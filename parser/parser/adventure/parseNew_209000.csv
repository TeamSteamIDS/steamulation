Short reviewIf you are a die-hard fan, you will have bought, played and judged this anyway, so you can stop reading. If you're not a die-hard fan, make sure you've played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City before this, and if you are then still hungry for more Batman and can't wait for Arkham Knight, consider getting this only on a good sale.Long reviewArkham Asylum was great.Arkham City was even better, even though the story did get convoluted at times just to fit in all the content.Arkham Origins... is just something to tide us over until Arkham Knight is finally released.If, like me, you are a massive fan of the Arkham series, it's likely that you've already bought and played Origins, so I don't need to review it for you. If you are someone who merely liked Arkham City rather than playing it to death, and who's wondering if you should pick up Origins: probably not. You've already seen (almost) all the gameplay there is in Arkham City, and done better at that. Yes, Origins has a bigger map -- but it doesn't manage to fill that map with sufficiently interesting stuff, so that, paradoxically, it somehow feels smaller than Arkham City. Yes, Origins adds a story that qualifies as a prequel (even though, in spite of the title, there is very little there that could be called an origin of anything), but it's ultimately inconsequential.The story is both better and worse than City. It definitely has more focus than City, which started off simple but had an incredibly convoluted build-up to the end, certainly compared to Asylum. By contrast, Origins simply has Batman targeted by a bunch of assassins because Black Mask put a price on his head, and most of the story is just Batman taking them all down in order. There's one thing that could be called a twist, but it happens pretty early on, and actually (and unfortunately) makes the story less interesting since we trade a new villain for an old one. But with the increase in focus also comes a loss of depth, and there's nothing in Origins that compares to the daring ending of City. True, Origins hardly has room for something like that given that it's a prequel, but more could have been done with the premise. As it is, most of the characters you encounter in Origins undergo no development -- Batman included.The gameplay is definitely worse, in both small things and bigger things. There are glitches where Batman can get stuck or enemies suddenly stop registering as enemies and just stand there looking goofy, ground takedowns seem to work only when they feel like it, and sometimes necessary encounters simply don't happen until you leave an area and come back. Mind you, this is with all the patches and fixes that are likely to ever be applied -- this is as good as it gets. It never gets so bad that it makes Origins unplayable, but it's just not as polished as City.Upgrades are now partially tied to achievements in the form of the Dark Knight system, and this manages to do little more than unbalance things. The fatal flaw of this system is that it requires you to do certain things in order, so unless you're carefully keeping track of what exactly you're supposed to do next, you may find yourself short of an upgrade you want with no easy way of getting it, or doing something silly you've already done dozens of times in the game which only now counts as an achievement. I spent the majority of the game without the ""disarm & destroy"" move because you can only get this if you complete a side mission that's extremely easy to miss until you've already finished the story (and in fact it doesn't unlock until a good way in). And if you haven't completed the Predator track by the time the story finishes, well, it sucks to be you because most achievements can't be completed for lack of appropriate Predator encounters. This is all the more galling given the fact that Arkham City actually had respawning Predator encounters, even though you almost certainly didn't need it.The Shock Gloves are an upgrade that's not tied to achievements but part of the story, and they deserve to be singled out as a bad idea. When you have this, after enough punches, you unlock the use of this ""super gadget"" that allow you to punch enemies that normally couldn't be punched, and counter things that normally couldn't be countered. Rather than making fights more exciting, however, it just makes them less interesting because you don't have to think about how to take on enemies as much anymore. Activating them is optional, but also very easy to do unintentionally. I would have given good money if I could have traded the Shock Gloves for the disarm & destroy combo... but that's not an option.The side missions are uninspired. Detective investigations are back in the form of case files, which is a neat idea but they're far too simplistic to hold the attention for long -- visit crime scene, rewind things back and forth until you've scanned the things that obviously need scanning, then go somewhere else to apprehend the perpetrator. The data packs you collect this time (replacing the Riddler trophies) aren't half as interestingly protected as the trophies. It makes some sense since, after all, the Riddler isn't even calling himself the Riddler yet, but if that's what they were going for they should have just reduced the number of them and saved you the tedium. There are no surprise encounters that lead to interesting diversions like in City; you'll pretty much hit all the spots during the story and what's left is collectibles and endless ""crimes in progress"", which are just repeated brawls. There's too much copy and paste like this and not enough memorable stuff.If it sounds like I'm doing nothing but comparing this game to Arkham City: that's because Origins all but invites the comparison, since in both premise and execution it's just like Arkham City. If Origins could be judged on its own merits, perhaps in a universe were Asylum existed but not City, it would come out much more favorable -- but since City does exist, the game can't be seen as anything more than what it is -- a repeat exercise. It's a good repeat exercise, mind you, and it does actually try new things even if those don't always work out for the better. The developers should be appreciated for their efforts, but the spark of genius is missing. Origins ticks all the boxes, it includes all the stuff that City did and adds some more besides, and yet somehow it manages to do less with it.Oh, and there's multiplayer. That is definitely new, but it's also the one thing I can't say anything about, as I haven't tried it. This is not a shortcoming of Origins, by the way, I'm just a solo player. And we are talking about Batman, after all, who does his best work alone. If you need to know if the multiplayer is worth it, you'll have to look for another review.Do I recommend Origins? Yes, as long as you get it on a good sale. It would be unfair to say Origins adds nothing to the Arkham experience, and as much as I've criticized it, I can't call it a bad game. But it never rises above ""competent"" when compared to Arkham City, and I just can't see myself playing it again to complete the ""new game plus"" mode, as I did with City (twice!) The only reason I'm even tempted to do that is because of the third mode you can unlock -- ""I Am the Night"", which requires you to play the entire game yet again, without dying once. Now that's an achievement -- but it will be a while before I can bring myself to sit through the game again, and by that time, Arkham Knight may well be released.			"

NOTE:A 'Not Recommended' Rating does not mean its a bad game  (it's an average game in my opinion). I just can't recommend it since its basically a copy/paste of Arkham City but buggier and made with little understanding on what made Asylum and City great. TL:DR? See CONCLUSIONINTRODUCTION:Batman Arkham Origins is the third instalment to the Arkham franchise. Although the original Arkham Games were made by UK based developers Rocksteady, this game (Arkham Origins) was made by Warner Bros. Games Montréal with Rocksteady acting merely in an advisory capacity.The story takes place roughly 5 years before the events of Arkham Asylum, in a time where Batman was only 1-2 years into his career as a superhero and is highly regarded as an urban myth. Play as Batman and fight for your survival because Black Mask has offered a $50 Million bounty on your head. Defend against the assassins, put Black Mask behind bars and uncover a new mysterious and dangerous villain calling himself, “The Joker”PROS:+ Good Story which has a lot of great moments. Recognized as canon by Rocksteady+ Improved and Challenging Boss Fights (although not all *cough* Electrocutioner)+ New Enemy Types (the Martial Artist thug is a fun new addition)+ Voice Acting by Troy Baker (Joker), Roger Craig Smith (Batman) and all of the voice actors did exceptionally well. Not the best, but for 'younger' versions of the characters they did well.+ Substantial amount of side missions (although very poorly paced)+ Visit the Batcave and AlfredCONS:- Copy/Paste of ARKHAM CITY- No innovation or change from Arkham City in terms of combat mechanic- No innovation or change from Arkham City in terms of gadgets which are still basically the same with new names but does the same thing- Bigger Map but somehow very boring and has a fair amount of glitches- Annoying screen flicker effect while reading- Severe Performance drops because of excessive use of PhysX and poor optimization- Unnecessary Multiplayer to a game which was clearly intended for a Single Player experience- Too much Combat and only a few (and easy) Stealth missions- Too much characters which resulted in less screen-time for each of them- Too much sources of Exp that results in fast level ups which results in...(see below)- Too much upgrades that removes the challenge in both Combat and Stealth play (Electric Gloves)- Bugs, glitches and errors plague the game, still unpatched because the devs said that they were focusing more on the DLC than fixing their game- Limited Batman CostumesCONCLUSION:I would RECOMMEND this game for people who's in it for the STORY, otherwise, Its best AVOIDED. If you were expecting innovation on the gameplay mechanics, smooth frame-rates and with a properly paced progression, sorry but you won't find it here.WORTH IT?:NOT Worth a full price purchase, best bought in a SALE.RANT (Not necessary for the review):There is a saying which goes: “Too much of a good thing is BAD”, Arkham Origins is a prime example of it. Too much Combat made it repetitive and a chore with not enough stealth, Too big of a map that made it boring, Too much upgrades that made the game easy, Too much villains that resulted in little screen-time, Too much PhysX effects that caused FPS to tank badly, Too easy Riddler challenges, Too much attention to DLC while ignoring multiple bugs and glitches and many many more.I just can't recommend it since its basically a copy/paste of Arkham City but buggier and made with little understanding on what made Asylum and City great.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Arkham Asylum was a revolutionary game. Arkham City was as well. By contrast, Arkham Origins is viewed as an evolutionary game, and between that and the fact that the principal actors and development studio have been replaced a lot of people figured ""eh, I don't need to play this for a year."" Technically speaking, Arkham Origins does feature revolutionary additions over the previous games, but it's in an area that nobody particularly asked for in the first place: online competitive multiplayer. I myself have yet to even launch it, but given that it's developed by Splash Damage I'm sure it's not slapped together. They did after all make the Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer (which got carried over into Enemy Territory, and then Quake Wars, etc).The thing about the single-player is that while it's good, you literally cannot help but compare it against Arkham City the entire time. The combat system and animations are completely carried over, with some additions. You have some new gadgets (one is allegedly ""new"" but in reality is functionally identical to something else from Arkham City) and face a few new common foes. Luckily, one of the gadgets is straight out of Super Inframan and makes combat even more satisfying since you trounce everyone with it, and the others give you more options during the Predator encounters. The enemy AI is altered since the rate at which you counter rather than strike has gone way, way up. Boss battles are VASTLY improved over the previous games, as each one emphasizes that you do different things. At no point do you feel ""well, this is the same thing I did for the last boss.""But even with that said, at most points you DO feel ""well, I've done this before."" Aside from the combat, the sidequests have you doing the same gameplay mechanic as 2 years ago (and 4 years ago) albeit for a different cosmetic reason. Example: in Arkham City you have to quickly travel across the city to answer phones in time to stop a killer. Here, you have to do the same to defuse bombs. It's the same map as Arkham City, albeit with some new zones. It helps a little that you can now fast travel. But there must be fewer grapple points because getting from place to place is a little trickier than it used to be. You'll be fighting and fighting, and with the random ""crimes in progress"" that spawn, you'll fight more. You're rarely going to be scanning the environment unless you're prompted to do so. Crime scene investigations are a new addition, but much like the show CSI you aren't really doing anything yourself. The computer is magically reconstructing a series of events based on your having scanned a body and a spot of blood (which they can't show as red). Then you go beat up a guy. You can't inadvertently defeat the person you meant to interrogate either, so there's no ""save this guy for last"" aspect to combat. But you are now given grades for each encounter, such that higher grades yield XP bonuses. Winning is largely a foregone conclusion given that you're Batman, but winning with an A or S rank is the tough part. In fact, I still haven't gotten the last one because it doesn't always play the *wham* sound effect to denote you KO'ed someone with a hit (I call this the ""BATMAAAAAN!"" since if I could mod this game I would replace that sound with the screaming pug). The game offers various challenges for additional bonuses and upgrades, but it's buggy about deciding whether or not some of them ""count."" I busted my♥♥♥♥♥doing the ""do 4 exotic takedowns in a Predator section"" and then it didn't count it. And then it turned out there were no more Predator sections in the game. AND it won't let you complete those challenges on the challenge maps, so if you don't do it during the story you're screwed...unless you replay it on the much harder New Game+ mode...The reduced architecture grapples and increased enemy attack rates are somewhat minor, but if there's a major ""step backwards"" here it's one of atmosphere. This Gotham City isn't yet overrun with supervillains who've marked their territory and themed their gangs. The incentive to see the world isn't really as strong. The Riddler's challenges were designed to direct you to all the cool little references, but at this point there is no ""Riddler"" etc so you're basically completing the challenges for the sake of hearing the ""extortion data that's going to harm innocent people"" recordings. Except pretty much all of them pertain to supervillains and corrupt civil servants whom you take down anyway. It feels more like a task since there's less ""reward"" for doing it. Why oppose this so strongly? That's the REAL enigma.The strong negative online backlash to Arkham City's criminal dialogue means that EVERYTHING pertaining to threats or abusive language is long gone (that already got walked back since the Arkham City DLC) so pat yourselves on the back, Team Social Justice. Between that and the fact that Batman is less infallible at this stage of his career, the writing has gotten a lot more praise compared to Arkham City. But for me, it feels less satisfying to beat people up because I overheard them saying they're cold and hungry, or that they're resorting to crime because they lost their job and now they have to not be home on Christmas Eve. This definitely plays into the ""Batman as fascist authoritarian conservative"" reading of the character. I kind of wonder if the writers just hate Batman as a concept, since the villains all expose the flaws in his approach and morality and Batman has no answer because he can't admit ""the reason I can't kill you is because you're all too profitable as IP.""Also, the game takes place over a few hours on Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, yet the amount that happens is absurd. True, a lot happened during Arkham City, but there was planning leading up to it. How can these locations be THIS devastated and re-renovated in just a few hours? And it's not even accidental; the game points out ""yeah, it's been 3 hours."" On the other hand, James Gordon isn't Commissioner yet, so the cops are pretty much all dirty. In this game you get to beat up SWAT team guys, which is the part of ""Year One"" that is the most important. The Assassin's Creed guy as Batman has his highs and mids since he's mostly forced to imitate Kevin Conroy, but with a name like ""Roger Smith"" you'd think he was BORN to impersonate Kevin Conroy's Batman! Troy Baker (who already nailed his Richard Moll Two-Face impersonation in Arkham City) is about as dead-on a mimicry of Mark Hamill's Joker as one could hope, given that Mark can no longer really do that voice anymore. Richard Epcar (voice of the Joker in the fighting games) has a few background lines that jump out to me, but I guess he also directed a lot of the secondary dialogue recordings.I enjoyed Arkham Origins, but I'd still say to hold off on getting it. Not so much because of the issues described above so much as the fact that there's a ton of DLC and all of it's spread out across platforms and retailers due to exclusivity (Challenge maps where you're Bruce Wayne in training, etc). There's a Season Pass which includes that stuff, but it costs another $20 and for now is almost entirely cosmetic. They say there'll be at least one story DLC, but what'll it be about? Maybe something inspired by The Long Halloween? I don't know, so I don't know if that, a few challenge maps, and some cosmetic skins are really worth the money. For now I'd say to pick this up once a ""complete edition"" is available unless you happen to buy a new video card that bundles it.			"

 ‘On the Shoulders of Giants’ ‘Batman: Arkham Origins’ is a taut, immersive, if iterative installment in the legendary ‘Arkham’ series of games – which unfortunately comes in for more criticism than it ultimately deserves. Boasting a strong narrative, an expansive and atmospheric open world, and all the classic gameplay elements from the earlier titles, it is just about everything one might traditionally expect from a sequel. Campaign: Released by ‘Warner Brothers | Montreal’ in late-2013, ‘Arkham Origins’ is the third game in a series that revolutionized the super-hero Action-RPG genre and it does not stray from type. A prequel, set five years prior to 2009’s ‘Arkham Asylum’, it features a younger, more vulnerable Bruce Wayne, one still largely unknown to the citizens, criminals and constabulary of Gotham. The opening credits detail a mysterious break-in at Blackgate prison by local crime-boss ‘Black Mask’ who subsequently announces an open bounty of $50 Million dollars for the masked vigilante’s (Batman’s) head, drawing some of the world’s deadliest assassins to Gotham. An engrossing, well crafted campaign of twists and turns will take you across a broodingly atmospheric and expansive, open-world, filled to the brim with side-quests, collectibles, and cold-cases, amongst a veritable who’s-who of criminals, psychopaths and super-villains.Gameplay | Graphics | Sound: Gameplay is from a third-person perspective, aligned around the game’s 4 main pillars of Flight and Stealth | Combat | Detective Mode | RPG elements (of character upgrades and customization), and these are largely unchanged from the well developed mechanics from earlier entries in the series. Besides the XP-based upgrades to obtain new armor, skills and weapons, a challenge system tasks the gamer with accomplishing targets of scaling difficulty to unlock new takedowns and abilities. ‘Origins’ also introduces two new gameplay features - 1. Crime Scene Investigations and 2. A Multiplayer Component - ‘Crime Scenes’ is an innovative concept triggered at various points during the campaign wherein you are tasked with studying a crime scene, and identifying ballistics, DNA and forensic evidence in an attempt to recreate/solve the incident in a mini-game format. While novel, it is unfortunately somewhat shallow in implementation and thereby predictable, and has to count as a real missed opportunity in driving the series’ gameplay forward. Multiplayer features the ability to play as Batman, Robin, The Joker and Bane as well as various gang-members in a good variety of game modes which while completely serviceable, again seems largely tacked on and unnecessary. Finally, completion of the main campaign unlocks higher difficulty challenges with ‘New Game Plus’ and ‘Worst Nightmare’ modes, and good visuals, strong voice-acting and responsive controls (for both K&M | Controller) round out a well designed, feature-rich offering.Flaws: Quibbles include average graphics and poor textures in areas, stuttering framerates in others, and a confounding inability to grapple freely onto any surface during flight – a seemingly general lack of the ol’ spit and polish, and a sense that this is more ‘Arkham City v1.5’, than an entirely new game.Overall, ‘Batman: Arkham Origins’ succeeds in maintaining the legacy of the ‘Arkham’ series by capturing the essence of what it means to be the Dark Knight – be it through brooding atmosphere, an exceptionally strong narrative, a who’s-who cast of villains, a fun and effective combat system, fantastic boss fights, varied gameplay elements and all the toys and gadgets one would expect. Yes, it is iterative and quite similar to ‘Arkham City’, but keep in mind that it stands on the shoulders of two nearly perfect games, and fans of the series should enjoy it thoroughly nonetheless.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to Arkham Asylum and a sequel to The Land Before Time. You play as a younger and less handsome Batman, when he was just starting his career of ILLEGAL vigilantism and his parents were slightly less dead. But still very dead by normal human standards. The game takes place on Christmas eve, a time for celebration and also a time when the diner turns on its heater in the alley and I can be warm at night. A man called Roman Sionis,  Negrodomis aka: the Black Mask and totally the main villain for the entire game has hired several assassins to come make Batman like his parents for the low low price of 50 million Vietnamese Dongs. These villains include Bane, Deathstroke, Deadshot, and several villains you've never actually heard of. The combat is much the same as it was the last two games, only with a few more features, such as electric gloves that also double as a nifty way to power your cellphone. Much like a microwave. It also adds a few new enemy types, such as discount Jet Li, and roid-monsters. But old enemies return as well like the random mook, and of course those creatures I am deathly of: girls. Stealth is pretty much the same, only this time you also get an upgrade to your spider-man web in the form of a gun that allows you to strap people to gargoyles so you can wrap them up and suck out their juicy goo like the evil man-spider you are. You awful, awful monster. The collectible riddler side-mission returns, only this time it reminds me of my high-school years: long and heartbreaking. The riddles and Batman trivia is gone in favor of collecting datapacks that I spent more time doing than I care to admit. There are also these invisible icons left behind by some chump called Anarky, and much like the gay agenda, they are everywhere. The game itself is rather jarring compared to the first two Arkham games. While Rocksteady made a rather loving tribute to the Dark Knights in comic and cartoon, Arkham Origins feels much like the movies, taking many assets from the Dark Knight trilogy and clashing themes together much like the skin tone between me and my African twin. Though you can use one of the many skins for Batman after you complete the game, most of them tend to not fit with the theme the game is going for, so you're left out like a DnD nerd at a Fantasy Football meet up. The game also gives you the option of playing as Deathstroke in the challenge maps, a character that is rather easy to beat even on the hard difficulty and only shows up maybe twice through the entire thing. And even then, he's just a re-skin of Robin from Arkham City. So you're basically just playing as Robin during his rebellious teenage years. This all being said, would I actually recommend Batman's third crusade through the streets of Angsty Metropolis? I guess, if you liked the first two. The side missions are unfulfilling and the Riddler missions make me want to rethink my life choice as a professional street Luchadore. But the game still held my attention for longer than I care to admit, and I still like to look at Bruce's chisled jaw and amazing abs.That still doesn't make me gay.6/10. Did you know that the M on Mario's hat stands for Mario?			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an action adventure game developed and published by Warner Bros that was released on PC, PS3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 in October 2013.  This is the third main game in the Arkham Series which has been running since 2009. Gameplay is basically the same as any other of the Arkham series of games. The same fluid and easy to grasp combat system is still the same, allowing you to string together some serious combos; I’m talking sometimes in the regions of 2000+! On top of the combat system, Batman comes prepared with his arsenal of gadgets to help him fight the bad guys, with plenty of returning favourites like the batarang and claw, but also some new additions such as Shock Gloves, and Concussion Detonator. Normally in past games, you are able to get by most situations without having to use too many of your tools, but you have a good range of moments throughout the main story to use everything here.  Something else which has been introduced is a fast travel system, since Gotham is so big, you really do need to take advantage of the fast travel system, but you can only use it once you take out certain control towers to free up the signal in that area. Another really welcome addition to the game.After just completing the game about an hour ago, I am honestly finding it difficult to think of any aspect of the game play that I did not enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed Arkham City and this really quenched my thirst for continuing the series. Graphically whilst it was one of the latter big releases of the last generation of games, the game does look really impressive. I couldn’t quite push out the game on 4k resolution but was able to play at 1440p without any problems and it just looks gorgeous. I particularly like the snow effects in game, along with the really impressive textures across Gotham.   The game is run using the Unreal Engine 3, so you can expect some really good looking scenes in a well fleshed out environment. The game does present some fairly tricky boss fights, each has their own style and way of beating them which is different from the last. If you want to get your combo streaks really high, you have to learn your combination attacks, and flow your counters and attacks together almost perfectly. It took me a while to get it down perfectly, but the rewards are certainly worth it when you can get combos of 500+ on some fights. What the past Arkham game and this game really focus on, is the open world aspect of the Gotham. Yes you have the 10 hour long main story, but a lot of the game’s content comes in the optional side missions and tasks. There are a number of other well-known bad guys that you can take on and aim to take down. These can be anything from destroying chemical containers to disarming crates of weapons.  Whilst they mainly a lot of “follow the quest marker” style missions, they still have their own story and resolution which defiantly makes them worth your time to complete.    As you can see from the amount of hours I have been playing Origin’s, there is an awful lot of content to see and experience, and I would highly recommend people take the time to do so.I didn’t have any technical issues whilst playing. I wasn’t running the game on SLI, purely off a single graphics card at 1440p with all of the settings maxed out. The game runs smoothly at 60fps without any glitches or stutters. This is a game I would strongly advise you play with a controller, given the way the Arkham style combat system works, you get the best movement and accuracy from using a controller over keyboard and mouse unfortunately, but it does play very well on a Steam controller.  In conclusion, I honestly can say Arkham Origin’s continues the trend of action packed and fun to play Batman games up to this point in the series. This game has often been criticized for lack of content and originality, I say they aren’t all fully true as there is so much content in this game, and why break something that’s not broken? Batman Arkham Origins is definitely worth the regular retail price of £14, 99 but you can get it a heck of a lot cheaper if you wait for sales. For me, this is a must play Batman game.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Batman: Arkham Origins opens with no intention of being anything but what is expected from it. In fact I was dropped into Blackgate Prison with such little fanfare and context that it almost felt as if I'd jumped back into Arkham City by mistake.This was after all the same Gotham I had run through before, familiar architecture giving way to reflexive movements honed over my time with the first two Arkham games. All of Batman’s high-tech toys were still with him, disrupting Origins’ prequel status though at least allowing my to skip collecting them for yet a third time, and by and large everything would appear to be in its rightful place eager for another excursion into Gotham’s criminal underworld (though by now I’m willing there’s a warrant out for at least 90% of the city’s population).But, therein lies the problem doesn’t it. That for whatever Origins’ is itself, it’s the third of its kind in five years, and what was once revolutionary is now mundane and ordinary. Arkham Asylum came out of nowhere as one of the best games of 2009, and easily the best Batman game ever released. Arkham City soon followed, blowing the series up into an open world and bringing with it some welcome improvements to Asylum’s mechanics, even if that came at the cost of being rather bloated with content it didn’t have any idea what to do with. So where does that leave Origins’ to take the franchise?Well, it doesn’t really take it anywhere. Origins’ is alarmingly similar to the games that came before it, only without enough confidence to carry itself well enough to at least be comparable to them. Which, OK, it’s being handled by a new developer so perhaps some rough edges are to be expected as a new team attempts to take over the Arkham series until Rocksteady is able to finish their next game. But Origins’ failings extend beyond minor bugs or the occasional bad level design, into an overwhelming feeling that this is all just busywork to keep people busy until the “real” third Batman game arrives. And that makes it hard to appreciate Origins’ on its own merits, when even it seems to have accepted its role as a filler game.It feels sloppy and rushed, in little and big ways that snowball into one another as the game seems to progressively care less and less about how it eventually turns out. Combat is identical to past games using the same attack/counter freeflow system, but it fumbles over itself far more often than in past games. I was constantly having combos break when I was attacked from off screen or had the camera fail to center on the next enemy, slipping up on counter timing that never felt right, or just having attacks fail to register properly as Batman shuffled in place as confused as I was. Encounter designs enhance these issues by popping up constantly and having no focus or balance to them. I was tossed into rings of dozens of guys with random weapons or armor, and these weird combinations made it difficult to create any kind of rhythm in the combat because it was constantly being broken by a random enemy with a knife or a car door or some other special attribute that might pop up once or a dozen times during a fight.The Arkham fighting system is one of my favorites in any game, but less than halfway through Origins’ I was already becoming annoyed anytime I walked into a fight and knew even if I played perfectly I was still at the mercy of the game doing what I told it to do. There is a lot less stealth in Origins’ than either of the past games, which was at first disappointing until I finally arrived at a predator mission and then wished they had been omitted entirely. City had already began to stumble a bit in following up Asylum’s impeccable level designs, but Origins’ up and throws in the towel right from the start with levels that are both far too complicated yet feel significantly less tactical than past games. There are still grates you can hide in and gargoyles to hang from, but levels never account for your need to quickly move from cover to cover as you close the distance between you and a guard and just haphazardly place hiding spots throughout a room with no thought as to how you might use them in conjunction with one another.Every stealth section felt like I was the one who was trapped, rather than the guards I was hunting, leaving me scrambling to take them out as soon as possible instead of anything more methodical and coordinated. I died more times in Origins’ than I ever did in either of the past two games, and it almost always was because I had attempted to takedown an enemy in any way other than hanging upside down and waiting for them to walk underneath. These sections became very boring almost immediately, when previously they had been my favorite parts of the Arkham games.Maybe this is simply the result of being spoiled by Rocksteady’s games, but Origins’ doesn’t exist in a vacuum and even seems to assume to player will already be familiar with the formula. It doesn’t bother to explain mined gargoyles or enemies with sonar goggles, because if you have played City you already know how they work. It’s entirely aware of its heritage, so treating it as a self contained work feels pointless and disingenuous. It doesn’t feel like a step forward for the series though, being closer to b-roll content cut from City rather than something original. Where the Arkham series had the most ground to make up though, and where Origins’ even had the capacity to do so was its narrative, and to its credit this is far and away the most engaging and cohesive plot the series has ever known. The cast has been trimmed down from City’s over indulgent buffet of characters, which allows Origins’ to spend more time developing them into interesting, complicated characters I wanted to know more about. Many of the assassins called in to collect a five million dollar bounty placed on Batman’s head don’t get as much time as they deserve, but they’re compensated by a far deeper, disturbed Batman who is still early in his career as a vigilante and less prepared to face the villains he’s after. At times his sense of justice and methods for carrying it out border on sociopathic, a side of him that’s not lost on those he comes in contact with and which eventually comes to a head as he is forced to come to terms with whether or not his actions are actually justified.It’s familiar ground for Batman as a character, but its a part of him I never grow tired of exploring and which brilliantly accompanies Troy Baker’s fantastic performance as The Joker. I thought I was ready to be done with the deranged clown, but the interactions between him and Batman are so compelling I simply wish Origins’ didn’t take so long getting to them, upon which it quickly changes the subject again. The narrative as a whole is still inconsistent, but it’s Origins’ one true advancement for the series which I hope will be continued with future Arkham games.I have a hard time flat-out calling Arkham Origins a “bad” game, but it’s saved almost solely on the strengths of what has been brought over from past games (and then butchered) and carries with it a very qualified recommendation to anyone but the most devoted fans of the series. This is still an Arkham game deep down somewhere, with some exceptional characterization that sadly isn’t given enough time to shine, and by now the rhythms of the series have become so natural to me that it wasn’t difficult to get into a simple groove and fly through the game despite how unimpressive it was. I guess what I find most unpleasant is just that in only five years and three games it already feels like Batman has already shown us all he has to offer, and I’ve only reruns to look forward to in the bi-annual future.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Note before reading the review--------------------------------------------Keep in mind, the recommendation/non-recommendation of the game is NOT an indication of the game being good or not (it's a great game). I just can't recommend it because, in its current state, the game is a bug-riddled mess. I myself did manage to beat the game, and I enjoyed (almost) every minute of it. Fantastic game. When it works, it is definitely the best Arkham game out there, but I can't, in good conscience, recommend a triple A, 50 dollar title that doesn't work for a major portion of the playerbase. If these bugs are fixed, the game's an easy recommendation. 9/10 game. Phenomenal. Incredible atmosphere, incredible gameplay, and the best writing in an Arkham game (sorry Paul Dini). But right now, this game, in its current state, simply cannot be recommended. -------------------------------------------Batman: Arkham Origins is one of the best examples of a fantastic game riddled by bugs. Great story (probably the best in an Arkham game), and great gameplay marred by atrocious problems. Bugs so far include a bug that prevents people from launching the game, game crashes (preventing the game from being completed), and keyboard/mouse control problems (where you can't land critical hits). There are even reports of people being unable to attack! Some bugs are minor, like Batman jerking up and down while gliding (kind of funny, actually). Overall, I can't recommend the game, in particular because of the gamebreaking bugs that can occur. Gameplay-wise, the game is great. It's not as good as Arkham City, because of major balancing issues with certain gadgets. For example, the Remote Claw is incredibly overpowered in Predator missions. Painfully overpowered, because of the Remote Claw Takedown, for example. It's basically a ranged, silent, inverted takedown. The Electrocutioner Gloves, in combat, grant you 2x per punch (3x per crit) on your Combo Counter, and can punch through shields/armor/stun batons, allow you to counter any enemy attacks. The gameplay is fun overall though. The new Crime Scene feature is cool, even if it holds your hand. The new gadgets do prove for interesting gameplay. If you're gonna drop $50 on a game, it better damn well work, and right now, WB Games can't guarantee even that. If you can run it, I promise you that you're in for a damn treat, but there's a relatively high chance that you can't.UPDATE: There are reports with people having issues booting the game still, a whole month after release. Sadly, this is unacceptable. I can't comment on the multiplayer for the game, as I've only played 3 or 4 matches. In terms of multiplayer problems, I've heard that after the recent update, player levels got reset without warning. Also, I was able to beat the game without encountering anything gamebreaking, but I also know that some of my friends can't even launch the game in its current state -- some FATAL ERROR OZZY thing. It's quite saddening, really.UPDATE 2: I want to expand a bit on the graphics and sound design of the game, since I barely touched on it. The game runs rather well on max settings (apart from PhysX), using DX11 features at 1920x1080 on my setup -- with an i5-3470, and an AMD Radeon HD 7950 -- specifically between 40 and 80 frames per second depending on the area, it's perfectly playable, and it looks good for a game working around the limitations of Unreal Engine 3. The visual and sound design in the game together is absolutely amazing. It was good enough to make me believe it was Christmas, if not just for a moment in October. Roger Craig Smith, and Troy Baker are absolutely fantastic at reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker respectively. Brilliant stuff.UPDATE 3: Aaaand Warner Bros has no plans to fix Arkham Origins bugs, apart from some keyboard/mouse functionality with Deathstroke challenge missions. ...Maybe.http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/02/10/wb-games-has-no-plans-to-fix-numerous-glitchesUPDATE 4: Critical Hit on KBM bug was fixed some time ago, not sure when.

												Basically Arkham City with a new story. I still hate the boss fights, but love taking out rooms of enemies without being detected and  gliding around the city finding things. Maybe one day we'll get a Batman game that offers the Dishonored approach of multiple ways to complete objectives, but until that fantasy comes true, this is good fun.Edit: After finishing the game, I can say it feels more tedious than Arkham City did. The combat's not as smooth, and I think it's because there were some changes to the button combinations for special attacks, although it's been awhile since I played AC, so I might be remembering incorrectly. There are also numerous small obstacles that for unknown reasons you're unable to step on/over, which really throws off the flow of moving around the city. I mostly used fast travel, once it was unlocked, because they made travel by running, grappling, and gliding too much of a pain. Finally, there are several small bugs. Nothing completely game breaking, but I had to reload a checkpoint on at least three separate occasions because of n enemy getting stuck somewhere I couldn't reach, or the option to interrogate not triggering.Overall, still worth playing if you loved the previous games, but if you weren't completely sold on them, this will be even less fun, and should be avoided.

												Arkham Origins is the worst of the ""Arkham"" games yet released, but it still retains the core formula that made the prior installments such fun. The combat is, as with City, untainted - fully intact, with few new gimmicks thrown in to distract from the centerpiece of kicking and punching. The stealth, too, is more or less the same - though, the level design is much worse, a problem that basically infiltrates every corner of Origins. Essentially, Origins is the same song as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, played by a cover band. You can still groove to it, and occasionally the new guys have something interesting to add, but it's not the original - it's a copy, and an inferior one. But it's the same tune you hum along with and tap your feet to. If the game weren't incessantly buggy atop of its design flaws, I'd say it's a worthy little sequel, especially at sub-$15. As it stands, the PC port is chaotically awful. It's dropped below $5 and I'd wager that's all it deserves, but that doesn't mean you won't have a fun time.			"

												There are definitely some similarities between Origins and its predecessors.  The action buttons are almost entirely the same, which was nice since I didn't have to learn an entirely new system.  There is a ton of content, we still have The Riddler as a background story, there are many optional side-quests and distractions, but it felt like there were *too* many distractions in this one.  In Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I never lost track of the main storyline, despite my frequent forays into side-quest territory.  Not so with Origins.  I can't count how many times I came back to my computer with absolutely no idea what I was supposed to be doing.  It felt aimless and repetitive, even when I was working towards a side-goal.One of the things I REALLY enjoyed about the first two games is the riddles we had to figure out.  Oh we still have two hundred data packs to find (the predecessor to the Riddler trophies we saw in Asylum and City,) but no actual riddles to figure out.  I really missed them, and the data packs simply don't hold enough of my interest to make up for the lack of riddles -- I'm not even going to try to get them all.The in-game achievements would sometimes work, most times not.  I literally flew from one end of Arkham to the other, and never got the flying achievements.  It took four or five tries to get the notification that I'd taken down two criminals in a slide.  Just frustrating. Besides the irritation of not remembering where and what I was supposed to be doing, there was also the frustration of not being able to grapple places that clearly should have been accessible.  It was very obvious where we could and couldn't grapple in the previous games, so I don't feel like it's asking too much for this third game.  We DO have a quick-transportation option, which is nice, but I still would have liked it to be clear where we could and couldn't grapple just by looking.There *are* some improvements over the first two games.  For instance, when we are locating the ""extra special"" criminals (those holding information we need, etc) we don't have to save them for last in order to get the information.  If we want to, we can take them out first, then go back and interrogate them when the fight is over.  Another improvement is the crime scene investigation.  They've really added an element of interest to it, though in my opinion, they underutilized it.Origins is clearly the inferior product game-play and story-wise, but I still recommend it for fans of the series.  It was interesting to see how the back-story emerged, and I'm glad to have played it.  Next time, though, I'll know to skip a lot of the side content and concentrate on the main storyline.  I think that if I do that, I'll enjoy the game much more. :)			"

												Arkham Origins is a great game with a very bad launch which makes it underratred. Different studio on an Arkham game means a different aproach, which in this case turned out to be a solid job. The gameplay is now brutal, there are more gadgets, the city is bigger and colder, the story feel more alive and the soundtrack helps making it all epic.The STORY is well written, has many epic moments and does it job at keeping you entertained and keeping your interest in, which is great considering it's a prequel. In this game, Batman is in his early days, fighting both criminality and law. In the night you're playing, 8 assassins mean to kill, all organized by the man behind a mask. There are characters like Joker, Bane, but new, even unheard ones from the past games, like Deathstroke, Firefly, and Shiva. The main story is great and the sidequests are a joy to do(only there you'll confront some of the assassins)The GAMEPLAY is brutal, fun and challanging on hard. Having more gadgets and moves keeps things fresh for an Arkahm veteran. There are regular thugs, armored thughs, brutes, martial artists, thughs with shields and armed thughs and there is a gadget, a move for each one of them. You have the dark knight system, which challanges you to do different things and gives you rewards which consists in upgrades and experience. The challange room is fun to play, but it should be approached after most of the upgrades are aquired. There is also a new game plus and new to the series, ""I am the night"" mode, which is the ultimate challange.The MULTIPLAYER is totally enjoyable. There are some things that tie in with the singleplayer, but aside from that, you can play as Batman or Robin, or you can be part of Joker or Bane's gang. Being a hero means intimidating both gangs, before they one kills the other and captures every point. You can even play as Joker or Bane, if you are the lucky thug to open the door for them.GRAPHICS are stunning, the game being the best looking Arkham to date. Also the texture models are a real eyecandy. It has the innovative thing of snow getting deformed at your movement, which is something available for every type of video card. The BUGS are solved now, haven't experienced any, but a crash while hitting the exit button. Gamebreaking bugs are solved now, but there are still some to report some problems.All in all, Batman Arkham Origins is a great game that does it's job of making you feel like Batman, a must own for every gamer, since right now it's the great game that you can enjoy. Even though I lost fate in this game after hearing the bad things about it, it turned out to be one of the games I couldn't stoped playing.The score I give it is 9.5			"

												As a fan of Batman, I had to get this. The game is mostly fine, good graphics and sound and such. Fun story and of course the fighting mechanics are still the main attraction here. However, I cannot recommend this title due to serious game breaking bugs. I managed to avoid most of them thanks to some research, but I've now fallen to one nearly 55% through the game. Currently stuck in a void and no amount of restarting or changes will fix it and thanks to the single save auto-saving system, there's no way to revert to an older save... This is clearly the sort of thing that should be found in QA. Now I have no choice but to restart the whole game. So, if you desperately want to play this game, just be sure you know there are many game breaking bugs that can completely wipe out your save. It's like playing Russian Roulette with your time. I lost 20+ hours. How much will you lose? And a good sarcastic thanks WB Games and the developers for not bothering to fix these terrible gamebreaking bugs.			"

												Extremely Glitchy. However, when it's not glitching out, it's a very fun game and I'm loving the story. It's just that I've become very impatient with it and worrying every few minutes over how it's going to screw up. I've fallen through the map so many times, had enemies fly into space when I tried to interrogate, groups of enemies on the streets become static, sometimes keybindings won't register, got stuck inbetween places, game crash/freezes while gliding, certain items won't work until restart, clicking would suddenly change to throw a batarang for some reason... and I've had to restart the game so many times. So I would not recommend it if you're expecting smooth gameplay. If it weren't for all those constant issues, I would say that it is a great game with an enjoyable story.			"

												The PC version of Batman: Arkham Origins is absolutely the best in terms of detail, smoothness, drawing distance and particle effects, though it suffers from a series of annoying glitches.For being a prequel to the Arkham series, this really kicks things off with a bang.Best story telling out of the series. Phenomenal voice acting.There's definitely some re-tread going on with Batman: Arkham Origins, but the combat, the relatively good story, the powerful feeling of being Batman in video game form has only increased my enthusiasm for the franchise.You can't go wrong with sticking to Rocksteady's Bat-formula, however it is starting to feel a little played out.Arkham Origins is a very good but very familiar game.It lacks the spice of originality that made the previous two games great.If you’re a Batman fan you should already have Batman: Arkham Origins.

												The game is full of potential, and honestly it is a good game, but the amount of bugs at launch, and that still remain, I cannot recommend this game. For instance, K+M players get different combat dynamics than controller players because of a myriad of issues like consecutive critical strikes not working. This game was clearly not QAed for PC at all, and are doing QA after release because they were on a deadline.Perhaps in a years time, when the GOTY Edition goes on a 66% off sale and things are finally patched up, I would recommend it.  However, not right now. Avoid like the plague.			"

Batman: Arkham OriginsDeveloper: WB Games Montreal, Splash DamagePublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentIntroduction==========Arkham Origins is the third game in the Arkham series, and is a prequel to Arkham Asylum. It's also developed by a different team from the other games. Overall it still retains most of the features from the previous 2 games, Asylum and City, but it's noticably different. It's still the same great gameplay you'd expect from Batman and the Arkham series, and it every bit as good as the other titles, despite the differences. Gameplay==========Arkham Origins plays largely the same as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did. Batman still has all his gadgets, in addition to a few new ones: the remote claw, the shock and thermal gloves, the disruptor, and the glue grenade...just to name a few. He can still grapple around the city and glide everywhere he goes. He can still throw the most beautiful punches and kicks you've come to expect from the Arkham series, with a few fresh new moves. Despite being from a different developer, Origins pretty much looks and feels exactly like an Arkham game should. WB Montreal did a really good job at implementing the battle system, UI (for the most part), and experience systems we've all come to know and love. Once you get into the flow of the game and in a good stride, you'll forget that a different studio made the game. It's still an Arkham game, and for the most part it still has all the features and mechanics you'd expect. Combos, Takedowns, gadgets and environment interactions...it's all here.One of the biggest things Origins adds to the formula in this entry is the Crime Scene Scanning and Rewind features. When presented with a crime scene, Batman goes into evidence scanning mode. As you scan pieces of evidence scattered throughout a crime scene, the events are slowly pieced together bit by bit, until eventually what happened at the crime scene can be played back with complete control. You can fast forward and rewind to specific moments of the crime to help locate hidden pieces of evidence. These scenes are spread throughout the game, and help to offer a sort of puzzle element to the game. Quite possibly the most useful feature added in this installment is Fast Travel. Scattered throughout the city are radio towers under enemy control. Once liberated, these towers serve as Fast Travel Points. At anytime while outside in the city, Batman can call the Batwing to come pick him up and drop him off at any of the unlocked radio towers. This is immensely useful in getting around in such a large city.You still have your usual fare of side quests and Riddler challenges, and quite a bit of your time will probably be spent doing these. Batman: Arkham Origins is the first game in the Arkham series to include multiplayer. Unfortunately it did not appear to last long. I went into Multiplayer Mode at least a few times and only saw about 2-3 people online hosting their own games. It's safe to say that multiplayer is dead. That's too bad, as going head-to-head with other players in different modes would have been a blast for me to try out.Graphics==========This entry in the Arkham series looks just a tad different from the others, but it looks great. The city is what really shines here. It's Christmas Eve in-game, so it's snowing all over the city. One of the details I noticed is if you are on a snow-covered rooftop, Batman leaves footprints in the snow everywhere. These didn't fade away after a few seconds like in other games, but they do go awat after an area transistion though.Gotham City is dark. Secrets are hidden everywhere. All character models are sharp and extremely detailed. Batman still gets tears in his cape and damaged spots on his body armor as the adventure progresses. Sound and Music==========The biggest thing you will probably notice in this area is that Origins features a different set of voice actor for the main characters. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are not reprising their roles of Batman and the Joker in this entry. For hardcore fans, this may be a turn-off. The voice actors they have sound really close though! The soundtrack is, again, the kind of fare you'd expect from Batman. Dark, dramatic, ambient. The kind of music that sets a dark mood fitting for Batman. The kind that says 'Don't mess with the Bat'.Performance==========In all my hours of play, I didn't run into a single performance issue. The game ran at a near flawless 60 FPS at all times, even during combat with many enemies on screen or when I was zipping around the city using the grapple gun. I also used a controller the entire time, and it felt so responsive and intuitive. I had zero issues doing everything with a controller.One small gripe I had was with the online aspect. When you boot up the game, it automatically logs you into your WB Account (once you sign up for one, which gives you a bonus skin for Batman btw), before going to the main menu. At a few different points the game got hung up on the logging in part. It took me switching Steam to Offline Mode to start playing again. I don't know if this issue was due to the WB servers being down or what, but I could not find anything pertaining to it through at least 20 minute of Google searching and the few minutes I spent scanning the game's news and updates section on Steam. Apparently others have had this issue a few times over the past couple of years.Final Thoughts==========Arkham Origins is every bit as good as it's predecessor. It's what we've come to expect from the Arkham series. It still puts you right into the shoes of the Caped Crusader and offers a unique experience and an original story. Very well worth a purchase, and it belongs in every fan's game catalog. Expect a great single player campaign full of twists and turns, plenty of combat scenarios, and lots of detective work. Expect...Batman!Gameplay Demo==========

												I think this is actually my favorite game in the Arkham series.Everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ on this game because it's not made by Rocksteady (Developers of Arkham Asylum, City and Knight) but I don't see the problem with it, it's a pretty awesome game.Pros-Batman-Freeflow combat rocks, it's so good yet simple, many games tried to mimic the Arkham mechanics (Like TASM2) but can't quite get it right.-Stealth mechanics.-Big Open world to explore full of criminals.-Interesting story with surprising twists.-Full of neat easter eggs and amazing attention to detail.-Amazing voice acting-Lots of content: costumes, side missions, challenge maps and even Deathstroke as a playable character!-Online mode (The servers are offline right now, but the online itself is really good)Cons-There are quite a number of bugs, I remember that the first time I got into the Batcave I got stuck near the Computer and Batman kept walking in a loop (Yeaaah, a glitch that forced me to reset the game on the first 15 minutes is not a good sign)-Sometimes the controls can be a bit awqward, in some occasions I wanted to counter the enemy's attack but for some reason Batman took out the disruptor, it can be pretty damn annoying when you get a great combo and it's all gone because the game messes up.-Sometimes the enemy variety is not right. Fighting two enemy types at the same time? Alright. But fighting a guy with venom, a freaking armored criminal, some guys with guns...It's extremely difficult to keep the combos going and it's a stupid way to make the game harder. I love the game, it does have some flaws but they are really minor ones and I still think it's a worthy sequel (Or prequel, whatever) to Arkham City. Not only a fantastic Batman game, but one damn awesome Action game in general.9/10			"

												There are parts in Arkham Origins - which were advertised heavily before the game came out, so no spoilers here - where you can ""be an actual detective"" and ""recreate a crime scene"" that you can play back and rewind at your own leisure to find the answers to what exactly happened at the scene. They're flashy and feature impressive scripted sequences, but really just amount to being pixel hunts. They're kind of representative of AO as a whole.People praise AO for its writing a lot, and I'm not really sure why. If I had to guess, it's probably because AA and AC were the trademark kinds of turds produced by Paul Dini post-2000, and because of its really, really flashy setpieces. Batman falls from a skyscraper punching the Joker, with the most impresive graphics the franchise has ever seen, which looks great - but winds up being the beginning of the game completely abandoning its ""EIGHT ASSASSINS! ONE NIGHT! PAY FOR YOUR SEAT BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGE EDGE EDGE"" hook before it could even be a third of the way finished.It's downright impressive how many things this game ripped off from previous Arkham games. A surprise section where you play as a different character was console-exclusive bonus content for another Arkham game, animations copy-pasted and all. Shock gloves (which instantly trivialize any and all combat) are just the super mode from the Wii U version of Arkham City. Mad Hatter is here, for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, and he's got yet another hallucinogenic trip to send Batman on. Etcetera.When the gameplay isn't stolen, it just doesn't work. There's still bugs with the Concussion Detonator (which is basically worse than AC's REC in every way) breaking combo constantly, due to the delayed nature of its explosion. Batman will occasionally just outright fail to counter enemies, and a lot of animations that were cancelable in AC aren't in AO. The island is the most lazy expansion I've seen on a previous open world, with areas broken up into segments that are broken off by either a hilariously long bridge where nothing happens, or massive buildings that you inexplicably cannot grapple or climb. Martial arts enemies don't add variety as much as they add busywork, and the bosses are a huge step back from even AC's basic Zelda-esque bosses.It's probably the prettiest game in my Steam account, though, and the challenge rooms are still a great time. It's worth $7.50 if you REALLY love the Arkham games, but it's the weakest entry so far, and you'd be totally fine by just replaying City's challenge rooms and waiting for Knight to hit instead.			"

												While Origins doesn't add much over its predecessor, there are a few new gadgets and enemy types, the boss battles are consistently better, and the story is arguably better than Asylum's story. If you were hoping for a drastic change in the formula, you'll likely be disappointed, but this is easily the best Batman Arkham game to date!You can read my full, in-depth review here:http://www.overclockersclub.com/reviews/arkham_origins/Cheers!

												This game is great.  It seems to have more negative reviews and scores compared to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, and there are a few reasons for it, but in a lot of ways this one seems better too.This game has some bugs and some people might have certain performance issues.  As far as I can tell, that is what most of the negativity comes from.  - The cutscenes (not the cinematic ones, those are fine) can be pretty laggy.- I've had weird glitches with my cape while flying.  While not gamebreaking, it will definitely ruin your immersion.- I had some lag issues while fighting the very lovely female Copperhead.  - Many people have had a bug while fighting the end boss that doesn't allow you to counter some of his attacks.  Because it is a quick time event fight, this will keep you from progressing.  The only way to get around this, is to reduce your resolution by quite a bit.  Why does that work, I don't know.- I've had some people that I needed to interrogate, where the interrogate option would not work at all.  I relaunched the game and then it was fine, but we shouldn't have to do that.This game is still great though, even if you do encounter these issues.  Besides that it ran smoothly for me.  The base game is tons of fun.  It is a prequel to the previous Arkham games, where Batman is somewhat new to Gotham.  Assassins have been hired to kill you.  You don't really have any friends aside from Alfred.  The cops are after you just as much as the assassins and the gangs are, and other enemies besides them as well.  There is DLC for this game that has a story centered around Mr. Freeze as well which is quite cool (ha...ha...ha...).  The map is very large, and there's quite a bit to do.  Aside from the bugs, this is great, and you can pick it up at fairly cheap prices when on sale.The game also has a multiplayer mode that pits Batman and Robin, the Joker and his crew, and Bane and his thugs all against each other.  It's a lot of fun.""You may be the world's greatest assassin, kiddo, but Joker always gets the last laugh!"" -The Joker			"

												Single Player Mode:The game starts on the end of year 3, when everyone in gotham is starting to realize that the batman isn't a hoax, but real.On the height of Christmas Eve, Black Mask sends contract killers to find and kill the bat before dawn.Over the course of the game, More and more villains enter the fray and do battle with the bat, Including the police force headed by the corrupt Police Commissioner Loeb and S.W.A.T officer Brandon.This game depicts the batman's rise from hoax to legend in one night.Multi-Player Mode:After enduring the generic insanity that is the COD and BF franchise, I congratulate splash damage for making something really original.While i admit there are some stupid things about multi-player, Like progress not saving or credits not giving out which happens rarely, (I still haven't had that happens to me yet, Thank god!) The Multiplayer mode is pretty fantastic!And then there's the gaming community who don't know how teamwork works or just don't care about it, Ragequitting in anger when shot or taken down multiple time's.Story: 9 out of 10The game starts off pretty slow until the steel mill, Then it kicks into overdrive!Controls: 7 out of 10While the controls are the same as the previous games, they feel a little sticky and sluggish.Gameplay: 6 out of 10Despite being the same from the previous games, WB Games Montreal decide to make the combat harder, Sending large groups of normal thugs at you even at low level, Making the Electrocutioners's glove's a top priority if you wan't to survive longer in the game, (And don't get me started on the sniper's in the diamond district!) The Boss Battle's are really fun and engaging refreshing pace from the dull combat we are used too.Extra Content: 10 out of 10The Sidequests and the optimal Challenge mode makes for replayability, But the real meat on the bone is New Game Plus and I Am The Knight mode. (Never did that one, Because i'm too scared to try.)Overall Score: 8 out of 10Final Thoughts: After a pretty unstable release, Its still a pretty good addition to the franchise, It might not be better than Arkham City, But then again i never expected it too.Now to wait for the next game..................................soon			"

												Batman Arkham Origins doesn't fix what already worked in the previous games, so Warner Bros. is playing it safe really. The last 2 Batman games were awesome, especially the first. The second one was a bit too ambitious, throwing you into the deep way too soon. Arkham Origins fortunately doesn't do this, but it doesn't hold your hand either, which is a good thing. But the city is a bit too similar to Arkham City, and yes, even though it is Christmas time, it also feels way too empty, with hardly a civilian to be found anywhere and empty cars standing on the middle of the road.Thankfully, there's plenty of content, with lots of sidequests and collectibles and a beefy storyline. Just like the other 2 games. And there's more than enough variety as far as the villains are concerned. Just like the other 2 games. And, of course, there are plenty of gadgets. ... Just like the other games... Sure, there are a few new ones but most of them work the same way as some of the gadgets found in the previous games (like the glue gun).Graphically it all looks amazing, with that dark Batman vibe dating back to Batman Returns on the SNES. The voice acting and music are also all very solid and gameplay wise it all works very well.It's just that Origins doesn't show enough innovation. It all feels and looks very similar. They should really try and expand the game for possible sequels. Give us something new, something to get excited about.Anyway, you will, once again, get plenty of content for your money by buying this. That's also not the thing that you should be worried about. The thing is, can you look past its flaws and enjoy a game that's basically Arkham City 2.5 ?[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Arkham Origins is a great game with a very bad launch which makes it underrated. Different studio on an Arkham game means a different aproach, which in this case turned out to be a solid job. The gameplay is less good, there are more gadgets, the city is bigger and colder, the story feel more alive and the soundtrack helps making it all epic. The story is well written, has many epic moments and does it job at keeping you entertained and keeping your interest in, which is great considering it's a prequel. In this game, Batman is in his early days, fighting both criminality and law. In the night you're playing, 8 assassins mean to kill, all organized by the man behind a mask. There are characters like Joker, Bane, but new even unheard ones from the past games like Deathstroke, Firefly and Shiva. The main story is great and the sidequests are a joy to do (only there you'll confront some of the assassins).Advantages of the game:There are more gadgetsThe city is larger than the previous two gamesGood epic momentsInteresting locationInteresting boss battlesMemorable personalities like superheroes and villainsFascinating historyNegative in the game:Fighting system is easier than in Batman: Arkham CitySeries of annoying glitchesThe graphic is not level as in the previous two games "

												Do you know how Batman introduced himself to Gotham? How he engaged his foes for the first time?Answering these questions Batman: Arkham Origins continues succeding of previous titles. New better graphics and story tailored exactly for batman games fans is what caught me. Sadly except from this the game has nothing more then previous games to offer. Still solving riddles beating criminals and revealing secrets is what entertained me for hours. Predator mode, where you pick guarding enemies one by one silently, is still one of the best features of the game enhanced of some new gadgeds.  8.5 /10Some of you would think I overrated this game, but I think the story is pretty impressive and outweighs minor inconviniences of other aspects of the game.If you are considering buying season pass I advise you to do not, only one I think worth it is Cold Cold Heart story pack.

Posted: March 20, 2015
												The short summary: no matter how you feel about Asylum/City, this game is pretty much just a couple of good boss fights surrounded by warmed-up leftovers from City. Skippable.The long version: the game begins pretty strong, and having one of its best boss fights early (hi Deathstroke) was a really good foot to lead with, but that's basically the peak of things, and it's kinda downhill from there on. Almost every bit of the game just feels like a lamer Arkham City, and some of the city actually seems to be directly copied from the last game, or real close. (It feels to me, and I have not reinstalled to check, like there are less grapple-points in the world. Which makes travel sorta lame even before the story-gated fast-travel checkpoints.)Similarly, the combat has a couple of steps up (I enjoyed remote-clawing things onto people as an extra layer), but these come early and then you're out of new tricks for the back half. In another ""was it always this way? I swear not"" moment, a lot of encounters take place in the-seams-are-visible invisible boxes. More than once I tried to start an encounter with a gadget or trap and then discovered I had clawed or bataranged a man into a wall that kept him from actually moving where I wanted. (Try it sometime!) The enemy 'groups' are strangely seperated. I would occasionally beat up two of three men on a roof and get rewarded for the fight, while the other stood there oblivious because he wasn't part of the same team. The prequel conceit also hamstrings the game really, really hard. On the one hand, kudos for going ""heck with it, he's going to get new tricks and we don't care that they aren't in the other games"". On the other, the barely-reskinned stuff that shows up in here but is telegraphed from miles away (looking at you, ""glue"" grenades that still come out as blue platforms...) if you've played the last games is lame, and oh my god there are too many batarangs. You have seperate multi-target batarangs. That's a real design decision someone made. And to circle back around: you throw in a bunch of villains you haven't used in other games and then expect us to believe that three dudes who all show up in every other game are in danger? For god's sake, at least fake us out with someone we KNOW isn't going to appear 20 more times.Speaking of design: this game is buggy. I only had it crash to desktop the once, but the volume just FLATLINES randomly on area-swaps, at times I had to restart the game because triggers stopped working/responding, and at least once an entire encounter had to be redone because a man fell through the world. This is apparently miles better than the game at launch, as friends pointed out to me, but man, it's not what I call excellent.I don't recommend this unless you're really, really hard up for some more City-style action but don't want to replay that, and even if so... maybe just save a few bucks up by not buying this and put it towards Arkham Knight? I mean, there's still the chance that could be a debacle, but at least it'd be a much more interesting debacle than this rehash of a title.			"

												I waited for a long time before playing this game. I felt like it was just a 'cash in' because it wasn't made by the original developers. Now that I've finally played it, I admit that I was wrong. Arkham Origins is a decent game and I have enjoyed playing it. The graphics are an improvement on Arkham City and the story is very good. The developers seem to genuinely care about the character too. As the game is loaded with really cool Batman related content.Of course it uses the same engine, as the previous games in the series, so that helps. However the game also creates it's own powerful athmosphere with it's Christmas Eve setting. The snowy Gotham City, great music and some really cool attention to detail, sucked me in to this take on Gotham.The game can be a bit buggy though and it crashed on me a few times. I was still able to enjoy myself and it looks great running at a mostly stable 60FPS. However there are occasional FPS drops in some areas of the open city.Origins is definitely worth playing as part of the Arkham Series. It's filled with cool content and is often on sale for a rediculously cheap price. However if it's a choice between this and one of the other games in the series. I would choose the others, simply because Rocksteady games were the innovators of this type of Batman game and their titles are more interesting and more fun to play. Arkham Origins probably was made just to 'cash in' on an already successful series. Thankfully though some people who really care about the character got on board and managed to make a pretty good game.			"

Posted: November 29, 2014
												Ok, first off I'm going to warn you guys that there are SPOILERS in my review, so if you don't want to know, then don't read. Otherwise, in a nutshell, the game was a huge disappointment and, in my opinion, wasn't even worth 5 bucks. I truly wish I could get a refund. NOW THE REASONS WHY:First off, the game is extremely glitchy/bugged, which tells me that the company/developers behind the game put out an unfinished and/or untested product on the market, probably because they were in a hurry to get their money.The fact that I couldn't even get through the first boss fight (which doesn't even take that long to get to ingame) without experiencing an almost game breaking glitch is just pathetic honestly. The fact that the glitch was SO BAD that the music was disappearing, Killer Croc was turning invisible, and then shortly after that the screen went black is probably some of the worst glitching I've seen in a while. The only fix was for me to have to lower my resolution and FX JUST TO GET THROUGH THE FIGHT. Might I mention that I left my settings the same for the rest of the game and had no problems, and this is a well known bug on the internet forums, some people stating they still couldn't fix it, so I'm one of the lucky ones. This is just one game breaking glitch among PAGES UPON PAGES on internet forums that you should probably take into consideration before even bothering with this crappy game.Now, I'm a person who owns and has played/beaten the other Arkham games, and I can honestly say that the controls and combat are way slower/stiffer/clunkier than the predecessors. There were times where I was going to pull my hair out because the game would alter my settings without me knowing and would invert the camera angles, or my character would activate a gadget I didn't even have selected which would cost me in a fight.AND FYI, the company behind the game hasn't bothered to fix these glitches at all and from the sounds of it they've practically abandoned the game by now so there won't BE any fixes unless you want to do the freakin programming yourself. BUT OH WAIT IT GETS BETTERYou can't access the ingame built in console (F10) in the vanilla version of the game xD *facepalm*. Wow. So good luck fixing the game. I'll get back onto this subject in a bit, but lets move onto the next issues.Second, if you're a  batman nerd and know your batman trivia, this game is going to drive you insane, especially on the chronological level. The writing for the game was terrible and in my opinion put a number of the characters in situations or saying certain things that I personally felt was not accurate for their character development. Gordon would NEVER be willing to send his men into a dangerous situation, KNOWING Firefly has the bombs set up and threatened to blow up everyone but the vigilante, simply just to SPITE Batman because ""I follow the law and you don't"". Batman would not destroy the Gotham christmas tree simply to be a jerk to a petty insignificant criminal for no necessary/logical reason, especially if he's just starting out as the vigilante and trying to send a message for people to NOT BE JERKS ANYMORE, what a concept. Batman would not simply let Penguin get away because he locked the door, especially considering the WHOLE freaking game has Batman asking Alfred to unlock doors for him. Guess he couldn't be bothered to open one more door. Batman would not simply let Black Mask get away simply because he was fighting an assassin. The moment Batman would get the antidote, he'd be on Black Mask faster than you could say salsaverde. I could go on and on, but you get the idea. Yet later, after Joker is arrested, they play off like Batman's GOT to find Bane and finish arresting him. Oh, so you NEED to finish the job with Bane but who cares about Penguin and Black Mask right?ALso, let me point out that there was hype for this game having a new villain created for it. This villain is called Anarchy, and from what I gathered, he's basically like the Punisher or an extremist, etc. etc. They play off in the beginning of the game when you beat penguin that he's gonna be this big pain for Batman, and it got me thinking that maybe Anarchy was the joker or something, whatever we'll find out eventually right? NOPE. Turns out that I still don't know much about Anarchy because HE'S NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE MAIN STORYLINE AT ALL, HE'S A FREAKIN SIDE QUESTLINE. A side questline which I will never finish because I have no desire to play this game anymore. Lovely.Now keep in mind that because I was so annoyed with this game, I hardly did any of the side quests at all. I managed to beat the main storyline in (according to steam) 11.6 hours. Honestly, even though the story modes in the other games weren't too much better, at least the game was fun enough to make it seem like it had good replay value and fun to engage, while this game leaves much to be desired.The actual storyline, for up till Joker gets arrested, actually seemed like there was potential. It kinda had me going for a moment, wondering what WAS going to happen. But after the Joker gets arrested, the story becomes a mess where for some reason Batman HAS to find Bane over everyone else, finds out that Bane somehow knows his secret identity, he temporarily kills alfred, and then for whatever reason goes to Blackgate prison to join up with Joker JUST to play some stupid mind game with heartmoniters and trying to force Batman to kill someone, ALL OF THIS MESS seemingly just to give meaning/purpose to the use of Electrocutionors gloves, which might I add is one of many devices they give Batman in a PREQUEL that he doesn't have in the SEQUELS, gee great to know the staff behind this crap game REALLY cares about continuity and staying true to the true origins of batman *note the sarcasm*.

												Don't get me wrong, I love batman games, but this one just felt insanely cheap.Combat is exactly the same except for an extremely overpowered powerup you get about halfway through the game, which completely destroys the purpose of special enemies. As far as the main story goes, it took me just under 10 hours to complete, and felt insanely boring the whole way through.The whole way through this just felt like an arkham city DLC, with the only difference being slightly better graphics and different enemies.The side missions aren't very exciting at all and the collectibles are just too boring to collect (coming from someone who collected every single riddler trophy and riddle in arkham city) and are not rewarding at all.This game is not worth the full price, and you shouldn't play this with very high expectations.

												There isn't much to tell about it really. Batman Arkham Origins was done by WB Montreal instead of Rocksteady and from what I've heard, they had only a few months to make the game so, they basically copied the mechanics of Arkham City, added some new gadgets, expanded the city, and changed the story. That's it. Batman Arkham Origins is the bugged version of Arkham City with new enemy types, new gadgets, expanded city etc. Cutscenes and boss fights really stood above first two games, though. They also added online but servers will be shutted down soon so, there's no point explaining it. It's still a great game despite the bugs so, I think it worth playing.			"

Extremely underrated game.This may be the worst Batman: Arkham game in terms of gameplay, mechanics, and polish (haven't played Knight yet), but that doesn't mean it isn't just as great of a game as the others. Sure, there are a few minor glitches and the design isn't as polished as the other Arkham games, but it was still loads of fun and the story kept me coming back. Speaking of the story, Origins' story may be the best story in the Arkham series and is definitely the best thing about this game. The writing is phenomenal and serves as a fantastic origin story to the Arkham series. I immediately bought Roger Craig Smith's portrayal of a young Bruce Wayne. Although Troy Baker's Joker took a little getting used to due to my obsession with Mark Hamill's Joker, Baker's Joker grew on me and I now love him (almost) as much as Hamill's Joker. Additionally, this game easily had the best boss fights in the Arkham series up to this point.Don't let this game's reputation as the worst Arkham game stop you from buying this game. It's just as enjoyable as the others, and I highly reccomend it, especially for the story and boss fights. "

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a commercial release of a total conversion mod for Batman: Arkham City.  That is not to say the game is bad by any means, it is however absolutely devoid of any innovation and serves as little more than a reskin with an altered map.By setting the game years earlier than the previous two Arkham titles one would expect less gadgets and more low-tech solutions and puzzles in the game, instead all the same tools present in City have returned in Origins, even Mr. Freeze's ice grenades, which are retextured to be glue grenades instead but function identically.  The exact same hacking, the exact same remote controlled batarang...  It is all more of the same.  Some of the Riddler's puzzles are taken directly from City and used over again with only minor tweaks.Again, not a bad game, but when you put out a new game the player should be able to expect a few interesting new things to see and do.  There are a few new bugs that I had not encountered in City present in Origins, so they got that going for them, which is nice I guess.Yes, it is a game worth playing, but no, it is not a full game, so don't ever get it for a full price.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the third game in the franchise, and a prequel to Arkham Asylum. It takes place around 5-years prior to Batman: Arkham Asylum and features Batman going head to head with 8 assassins sent by Black Mask. Not only are gotham's most dangerous assassings out to kill you, but the Gotham City police are trying to apprehend you, so you are alone. As with previous Batman games, the perspective is third-person, with all of the usual gadgets and tricks. For those who enjoy multiplayer, there is a multiplayer version of Arkham Origins as well. During fights I felt like the perspective would roll around to much and it was a little distracting. Gameplay is essentially like the other Batman games, and visually, it looks and feels like Arkham Asylum with a few differences made to the interior of the prison. I didn't test out the multiplayer mode, but I've heard mixed reviews on it. In all, Arkham Origins has an interesting story that shows us what life was like for Batman, prior to his assisting the Gotham City police.			"

												Let's start with the short review:The third entry in the Arkham franchise is good, but it's also superfluous. If you're looking for more Arkham, then by all means don't skip this game. That's what I was looking for when I started Origins, and I wasn't disappointed. I consider this game superfluous because it really doesn't do anything better than Arkham City. Indeed, in some cases it's pretty lacking. And now for the long review:The story to Arkham Origins is...well I'll be vague here. There's a bounty on the Dark Knight's head and eight villains are looking to collect. It's up to the player to put a stop to this nonsense and save the day. The pacing and story are a bit uneven, with a number of segments feeling like they're not really going anywhere. There's a distinct lack of great set-pieces, those moments that really define the Batman experience. That's not to say there isn't any, but they tend to get clumped together. It's like wow give me a chance to breathe here. There are even a couple objectives that seem to exist, solely to make sure Batman is in a particular place, so it doesn't break the next objective. Still the story definitely has its moments, the characters are well-done, and by the end I had a good sense of what WB Montreal was going for with the plot.Next up there is the city. On one hand I like that unlike Arkham City, Gotham doesn't have The Riddler's ????? fetish on display around every corner. His trademark riddles are around, but they blend in a bit better with the surroundings. It's less guady, which counts for a lot. There are some nice details throughout the city. Overall though I can't say I'm too fond of it. Arkham City's..uh...city is more stylized, which is understandable since its villainous inhabitants have dressed it up to fit their personality. Still, I was expecting something a bit more gothic and ornate. There are elements of that and yet sometimes the city can look just plain. Aside from the aesthetics, Arkham City simply had a better design and ""flow"" to it. It felt like more time was spent creating a slice of Gotham that the player could really move around in. Origins on the other hand, can feel just a little bit clunky. Then there is the combat. The Arkham games are divided into two styles of action. There are the melee-oriented ""Vigilante"" brawls and the stealthy ""Predator"" rooms. The goal is typically to defeat all the bad guys, with better experience rewards doled out to stylish players who take advantage of Batman's numerous abilities and gadgets. WB Montreal has done a fine job with both styles. In some cases the brawls aren't quite as tight, and I've had some odd dropped combos, but nothing really stands out as poor. Predator encounters are pretty much 1:1 with the previous Arkham games. There are also the occasional boss-fights, which can take elements from the core styles, or be a little unique.Now then, the big complaint I have with Origins is that they didn't really add anything new. There are a handful of new gadgets for handling Batman's foes, but nothing really inventive. There's the shock gloves sure, but they're ridiculously strong. They chew through every possible defense and add to the combo multiplier at a rapid rate. As fans are well aware, successful vigilante is constantly changing things up, using all of Batman's maneuvers, and keeping a flawless combo going. The gloves simplify things a bit too much. Batman also gets a few new gadgets for his predator encounters, including the ability to string up three criminals to gargoyles from a safe distance. They're not nearly as overpowered, but I have to restrain myself just a bit more to keep things from getting too easy.Of course this is all balanced by the bad guys getting a bunch of new equipment....right? Oh, oh no. This is where the lack of fresh content sticks out. There really aren't any new types of bad guys, nor are any new methods developed to help them spot Batman when he's stalking them. Everyone is still wielding bats or pipes, late-game guys get stun batons, and it's certain they'll get the bright idea to carry riot shields or car doors around. The combat is still good, but it's just more of the same.This feeling of sameness extends to other moments in Arkham Origins. An encounter with Deadshot is oddly reminiscent of the final battle between Catwoman and Two-face, the boss-fight with Firefly is eerily similar to the one with Poison Ivy back in Arkham Asylum. As these battles play out I get that familiarity that really shouldn't be there. It's difficult to feel that sense of accomplishment when there's a little voice in the back of my brain saying ""What are you celebrating about? You've done this before."" The names and locations change, but too many other elements don't.As far as concerns the rest of Arkham Origins content. There is the usual collection of vigilante and predator challenge maps, additional playable characters, and...multiplayer? I'll be brutally honest here, I played one multiplayer match, and that was it. What can I say? I'm not much of a competitive MP person. The multiplayer seems to be retaining its popularity well, as I got into a full match within seconds of starting up. Honestly I'd be satisfied with something a bit more simple and direct, Batman & Robin teaming up to put the hurt on some thugs. Maybe there could be some more advanced vigilante and predator maps to keep things balanced. All in all, despite Arkham Origins not really doing anything new or improving on its predecessors, I still recommend it. Why? Simply because it's more Arkham. Yes, really, that's absolutely it. Am I shallow or what? Rocksteady struck gold when they developed Arkham Asylum. Now they have a model that can be applied to any and all future Batman games and I'm likely to eat it up everytime. As long as the quality remains at moderately-high level I'll remain a fan. Although I hope that with Rocksteady developing the next game, they include a slew of fresh game-design changes and additions. If the fifth Arkham game turns out to be a retread, I hope it's at least a retread of Arkham Knight and not Arkham City.			"

 Single player	This game has a good story, a slightly similar combat system of arkham city with a few new added gadgets , new enemy types, and about 9 villains you get to face off and fight. Unlike arkham knight boss battles, this installment brings back the feeling of what its like to fight actual bosses who could kill you if your not too careful for example bane, deathstroke, cooperhead and others. Multiplayer	The multiplayer in this game is also good. There are 3 teams Jokers gang, Bane's gang and batman and robin .You get to play as one of the elite henchmen who work for either the joker or bane and you get to play as batman and robin, sort of like a predator/prey system where about 6 players are henchmen(prey) and 2 players are batman and robin(hunter). I like how the mutiplayer gives you the opportunity to play as henchman and get to experience their perspective of being stalked by batman, you maybe thinking how hard can it be to spot a man in bat costume or even be scared of him but trust me after playing as a henchmen you will FEAR THE KNIGHT.The drawback to multiplayer is that its really hard to find a match when there aren't many online players, each matchmaking session takes about 10-15 minutes which is abit frustrating and things get even worse when a game starts with people who are either afk or disconnected during the match since there is no vote to kick feature and players can't join during multiplayer sessions. This game may not be as good as arkham city but its still worth buying and playing. I recommend buying when its on offer like i did, then you won't regret your decision if you dont like it.			"

Product received for free
												Pros-great combat you've come to expect-great boss battles-above average graphics for a last generation title with a decent ammount of options-runs well (more on perfomance at the bottom)-best cut scenes in an Arkham gameCons-occasional crashes-cinematics seem to be ripped from the console versionEDIT: I have now beat the game on hard and made a few additionsalmost finished and really enjoying it. I've played AA, AC and now AO and I think this game carries the torch very well. It's not developed by Rocksteady but honestly I'd never guess, it feels like a worthy successor to the first two. I don't know why this game gets thrown under the bus and why it doesn't appear to be included in the new ""HD"" remaster (enough of these ffs).It plays great, looks great, mostly runs great and has some great cut scenes and boss battles, with lots of action.Only probelm was I got semi frequent crashes but the game autosaves very frequently so you'll hardly have to worry about losing progress, just a slight annoyance of relaunching the game which only takes a second.One of the most impressive things about this game are the cut scenes (ok, well besides the fact they're ripped from a xbox 360). They are extremely entertaining and seem to me to have the highest production value of any Arkham game, even though most only last about half a minute and sometimes even less. It's perfect, because a beat'em up Batman game should be like MGS but the short bursts of cinematic action are highly satisfying and feel like the totally natural extension of a Batman comic book or cartoon brought to video game form. They also manage to advance the story and gameplay very well. Well done WB.Overall I recomend this game. Got kind of shafted by WB for giving me AC for free after I already bought it and giving me AA which I already beat on PS3 but I'm glad I got this game which I probably would have never checked out otherwise due to an average reputation that I now don't think it deserves.*I've heard this game once had alot of problems but on my gtx970/FX8310@4.4ghz was able to maintain a pretty smooth 60fps flying around Gotham and even durring heavy fights at max settings/1080p/2xMSAA but would frequently get drops to 40 when entering new areas or sometimes durring in engine cut scenes. I don't think there's really anything to do about that, just a console port showing itsself.Especially durring the pre-rendered cinematics which appear to be taken directly from the console versions, because even though my counter reads 60fps it definitely seems to be 30fps and the resolution seems to MUCH lower than the game itsself. I got the platinim trophy on AA and don't remember janky cut scenes but maybe they don't stick out on the console version. However when you're playing on high or max PC settings, the diference can be jarringThe cutscenes are usually packed with action and Batman being a badass and generally only last about 30-60 seconds so the cut scenes are stil enjoyable despite this.

												Make no mistake, this is a fantastic game. The media reviews of this game are incredibly biased and bashes everything based on the fact that it is not made by Rocksteady. If the game changes too much, it is unfaitful, if it doesn't change, then it is uninnovative. There is no pleasing of the media dogs.This game kept everything that made Arkham City amazing and added upon it. Here's a list of pros and cons that I've experienced during the game:Pros:1. The new detective vision allows far more interesting interactions with crime scenes and now actually requires effort to solve a case. 2. Fast travel is now available to compensate for the larger city3. Superior story telling. This game tells a fantastic story of Batman's  beginnings and lets you see into the internal struggles of Joker. In terms of story and character presentation, Origins well surpassed its predecessor. 4. Much improved graphics including higher texture resolution, dynamic lighting and ambient occulsion.5. Far more optimized than Arkham City for the PC, better performance overall6. More gadgets provide more ways to terrorize your enemies7. More complex city geometry with multiple layersCons:1. Bugs. Even though bugs still exists, they are more or less small glitches that are less likely to be game breaking. Of the 20 hours of gameplay there have only been 1 time where a bug actually got me into trouble.2. Factial animation. While most of the characters have impressive facial animations, for some reason a few characters just never got the same effort put in to them. Gordon and Alfred talks without ever moving a facial muscle, which feels quite creepy...3. Somewhat shorter in length compares to Arkham City, less side quests and shorter main story.4. Grapple lock feels less accurate than its predecessor, aiming of your grapple can be a serious issue when you are trying to do some fast swings.Overall I am incredibly pleased with the game, if you still have doubts, pick it up after it goes on a steep sale, which is likely to happen soon due to the relatively low sales figures...

												This game has a great story line and great boss battles, it plays exactly like City and Asylum but has even more open world. The multiplayer is a fantastic experience if you get a good connection with the people you are playing with...its even better if you play with your friends and with headsets. The only complaint i have with this game is the upgrade system is a lot more complicated then Arkham City and they arnt the original actors. I wont give away any spoilers but i will give this game a 9.5/10			"

												Being the huge Batman fan that I am, I still knew that at some point I was going to try it out. And that I did on Halloween night. Ten hours later, my opinions on the game have changed drastically. This is the largest, most complete, most refined Arkham to date. Every single aspect of the game has been tuned to the point where it has reached its full potential.It is true that regarding game play, this is Arkham City on a larger scale, with a larger map and plenty more skills, animations, gadgets and so on. But the story in Origins is fantastic and stands out as the best in the trilogy. Every major enemy is introduced with flair, and the fights are spectacular. The Deathstroke battle (which has caused many a lot of trouble, but I thoroughly enjoyed) in particular, was epically designed. The martial artistry displayed in this scene is jaw dropping. I cannot think of a more awesome and cinematic showdown in a comic book-inspired video game.I must say I do find a major setback with regards to a particular decision in the art direction, and that is Batman´s character design. It makes no sense at all. An excessively armored Batman on his second professional year cannot be justified on any grounds, and the countless amount of gadgets, from the get, go, at times removed me from the context the story so passionately tries to portray.The atmosphere is thick with immersion and somehow darker as well. I feel this visual interpretation more akin to the Batman world I know and grew up with. Similar to what Tim Burton did on his second Bats movie.So to wrap things up, yes, Origins is very similar to Arkham City. Yet after spending some time with it, I´ve come to the conclusion that the Arkham formula is too much of a winning one, and polishing it rather than messing with it was perhaps, the safest and truest (to the franchise) course of action WB could have taken. Batman Arkham Origins´ biggest hurdle is its legacy, and the uncontrollable human tendency to compare.As a gamer and Batman fan, I have given the game a chance and wholeheartedly recommend Arkham Origins. A truly memorable experience if measured on its own grounds.Overall: I can only wish this was the first installment. Arkham City was pretty much a perfect game but it doesn't preclude Origins from being a great game.Note: Don't skip the credits scene.			"

												It's a good game, but I see it as a glorified DLC for Arkham City. But I love the ""Initiation"" DLC! Roleplay wise it is a pretty good way to start playing the Arkham games. Sure it's just challenge maps, but the way I see it is that once you complete those maps with top scores, you'll be ready to tackle all the four Arkham games as THE Batman. I don't know about you, but it always annoyed me when my Batman gets hit because of my lack of combat and stealth training. And remember what Bane said ""... but we are initiated, aren't we Bruce?""

But having in mind that it comes out after AC it fails to protect its name. + The visuals are great and the game runs smoothly+ It gives more of the same, while trying to add new things to the franchise+ The story is by far the best from the 3 games. The voice acting and story reveal are top notch+ Good additions: Score system, I am the night mode- Terrible level design, bad city design- Full of bugs- Fillers, easy riddles and direct copy-pastes- The smoothnes and battle rhythm from AC is goneScore: 70/100 "

												Despite Arkham Origins being an excellent game in its own right, it's hard to ignore the Arkham City comparison. Warner Brothers took no risks with Origins, and the few changes they made were for the worse. Everything in Arkham Origins is an exact replica of Arkham City, except with different buildings that you go into and obviously a younger story.The only thing that's stopping this game from being completely pointless is the story. Seeing the characters when they are younger is quite interesting, but the story lacks focus it jumps around too much.The multiplayer is tacked on, and doesn't even work most of the time on PC. The concept and class system and stuff is all just flawed and tacked on for the sake of it. Overall, Arkham Origins has solid foundations but fails to expand upon them.			"

												Arkham Origins is a very curious title in a lot of ways. It was made by a different developer than the previous two games, since Rocksteady was busy working on Arkham Knight. The things Origins does well is mostly in the storytelling department. I really liked how the game takes place early on in Batman's career as a crime fighter. Characters remark with surprise treating the protagonist as a myth and Batman himself comes across as more inexperienced and arrogant. It feels more in-line with the Nolan movies in this regard and it's a welcome change from the previous two games which felt like extensions of the Batman Animated series. However, Arkham Origins isn't as polished as Asylum, nor does it have the steller presentation of City. It's clear the developers were working with a limited budget and time constraints, and that they weren't interested in innovating on the previous games like Rocksteady was. I still do like Origins but I think of it more of a spinoff to the previous two games rather than a sequel. If you treat it like that you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins stars a more younger Batman... a more reckless and more naive Batman that's just now being hunted down - literally - by a group of Assassin's hired by the Black Mask after a prison is raided and the old Police Commisioner dies - Batman is now being hunted by both cops, thugs and the assassins. The newest Sequel, which is a Prequel to Arkham Asylum - was developed by a new studio - not Rocksteady, and there were some... changes and some not-so changes that ultimately make this, in my opinion, the worst Batman Arkham game out there right now. It is still a solid game however and it is pretty well built.Now this game, visually, is a little different from the more Comic/Cartoony looking Arkham games Rocksteady had made. Origins looks a bit more... like plastic I should say but it's not entirely bad, same goes for the major enemies like Deathstroke, Killer Croc and the like. The environments also look pretty cool as you see snow tracks being made by either you or enemies (can be further enhanced by Direct X11 tasselation and PhysX features, respectively) but I found myself feeling a sort of Deja Vu, and it wasn't too far fetched to say they directly lifted models and scapes and pretty much rebuilt Arkham City and modeled it to be a standalone Gotham, which was pretty lazy - however, the nifty visual effects DX11 can bring, make this game quite a looker, Batman himself looks pretty beefy (though I noticed there is a might tight bit wrong with his model - his right arm seems to be longer than his left arm), the major enemies look pretty well designed with the minor nitpick that the enemy models repeat far too much and offer little to no variety.Batman here has pretty much the exact same gadgets he has in Arkham Asylum and City - disappointingly enough. Other than the Shock Gloves - there's nothing you obtain that really makes much of an advancement over City. You still have your standard Batarangs, the Sonic Batarangs, Smoke Pellets, the Explosive Gel, the Grapple Hook and it's enhancer, the Decrypter and of course - the new Shock Gloves, which you obtain later on in the game. The Shock Gloves are like a temporary upgrade in combat that enhances your damage and makes your attacks unblockable while they are active. To Power up the Shock Glove, you still counter and fight as your normally would in a fight, once powered, you can activate 'em and start wreaking havoc. The Shock Gloves made the game considerably easier and it's the main way you're going to be able to add a 2x hit to your combo counter, unlike how it originally worked in Asylum - which was with an upgrade to your combos.There are also a multitude of upgrades. Sadly, this was made worse thanks to a streamlining system they made for it. On previous Batman Arkham games, you could purchase upgrades as you would unlock them via sthe story - be them Health, Defense, Finishers, combos enhancers/extenders, etc - you can still buy ALL of them in Origins, but you need to buy previous and sometimes completely unrelated upgrades in order to get the ones you want. This to me was not a very welcome addition as it just made me want to pump all my upgrades into one skill tree instead of balancing out Batman but frankly, other than Defense enhancers (one for ballistics/bullets and one for armour/fist fights) there wasn't much I really wanted to get as upgrades in this particular game are pretty minimal.This game pretty much plays out like past Arkham games - it has the exact same ""Free Flow"" combo combat, except it has a few minor twists. You press a button to attack in continuation and when an enemy is downed, you can hold a direction towards an enemy and press the attack button/key again and Batman will lunge himself towards them in a very sleek and stylish manner. You can also hit another key/button that makes Batman swing his cape at the enemy and temporarily blinds/stuns them - when an enemy is stunned, if you mash the attack button on that enemy - Batman will unleash a fast and furious flurry of punches against that particular enemy and it feels really, really satisfying to do - by far the thing I did most in the game and you'll be doing it a lot aswell, considering some enemies NEED to be stunned before you can damage them - this is truer in boss battles - and of course, you can tap the batarang key/button to make Batman spam throw Batarangs at enemies - this serves as your basic projectile attack - and like in previous Arkham games, you can still counter incoming enemy attacks using the ""Counter"" key/button and evade/pole vault over enemies using the ""Evade"" key/button.  ~Later on in the game, however, you will unlock more moves and finishers you can utilize to extend your combos, combo counter or simply permanently defeat a downed enemy faster.Like the past Arkham games (will be saying this a LOT), predator mode is back, and it still functions like you would expect. You can hide under grates, use the crouch key/button to make Batman move lower and more quieter (for some reason this animation is actually faster than your standard walking animation) as well as grapple up top of a Statue. You'll be working to take down enemies while in Predator mode - you can do this a multitude of ways. You can use Explosive Gel placement spots and remotely activate them to KO an enemy, but makes a lot of noise, you can simply walk up behind them and put 'em to sleep, you can use an ""inverted takedown"" which has Batman drop down from the statue, tie up the enemy by the feet and hang them upside down, and of course, you can issue takedowns (noisy ones) from grates and vents - there's still a lot of versatility with stealth and such, but nothing in it is new at all - it is still very satisfying however, to pull of a predatory encounter very fast and pitch perfect before anyone even finds out what happened.Now onto the game itself... it's repetitive. Out of all the Arkham games, this one, even though it plays the exact same as City is so much more repetitive and dull and that's because it lacks variety. For some reason, Gotham is infested by corrupted cops and thugs and every single one of them wants to kill you. Not only do most of these thugs use the same model repeated, over and over again - but so do the cops. Sure there are ""Crimes"" to stop, but they also culminate in ""Drop here, beat them all up"" - it's mind numbing how boring it is. There's honestly not much to do outside of story missions. The ""Nigma"" datapaks , which are the equivalent of Riddler Trophies from past games are easier to find and the puzzles are a lot more dumbed down than in past games aswell. You also have little satellites you can to throw your batarand at to clear up an area's signal so you can unlock a travel point, but that is also very boring and tedious to do. Boss battles fare no different either. While some boss battles here - namely the Deathstroke battle - is more ""creative"" than past games' mini-game like boss battles, they ultimately feel too scripted and repetitive. You do NOT get to fight all of the assassin's within the story arc (two of them are left out to Side missions - seriously - why?) and you get to fight one a total of 3 times! Wow - not very creative are we? All in all, it's still a Batman Arkham game, albeit a more dumbed down, tedious version that brings absolutely nothing new to the table other games haven't brought before. It is fun though, and the mechanics work pitch perfect - though for some reason the awesome crackle noise the game made whenever you finished a battle and punched the last thugs' face in is gone. I still recommend playing through it (at a reduced Price mind you - not at $40+) because it's a beautiful game, especially if you can utilize the Direct X11 features coupled with PhysX - they are astoundingly beautiful to behold. Batman's voice actor also changed, but it works to his advantage in a certain way.  "

“Well, at least we can all agree the third one's always the worst.” Jean Grey, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)Batman: Arkham Origins is the 3rd entry in the Batman franchise, a prequel to Asylum.  Notably, Origins was not developed by the original developers Rocksteady, instead it was made by WB Games Montréal. And oh boy, does it show.Story:Set 5 years before Asylum, Origins portrays a young Batman who has yet to become the superhero vigilante. The thugs and criminals are afraid of him, the police even more so. On Christmas Eve, a hit is put on the Dark Knight by Black Mask. $50 million for the head of Batman, with 8 supervillains competing with each other for the bounty. It could have been neat story, but Origins falls apart in its execution and gameplay.The first part is the believability of the story. Batman has not met any major villains, yet in one night, goes up against the Joker, Bane, the Riddler, Penguin, Black Mask, Killer Croc, and the Riddler. Not to mention the other B-D list villains such as Electrocutioner, Copperhead, Shiva, Mad Hatter, Deathstroke, Firefly and Deadshot. It’s unbelievable that Batman encountered every one of them for the first time in the same night, much less beat them all.Origins’ story lacks any tension. We all know that Batman will survive, we all know the fates of nearly all the characters. Origins is an unnecessary game, because we already know what’s going to happen. There are prequels that still told compelling story, adding to the story rather than detracting from it, (Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Wolfenstein: The Old Blood are great examples) but Origins does not. It’s telling an origins story we already know the ending to, and is an unnecessary addition to the franchise.The most obvious example of this lack of tension comes near the end of the game. Bane, having discovered Batman’s secret identity as Bruce Wayne, goes to Wayne Manor and seemingly kills Alfred. It’s worst parts of the story because we already know how it ends. Alfred isn’t dead, Bane doesn’t know Batman’s secret identity in the later games, it’s an utterly useless plot point.The only scenes I found myself enjoying were the ones with Joker. Though I still wish he hadn’t been the main villain yet again, especially after that bait and switch (IT WAS ME ALL ALONG), he’s the most entertaining part of the game. The moment where he meets Batman for the first time (the best scene in the game), watching Batman come to grips with his yet to be nemesis, those segments were easily the most interesting parts of the story. The rest of the story is a convoluted mess, too many villains and no sense of direction.


Batman™: Arkham Origins

Gameplay:Origins is one of the few games I’ve played where the core gameplay actually got worse. It still uses the Freeflow combat system, but something felt… off. Timing is irregular, where in previous games there was a consistent rhythm to the combat, it’s completely absent from Origins. Animations are janky, there’s a distinct lack of polish. The new gadgets are uninteresting and there are no new moves, whereas City greatly expanded the combat variety that Asylum was lacking, Origins copies the combat of City, and somehow made it worse.Worst of all are the visibility issues when it comes to differentiating enemies. Handling Brutes (the big armoured enemies you needed to stun first) was important in City, you had to keep an eye out for them or risk losing your combo. In Origins, Brutes are near indistinguishable from common thugs, where in City you could spot them instantly even in the heat of combat due to their distinctive armour and larger stature, the same can’t be said for Origins.On the subject of reused features, the entire ♥♥♥♥ing map of City is reused. There are minor differences (5 year time gap), but when half of the map in Origins has been an area identical to the previous game, it feels like such a lazy design choice, as if the developers couldn’t come up with any original ideas. Given how much Origins borrows from City, they could have at least made a whole new map, instead of reusing half of Gotham and calling it twice as big as the previous game. Origins feels like a cheap knockoff compared to the previous two games, it copies the same mechanics and does nothing new. Mad Hatter missions play like worse versions of the Scarecrow bits in Asylum, “new” gadgets are just the same ones but under a different name. It’s the same… but worse.And the boss fights are awful. Though the bosses in Asylum were weak, City showed that the Arkham games could make creative bosses, from the spectacle of the Ra’s al Ghul fight to the hide and seek game with Mr. Freeze, which at the time was one of the most creative boss fights I’d played. The bosses in Origins for comparison are laughably bad. Remember that Poison Ivy fight in Asylum? All the bosses are essentially that. You beatdown the boss for a bit, perform a QTE counter, use a specific gadget when they’re vulnerable, then repeat the exact same sequence over and over until they’re dead. EVERY boss uses this same formula, and every single fight feels anticlimactic because of it.The only new feature I enjoyed in Origins was the newly improved crime scene investigations. While in previous games, investigating crime scenes boiled down to “scan for the highlighted object and follow the trail,” Origins expands on that idea by allowing you to rewind time and recreate the crime as it happened, and look for clues at specific instances. It still is the same idea for the most part, but is more involving than walking around and scanning the area, and was a nice addition.Graphics and art design:Oddly enough, Origins looks graphically worse than its predecessor. If I were to guess why, it would come down to the art design of the game. Previous Arkham games had a very strong art direction and had a surprisingly good use of colour. Asylum and City were colourful games, and to this day they still look great. Origins in comparison lacks the strong art direction, and it’s noticeable. The game looks flat, has terrible lighting, too much grey and brown. It’s not a visually appealing game. It may be my imagination, but the textures looked worse on max settings compared to City. Just look at Killer Croc in City compared to Origins, and you might see what I mean.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386749054Soundtrack and audio:I can’t remember a single song. It’s not like the Arkham games had bad music either, Asylum and City had some memorable tunes, but there didn’t seem to be any recurring leitmotifs in Origins.Voice acting ranged from mediocre to bad, notably Batman and the Joker have different voice actors this time round. Mark Hamill will always be the true Joker, but Troy Baker does a fairly good job of playing a younger version. At the very least, you have to respect his impressive range, even if it does feel like he’s chasing Hamill’s spotlight here. The rest of voice cast is bland and uninspiring, especially Batman’s replacement.Conclusion:Batman: Arkham Origins plays like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover of a great song. This is not the game you need, nor the one you deserve. If you really want more of City you may be interested, but with an uninspired main story, recycled map and game mechanics, Origins does little to innovate. A blatant cash grab and completely skippable.			"

												Let's start off by stating this game doesn't succeed Arkham City in the way I hoped. It does however entertain for what it's worth. The game is set 5 years before Arkham Asylum, where you play a less refined and experienced Batman. Black Mask places a bounty on your head which 8 of the world's greatest assassins heed the call to. The Gotham City Police Department aren't fond of Batman, and the tactical team, lead by Branden, attempt to take Batman down themselves to earn the bounty. At this point James Gordon isn't the commissioner yet, as he is the Captain, and he and Detective Harvey Bullock are trying to take down the Batman.I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I was never too fond of Arkham Asylum, giving it an average rating, however I loved Arkham City, and it remains to be one of the very fews games I've ever given a 10/10 for. Regardless of whatever issues that game had, I enjoyed it far too much to deny it of that rating. Sadly to say Arkham Origins didn't entertain me as much as Arkham City did, but it did (in my opinion) stay true to the franchise. I would've loved to see Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles as Joker and Batman, however I enjoyed the new voice actors as they really did sound like the characters they were portraying. That being Troy Baker as Joker, and Roger Craig Smith as Batman.One disappointing factor about this game is that you don't see much of the assassins, when that was one of the high points of this game, you only fight each assassin once, and in the Electrocutioner's case, it is a very short battle, where he literally falls and faints if you punch him ONCE, then Batman insults him and leaves the battleground. Deadshot, and Lady Shiva aren't even in the main story and are only in side missions (one series each). The only assassins whose true potentials was met were Bane, and Firefly. Both of their objectives as far as Batman goes, made sense, their character's dialogue seemed to be on par with their characters in the comics, and previous games, and their ""Screen time"" was more than suffice. The DLCs released for the game haven't been too impressive, I always like the extra skins for my character as they are always really good adaptations of the DCU comics, however aside from that the Initiation DLC was a huge let down in my opinion, as it was just a challenge campaign and not a real story. The new DLC just announced (I'm speculating to be a Mr. Freeze DLC, based on the picture alone which is an award for the ""Wayne Foundation Humanitarian of the Year"" where a sculpture of a woman holding a huge heart shaped diamond over her head, with shards of ice all around her) seems to be promising as it will carry on where the game left off, and I hope will provide that same story telling that was so greatly successful in Arkham City.Overall I love the Batman series, from comics, to movies, to games, so my review may be a little biased and skewed to give this game a victory it may not completely deserve, I still recommend it to anyone who likes Batman, wants to get into the series, or just wants an exciting open world superhero game to play in. WB Montreal played it on the safe side and didn't change too many things. They added many new features, but all of which are on a small scale, so if you liked Arkham City, or even Asylum, as far as their game play went, there should be no reason for you to not like the game play of Arkham Origins. Rating the three games in order I would say Arkham City wins, followed by Arkham Origins, and Arkham Asylum. I would recommend this game to be played from beginning to end, from the main story, to the side stories, and even those annoying Enigma challenges.Taking everything into consideration I would rate Arkham Origins at 7.5/10.

												Great Game 8/10Pros:- Best Story of the 3 Arkham Games.- Good mix of villians.- Combat as fluid as ever.- Multiplayer is a great idea.Cons:- Multiplayer while fun, has no lasting appeal.- Side missions are not as good as Arkham City's.- Huge difficulty spikes on certain bosses early in the game (Deathstroke)-  Some glitches in the game. (Some riddler trophies unaccesable) Fixed now :)Bottom line its a great game, and would recomend anyone who played the other 2 Arkham games to give it a shot!			"

												This game annoys me for many reasons. Mainly it is down to consistency.They managed to screw up the brilliant combat system. While it is still fun, it is inferior to the previous two games. Sometimes you can free flow to an opponent, sometimes you'll punch the air and sometimes you'll favour hitting a guy already on the floor instead of the one who is standing next to him. The upshot is that you will lose your combo and this is annoying. You also have to be careful with quickfire gadgets, you can fire a batclaw at the only standing enemy and before you're finished slamming him another guy can stand up slide to you and break your combo with no chance of countering him. Same goes for any move which takes longer than a single beat (cape stun, mine laying etc). I like the idea that you have to be careful when to use these multi beat moves but the lack of consistency and apparent psychic/superhuman powers of your enemies means that it is less about skill and more luck.The linear nature of this game is very obvious. There will be doors which look like other doors you can use but which are nothing other than scenery, no interaction, no trying to budge a blocked door or funny little animations of henchmen surprised that Batman is knocking on their door. The line launcher only works on rare and obvious anchor points. The grappler will sometimes let you grapple, but sometimes you will just hit the side of the building you're trying to glide to.There seems to be one way to approach situations and any other idea you may have will be blocked by scenery (Batman is defeated by a single strand of police tape.. don't tell Joker), bad grapple mechanics or doors which mysteriously lock themselves after you've walked through them. I think it's a cheek to call this an open world game. The ability to hang from a ledge you are perched on has been removed, one can only assume because the developers were drunk or suffered head injuries. The Deathstroke fight was little more than a button mashing interactive movie, ensuring you get to see all the animations the devs have made for you. Speaking of animations, a great improvement on AA by AC was the death animations. You know, where the bad guy would taunt Batman as he lay dying. They're great, but you don't want to be forced to watch them 20 times while you learn how to beat whatever stage you're on. Arkham City allowed you to skip these and get back to the game, Arkham Origins has gone back to the philosophy of Arkham Asylum (i.e. watch this animation, then wait for a reload).The new detective mode is nice except it also suffers the linearity problems. You'll need to scan various aspects of the scene to build up a picture of what happened but you can't progress to the next peice of evidence until Batman has finished musing to himself about the previous one and forcing you, again, to watch animations.I was going to finish this one before starting Arkham Knight but I think I'll skip it for now, though I will probably return to it when I want some more Batman. All in all, I wont recommend the game because the problems are too numerous. It isn't terrible overall, but it does leave a sour taste. If the other games didn't exist, I probably wouldn't mind so much. Get it on sale or something.			"

This review is based on the current condition of the game and therefore my opinion may be a lot more positive than it would have been on the release day.My favourate Batman game out of the first 3 Arkham titles Origins took everything good about Arkham City and just improved on it.The story, while simple, is a lot more entertaining than in Arkham City. This is an origin story. Batman is still just a rumor. You're not a known figure or a hero and so even the cops are after you. This made the game feel fresh and unique. You're a ""hero"" going after criminals but at the same time you have to avoid cops or even fight them. Not only is this an origin story for the Batman but you also get to know all your favourate villains a bit better. You get to see how Harley and Joker met and all that kind of stuff.What is the story tho? It's simple: It's about Alfred trying to have a peaceful christmas meal. Khm! A villain put a bounty on Batman. You're basically going around Gotham fighting bounty hunters and trying to capture the person who placed the bounty on you. There is a little twist in the story but that's pretty much it.It took me 14h to finish the story. I did stick around to solve some cases and take down last of the remaining Enigma servers but I did not go for 100% completion. I assume it would take around 20h to do everything.Gameplay is pretty much the same as in the previous two Arkham titles altho i have to say that the combat does feel a lot more faster and smoother in here. You can upgrade and unlock new gadgets as you progress in the game. Those same gadgets let you access different parts of the map or help you get to a shiny precious collectible. If you've played any of the Batman games you know what to expect from the combat/gameplay.Graphically the game is superiour to the previous Arkham games and it is still good to look at even in 2016. The voice acting is supreme. The gameplay is fun and the story is decent enough to keep you hooked until the ending.I'd say the game is worth the full price.- I did experience one crash and about 2-3 graphical glitches during my playthrough.I understand it had a rocky launch but the game seems to be fixed by now and you have to work really hard to come across a bug.

												One of the Best Pre-Sequels ever out there.So Batman's kind of new to this Vigilante buisness and guess what ? Someone orders a hit on him , Batman has to find out why.The Game takes place in Old Gotham City but with new areas and new Enemies .The combat system has been , downgraded to make it feel like Batman's still learning the ropes , as he still isn't a veteran and Civilian friendly. Though the free flow system is still fluent.There are quite a few bugs , but nothing a checkpoint reload can't fix. The story is long as compared To City and Asylum and I've enjoyed it more than them.I'd say it's worth getting this game ! Also The Season Pass gives you some extra goodies . 8.5/10 because of some bugs .			"

												I was one of those people that loved Asylum, but didn't care much for City. As a whole it felt very unfocused to me, with too many villains popping up that didn't get enough development. As a result, I didn't expect much from Origins, since WB Montreal was making a game in the same vein. My reaction after finishing it though, is very much the opposite. I loved Origins from start to finish. The story has more focus, and is centered around a few central characters. It's a nice 'Year Two' type story, with Batman learning that oppossing Gordon maybe isn't the smartest idea. The finale was a blast to play and there were some purely fan service moments that were still handled really well.I still miss the more metroidvania approach from Asylum, but Origins deals with the open world type gameplay better than City itself.Also, it has the Deathstroke battle, which is definitely one of the finest moments in the series.

Batman: Arkham Origins			* 9/10Considering the unexpected ending in Arkham City and the different development team a prequel chapter seemed a good solution. As a matter of fact it IS a good solution.Arkham Origins, as the title suggests takes place before Arkham Asylum, the first Batman Arkham Franchise game, and tells us the story of an angry Bruce Wayne that started  being a Brutal Batman for a very short time in Gotham. The event that trigger this story is the Evasion of Black Mask from the prison of Blackgate and his unpredictable actions seem to lead to a bigger plan that will lead to disasters and revelations.As the other chapters, this is a 3rd person action. Hack and slash, I would say, inside an ""open world"", in this case the open city of Gotham, now even bigger than before and even colder, as it's winter and snow is covering everything.What I really loved of this game is the Winter snowy setting, the prequel timing, where we meet various characters for the first time (such as Good old not-yet-commissioner Gordon), and most importantly the detective aspect of the game. There are side missions focused on detective mode, but considering that the original Batman stories are ""detective Stories"" this chapter does a great job by giving the main story a constant mistery that Batman must investigate, with reconstruction of events in crime scenes, clues and everything else. Sure, as every other Batman Arkham Franchise the game is still mostly an action, but this chapter introduced a story worth of the greatest detective, and this is what really made me appreciate this title.Just like the rest of the franchise, Arkham Origins uses The Unreal Engine, which can be demanding in terms of resources but gives back beautiful sceneries and great details. However, in this chapter random crashes have been more frequent than the previous ones, not to mention few random glitches (I fell into void through the ground for no reason while attacking a boss in the Cold cold heart DLC). I forgive only because the game is great and luckily it saves the progress automatically and frequently.The soundtrack makes use of a great title track, and some good support melodies fitting the Dark Knight adventures' mood.Unlike its predecessor the game makes a few references to the DC world (especially batman's), which is less than the standard I've been used to in Arkham City, which is bad but not essential.The game sure offers lots of side missions that will keep the player on the title for a very long time. The most notable is the Riddler's side mission, which I consider the longest and most difficult, just like in any other chapter. Luckily, this time is not that complicated as in Arkham C‭ity. Also considering the city's size you have the option to fast travel with the aid of the batwing (as long as you have unlocked the area by destroying the local towers, which is part of the Riddler's secondary mission).Arkham Origins also has a Multiplayer component (which I didn't even try because I rarely play MP) that unfortunately has been terminated on December 2016.+++PROs+++ NEW ARKHAM CHAPTER. I really consider this game a really great Prequel Chapter, the story with mistery, the cold and dark winter setting inside a Large and Extended Gotham, the classic Arkham Gameplay with the improved Detective mode make this chapter really good. Not to mention the great DLCs.---CONs--- GLITCHES AND BUGS. Random crashes and glitches are more frequent in this chapter than the previous ones.I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 "

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an intelligently developed game. Warner Bros Montreal knew it had a great core to work with and focused to improve the weakest points, with great success. This is no cash-in, but rather a full-fledged adventure that helps shed light on the first steps of Batman as the Dark Knight, while providing many hours of fun between a compelling main mission and the secondary activities. Of course, if you weren't a fan of the games created by Rocksteady, chances are this one won't win you over. Still, it's a great start for a brand new development studio and a promising sign for the future of the franchise.Read my full review at http://www.worldsfactory.net/2013/11/07/batman-arkham-origins-review-batman-hits-once-again "

												With the release of Batman: Arkham Knight in about 3 weeks I figured I'd remake my review of Origins considering it's been 2 years since its release. And also because it's due time for an updated one. Story This story takes place after 2-3 years of Batman donning his cape and cowl. 8 assassins are tasked with finding and killing you for 50 million placed by Black Mask. Killer Croc, Firefly, Shiva, Bane, Deadshot, Copperhead, Electrocutioner and Deathstroke are all out to kill you. Or so it seems. The twists are done well....however most people are not happy to see Joker take the spotlight once again. You need to remember that the title is called 'Origins' for a reason. It's exploring how Batman first meets some of his greatest enemies/foes. Naturally, you'll think of a couple being left out. Where's Two Face and Poison Ivy? What about Scarecrow? They didn't come into being until later. Overall, I think the story was well enough thought out and I don't get sick of it. Gameplay I won't sugar coat it. The gameplay is the clunkiest of the Arkham series. Batman will sometimes lose the freeflow due to hitting air regardless of being near enemies, hits are slower and counters don't always register. There are a couple new gadgets Batman obtains and uses and they add more fun to predator areas. The addition of shock gloves makes Batman much more powerful. Too powerful in fact. Once activated, you ignore any special goons and just hit right through anything. It does double damage as well. It's fun, but makes things too easy at times. I really like the martial artists. They definitely provide more of a challenge forcing you to counter as much as you hit. The new detective system is fun to use as well to solve crimes. I've heard some encounter game breaking bugs still, however I haven't had these problems. But WB Montreal did rush this so it doesn't surprise me all too much. Graphics Better than AC, but not by much. They added some fog effects and smart snow to add to the depth and I found it pretty cool and impressive. But that's about it. Graphics are nothing special. Multiplayer This was an absolute wreck at first. Many bugs and it worked literally 1/4th of the time due to never-ending loading screens. You have 3 teams. The Bane gang, Joker gang and Heroes. The two gangs war it out trying to take and protect key points on the map while Batman and Robin try to stop it all by taking either gangs members down and filling a fear meter. The match ends if one gang loses all lives, all points are held for a certain time or Batman and Robin fill their fear meter. Joker and Bane are playable of course. Bane is overpowered though. Able to absorb what seems like 10 full magazines and is equipped with a rocket launcher on top of it. Joker uses his handy pistol and will kill you in one shot if hit. It isn't perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable. Overall Origins is worth the purchase. Both singleplayer and multiplayer are done well. And this will retain some value because of the multiplayer portion. While it can be clunky at times, you can easily overlook it and enjoy every moment. My only complaints are the clunkiness and how empty the map can feel compared to City. Definitely recommended.			"

												When i played this game on console when it first came out i was frustrated because it wasn't nearly as polished as Arkham city or Asylum.but some time later when i got it on PC and gave it another shot i find myself enjoying the game much more. While it's still not as good of quality as the other Arkham games Origins stands on its own feet pretty well and does a good job of showing batman in the earlier stages of his career.You get to encounter plenty of the villian roster here including Black mask, penguin and Bane. As well as some enemies that aren't usually in batman's gallery such as Deathstroke.The devs also did a nice job throwing in some new enemy types weve never seen before such as martial artists and Venom users which mixes things up a bit in combatI never tried the multiplayer component though i heard it was meh and its dead now anyway so moot point there.All in all id say get it if you like batman and are a fan of the Arkham games and their playstyle.

												Batman Arkham Origins...what can I say? Nobody wanted this game when it was announced that original developers Rocksteady were not behind the helm, myself included, but after seeing it on sale I just had to suck up the misgivings and give it a whirl. As it turns out I was extremely pleasantly surprised. This game gives you more access to Batman's iconic arsenal and carte blanche to use it not only on the City's criminals, but also the police force. Yes, that's right, as the Dark Knight of Arkham you get to use your near super human abilities to shatter the bones and bodies of every police man you see. Furthermore, you are even given a mission to infiltrate the Arkham City Police Station, and after a few grumbles from Alfred about toning back the devastating blows when fighting the police, you are then allowed to brutally incapacitate every on duty officer inside the station. The sheer amount of officers you are allowed to perform the ingame ""takedowns"" and ""freeflow combat combos"" on absolutely blows away the miserly amount of cops you could attack in the previous games (note to Rocksteady, the mind controlled security guards in City and Asylum did not satisfy. The fans want to punch REAL cops who are fighting back on their own terms). Overall I'd say this game is one of the best Cop Smashing Games on the market and is a must have for any fans of beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of cops.			"

												maybe this is the review for Arkham Asylum...maybe not.Be the Batman. Use your gadgets to your advantage to get rid of your enemies and remember: Mark Ha... The Joker is your enemy!Wonderfull game btw. One of the best comic book adaptation and lost nothing of his charm.+ cool gadgets+ flawless controls/combat (tried with X360 controller)+ interesting villians with cool background story+ many secrets to unlock - high replayability+ additional value: physyx effects (although back in the days it was not so praised)- no Batmobile (is it even necessary?)

												I really, really wanted to like this game but just couldn't. I could live with the glitches if the game had something new to offer but it doesn't. It feels like a rushed cash in on the previous Arkham games and that's just sad. The decision to do a prequel was a bad one. The map is larger than before but with less interesting things to do. The story had some decent elements but never pulled together as a whole and the final ""boss"" battle was keyboard smashingly insulting. Bring Rocksteady back or don't do another one please guys. 6/10			"

												A very beautiful game with a great story.The game, played from a third-person perspective, focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration.Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins introduces the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game is the first in the series with multiplayer capability. WB Games Montréal took over development duties for Arkham Origins from series creators Rocksteady Studios.Personal Rating: 10/10			"

												Bugs, bugs, more bugs... Fixing the old bugs creates new bugs...  so so many bugs...I love the franchise, this is the only game Ive ever bought before the release.  I wanted to play this game so bad that I overlooked alot of bugs, but then there are the game breakers.  they finally fix those only to have more... Bottom line if you want to play this game I would wait another year or so, hopefully they work out the bugs someday... meanwhile I feel like a total sucker.  Ill still play the game though, so that tells you something...			"

												I can't in good conscience recommend this as a game for PC. As a console game, it would present an enjoyable playthrough. As a PC game, it is clearly a console port - both the game play and graphics are not of the standard I would expect for a quality PC game. Holding multiple buttons to trigger various combos and being unable to separate my run and jump keys (they are both default spacebar) are simple gripes.Having said that, it's not a bad game, and if you are a die hard fan and haven't played Arkham Assylum, then by all means give it a go. I just found the game play far too linear, the storyline predictable, and the gameplay underwhelming. I can't bring myself to finish a single playthrough.			"

												Who says a prequels can't be nearly  as good as the original..  Compared to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, Arkham Origins doesn't skip a beat. great combat, awesome exploration and featuring an all new multiplayer option if you're into that kind of thing..  The story introduces us to The Batman and his humble beginings, trusted by no one but his trusty butler Alfred Batman is tasked with a mission to stop assassins hired by Black Mask to kill him.     The downsides, the joker isn't voiced by Mark Hamill any longer, which in my opinion is a bad thing, Hamill had that perfect voice for the joker which is totally missing from this game.  Another downside seems to be loads of bugs.. I haven't personally experienced any of these bugs but the forums are filled with people having all sorts of audio and video bugs... may be worth checking these out before you make the purchase.With the few downsides this game has I would totally still recommend this game for any comic book aficionado's, fans of beat em up's and people who enjoy donning their  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sheet around their neck and pretending to be a super hero..   Come on we've all done it, and we'll all love this game...  buy it now....			"

												I do wish there was a maybe button on reviews :) Im going to pass this one just due to i think Splash Damage did a good job in a way with this game (Rocksteady Studios made the 2 other Batman games) ;) The only down side is all the BUGS this game! It has more bugs then a plate of rice in the India Heat lol I do like the boss fights they can be pretty challenging at times so +1 on that ! And i like the combat system seems a bit more fluid and faster then the other 2 Batman games.I just wish they would have made a nice uber patch that fixed all the bugs then this game would be so darn good !!!I say if you are Batman Fan Get this game ! If you arent wait till a sale ;)And this will do you till Batman:Arkham Knights comes out!! ($ ROCKSTEADY'S BACK ON THAT ONE!!! $)			"

												I sit on the edge of a building looking down on some criminals on Christmas Eve trying to learn the whereabouts of the Black Mask. These guys don’t have much of a lead but they are up to no good so first I need to drop down and do a little training on a few faces.Origins is the third game from the new Batman series but takes place before the last two. You are basically in the early years of being the bat. You’ll get to see some of the first encounters with some classic villains from the Batman stories we all love. Black Mask has put a $50 million bounty on Batman’s head and you now get the fun and excitement of dealing with all the villains who want that money. Not all is what it seems as you are soon to find out after a little progression and discovery.The games graphics look about the same as AA & AC. Which is a good thing because I love the looks of the characters and environment. I did notice the lip syncing to be off sometimes but no problems there. Voices were all great like usual and I love the music specially the darker tone Christmas stuff.Gameplay is what you expect from the last two games. Use your predator skills for silent takedowns which is always fun. Gadgets galore to use at your disposal. Like the new glue grenades to immobilize an attacker for a short time, or a gun which shoots a wire across to anchor points to be used as a zip line or tight rope. You can also use it to hook criminals to objects or each other.  Many fun times with that one. Other gadgets are your typical batarangs, grappling hook, explosive gel, and some others from the previous games.There’s plenty to do in Gotham this time around with some side stories like Anarky, Deadshot and a few others. Small crimes you can solve which is now done with a cool feature were you can see a reenactment of the crime to discover what happen. A pretty cool feature and should be expanded on later down the line. Then there are the Riddler challenges again, which are just small packages you find throughout the city. Not as cool as the Riddler challenges from the previous game but it does give a little change.Now the combat is what Rocksteady had perfected in the last two games and really made it exciting and fun to get into fist fights with your enemies. It was so fluid and fast and just beautiful to pull off some amazing moves. I’m not sure what happen but WB Montreal seem to screw up the system. Counters don’t seem to work many times and the fighting just did not feel as balanced as usual. It was disappointing and aggravating at times but I still had a blast playing.Batman: Arkham Origins is a wonderful game to play and a great addition to the Batman franchise even despite its small flaws and some bugs I encountered. Like the red screen bug you get when entering the GCPD. Your screen turns red when you enter the rooftop door and then your PC restarts after like 10 seconds. An easy fix as you just have to put the game into windowed mode before entering and you can then go back full screen after that. Just be careful though because one downfall I got was after I beat the game and was almost finished with all side missions I forgot about this bug and got the red screen. When I restarted everything up again I had lost the last 7 hours of gameplay and all my completion stats. Luckily for me I had finished the game before this happened.If the little issues don’t scare you away then pick this up and enjoy the great Batman story and fun.Bear Rating: 7.5/10 "

Overall Opinion: If you enjoyed Arkham City and wanted more of that, or love Batman lore, you'll enjoy Arkham Origins. If not, Arkham Origins offers little value to you.Number Rating: 8/10 WARNING: I highly recommend getting a controller for your PC before buying Arkham Origins, the M&K controls just aren't as fluid Batman: Arkham Origins is definitely the most hated of the Arkham series (not that that's saying much, considering the other 2 are considered amazing), so frankly when I picked this up and saw it had already dropped to $20 in the course of a few months...I was prepared for an awful game that tainted the Arkham series. I'm happy to say, I was wrong. Fans of the series will notice a distinct lack of innovation in Arkham Origins, but at the same time, it's not like WB Games Montreal ""ruined"" any of the mechanics. Plus the game does take quite a few steps forward, all though to varying degrees of success. The best way I can describe it is, while Arkham City and Asylum were both revolutionary in many areas, Arkham Origins just evolves their formula slightly. PC Port: Running the game on a GTX 660, everything maxed out (including PhysX) and FXAA High enabled, I was getting a stable 60fps and above for most of the game. A few areas and fights (especially one fight with Bane on a rooftop) I noticed some drops but nothing too bad.  The FoV is just fine, really nothing to complain about. Runs solid and looks solid. My only issues would have to be the stuttering when you first boot up the game as Unreal 3 loads in the rest of the world, and the sudden changes to pre-rendered footage at times.Visuals: The game maintains that dark Arkham feeling, as the snow comes down on Gotham on Christmas Eve. It looks great, in a gloomy kinda way. The Nvidia effects in the game are really nice looking, smoke moves out of your way as you pass by, paper and money flies around in fights, and Batman himself looks really well detailed. It's quite impressive for an Unreal 3 game, but it's still obvious this is Unreal 3 and that engine is aging. Textures will pop in at close distances and that can look pretty bad at times. Also, there are some odd animations when characters talk in game, especially Alfred. Hard to explain, but it just looks...wrong.   However, I have to say I believe this is probably the best looking Unreal 3 game to date. And with Arkham Knight being made in Unreal 4, I think this IS the best looking Unreal 3 game we'll get. Story: Wow...the story in this game is actually really good! After the rather strange ending to Arkham Asylum, and cluttered mess of a story that happened in Arkham City (not saying I didn't like them, but their stories weren't exactly the selling point of the game) I didn't expect much from this game. Especially when I heard Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy would not be making an appearance as the Joker and Batman in this game, unlike in Arkham City and Asylum. However, to my surprise both actors that replaced them do a great job, especially Troy Baker's Joker. The story manages to be just as chaotic as Arkham City, while having a central goal: Track down the assassins. And it's delivered very well. The game is more of a origin story for Joker and Batman's relationship though, instead of Batman himself. And it's quite neat to see the first time Batman and Joker have that ""connection"", where they realize they were in some odd way, meant to meet. I have to say, I was very impressed with this story, and there were some truly emotional moments in it. All though it is pretty predictable at times, there are still a good chunk of twists that keep the story moving at a good pace. Also, I really enjoy how tough and angry this Batman is compared to the more experienced and calm Arkham City and Asylum Batman. Arkham Origin's Batman is the type of guy that leaves some criminal hanging on top of a building, then comes back to the guy in a police station, just to beat him up again. Gameplay: Batman: Arkham City 2.0 basically. There are some neat additions, such as the ability to use your zipline to attach enemies to each other, or throw fire extinguishers at them. However, other than that gameplay is identical. They did add in a more advanced crime scene investigation detective mode, but it's only used maybe 3-4 times total, and most of the time you're just looking for the red arrow instead of actually figuring out what happened yourself. This mechanic is pretty awesome in the Deadshot side mission, but since at E3 2013 they showed it off already, it kinda spoiled the whole expereince of that side mission. Setting: Part of Gotham City, the bat cave, and Black Gate prison are the locations the game takes place in, all on Christmas eve. The world feels VERY similar to Arkham City. The northern part of the map (or Old Gotham) is basically straight out of Arkham City, Wonder Tower is even in the center of it. That doesn't change the fact the setting works really well for the game, it's just a bit of a shame to not see them try to expand Gotham besides adding in an absurdly long bridge and a little bit of land in the south. Plus, citizens are just no where to be seen. There is a curfew going on which could explain it I guess, but it just makes the world feel lifeless. Music: Just making this a category from now on in my reviews. So the music is great, it keeps with the whole dark and heavy tone the Christopher Nolan Batman movies soundtracks have. Also, whoever decided to have that remix of ""Carol of the Bells"" as the Joker's main theme...kudos to you.

I'd definitely recommend picking it up in the upcoming Fall sale. Also, anybody see the new Arkham Knight footage? HOLY CRAP! 2015 just can't get here fast enough.			"

												When developing a prequel, make sure the game doesn't take place before the QA team has tested it.  The developers of Batman: AO apparently had one goal: If it isn't broken, fiddle with it until it is.  They took Batman: AC, and managed to break every single aspect of the game in some way or another.  The bugs are innumerable and the developers publicly stated that they would not be fixing any so they would have more time to work on the DLC.  Seriously?Where to start...Batman occasionally glitches out while gliding in the air like he's bouncing off a platform and actually gains elevation while doing so.  I've gotten stuck on ledges, in objects, and been teleported to my destination when stuck while grappling.  Enemies will sometimes teleport to their fallen companions after being alerted in stealth rooms.  The graphics somehow received a significant downgrade despite including additional eye candy that AC doesn't have along with facial animations from 15 years ago.  It also includes new performance problems that cause the game to stutter badly when flying around the city and in certain rooms indoors.  Side quests regularly break with fights getting stalled or being unable to continue mission steps in the city.  Combat timing feels off with counters being harder to pull off than they should be, and a couple times I had enemies attack me from so far away that even though I had a counter indicator, Batman would ready a gadget rather than countering.  This is made worse by the game wildly varying the timescale during combat.  I've read about some major progression-blocking bugs as well but luckily I never ran into any.Then come the design problems.  The map has no mouse support and the keyboard moves the cursor in very large increments making it very difficult to select specific locations (I know this won't affect many players but it's inexcusable for the map to be that hard to use with kb/m.)  The game has a lengthy tutorial laboriously explaining the basics but afterwards assumes you have already played the previous games and does not explain anything until after you've failed the first time.  The game includes way too many cutscenes and at several points in the game will drop you back into the game only to have you press one button before starting another cutscene.  Most of the bossfights are long and tedious and a few rather frustrating - none feel well-designed.  During one fight, after one of the frequent in-game cutscenes the boss recovered and hit me before the game gave me control back.  Riddler has been copy-pasted into the game as Enigma except with less personality and extremely simplistic puzzles.  The game includes less interesting characters overall and half the story feels like a rehash of AC.  The new challenge system is strictly linear and will only let you attempt one at a time and most can only be completed in story missions which makes it extremely difficult to complete in one playthrough.  Many ledges are ungrappleable for no reason other than to artificially make it more difficult to reach that location.  Oh, and it seems Batman hasn't learned how to punch through plywood yet despite having more gear than AC and acting like The Hulk the whole game.The only good thing I found in the game is that you unlock certain gadgets and abilities through side missions, rather than all through the story.  The new martial arts master enemies are pretty interesting as well, though they can make fights a bit unpredictable due to the variable way they react to attacks and counters.So in summary, they took AC, made every part of the game worse, added a big pile of bugs, and released AO.  Play AA and AC instead or wait for AK.  Save your sanity, I already lost mine.			"

												Take everything I say with a grain of salt, since I received this game for free (came with my graphics card).It is a broken game. The mechanics are ~simple~ yet there are moments where you will die, and there isn't much you can do about it. I know that sounds lame, but even with a ton of practice, there isn't much to gain.The consistent crashes don't help. I have a fairly new high end rig, and this game crashes every 30-45 minutes or so, which is unacceptable. Hopefully some patches are released at some point.Considering what I've written, I can't logically recommend a game at this price with this many problems.			"

												Was one of my favs when I originally completed it but after recently replaying both Arkham Asylum, City and Origins, this reminded me of how much more polished the combat system is. For one you don't get hit mid animation so much. A lot of what Arham Origins did right too was what was imported into Arkham Knight in this area. The shock gloves are one of Batman's best gadgets in Origins and the Cold Cold Heart DLC a great episode about Mr Freeze.I luv the intensity of Batman in this. The boss battles were full on and I'd have to say unmatched.If you're a Batman fan, make sure you don't miss this entry in the Batman Universe, this is as good as any of the main Arkham entries.			"

I Am the NightTake on the Batman's established experience after and during the Year One story arc (since the game is inspired by it, not a direct page-to-screen copy of it). You get a shining moment in the early night outings as the Batman, with his Rogues Gallery to-be and some new rudimentary Bat-gadgets. The story is an endearing one when understanding why Batman kept his promise. Alfred Pennyworth has to be the best highlight of the evening though. Talk to him, you won't regret it! Once again, all his flush and paned out as with all the Batman games in the series. Villains' personalities are thoroughly engrossing, but especially Joker's (check out The Killing Joke, you'll see). Don't forget the Cold, Cold Heart and Initiation DLC, both of which further develop the Batman villains and origins respectfully. Among all this comes an interesting multiplayer where you can play as Batman or Robin, Bane's gang and Joker's gang (Bane and Joker included)! Batman Arkham Origins is a thorough origin story of its own merit, one with first appearances and references to villains you'll enjoy. For the most precise penning, I direct you to the comics. Though this game should not be evaded for its accuracy to those comics. Besides, it's Batman!			"

												Poor example of a game, I have found several gliches that make it unwinable in spots, like suspects not presenting a prompt to be interogated, interogations not being logged/recognized by the game, and Interogation targets despawning before they can be interacted with. All in all it's meh, seriously I've tried reloading, restarting, dying, rebooting, the guys are always gone and I can't finish the Bird questline now. The games Idea of a new game plus is a harder dificulty, not just getting to re play everyhting knowing what to do and being able to complete the one quest it broke, which I also found out broke the Riddler questline as well. I don't play for challange usually, and I like having my open world games to have a sense of closure, which this lacks for me at the moment, also I find the abbrupt inclusion of several enimies attacking silmultaniously with unblockable attacks to be a poor choice for a harder difficulty, by far the brawls in the harder modes are near impossible without the shock gloves which unlock about mid story, making the starting portions increadably hard when faced with several kinife and shield weilding, armored and blocking foes. So it's good for one playthrough, and if it gliches like mine did you have to make a new save file and re-collect everythingm which I will not be doing.			"

												This game is a nice chapter in the Arkham series. The gameplay runs smoothly and the graphics are great.Lots of side quest, a bit repetitive though,  classic Enigma puzzles, detective missions.. One of the major improvements is how fluid the combat is in this one, and finally a quick travel to move around different parts of the city. The only thing I din't like much was how the plot goes from here to there and it gets really confusing at some points, it lacks focusing.A must have for every Batman fan, though the story is not as good as in previous games.8/10			"

Arkham Origins in 2016I got this product during the WB Games Sale a few days back and this is my second playthrough of the game (played the retail version a year or two back and now I'm playing via Steam). First off, the single player campaign has a good story and this is my second favorite Batman Arkham game after Arkham City. The graphics and gameplay mechanics have visibly improved, compared to the earlier games in the series and some of the villains (Deadshot, Deathstroke and especially Bane) have pretty interesting ""origin"" stories (if we can call them that) before Batman meets them again in Arkham City. You'll know what I'm saying when you play the two games. Continuity of the overarching universe has been kept in mind (though the addition of new gadgets and modes of travel in a ""prequel"" story, that don't exist in Arkham Asylum or City clearly breaks that continuity, lol). Some other villains were pretty meh to play against though, IMO. (like, Copperhead, Killer Croc and to some extent, Shiva).Apart from the single player story, I should also add that playing as Deathstroke in the challenge maps is immensely satisfying.Where it gets boring and somewhat dreary is the ridiculous amount of Riddler side-quests (as usual) that you must do in order to unlock the fast travel points on the map (the map is pretty expansive and after a while, you wouldn't want to glide, grapple, dive bomb to your destination from a totally opposite side of the map).Coming over to Arkham Origins Online now.After checking out the training videos, I must say that I am impressed with the concepts of Invisible Predator Online and Hunter, Hunted but the number of players online is pretty low. I can understand why that is the case after being part of a full lobby and about to get into a match, I come across this - ""Connection to Steam has been dropped."" It gets pretty frustrating sometimes but during the times that I DID manage to get in, it's fun. Batman, Robin, Joker and Bane are playable characters. Also, Joker and Bane have their own Elite factions (made up of real players themselves) that have to focus on completing a given objective. Not getting into the details since the training videos that you'll see are pretty self explanatory.Will be updating this review with time, if need be.And BTW, here's a secret: Bruce Wayne is Batman..

Oh dear!I played all of the Arkham series' games so far, knew this wasn't made by Rocksteady, came in with low expectations and really didn't intend to review like ""Oh, this is the reason, why Rocksteady made it all better..."" - but sadly, it turns out to be like this. And you cannot only blame the time limit or tight budgets: Someone really didn't get it at all and I am really shocked one is capable of ♥♥♥♥ing up such a wonderful game so badly.in shortThe main criticism and a heavy one is, that besides an absolutely lame patch work of a story (which is forgiveable), you are forced to do anything the way the game designers want you to. Choice is completely gone and to top that up, the game mechanics are horribly messed up. The first game ever, I vote down - not that it is the worst game ever, but starting from Arkham City it is the worst bootleg, I have ever had to play. Don't buy it and play another round of Batman AC instead!in detailstoryWhen reps of Warner were questioned about the lack of new stuff in the game, they responded by ""Oh, but the story - so amazing twists!"" Now, we know for sure, this was a standard marketing phrase and nothing else: The story is non-existent and the ""twist"" doesn't matter at all and it just shows that someone had no clue about story-telling whatsoever. AC had a carefully crafted story there the twist was shocking and turned the story upside down and up again. Here, it just loosely connects the Combat and Predator maps. The introduction of some of the side missions is especially bad: Either it is a glitch and just some audio missing or it goes like: ""Oh, I have to do X and Y now, in order to achieve Z!"" - completely out of the blue, by just passing areas, w/o logical connection to it. The same goes for the (very short) main story.side questsThis was the only downside to Arkham City, because most of them were really forgettable and in this respect AO is stronger (by sacrificing the main story for it). They are not as ""cinematique"" as the Cold Call Killer or Tea Party in Wonderland, but they are far superior over the rest of the AC's ones and I like the way the Anarky mission combines gliding and combat skills. gameplayThis is the most important, but also the worst part of this game and the reason why it is so unenjoyable. I would forgive everything else, but this is the main reason for voting it down:The combat mechanics are awful; especially concerning enemy AI's strikes: Sometimes (unlike both AA and AC), they withdraw a strike and you end up loosing the combo because of countering thin air. Also, it seems like you can (hardly) evade over red and yellow strike alert flashes: In AC I could strike an enemy even while he flashes yellow or evade a red one (unless armed, which you can strike), this doesn't work here.The special combo moves ""trigger"" only in a far smaller area around the enemy and hence you have to be far more precise. In addition to that, if you choose the wrong special combo, there is no automatic replacement (unlike AC, where a Disarm & Destroy turned into a Special Combo Takedown, etc., if the opponent was unarmed).On Predator, enemies are more sound aware than before, some of the chambers have an interesting design. Generally, there is a greater quantity of enemies in the Single Player campaign. In the Challenge maps, it is like in AA and AC.Deathstroke plays like a combination of Robin and Nightwing and is horribly underpowered in Predator as well as in Combat Challenges - not a nice experience.The Shock Glove is the game's combat novelty. Due to its non-permanent nature, it is rather a plus than a minus to the game and one doesn't have to use them, if you wanna play ""old school"".The new kid on the Predator block is the Remote Batclaw: Well, we didn't really need it, but I guess more useful than  Nightwing's Escrima sticks.What makes this claw so bad, is the navigational aspect to it: It replaces the Line Launcher and the Tight Rope completely and thus forces the player to use the intended path and no other! I could line-launch anywhere I wanted to - no more! As well, if there was a ladder and a grappling spot in AA or AC, I could use both options. In AO again, the game forces you to  use the predescribed method. You cannot grapple freely at all and sometimes for absolutely no reason and w/o explanation, the level design changes. Particulary, I am thinking about a mini campaign styled side quest, where Predator comes first and Combat therafter and from one second to the other, after the cut scene, the gargoyles are gone!Why, why the hack don't you let it be the players's choice, whether he wants to engage a small combat map in a Predator like style or vice versa? - This made AA and more so AC so enjoyable: That I had so many chocies.And Firefly! How can you turn away the opportunity to having the ultimate Predator challenge with a boss capable of using high ground and turning sneaking into a nightmare? Instead, it's just a Poison Ivy and Joker AA type of fight combined with cut scenes. The other assassins aren't much better: Either, a Harley Quinn's Revenge/Catwoman & Twoface type of Predator challenge or a non-existent fight by simply using Quickfire Gadgets (2 assassins). One fight was more or less completely scripted, but ok since it just happened once. In AC, I could play the game ""the hard"" or the relaxed way, however I wanted it to. Here, they are desperately trying to make the game harder than AC by not permitting certain options or putting more enemies out there.Another aspect of this is the completely messed up XP progress tree, which seems not to understand the subtle mechanics of AC: What's the point in unlocking basic upgrades only after half way/two thirds into the game? Isn't that again my own choice - or not?The new type of enemies aren't bad, though too much of the same. I like the Martial Artists; nice evolution of the Female Assassin of AC. The Enforcer is like an AC lieutenant and more combo breaking than that.  Preferred the Roman Abramovic Twin's gameplay mechanics.The lovely Riddler questions are gone (too complicated and love to detail would be needed) and are replaced by Anarky Tag's, which is another mere Collectible.graphics/designCheapish compared to AC. More ain't always better and this counts especially for AO: AC was carefully crafted and you could see the love and detail. Especially the colour scheme was amazing and left you marvelling in a bright phantasy world. AO drowned now in an uninspired shade of grey. Like playing AC on lowest settings w/o any special effects to it. The special flair to each district is gone and grappling points aren't clear at all (i.e. some water towers work, some don't).One area around the electricity company with a non-grapple zone was nice though.The tab menu is horribly complicated now and stuffed with cryptical icons lacking any explanation (mouse hovering/clicking not possible) - again, for no reason.bugs/techmany minor bugs and glitches as in premature triggering of events (Case File A's second task triggered before the first one), some keys don't work properly (i.e. turning off the Cryptographic Sequencer). There are also some critical bugs which freeze the game completely (not sure, whether game or Steam overlay related). final verdictBuy only on a at least 75% off sale, if you really wanna play this game. You don't miss anything.			"

												I wouldn't believe the reviews that said this game was mediocre, so I bought it. I'm sorry to report that most reviews were pretty accurate. This game does a diservice to the franchise and to the oustanding job Rocksteady did in the previous installments. Somehow, the new developer managed to screw up the most important aspect of an Arkham game: The flow of movement and combat with unresponsive controls, forced camera perspectives and limited grappling points. The main story is boring and so are the side missions. Most of the technical problems reported were fixed by the developer, but there are a few kinks here and there (that weren't in the last two games).			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins delivered fun gameplay with enchanced or better controls of combat system. It has beautiful graphics with DX11-Enabled which you should turned it on to get better scenery, if your settings has DirectX 11. Last but not least, the storyline! The storyline deliver everything about Bruce Wayne becoming less-refined Batman and the first event where Batman encountered Joker. I give nine out of ten!			"

												This game is great!I have played both previous versions and enjoy everyone of them.  Arkham Origins is far bigger than its predecessors, and plays pretty much the same.  I found the story mode a lot better than Arkham City, and a lot longer than Arkham Asylum. The mission path is easier to fulfill and i never really strayed.   Completing the game was easier to do than leaving untouched missions as i did in City.  However one thing that got on my nerves was the combat sequence.  The mechanics are great, but begun to get repetitive and became quite a chore.   Even so the rest of the gameplay was great and collecting all the collectables seems to be a lot better to seek out than Arkham City.   One new feature that wasn't in the previous installments is the crime scene investigations.  This feature is great, and like the whole sequences it plays out.  Unfortunately there wasn't many of them to do, more of these and less combat would of been great.I have given the challenges a go but find this crazy repetitive when going from one challenge to another.  Nothing really keeps me wanting more in this mode.  Just get more frustrated when you miss the counter and the combo counter resets, gggrrrrrr!Anyhow i recommend anybody who has played Batman Arkham City or Asylum to give this a go, its got all the goodness from previous installments and graphically is really good.7.5/10 "

												Arkham Origins is, unfortunately, sort of the black sheep of the Arkham Games. What with it not being made by Rocksteady while they worked on Arkham Knight, Origins was put out by Splash Damage Studios instead. And it is, to some degree, underrated. While Arkham Asylum was excellent and Arkham City was good, Origins falls further behind and winds up in the realm of ""Better than average"", but it is still decent. Everything you liked about Arkham Asylum or Arkham City is still here, mostly. The problem is that Origins somewhat coasts off the success of the Asylum and City, and suffers from a lack of any new cards to throw down.On the gameplay front, combat has been improved once again, but it's gotten around to where it has inevitably become repetitive. And the entire map does feel somewhat lazily designed, as no less than half of it is copied over from Arkham City, right down to the Steel Mill section. Side missions are also making their return, although not quite as much of a spectacle. What is new is the crime scene missions, which are a welcome addition using Batman's crime reconstruction technology, although the number of them makes them go on a bit too long and a bit too short each to be truly entertaining. Boss fights haven't been copied, but as a result they're worse than City or Asylum and fail to do anything as impressive as the Mr. Freeze fight from City. Hunting down Deadshot and Riddler are also almost exactly the same from the previous games. Really, on the gameplay side, there isn't much to talk up. It's basically an expansion for Arkham City.The story is where Arkham Origins finds a good place. Asylum played much more like a comic book and did quite well in its niche, but City tried to take a darker turn without changing Asylum's formula of ""Villain X is doing Y. Go to location Z and beat them up"", and therefore suffered for anyone who tried to take it seriously. While Origins doesn't do much to shake that up that formula, it actually explores the relationships of both Batman and one of his biggest enemies, which both its predecessors failed to do. The character arcs affect the plot much more than they did in the previous games, and so with that, Origins takes that successful dark step up that City tried to take but misstepped somewhat. The main plot thread does hop back and forth between side stories a bit too much, but it's not that noticable, and its enjoyable while it lasts. The voice actors also do a very good job filling the shoes of their predecessors, and one villain's VA who I won't mention did such a fantastic job that I didn't realize until halfway through the game that the character's actor had changed.If you liked the previous Arkham games, you'll find pretty much everything you liked here, and maybe something you haven't seen before as well. That being said, while Origins doesn't do anything that made me want to punch the developers in the face, it didn't make me want to sing their praises either. There's nothing really new it can bring to the table, although it does make better developments in the story department by making characters more three-dimensional and making them more important to the plot. I'd pick it up on a sale if you aren't 100% convinced, but Origins isn't not worth your time, and it does no dishonor to the name of the Arkham franchise.			"

""Nice of you to drop in Bats!""This is the 1st Arkham Game in the series. (Chronological Order) Released in October 2013. Being the first game, it  serves as the Action-packed Origin Story where (A Fresh from Training.) Bruce learns many new skills and meets many vital characters in the Arkham Storyline! (Note that this is Rocksteady's adaptation so it will be different to any origins or sagas from the comics! This is a Videogame Dammit!)Also i wont Spoil anything from the story here because im reviewing overall content and mechanics, not specific parts of the plot. You can find a neat summary on the games page for this. ;)


Time to Return to the Darkness, we are not Appreciated here.. 
A Screenshot of Batman™: Arkham Origins
By: Jaeger




Without further ado, lets get to the Black and the White, the Strengths and the Reserved Judgement that is the...Pros and Cons.PROS:+Pointy Bat-ears Strike Fear into Dumb thugs! xD+The Plot is done in such a way that its almost episodic and gives each character a balanced time in the spotight! (Before being beaten up by Batman.) Lots of new enemies are introduced especially, their origins are also given an arkham game spin. This is the origins game of the series and revelas lots and lots about the people of gotham! No spoilers here but there are many plot twists and interesting turns for the story, though they  could take a while to be revealed.+Graphics are good for the time, couldnt ask for more here. Its what you would expect from 2013, nothing more, nothing less. Lots of little effects like snowfall and chilled breaths give gotham a true Christmas feel.+His Cowl+Snowflakes=<3+Bigger Map Size which is surprisingly dense with activities. It expands on Arkham Cities map and adds south gotham to The North, connected by the gotham pioneer bridge. Gliding across the snow capped rooftops of The Major Areas of Gotham is a really unique feeling. Especially for a Batman game.+Collectibles will keep any gamer busy for at least a few days! (Maybe too many...)+The Boss battles are Balanced and shouldnt take too long to complete. Although many of them use repeating sequences, they will be beaten quickly so its not too much of a problem!+The Origins of the Characters are generally really well done! If you cant see this game as a big new entry to the series, you can at least view it as a backstory to other games in the series. (As it is the First.) Bruce's story about developing into a more solid and refined figure of justice is given to us in an immpressive way. The Pacing of the plot is done well, but you are reminded often that this is far from a cinematic experience. I wouldnt imagine seein this as a film at all (Which is probably for the better.)+Many new Features to gameplay include: Enhanced Detective Mode with the ability to ""rewind"" scenarios, new gadgets and interface additions. (Keep in mind that he gets all of these NEW features before Arkham Asylum!!)+It has Added Multiplayer for the first time! I've tried it only a few times so i cant say much but it does have some good modes and progression. But im betting people will buy this for the story, combat and thrill of being Brucey boy!+Story is about 12-16 hours without touching on any of the other fun Activities! This is definetely long enough for gamers and it is the average length for the Arkham games too, so thats good!+Once again, the combat system is done so well, its just so smooth! It seems like Batman is just dancing at some points, he feels in the zone at some times! Although, saying that, the targetting can get a bit off a completely ruin a huge combo..The Combat system is simple enough to understand quickly but complex enough to put major effort into strining together some Badass combos! The Mechanics of Hand to Hand (To Gadget too!) Combat in the Arkham Games are a true marvel of third person Action games, and many games (Of the same genre) have tried to dupicate aspects that stood out. Watch some gameplay of challenge maps if you still arent convinced. (I do wish there was a mode where a comic balloon would pop out and say Kapow! or Wack! with every few punches and kicks. ;D)Cons:-Its Riddled (See what i did there) with bugs and even some crashes at times. Although the main offender is frame drops in graphically busy sequences. These are minor issues but people have been known to have much worse. Obviously on Launch there was some Large problems that arose, but they were quickly patched by Rocksteady. (Every game will have issues on launch! just depends how much coverage they get really!)-A Gloomy Gotham leads to Brightness issues and an annoying fog thats makes it hard to see long distances.-Mission objectives often include much Backtracking, Many Dull Dialogue scenes and timed sequences that seem far to easy to the average gamer.-Linear Environment around the City. Like Doors that you cant open at all, Blank and boring walls, Slow Animations and No Miscellaneous Interactive objects to find!-Repetitive boss battles! The Deathstroke one is the worst offender!its really only3 different Counters and then a simple beatdown for one of the best mercenaries in DC!? A Skillful Meta-human gets given this disgraceful Repeat of actions? Quite sad really. Boss battles actually have variation between each major VIllain, taking a new apporach to defeat them really uses all of Batmans Skill and Gadgets. However i felt that they were generally better in the other Arkham Games.-The New detective mode has difficult controls and slows down the story a bit too much at times. You know  exactly where B is but you havent found the right Clues  to find A beforehand... The Hiding of Evidence is a bit too easy as well.Give us a bigger Challenge Rocksteady!-The Pacing was a bit strange as well! After a huge boss battle, it would be nice to follow up and see how alfred is doing (And join him for a cuppa!) and fix up your suit right? Instead you will get a call from Enigma and will have to deactivate some bombs straight away! Ignore the fact that Batman is a human being and even he has a bedtime! He must have adrenaline built into the suit...-The Plot would have been better with some emotional scenes or bonds built with certain figures even!A Sequence about Bruces life, A flashback to when he is training on a mountain. This comes back to pacing and where the story is going...It does have Lots of Plot twists!-Among others, Bane is a very different Character, same as many villains. Although this can be excused due to origins and all that. Some Personalities or even costumes for Batman's Foes were a bit of a strange choice. But then again, i read the old school comics so i keep comparing their personalities, etc.-Some Gadgets you will hardly use outside of missions and thir uses were too specific to stand out as a true Batman Toy. The Electrical Charge or disrupter (Although useful for armed thugs!) will never match the various functions of the Grapple hook or the Remote-Batarang.-The Colour theme seems dull compared to the other games i the series, this is obviously due to the season and the industrial design. But interiors should be more plentiful and have more Variety too!


Meta-Human Revealed!

Final ThoughtsOverall I give this Plot-Packed Arkam experience a 7/10!Light on the New Features and Colours, but heavy on the Origin stories and Combat (Once again) this is a must-by for Batman lovers, just to see Rocksteady's take on the Caped-Crusader's rough side...and the familiar line up of Villains that we all know and love. Athough it does have numerous technical Issues and repetitve missions that will be noticeable.Don your Cowl and Gadget Belt, and Glide into this Super-hero Experience Today!Dont forget to Leave a comment if i missed anything important in this game! Now if you'll excuse me, some Thugs are clipping through walls...-Kyle "

												8.5/10Better than Asylum, not as good as City.As an origins story, the plot does justice to the Batman universe and as a prequel to Arkham Asylum. The fight mechanism is  similar to all games in the franchise but the boss fights are taken up a notch and are made as unique to each super villain as possible. The detective sequences wherein Batman has to find clues and understand what happened at a crime scene are also much more fun than in the previous games, this time making it slightly more engaging. The plot thins a bit when entering the killing all the assassins part just because they were paid to kill Batman. Bit repetitive but the fights are really cool, so this can slide. All in all, a pretty damn good game. Although Troy Baker did a pretty good job as the voice actor for the Joker, many sequences will show you why Mark Hamill is undeniable the best man for the job.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is third game in Batman series. This time around we get to play a prequel to the very first game (Batman: Arkham Asylum). Even though Origins are not developed by Rocksteady, it's still great Batman game. Only big downside are really annoying bugs and glitches. Some of them are straight up game breaking. Besides that, i had awesome time with Batman: Arkham Origins. I did not feel repetitivness at all.So as a wrap up, it's a great Batman game, but it hasn't topped Batman: Arkham City. Would i recommend it? Yes, of course.			"

												If you're a fan of the Batman video games, you will still enjoy this. It's not really a bad game, it just has a bunch of bugs and issues, and I'd like to say there are less than there were on release day, but I think I've actually encountered more on my 2nd playthrough which was just recently. The story in this game isn't bad, and actually a few times it has great writing and dialogue. Other times, it really doesn't seem right, it's sort of a mixed bag, in my opinion. Some of it didn't feel right to me, but overall it was decent. Out of the 3 Batman games out right now, this was my least favorite, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. The whole 8 assassins part is what was misleading about this game. You would expect to fight all 8 in the campaign, which isn't the case. Some are side missions, and even as side missions, they're very short and unsatisfying. This could have been much better, much better indeed. I could probably say a few more things, but overall, you get the idea at this point. If you enjoy Batman, pick this up, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale. If you're new to the series, definitely start with Arkham Asylum, followed by Arkham City, and save this one for last.			"

												How do I put this in the most easy form of review possible... It's a batman game. If you haven't played any newly released batman games, they're glorified QTE simulators. Don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing. But with AI like I've seen, this ""Triple A Game"" has so many errors it's incredible. It's unoptimized to the point of Geforce Experience's ""Optimized Setting"" lagging the hell out of my 780Ti, to start out. The flying (gliding?) mechanics are glitch-prone, and overused. If you don't activate the fast-travel stations around the map, you're stuck grappling to rooftops and gliding slowly over gotham, spending 3+ hours just traveling to the various spots on the map. The AI are hyper-sensitive to everything around them, and if they even  glimpse a pixel of your cape across the room, they'll automatically start shooting. The fighting mechanics, while unique, are also quite broken. You're able to counter attacks from across the room, and the AI are apparently able to attack you no matter where you are in the room, as long as it shows that they're about to hit you. I spent hours on the first QTE boss, and lost several times just due to him zooming to my point on the map, no matter how I dodged. It's a fun game, edgy and batman-y, no matter it's flaws. I come back to it after playing other games, but I got it for free with my graphics card. Please, for the love of god, don't buy this game.			"

												Batman's consistently made the shadows his associate, however in Batman: Arkham Origins, he finds the shadow of his own past beguilements difficult to escape from. It's like Batman: Arkham City from numerous perspectives, having gotten a remarkable battle framework, regardless it needs beguiling thoughts of its own, and it's slant the loss of the clean and exactingness that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum exceptional development entertainments. Its name, ""Arkham Origins,"" is a ludicrous misnomer - it might be a prequel, yet this story is neither about Arkham, nor is it a beginning story in any essential way. It's extensively more a common Batman plot that retreads a parcel of The Dark Knight's most unmistakable subjects over its around eight hours of focal story content: a self-dangerous complement on working alone, and how far he'll go to abstain from completing a nearness - an idea the last fight wisely toys with. It's a respectable plot that even thinks about a conceivable elucidation behind Batman to face such a combination of delinquents all in one night – a $50 million wealth on his head. In any case, it's the sort of prequel that hollers ""What were we accepting when we butchered off that staggeringly clearly comprehended character? Change! Change!"" This more lively Batman beginning now has all his check moves and mechanical gathering, flies some plane, and is on a first-name present with in every way that really matters every misrepresentation beside The Joker. So at the cost of truly offering these occasions happen going before the other two preoccupations, Origins keeps the establishment of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City's stunning battle set up, joining each device alive and well. (Mr. Keep's nonattendance from the revolt's show surmises the cryo-explosives are immediately control blackout or paste shots.) Two new adversary sorts switch it up, broadly the military powers who can counter your assaults. Regardless, the principal amazing change is an uncommon little something that is splendid shockingly you utilize it, however rapidly uncovers itself as a dreadful thought. The Shock Gauntlets are among the last mechanical gathering you open, which is inconceivable, in light of the way that once charged (by hitting a couple people in solid battle) and actuated, they let you completely expel everything that makes battle intriguing. Revolt shields, daze twirly doos, defensively secured offenders – Batman just punches them. They're on an exceptionally essential level a win get, and the sort of thing that doesn't work in a prequel in light of the way that why may Batman ever dispose of them? By then, in the stealth battles where Batman picks off furnished criminals one by one, there's another to some degree unsanitary feeling win get: a remote associate that strings convicts without them in spite of walking around a mammoth. I got myself intentionally keeping up an imperative partition from both of those contraptions, since I'm not in this to not battle blameworthy gatherings. Out in the extended and snow-secured open world, I discovered Gotham City delightful yet lethargic. In Arkham City, the reason is that this some parcel of town has been walled off and given to the wrongdoers. Without that (in fact stunning) situation, the nonappearance of any comprehension of non military staff life makes Gotham feel horrifyingly vain, particularly near to Origins' open-world partners and their populated lanes. It might be the point of convergence of the night on Christmas Eve, yet roads swarming with just unequivocally un-cheerful lawbreakers are still abnormal. For visual characteristic, the new wrongdoing scene examinations are staggering, and take the ""zoom and upgrade!"" saying to new extremes. Utilizing the shoulder gets the opportunity to clean through an extended reality diversion of occasions looks amazing, yet it's specific scarcely common; whatever you do is locate the going with (sign: the thing's highlighted for you) when influenced and assess it to get the going with bit of the confound – no vital organization included. It's a transcendent, showier utilization of Detective Mode than Asylum or City considered, yet meanwhile, it's only for appear. Precisely when utilizing the Wii U Gamepad, you're supported (however not obliged) to utilize the LCD as a viewfinder and control the essential individual point of view camera with the improvement controls instead of the sticks, which is awkward and gimmicky. This is the central Batman joy to have multiplayer (on all stages with the exception of Wii U), and the eight-player mode feels like a first draft. Generally you're playing an ordinary third-particular shooter in which your three-man hoard goes after zone control focuses with an adversary pack. The turn is that two other self-decisively picked players are Batman and Robin (who doesn't show up in the battle) picking individuals on both sides off utilizing Predator mode moves and a to an exceptional degree ungainly sort of the single-player battle. Frankly, it's a genuinely sharp thought – I do like how when I'm doing fighting different crooks I ought to be unpleasant of a legend sneaking up behind me, and when I'm looking toward the figure of characteristic roosts trying to shoot down a blessed individual a criminal is in all likelihood going to shoot me in the back. In like manner, two sacred individuals taking part can oversee utilizing marvelous Batman-utilizes a-minor-as-a-redirection frameworks. In any case, given the unremarkable shooting mechanics, the multiplayer mode is a peculiarity that I wouldn't plan to get more than a few sessions out of. Wii U proprietors aren't missing much here. Batman distractions take after pizza: in spite of when they're dreadful, they're still extremely exceptional. By Arkham City, Arkham Origins is reasonably a mistake in its nonattendance of new contemplations and utilization of win finds, making it the base interesting of the game plan of three. By and by, as inspirations to jump over into the awesome free-spilling battle and predator takedowns go, this story isn't repulsive.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												As with the other games, Batman: Arkham Origins is an awesome title, a fantastic prequel and the only game in the series with a multiplayer option. The only bad thing about it, is that many mechanics from the single player are directly taken from Batman: Arkham City. Apart from that, they've done a nice job with the multiplayer, which is funny and enjoyable. I give it 5 out of 5.			"

												Frustrating. I have only had a couple of hours gameplay but already it's annoyed me far too much. At first I enjoyed it a little, even though it has none of the same feel that the previous games gave you. But the problem came a couple of hours in. The game suddenly stopped saving my progress (although the saving icon was displayed a lot). I lost out on hours of gameplay and I am not willing to re do them again for nothing. I give up. This problem has been around for over a year according to the boards. Rip off. P*ssed off.			"

												Ничего не ждал от игры,и правльно делал.Игра не лучше,и не хуже предыдущих частей серии,она держится на уровне предыдуещих частей,ведь в эту игру запихнули самое лучшее из Arkham Asylym и Arkham City,нового в игре практически нету,старые локации,и мало новых,в общем получилась такая смесь самого лучшего что было в Бэтмане. Сюжет в игре довольно предсказуем,тебе с самого начала говорят мол ""Вот на тебя охотится 8 наемников,тебе нужно их остановить,и разузнать где находится ""Черная Маска"" И ты действительно всю игру по очереди мочишь этих наемников,и узнаешь где находется главная шишка... Помимо предсказуемого сюжета,в игре очень хорошо рассказана история знакомства со всеми будущими врагами Бэтмана,история расказывает о самых первых годах ""Темного рыцаря"" Бэтман еще не знает таких как ""Пингвин"", ""Бейн"" , ""Пугало"", Убийца-Крок"" и конечно же ""Джокер"" В общем историю знакомства с врагами Бэтмана новые разработчики сделали на УРА!P.S Хочу отметить мультиплеер игры,его я тоже не сильно ждал,но поиграл пару матчей,и очень даже затянуло) много фана получаешь от него,особенно когда ты жертва,а над тобой летает Бэтман и Робин,и ты постоянно думаешь нападут ли они или нет,постоянно вертишься по углам) Командная работа тут очень важна,если ты будешь бегать один,то тебя сразу вынесут,и никакие там гранаты и автоматы тебе не помогут.В общем советую данную игру тем кто хоть немного увлекается вселенной Бэтмана,и особенно тем кто проходил первые 2 части)			"

												I think we've all seen that 7/10 Game of the OK cover for Arkham Oranges before, right? It basically summarizes how I feel.  We all know what we're getting with the combat, and gadgets and such, so that leaves the story and characters to try and stand out from Rocksteady's offerings. First, some pro's:Some of the predator sections really stood out as having great level ""flow"" and the minions eventually learn to shoot down your perches after a while, forcing you to take the fight to the ground.The sections in Blackgate really reminded me of Asylum in the best way possible. Troy Baker's Joker (despite the reliance in the character in general), I thought was great, and Roger Craig Smith was good as a younger Bruce. The standout portion of the game to me was Bane's section. They played up his intellect which creats a real dichotomy with his venom addiction, and made it that much better when Bruce realizes how smart he is and the danger he poses We even get a scene fairly reminiscent of the Knightfall comic, though he does get dumbed down in the end. I think the game was smart to have him take a more central role to the overall plot, but I think it could have been pushed even more.Even moreso, the hotel section of the game, when Bats jumps to save the Joker from falling to his death, was the high point of the game for me story and character-wise. Joker's realization of his relationship with Bats as he talks to Harley reminded me of the short comic Batman: The Deal[moonheadpress.blogspot.ca], which is one of my favorite comics about the two, and I think they really could have had something if they dug into the character like that more.And some things I didn't like as much: The last ""boss fight"" is an anti-climactic joke, and while the psycho Bane fight before it was somewhat unique, it made me feel less like Batman and more like Newt from Aliens.Gordon's speech at the end was laughable, and most of the writing was all around underwhelming at best. Save for one standout section I'll talk about near the end.Outside of Bane, the other assassins are all pretty bunk. Deadshot is a chump with no personality whatsoeverShiva is just a lighter shade of Talia from City, and both her and Deadshot are reduced to side quest chains(even less important than Anarky, even) with no fanfare or pizazz. Croc goes down in the tutorialElectrocutioner is essentially this game's Johnny SasakiThe Slade fight was very well coregraphed, but essentially boils down to a QTE fight. Bane gets multiple fights, with varying strategiesCopperhead is pretty much introduced and defeated in the same scene, but at least the fight was ememies-filling-the-screen fun (the painfully slow stumbling around while poisoned, not so much). Firefly, believe it or not, I think has the best showing aside from Bane. He seems like a real threat to the city and not just Mercenary # 7, and his whole section on the bridge was super fun and diverse, with lots of puzzles, interesting level design, and a pretty spacious predator room. The Suicide Squad tease at the end piques my interest for WB Montreal's whack at a different style of game, and hopefully they can pick some inspired choices for the cast. Overall, a middling Arkham game: 7/10.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Arkham Origins is not a bad game. It was just a disappointment to me and I consider it to be not worth what it costs at the moment.________________________________________________I really really really don't know how to feel about Batman Arkham Origins. First of all I was stoked when I heard about it and preordered it as soon as possible. When I got it I locked myself in my room for the entire weekend and played. That at least was my plan, until a couple of bugs appeared that made it impossible to continue playing. But by now I've finished it thankfully they quickly came up with patches for the PC version and storywise it was a great game. Unfortunately the story couldn't unfold it's entre potential because the game-play just straight away sucked. Batman no longer moves as fluidly, which is especially annoying when having to deal with larger groups of enemies. The freeflow everyone loved in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City has become no more than a painful itch between your buttcheeks. And do I even have to mention the Electrocutioner?Furthermore it felt A LOT like Arkham City. Even the sidemissions were the same. All they really did was to exchange the graphics so it would at least look slightly differentThis game held so many great possibilities, but it's rather poorly made, and I kinda regret having paid 45€ for it. Anyways, playing it was fun, there's a lot about it fans of the franchise will love.			"

												Batman has a long history of escaping from some of the deadliest, most elaborate traps a brilliant criminal mind can devise. In his bat-utility belt is a gadget to get him out of nearly any predicament. But in Batman: Arkham Origins, there's one trap Batman can't escape from: the trap of expectations. By now, there are two things that define action in the Arkham series: rhythmic, free-flow combat and stealthy predator rooms. Arkham Origins has those elements in spades. But it doles them out in a straightforward, predictable fashion that lacks the inspiration of the earlier Arkham games.The most noteworthy difference between Arkham Origins and its predecessors is a significantly larger open world. But that larger world has little meaning when the things you're doing in it are the same things the smaller world of the previous game accommodated perfectly well. Grappling up to rooftops and gliding through the air still feel great, but they don't feel any better here just because you have more rooftops to leap from. And there are side quests that have you doing things like racing to and fro to disarm bombs set by Anarky, which is much like racing to answer Zsasz's ringing phones in Arkham City. The city is bigger just for the sake of being bigger, and while these side quests make interesting use of characters--Anarky's willingness to go to any length to liberate the downtrodden from the oppression of the rich and powerful makes him a fascinating figure, for instance, and the game gives him his due--the things you're doing are exactly the same as the things the previous game had you doing in its open world. Even the crimes in progress, events you can choose to respond to or ignore that come up on the police radio, aren't a chance to protect hapless citizens of Gotham from criminal elements, but just to fight more groups of thugs, something you do plenty of anyway.Free-flow combat is unchanged from earlier Arkham games, aside from the fact that there are a few new enemy types in the mix, most notably a martial artist who has an attack you need to counter twice rather than once. The animations are still excellent, and getting into a rhythm where you're dishing out punishment while perfectly countering every enemy attack still feels good, but it also feels exactly the same as ever. At a certain point in the game, you acquire shock gloves that make your punches more powerful, but this doesn't prevent punching dudes in the face from feeling routine.Predator rooms are also what you'd expect them to be, no less and no more. Of course it's still satisfying to sneak up on a goon and take him down silently, or to be perched on a gargoyle, waiting for a clueless criminal to walk right under you so you can do an inverted takedown. But it's also starting to feel rote. By this point, the mechanics governing these systems have become apparent, the process of sneaking up on enemies or of countering attacks overly familiar. You and Batman and the game he's in are all just going through the motions.8/10 "

												Awesome game. A must play for any fans of the DC universe, or anyone looking for a good action/adventure title to waste a ton of their life in. The rest of the series is just as good, so if you like this one go buy the rest too. This title differs from the rest in the series somewhat, as it's buggy as hell. I once had an issue that put the last riddler informant permanently out of reach and unable to respawn, so I never finished that questline. These issues usually aren't that big of an issue, so I won't give this game a thumbs down just for that, but watch out for issues and back up your saves often.			"

												If you were a fan of the previous two games (Arkham Asylum/Arkham City) then this is a fitting exploration into a prequel of those two titles. The gameplay and mechanics will be very familiar and picked up easily (and the AR gliding tests are much simpler!).If you haven't played the previous two titles, you can still proceed with this and only miss a few of the nods to the earlier releases. Being a prequel it obviously occurs before the events of Arkham Asylum. I personally recommend playing the games in release order due to the tighter controls and graphics each new title brings.There are only a few bugs and glitches still present this long after release. I had to restart the game on multiple occasions to clear up various glitches (ie stuck game/mission progression). Apparenly WB do not see these as fairly substaintial problems, since they are still present even after most were reported around release back in 2013. So some mild frustration is to be expected.Overall this is an excellent step up in the series with some fresh(ish) ideas to reboot the franchise.			"

												Whilst buggy, this game is seriously underated. Most of the hate comes from the large amount of game breaking bugs, which were not removed quickly enough, though at this stage I managed to complete the game only having to restart twice, both of which were not during the story, and I only need to ""restart from last checkpoint"", and not the entire game. [SPOILER ALERT]  The other reason that this game is so hated is because the marketing hinted at a plot that wasn't based around the Joker, and included some smaller members of the rogue gallery as the main characters. Now whilst its not true that some less famous villians are included in this game, its just that the Joker is actually the main villian, along with Bane.  Apart from that, the 'lack of innovation' in this game is the another reason that this game is hated. Whilst in comparison to the other two Arkham Games, that is true, this game has one huge area of innovation: The Multiplayer. Unfourtunately, this was not the audience wanted, so it was largely disregarded. But in fact, the multiplayer is quite fun, and at the time of writing has an active multiplayer community. This is really what I would have wanted from an Arkham multiplayer mode. Stealth against real people. Whilst I will admit playing Batman or Robin is alot more fun than the thugs, there is an equaliser. The fact that at one point in the game, one player will be able to play as the Joker or Bane. This actually can be really challenging for Batman or Robin, especially if the player of the Joker or Bane is good at the game. Of course there is one bug that *still* hasn't been fixed is multiplayer data being wiped. Though by launching the game from singleplayer mode this will prevent this bug, no matter what (from my experience). Some may also have to launch singleplayer again one they are finished, but I haven't experienced this. Now my favourite bit from this game is the Story. Now, obviously some will be dissapointed (see the spoiler) by the plot, but I still think that the story was gold. It was really the first Arkham Game to try to show the flaws in Batman's actions, as he seriously hurts people to stop them hurting others. Some of the corrupt police or common thugs are in desperate positions, and don't have much hope elsewhere, yet Batman will still knock them out cold. Still angered by his parent's death, Batman is demanding, somewhat ungrateful and unable to listen an opinion other than his own, I cringed with every conversation Batman and Alfred had, until the *incident*. Not a single thank you, shouting because Alfred opposed his views, Alfred's relationship with Batman is one of the most heart-breaking of all. The ending was uplifting, and somewhat smart. One pointer is how ubsurd it is how much happens in one night. I'd rate it 7/10, based on the fact Arkham Assylum is a 10/10 for me.			"

IntroductionBatman: Arkham Origins is the third game in an amazing series which combines fun and proactive combat with a massive city full of secrets. If you have already played Arkham City or Asylum then you're getting more of the same, though there are many elements of the game (mainly story and characters) that are different because Origins is a prequel to the series. Plot DetailsYou are The Batman, a highly trained combat expert with an arsenal full of gadgets at your disposal. However, Gotham City doesn't really know about you at this point in time. You go from just a rumor to a full-fledged night vigilante in the space of (what should be) a night. I find it a bit ridiculous to be honest, but hey, that's just my opinion. Basically you become 'wanted' by this guy called Black Mask who puts a pretty impressive bounty on your head and hires assassins to kill you, 10 of them in fact. At first this premise really got me interested, but I didn't feel like the story was carried as well as it could be. Nevertheless, you get to meet some of the most infamous criminals of Gotham in a younger version. It was weird seeing Penguin a little younger than usual. All of this happens on Christmas eve by the way. As you traverse the city, you'll see a lot of snow, christmas trees and assorted lights everywhere. Let's talk more about Gotham shall we?GameplayGotham City is pretty much the same from Arkham City. It's large with various major areas you can travel to. You can decide to grapple and glide everywhere, or you can now fast travel via the batplane. I do appreciate the choice between them both, however the Batplane travel is just a combination of three cutscenes that never vary. I prefer physically going through the city, finding cool grappling spots and just enjoying the game that way. BUt when I simply wanted to get somewhere quickly, the fast travel system helped a lot. The problem I have with the city is that aside from enemies, it is completely empty. Remember the plot? Well it just so happens that there is a supposed curfew in effect for the entire night and so you'll never see a single regular human being anywhere. This is something I had hoped Arkham Origins would have fixed from City, but alas, we have to deal with another lifeless city. Almost any person you see is automatically an enemy because the cops aren't even on your side. The exception to this rule are the people you end up rescuing in various situations. They may thank you and leave, but otherwise they pretty much don't exist.There are quite a few things to do in the city itself. From beating up baddies to finding collectibles, this game will eat away time like acid. Combat is quite satisfying and will involve a lot of countering, utilizing gadgets and changing your strategy to deal with various enemies. Stealth gameplay is quite fun and it's highly entertaining to listen to the voice chatter of terrified enemies. Gadgets give you so many creative ways of taking out, or immobilizing enemies, so no two encounters are ever the same.Now, I dislike doing repetitive things, however there are two things that kept me interested in getting collectibles. Firstly, most of these collectibles are tied to some very creative puzzles. Each one kept me guessing and some of them absolutely blew my mind. However I never once had to pull up a guide to tell me how to solve any of them so most people should be able to get them all with enough time. Secondly, I enjoyed reading the new bits of information I got from each collectible I got. It put more life into the characters and was pretty worth it.There are many other gameplay elements which are worth mentioning but it would make this review too long. VisualsAbsolutely stunning. If your PC can max this out then that's perfect. However this game is very well optimized for even potato PCs.AudioThere are a few new voice actors in this game and while I thought they did their roles just fine, I'd still prefer the originals. Other sounds and music are top quality stuff. Highly enjoyable.SummaryWhile Arkham Origins is a great game in its own right, it feels like the developers missed multiple opportunities to expand the game past the original despite the plot. Arkham City felt a bit lifeless and this game would have done well with some expansion in that regard. Instead, it felt the same, if not worse in that category. However, Arkham Origins is overall more of the same from Arkham City, so if you liked that game, or you're new to the franchise, you'll love it.Newcomers: 9/10 - Worth a buyPrevious players: 7/10 - More of the sameIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Batman: Arkham OriginsI've decided to wait, and review Batman: Arkham Origins now, rather than had reviewed it back when it was released in October, last year. Why? Because the hype. I was so excited for this game to come out. I had changed every digital wallpaper I owned to it. Bought posters, digitally made a shirt, hell, the release date was even my phone's passcode. I thought it wise to just wait, and review it when my excitement had died down. And here we are, 5 months later, and I still love this game. Sure, it has it's flooks. But what game doesn't? The gameplay is what you EXPECT, and that's okay! What the Arkham series provides is an unreal superhero experience that makes you feel like YOU are Batman. Arkham Origins still captures that and displays it in a different style and showing of the character. Arkham Origins somewhat takes the old gothic art style of Asylum and City, and sort of hides it away. You know it's there, but it's smothered underneath all the gritty realism. A harsh mix between the Nolan films and Batman: The Animated Series. The art style is also accented by the crisp visuals. and particularly to the PC version, the PhysX. (I love you Pepe) The graphics are unique, and not overly realistic, but at the same time, have that crisp Arkham feel. It knows what it is, and it tries to maintain it. The story is absolutely FANTASTIC, and is really what carries the game... Seriously... Batman fan, or non-Batman fan, you will like the story, ESPECIALLY if you have played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.I guess the main gripe most people had with Origins was that it was ""more of the same."" But I have to ask, is that a bad thing? We got a new art style, amazing story, gadgets, refined predator mechanics and new abilities, a expansion to Gotham, and new playable characters. To me, Arkham Origins is a solid installment to the Arkham series.Gameplay 9/10Visuals 8/10Story 10/10Replay factor 7/10Overall: 8.5/10			"

												It's not good enough to be considered a Batman Arkham game. Buggy, short and poorly designed.The story is good and the locations are great (albeit Gotham City doesn't have any pedestrians because of a convenient blizzard storm, and most of what's playable of it is what will become Arkham City in the future).I've experienced tons of bugs, something that never happened to me in the other Arkham games. For example, one time an entire Crime In Progress scene spawned right in front of me and I got locked inside the model of a truck which spawned on me. Another time I got killed by a bug in the first Bane fight, repeatedly. It took me more than three hours to beat that and I had to let Bane punch me because if I tried to avoid his hits I would get crushed by the floor for some reason, getting bugged inside the floor. Another time I used the Bat Wing to fast travel and my model didn't appear so I had to restart the game.Fighting sucks because of the camera angle, it's very very difficult to aim when blocking or when jumping from one thug to another because the camera twists too fast (and there's no control to turn it off since the only one there is just changes what it does with the camera when you jump out of combat).The animations are clumsy and laggy, but the game itself runs smoothly, so I wonder what happened there?Some of the boss fights are uninspired repetitions of other boss fights from the other games and some even copy some of this very game.I still recommend it because overall it's still a Batman Arkham game but it's way worse than the others. Buy it on sale and keep in mind Splash Damage hasn't fixed anything yet even though it's been months.A shame really.			"

												THIS GAME IS A SHAME AND A DISRESPECT WITH US AND WITH ROCKSTEADY'S WORK WITH THIS FRANCHISEDon't get me wrong: ""Batman: Arkham Origins"" is a very cool and fun game. It even has some improvements over the two past games, like some remarkable boss battles that are even better than most of the AA and AC ones, and some improved investigation missions with elements that reminds Capcom's ""Remember Me"".  But, unfortunately, all of these good things became a little blurry because Arkham Origins is one of the worst polished games from this past generation(PS360)...Arkham Origins have one of the biggest collection of bugs of the series, contrasting with the previous games, that are so well made by Rocksteady. And not only this, but Warner Montreal simply spat in our(consumers)face, when they said they're not fixing anything anymore because none of the bugs and issues the game have right now are ""game breaking"" and we can still finish the game. It's a shame and a disrespect with us and with all the excelent job Rocksteady had been doing with the series. From the games that a played recently, Arkham Origins was my biggest disappointment. I had fun with it, but, at the same time, I was always mourning with myself about how the game is so broken and with no polishment. I'm even kind of sad of writing this review, because I really like Batman Arkham series. But these bad developers must know that we are not happy with their work. I know it's unlikely they'll read this or even fix the game because of my review, but at least I'm spreading the word and warning some other players on what they will get into when buying this game...

												Batman: Arkham Orgins brings together two of my favorite types of gameplay. At times you are a hunter in the shadows, timing takedowns and picking apart your prey one by one while remaining invisble. Most of the time you dive into the middle of a gang to rely on quick reflixes and situational awareness to beat the absolute turd out of them. While being very fun and simple Arkham Orgins is basically Arkham City with a lower budget. All but two gadgets are the same, but even then one of the ""new"" gadgets is really just a reskin. The main story mode is extremely linear, which isn't bad just means less time explorin' more time kickin' booty patooty. It's also unsatisfyingly short. I have no clue what I paid for but with the main story mode complete, every collectable on the lower half of the map safe, and all the sidequests but one completed I only have 35% of the game done. Nothing left but grinding that most people will find boring.So final verdict is, if you want to buy it but don't have Arkham City, get Arkham City instead. If you've played Arkham City and crave a bit more go crazy.P.S. Don't buy the skins. They're poopy. The original skin is bad butt anyways, it tears up as the story progesses (kind of to the point where you wonder how he flipping flys with so many holes in his cape but still awesome.) One of the skins looks like they threw batman into a tanning bed till he bacame the Wrinkled Knight.*edited with less cussing!! ♥♥♥♥ YEA!!!!			"

												Arkham Origins is an addicting game, but that doesn't mean it's good. As someone who has put over a hundred hours into Arkham City and has 100% Arkham City and Asylum, I'm not afraid to say that Arkham Origins is an inferior follow-up. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun; the combat is better than ever with the addition of new enemy types and the ability to stack up to 2 special moves. But besides that there isn't really that much the game has going for it. The predator rooms feel uninspered and generic compared to the ones in City, and can be breezed through with the use of Deathstokes grappel gun which basicly allows you to pick off up to three enemies with no challenge to it: it's basicly a ranged Inverse takedown. This eliminates the diffliculty of predator rooms. Then there's the city, the game's hub world. While it is larger than the one in Arkham City, if I remember correctly I've been told it's atleast 3 times as big as the one in AC, it feels empty. There isn't much to do apart from stopping the same general street crimes that pop-up in the city districts (whether it's fighting mobs or beating up gangs it all ends up becoming the same repitative task after a while). The are no riddler trophies or riddles that unlock bonuses and give winks and nods to the batman lore. I understand Edward Nigma hasn't transformed into the Riddler yet, but the replecement collectibles they have in the game just feel inferior compared to the collectibles of past games. There are side-missions you can do, but half of them are straight up copies of the ones present in AC; Instead of blowing up titan containers you're blowing up drug containers, there's the one where you get sucked into Mad Hatters Wonderland, there's the one where you have to track down Deadshot just like you did in AC. Speaking of Deadshot, one of the biggest flaws in this game is character development. For a game whose whole premise is based around Batman having to defeat eight assassins, the assassins themselves have barely any impact in this game. Assassins like Deathstroke have little to no screen time, they just show-up, you beat them, and you about never see them again. I'm not talking about B or C list characters here, this is Deathstroke, a major player in the DC Universe, a man who has fought the Teen Titans and had multiple comic series. Instead more emphasis is placed on characters like Bane, who has already had screen time in the previous two games. For the most part it just feels like most of the assassins where just there as fan-service instead of actually having a purpose; it's like how people always joke that the Batman story-arc ""Hush"" was just an excuse for Jim Lee to draw and include major stars of DC universe, with them having little to add to the overall plot.    But while there's a lot I can criticize about Origins, there are some things it gets right. Like I said earlier the combat is better than ever, not to mention the boss fights, which for the most part, are an improvement over the ones in City and especially Asylum. The voice acting is surprinsgly better than I expected; Troy Baker sounds great as the Joker and overtime Roger Craig Smith starts to grow into the role of Batman, even at some points sounding like a young Kevin Conroy. And while I do think the assassins where underplayed, I'n my opinion James Gordon and Alfred were certainly given the time in the spotlight they rightfully deserve, more so then they were in the past games. But besides that there isn't much I can say good about it. Like I said from the beginning, Origins is addicting. The comabt is satisfying, I'd dare say even more than City, but it lacks the things AC has that made me 100% it and start on my 5th playthough of it. It might just be me, I'll admit that. From what I've read in other reviews people have enjoyed this game, and that's good. But in my opinion, as an honest-to-god Batman/Arkham series fanboy, I just can't recommend this game. I wish I could put it into words that would fully convey my dislike towards this game in a way that would allow you to see it the way I do, but I can't. And when I try the only word that comes to mind is the same one I've repeated over and aver again in my review, and that word is ""inferior"". This game is just inferior. But I'll say again, that's just the way ""I"" see it. If you think you'll like it, and it comes on sale, you can buy it and make your own opinion. But if you had to ask me, I would not recommend it. P.S. I couldn't think of anyplace else add this so I just decided to talk about it here, this has to deal with game's New Game Plus mode. Following in AC's footsteps WB Montrel added a New Game Plus mode that allowed you experience the game a second time with an upgraded Batman. But here's the thing, in AC when you started New Game Plus you had all your gadgets unlocked from the start. This was cool because it allowed you an edge with the harder enemies. But in Origins you don't have your gadgets, you have to unlock them all over again. So I have to ask, what's the point of New Game Plus mode if I don't have my unlockables? That was a just a small nitpick I had with the game that I just needed to talk about.			"

Yes, it's not made by the original Batman Arkham studio, Rocksteady, and yes, it had some fairly heavy bugs on release.Yet it still have the very best storytelling of the series, and a very good overall. Troy Baker as the Joker is amazing.The gameplay is a bit down from Arkham City, but at least the game has the good taste to allow the removal of the combat prompts, something all other opuses in the series failed to do.You can have a look as my extended opiniated review here[anothergameress.tumblr.com].

												After playing the previous Batman series, I think that Arkham Origins is disappointing.Lets begin with the Pros:First of all, i should say that the story line is very good and there are some great moments too. The gameplay is brutal, fun and challenging some times. I also think that there is an improvement to Boss Fights. Regarding the Voice Acting, it's a good try by all actors (Troy Baker as Joker, Roger Craig Smith as Batman etc). Finally, the amount of side missions is Substantial.And now let's turn to the Cons:Glitches, Glitches ... Glitches..., did I mention GLITCHES?! The biggest problem of this game is the glitches/bugs and the technical issues because they are just so many! Apart from this, Akrham Origins is exactly a copy-paste of Arkham City. It got the same map and nothing new added (+things like gadgets, mission types etc). Also, there are not many Riddles and Challenges.I would only recommend this game to the fans of DC Comics/Batman Series because they will like it. If this is a new ""experience"" for you, I'd recommend you not to buy this game (especially in full-price).Overall Rating: 7/10 "

												Bruce Wayne no longer exists. The person he would have been died along with his parents in that dark alley. Only rage is left. He feels no sympathy. He has become unstoppable and invincible vengeance. Criminals will not get away with the pain they inflict on others. Even the smallest crime is unforgivable as they will only lead to bigger crimes. I have no fear. I am the Batman and no one will escape my wrath.Batman: Arkham Origins is the most brutal Arkham game yet. The younger Batman does not know that he is not invincible. Familiar epic gameplay and a great dark story. More thoughts at http://germaximus.com/batman-arkham-origins-impressions/ "

												Arkham Asylum came as a breath of fresh air in a genre combination that had left a long trail of mediocre at best games, even when coupled with some of the biggest licenses in the world. Arkham City expanded on that with an open world and a ton more things to do. Can Arkham Origins, the third game in the series, a prequel made by a different developer, keep the same high quality and still make the franchise feel fresh?The answer is, thankfully, yes. Though Rocksteady didn't work on this entry in one of the best new franchises in years, WB Montreal has hit it out of the park and convinced me that even if Rocksteady has moved on, WBM's hands are more than capable.The game starts out long before the events of Arkham Asylum, and you play as a Batman who's nowhere near as confident. He has no allies aside from Alfred, the criminals of Gotham City still aren't quite sure he's more than a myth or urban legend, and the police force will stop at nothing to take him down. On Christmas Eve, Batman discovers that someone has hired eight assassins to kill him, with a $50 million reward to the one who manages to take him down.The story takes place across Christmas Eve night and a couple hours into the very early morning of Christmas, and it's wonderfully well told, which is good because the story was the most worrying thing to me, since I figured the gameplay looked nearly identical to the past two games. The gameplay isn't just a cut and paste of the prior entries, though, with a handful of new gadgets, takedowns, and combat moves thrown in to keep things fresh. Obviously there are some gameplay continuity quirks, since why would Batman have lost some gadgets between now and then, but for the most part you'll forget about those kinds of things as you fight quite a few new enemy types, the best bosses in the series, and use your detective skills to solve crimes with some cool new crime-rewind/fast-forward stuff. It's all very fun and I have no real gameplay complaints, though those expecting radical departures from the series' formulas will be disappointed.The non-story stuff is at its best in this entry as well, with cases to solve, criminals to catch, and an enjoyable random crime system to mix things up. The only real downsides to AO are negligible. The multiplayer mode is both dead and somewhat pointless, though it could be fun if you could find some games and play with friends. The other issue is that the game, unlike Asylum and City, could use a couple more passes of polish. There are quite a few bugs in this entry, mostly with mission triggers not occurring or enemies becoming unable to be interrogated. Sometimes while rewinding a crime you will become stuck in the ground until it finishes,  things like that. I didn't run into any of the gamebreaking bugs some people have, but I guess your mileage may vary.All in all I had a blast with B:AO and I look forward to what both Batman developers have up their sleeves.9.5/10			"

												I love the Batman franchise and so I am going to recommend this game. However, although this game is visually appealing I don't think it is as good as Arkham Asylum or Arkham City. Ihave given it a fair chance at 15 hours of game time in but in my opinion it is missing something. I don't think the combat is as good and it needs more story within the campaign. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game but just not as good as I thought it might be. The graphics are superb though. That goes without saying. It's a very pretty game and for those who have not played it yet I would recommend playing it over Christmas given it's storyline and theme.			"

												I played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and loved them.  I absolutely could not wait for Arkham Origins to come out.  The only word I can use to describe it is.......disappointing.  The storyline is not as smooth and the transitions are awkward.  The previous interface was intuitive and easy to navigate.  For some reason they decided to change the interface and have made it more difficult, less intuitive and thoroughly unenjoyable.  There are a lot of bugs in this game.  I have had to exit out of the program and start again 3 times today because bugs made Batman unmovable.  If you are like me you will buy it just because you have the first 2 and have to see what happens.  Just do not set your expectations too high and prepare to be disappointed anyway.  My advice is to wait until you can get it for $5.			"

												Now, before all of you simply glance over my words simply because I don't recommend this game to everyone, allow me to explain in detail why that is so.Have in mind that I have not completed this game 100%, nor do I intend to; I am not a completionist, and even if I were, this game does not deserve it. I've also played both Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City, followed by Origins, all in quick succession and in proper order, over the course of about 3 weeks. I was also (un)lucky to pre-order this game with a decent discount; it cost me about 30€ or so, a good dip from the 50€ that the game retails for.Also have in mind that I will not be talking about the online multiplayer of this game; I feel it is an unnecessary add-on to the game that does not benefit a previously exclusively single-player experience, and a great one at that.Now, I usually don't tend to compare different games because it takes away the focus of the game at hand, but since this is a sequel (or a prequel, to be precise); a game in a series of games, I shall compare it to its predecessors simply because it makes sense. This goes more so for the quality of the previous games, and to see if this game is up to the same standard. And unfortunately, it is not.This game, like many other in their respective franchises, such as God of War and Assassin's Creed just to name a few, suffers from a very common AAA game problem; over-iteration. Companies become greedy due to the success of previous entries, and simply start cashing in on the loyalty of players with a passion for games like this. It should also be noted that this game, unlike Arkham Asylum and City, wasn't even made by the same studio; the first two games were made by Rocksteady, whereas Origins was made by WB Studio Montreal; meaning that the entire cast was changed.Now, before I can state why I don't recommend this game, I'll take a look at the two previous entries in the series.Back when I started Asylum, I expected nothing of the game. It is the only game of the three that I have not done any reading on, or have not seen any video material beforehand; I explored as I went.A week later, having finished it, and on a side note, it is the only game of the three that I have played on the Easy difficulty (and it still remains the most difficult game in the series), I came out more than pleasantly surprised. Everything, from the game's level design, to its closed, dark, gritty, and almost paranoid atmosphere, not to mention amazing characterization, was spot on. I won't even start talking about the voice acting, which was second to none. The game felt fresh. It felt new. It felt like a really high-quality piece of work.Afterwards, I almost immediately started Arkham City. With this one, I'd done some previous reading and watched some short videos. The game received almost universal praise, and I read reviews filled with nothing but good word of it. And given the quality of Asylum, I went into the game with high expectations.Another week later, I finished the game, but with mixed feelings. For one, the story seemed out of place, and was kind of messy all around. Other aspects of the game received no change whatsoever; it was basically Asylum with a different story. Luckily, voice acting remained on the same quality level as with Asylum; Hamill really shined with the Joker. Lastly, the game did improve in one aspect. That was the environment. It provided me with a more or less open world, shedding the closed atmosphere of Asylum, and providing me with the constant feeling of being on the move. The design of Arkham City was great, and it was a good change from the closed corridors of the Asylum, and this required a different approach from the player.Yet, despite all this, I still prefer Asylum. It just felt better.Lastly, I started playing Origins. I had hopes for the game. I wanted to see it correct the things City got wrong; a more coherent story, a larger world to explore, more stuff to do.And after a while, I saw that the game failed spectacularly at all of these. Now, since I'd harbored nice feelings for the previous games, I could look over the various issues that the game has. However, by the end of the game, I realized that this game was indeed a failure. It is a failure because it takes everything enjoyable from the previous games, and then limits it.For starters, the level design is a step back from Asylum, let alone City. The game basically tricks you into thinking you've been given this large open world, when it fact it is more limited than the closed levels of Asylum, for most of the game. There are only a handful of ways to progress, and the game is not flexible in this aspect. Adding a quick travel feature detracts from the game's supposed exploration-based nature, and you're left to realize that, despite this game having a (slightly) larger map than City, it is barren. The entire city is almost empty, and to make things worse, this is obviously artificial, and on purpose. The game feels poor in content. It even has loading times between areas if you quick travel. It is simply pathetic.And all of this is made worse by the fact that the game doesn't try to innovate in the slightest. It sticks to the formula of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', and it pays for it dearly. Nothing has changed gameplay-wise, and some things are even performed worse than in previous games. The entire system, like City, is simply copy+pasted from Asylum.Last but not least when it comes to gameplay, the game has a multitude of bugs. From what I heard and read, I actually got off easy; I only encountered two or three game-breaking bugs over the course of my playthrough. Gameplay aside, there are even more issues with the game. And that would be the story.SPOILER warning; mild story spoilers ahead.Now, it might be just me, but the story of Origins feels even more out of place than City. It is cluttered, and makes no time to explain itself, while at the same time letting down my expectations. For one, I expected the Joker's presence in the game to be minimal, even more so than in City. But no. They just went and had to make him the main villain. Again. For the third damn time. Now, all of this would be ok if he was up to par. But even that doesn't occur, as the change in voice actors is visible; while I have nothing against Troy Baker, by trying to be as good as Hamill just doesn't work, and makes the game feel cheap. It is something you'll notice if you played the previous games.Second, the game disappoints in its choice of villains; because the Joker is the main man behind the scenes, this de-values all the other villains, and makes them effectively the Joker's underlings, which is terrible. None of the other villains are given proper screen time, nor are they challenging in fights. This is evident as the game has the worst boss fights in the series. It is a step down from the outright amazing boss fights with Scarecrow and Mr. Freeze, as well as the Penguin in Asylum and City respectively.And as far as the story goes, the name of the game is misleading. This is no origins story. It is just a half-as*** attempt to cash in on the amazing work of Rocksteady. The story does not feature the true Origins of the Batman, and provides no backstory to his motivation, like Asylum does. It just takes a great character and gives him more stuff to do.TL;DR - If you simply have to have more of Batman, play the game. However, this game works best if you haven't played any of the previous two games. If you have, and think the series was great so far, for the love of God, don't play this game. If you were a fan of Asylum, stick to it. It is by far the best game in the series, and playing this will only make you dislike the franchise.As a side note, this review was longer, but it seems there's a character limit, so I had to shorten it. Oh well.			"

												I give this game about a 8/10 its a very well done game with a amazing campaign lots of side missions and just a huge amount of content including a super fun mutliplayer, not the only issues I have with the game is the lacking amount of players on multiplayer(which can easliy change) but would be the amount of glitches now offline has just glitches that don't out right make gameplay harder in any shape or form it just has glitches that can be noticable but funny, Multiplayer in this game is my favorite mutliplayer of ALL TIME, it has a great feel to it, its a super fun thing to play but it also feels too dark at times, the matching making can also be weak at times, and there is a lack of maps/game modes which multiplayer only has 2 modes and no one even plays the other one it just needs some really fun but stupid mode to get you more hyped up, but multiplayer can occasionally have game ending glitches or unfair glitches giving advantages to a random team(but are extrememly rare) there are some super annoying glitches for multiplayer such as: when you finially get to play as Batman this glitch can sometime change your Batman Costume or even make you play as Robin, the evil Robin twin glitch, being locked in the super villian spawn, matches won't start or end and connection dropping from steam too much, It may sound like its really bad but its really rare for those to happen its very fun and I reccomend this game to any fan of Batman!!

												This is the last game of the Arkham franchise I played. I tried to play it shortly after I played Arkham City, but felt it was too much of the same. I gave it time and wanted to give it a solid shot.I ran into a few bugs with riddler trophy locations. It would say a trophy was there, but I couldn't find it. When I would reload the game, the riddler marker would go away.Also, I had problems with broken graphics settings that wouldn't save. Eventually I just edited the files myself and set them to read only so it would stop overwriting my settings. But man, I actually almost quit the game in frustration over this. This game also suffers from some optimization issues. I have a pretty beefy computer, but it would still have stutter issues while I flew through the city.Plot Spoilers: I was disappointed with the overuse of the Bane boss fight. I personally can't stand that bosses' mechanic, and felt disappointed that it was used so heavily. Though I did like the sneaking when you fought ""super bane.""I did like the introduction of Harley and the sequence where Joker recounts his bad day as Red Hood that turned him into the Joker. But I was ultimately disappointedd that Joker turned out to be the main villain again. Though he was somewhat more ancillary, having him popping up as a memorable side villain ala scarecrow in Asylum would have felt a little better. Overal I only recommend this game to someone who wants to complete the Arkham lineup. It feels very similar to Arkham City with a story that's only ""okay."" "

												This Batman is great and I recommend everyone playing this before the other games. This game obviously isn't better than Batman: Arkham City, but it's still fun and great for 10$ or below. The story is good and the gameplay mechanics work well, I tried this with mouse and keyboard and guess what. IT WORKED. I really expected this game to be broken for mouse and keyboard, but no it works perfectly fine. I experienced 2 bugs, the first time my game crashed, the second time was that Batman got stuck in the wall. I paid 3€ for this game and wow am I happy I got it for this price, the game reminds me a lot of the other titles, anyways it's worth it.Pros:- gr8 mechanics- works well with mouse and keyboard- gr8 story- gr8 graphics- powered by the MLGness of Nvidia Cons:- Black screen (no racist)- not powered by the swaggerino of AMD- Too much water7.8/10			"

												If you've played the previous Batman games, it will be easy to get frustrated with Arkham Origins. The real center of these games is hand-to-hand combat with large groups of thugs. That's what you'll be spending a large portion of the game doing, and it's never been more frustrating.In past games, you were able to cancel out of any long animation Batman might be in the middle of in order to counter an attack coming from a thug behind you. In this game, not only do your animations have priority over your commands, but enemies can slide from a good distance away right up next to you to lay a sudden smack-down on the Bat, the whole while you are helpless to defend yourself. This makes the ""Bat sense"" warning signals above enemies' heads useless at least half of the time, since it will be impossible for you to counter them.This is more or less emblematic of the problems with Arkham Origins: changes were made that make little sense and do a lot to detract from the experience. There's some fun to be had here for anyone desperate for more Batman after Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, but if you can hold out, you'd be better off waiting for Arkham Knight next year.			"

												Arkham Origins is the third game in the Batman Arkham series, though it is a prequel. It is obvious when playing through the game that the developer of this game is different than the previous two installments, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. The game feels clunkier and is not as well optimized but the game still has a sort of charm that drives through, which makes it a unique, though flawed, addition to the series.The story in this game caught me by surprise because of how honestly interesting it was. The game takes place on Christmas Eve and features the first night Batman encounters The Joker. There is a twist that happens during the beginning of the game, but do not expect anything of Arkham City caliber. The character interactions are fantastic and honestly my favorite part of the game, especially the relationship portrayed between Bruce and Alfred. To see the beginnings of many characters and their involvement with The Dark Knight is interesting as well, including Officer Gordon and Barbara Gordon. Many parts of the story actually portrays Batman as a ture detective, which is very well done and satisfying.The voice acting in this game is pretty solid, even thought the actors Batman and The Joker have both been replaced. Troy Baker must be commended for his outstanding job as The Joker and filling in the big shoes left by the much talented Mark Hamill. A huge negative for me though is how awful the lipsyncing in real time is in this game. It looks extremely clunky, unfinished, and just plain bad, especially by 2013 video game standards. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are a big plus because they are extremely stylized and are a huge factor that sets this game apart from the previous installments in the series. The graphics in this game are nothing special and even when they are maxed out, they do not look as good as Arkham City does. That said, it is definitely not a bad looking game (though the fire effects are absolutely atrocious). The funny thing is even though the game came out two years after Arkham City and does not look as good, it also does not run as well. I have a pretty solid PC which can run games such as Battlefield 4 on high smoothly and at a constant framerate but for this game, it manages to lag (though not frequently) at random locations throughout the game, and especially prominent during the last couple portions, The gameplay in this game consists of what you have already been accustomed to in the series, except it just seems to be a bit clunkier. Though the flow of the combat is fluid, sometimes the takedown controls did not seem to work which got quite annoying in specific portions of the game. Also, the combat in this game is much easier than the other games because once you get a flow going, which is easy enough, you can attack enemies that are stunned and already on the ground which somewhat removes one of the only challenges in the beat-em-up combat this series did so well. There is a return of stealth portions within the game but it plays quite differently because of the very different level design compared to the previous installments. In this game, the stealth portions really just seemed easier and if you are caught sneaking around, it was also simple enough to dodge the enemies' bullets and take them down non-stealthily, which honestly should not be the case. So one of the biggest gripes about this game is the fact that it is really a lot easier than Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. There are also many new weapons introduced in this game, which does not make sense since Batman could have used them in the other installments, which take place later on the timeline. Though when making a prequel videogame, it is inevitable to run into problems like that. One of my favorite additions though is the grapple accelerator, which allows Batman to increase his speed when grappling on to any surface, which happens a lot in these games. This is one feature I definitely want to see carried over into Arkham Knight. The map in this game is slightly bigger than that of Arkham City, though it may feel emptier because of the lack of interesting and engaging sidequests. The game takes place in Gotham this time around and it does not make a whole lot of sense since the only people we see roaming the streets or the rooftops are criminals. It made sense in Arkham City, since that is an entire area infested with criminals, but the same cannot be said about this game. One great addition though is the fast-travel using the Batwing. There are multiple fast-travel spots that can be unlocked throughout the map and this idea works very well and I hope it is implemented into Arkham Knight. Though the game is still pretty fun, even compared to the first two installments, it is lacking something huge. A variety of Batman villains. We get some interesting bosses in this game but we also get some fairly unenjoyable ones with villains I don't really care about. Arkham City had an assortment of crazy and fun villains, but this game takes a slump in that department. Bane returns for a total of three different boss battles here and though they are fairly fun, it would have been more interesting to change up the formula. There is a boss battle with Deathstroke early in the game and it is very well executed, and one of the highlights in this game for me. One thing to note is that one of the boss battles is very annoying to play with a mouse and keyboard, so using a controller for this game may be a good idea.Overall, Batman: Arkham Origins is a solid game muddled by being unpolished and some poor design. However, it is still a good game in my opinion and one that is worthy to be in the series. WB Montreal did a good job at portraying these characters in a new light and I really appreciate that. 7.5/10 "

												Let me clarify two things before moving forward with this review:1) I have not encountered one single bug / glitch throughout the game during my playthrough. Perhaps one thing could be mentioned: Batman occasionally does some strange movements once in the air whilst gliding. But when you stop it and do the gliding again it is fine. So, I have to assume that by the time I played this game WB had patched it properly eliminating all (or most) of the annoying issues.2) I have not tried multiplayer out, at all. I just didn't care. This franchise is all about the single player experience for me and after completing the story I moved on to other games simply skipping the multiplayer component. So, whether good or bad, I do not know and my review is based on the single player experience.Additional criticism towards Arkham Origins (beside the handful of glitches) was its incremental nature. So, while Arkham City offered a couple of new things Origins does not do so. Media cited it should have been a more transformative sequel. But why? It prepares Arkham Knight for that - Rocksteady will do that (we already know vehicles have more involvement in the new Batman game), in the meantime, Splash Damage simply picked a working formula and created a game with that.With that in mind Arkham Origins has one new thing: its story. This is now a prequel so Batman is just after his disappearance (the journey during which he honed his skills) and just started apprehending the bad guys of Gotham. Police, at this point, do not trust him (meanly because they fear him and another reason for that is them being corrupt). Of course, we have Gordon as the outstanding, good, by-the-book guy who can accept Batman (albeit he is making this decision reluctantly). So, it's interesting to be there from the ""beginning"" and see - for instance - how difficult it is for Batman to cope with Joker (he's quite worked up after their first encounter). I liked the story and I liked the new villains - Black Mask, for instance, or the assassins he hired to kill Batman.So, in essence, the game offers the same thing, but instead of Arkham we are in Gotham City. This is quite huge (perhaps even bigger than Arkham); there's the usual riddle trophies we can collect and many side missions. Also, there are a lot of cutscenes and one thing I found very interesting: Both Batman's and Joker's voice actor changed, but they do a very good job indeed! You can barely hear the difference (yes, even Mark Hamill's replacement is that good).I found the game a bit more difficult. You need to act much faster and there's a new enemy type who can counter Barman moves so you need to counter the counter (it makes sense, right?). Some predator challenges can be annoying as if you mess with the bad guys one by one there's always one who grabs a hostage and if he sees you he simply eliminates the victim resulting in a game over. So, even these encounters require a bit more focus.I do not know about the DLCs (I understand there's one with titled Cold, Cold Heart and it is with Freeze) but the core story is really good and the game offers a long-lasting experience just like its predecessors. Perhaps Origins sticks out a bit; this will be even more alarming probably once Arkham Knight is released; in the meantime, let's just enjoy this installment which I believe is an important part of the franchise and true fans of the series should not skip this one.UPDATE:Cold, Cold Heart DLC - The downloadable content pits Batman against Mr Freeze. We have an extra 4-5 hour long single player content that is to be launched separately from the main menu. After completing the introduction section we find ourselves in Gotham once more with ""all gadgets available"". I guess all gadgets means all you have obtained in the main game. There is no levelling up and only a relatively small section of the city is available as a playable are.Still, the DLC content offers a new enemy, a new boss battle and exciting cutscenes. I like how Batman faces a frozen Gotham - the snow / ice effect on his cape is brilliant. And of course completing the story still allows us to go back and pick-up the remaining collectibles. This is a good DLC - while for 10 bucks it may be a bit expensive if discounted true Batman fans must get it!			"

												It's more of the same with more bugs.tl;dr: I paid $30, it’s worth $10.Now you might think more of the same would be a good thing, but sadly it's just stale.I was all aboard the hype train for this, I had faith that WB could put together a decent game, I mean how could they mess it up?1) It's incredibly short.  That being said I didn't run around getting all the Riddler boxes to beat him up for a third time.  But the main story is considerably shorter than that of Arkham City, and it ends sort of abruptly.  (Yes, yes you can continue playing after you finish the story to get the Riddler stuff.)2) The writing seems half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  The assassins that were hired to kill Batman, which I might add were the main marketing point for the game made up less than an hour of the game.  The concept of surviving the assassins in one night sounded appealing, the actual execution was boring and short.  It's almost the same issues the Batman films ran into all those years ago, when you have too many interesting characters there just isn't time for everyone.3) The game is Riddled (heh, pun) with bugs.  From the buggy controls to the performance issues, all the way to that inescapable Riddler room that you actually had to fast-travel your way out of.  I played for 3/4 of this game on the highest settings with a decently high-end rig (i7, 16GB, HD 7970).  I had performance hits here and there, but as soon as I got to Blackgate the game became unplayable, and for no reason in particular.  Looking at performance monitors, my card was itting at 80% usage, my i7 was barely being touched and yet I was struggling to get 14 fps.   I had to look online for community fixes.  Though these are known issues, they have yet to be fixed.4) Yes the map is roughly ""double"" the size of Arkham city, but there were sections of the map that I barely explored because there wasn't a need.  It was big just for the sake of being big.5) While the boss-fights in the Batman series have never been anything special (with the exception of Mr. Freeze) the fights in this game are spectacularly vanilla.  I was looking forward to the Deathstroke fight, and it was over in seconds, more of a chore than a challenge.6) The gadgets are a joke.  The “glue grenade” is a clone of Arkham City’s “freeze grenade” with a new name but all the exact same functionality.  For some reason there is stun grenade… thing that you’ll probably forget that you have because it’s less effective than any of your other gadgets.There is more, but you get the idea.  With as little actual story was in this game it could have done as an expansion to Arkham City or been incorporated into whatever the next Batman game that Rocksteady is working on all hush-hush. **I must say though that this game as a whole was disappointing the one part I was surprised by was the voice acting.  I wasn't sure of their decision to swap in new voice actors for that ""younger"" sound.  While neither of the main characters sounded particularly younger they did do a damn fine job of bringing the characters to life. "

The skins are crap. The main batsuit used in the game is the only good one, rest of them are not nearly as detailed as the main one. And for the challenge maps. They are just bunch of similar rooms as in the main game. You have to beat the enemies to a pulp. The DLC are absolutely unworthy.After playing cold cold heart DLC. I will say yes that is the only one worth buying. A small story telling the origins of Mr Freeze. The extreme environment suit that comes along with it is kick♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I love the original Rocksteady trilogy and always wanted to give this one a try and in all honesty it was not as bad as I thought it would be!It’s definitely the weakest of all the Arkham games for a number of reasons.I found this the most glitchy/buggy of all the Arkham games.The city is very dull and lifeless. The story just didn't flow very well for me, there didn't seem to be any build up like the other games, I found it very 'mish mash' at times.And I really did not like the CGI cut-scenes, this was probably done because of time constraints/man power but the in game engine cut scenes from the other games are way better and more engaging.On the plus side, the free flow is as addicting as ever, the story starts off very well, especially with the Deathstroke boss battle! But just flakes off towards the end. A highlight would be the hints at 'The Killing Joke' I loved the red hood Joker flash back in the chemical plant showing his origin, very nicely done. Troy Baker does a fantastic job as the joker and sounds very Mark Hamill at some points which I like, all the other voices are forgettable.I would still recommend this to anyone that enjoys the other Arkham games, just don't expect anything new or exciting. But for anyone who has not played any of them, this is the one to play first as they will just get better and better!			"

												Origins is the newest , third, and the least strong of the Batman Arkham games. If you liked the first two you'll probably enjoy this one, though I found it tedious, and what DLC there is is tied to signing up for a WB account, which no one wants. It was worth it for a Steam sale price :)A really difficult boss fight with Deathstroke finished off my patience for this game fairly early on, and so I haven't seen much of it. The level design (of the ship) was really quite nice and the core mechanics of Batman Arkham games are present, in minmum, but I didn't see anything new compared to Ciry or Asylum, both of which I was able to finish, eventually.Cold Cold Heart seemed a neat DLC but I couldn't get very far in it and was already disinterested.

												The worst Arkham game, which still means that the game is really fun... but it feels off. The story is really cheesy and kind of silly, the gameplay is solid and well-rounded but feels a little off. The game also commits one of the cardinal sins of gaming and throws a last boss that is entirely different from the rest of the game at you. I enjoyed my time here and got some good mileage out of the game, but Arkham City and Arkham Asylum are incredible compared to this. It is worth a five to ten dollar purchase, and you'll have a good time with it, but it feels hollow compared to Asylum/City.Timeline wise, this takes place before Asylum, and tells a bit of the origin story, hence the name.

												SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY.Let's cut to the chase and face it - Batman: Arkham Origins is ""more of the same"", for the most part. It's basically more Batman: Arkham Asylum + Arkham City. If you were a fan of the two previous Arkham games and wanted basically more Batman: Arkham, then Origins certainly delivers just that. If that sounds good to you, great - you'll probably feel right at home with this title. If you wanted and expected more - well, prepare to be disappointed.Arkham Origins' voice-acting is still pretty good, even with some of the changes in some of its cast members. Regardless - the cast delivers and does a great job on their performances. While the story does take a little bit for it to get rolling, once it does - it finally decide to get good. Eight assassins are basically coming for Batman's head, as there's a bounty of $50 million on Batman's head from Black Mask. That's just the start of things, to say the least. There's certainly more to it than that. Because of such a huge cast of characters and some twists + turns in the plot and storyline, some characters - like some of the lesser known Batman villains to most non-fans of the series - never really get the time to get explored and shine here, which feels like a missed opportunity.  Some of Origins' story fills in the blanks of what happened to certain characters, how they become the character they become, or talk about some of their past - explaining some things that happened before events of the previous Arkham games. B/c this is an Origins story, it feels like some of this should've been explored a bit more.If you loved the combat of Arkham Asylum + City, it's not really changed much here - and this definitely has always been one of the strengths of this series. Some of the combat feels tweaked, here and there. Plus, there are some new weapons and gadgets here. One of the best things here are the boss fights - which are always excellent here. There certainly are plenty of side missions and collect-a-thon's here, for fans to dive into - if they are digging the game. And if that isn't enough, there's a New Game Plus Mode, among other things to dive into.After 23 hours approximately, Batman: Arkham Origins' single player campaign deliver basically more Batman: Arkham. Fans of the series wanting more Batman: Arkham, that's exactly what you receive here. If you were expecting more, innovations, and major improvements - don't! Origins is not that title. If you want more Batman: Arkham, you'll come away happy with this title. It's certainly a solid game and delivers such an experience. Origins certainly does not touch the greatness and freshness that came from the previous two titles developed by Rocksteady. Though, it can't be denied that WB Montreal has put forth a solid Batman: Arkham game.Final Grade = C+.			"

												Similar Games:The previous Arkham games, Assassin’s Creed games, and every game which hasattempted to rip either of those two series off.The Good:Fantastic setting for a Batman game. Gotham City on Christmas Eve just screams “Batman Returns” and is iconic in its own right. The character design and graphics are top notch, from the major (and minor) villains to the skyscrapers of Gotham. Character animations are fluid and natural, especially in cutscenes. Copperhead, one of the eight assassins gunning for Batman, is the real standout in this aspect. The gameplay is a rehash of the previous Arkham games, with the now standard attack/counter/stun/gadget methodology in place. The combat has always been a strength of the series, and Arkham Origins is no different, except to make Batman’s combat seem less refined and more brutal. That they managed to convey Batman’s inexperience to crime fighting through his fighting technique alone is fantastic. Detective mode is now more involved, requires more evidence gathering, and *GASP* actually involves Batman having Alfred send the evidence to the GCPD for prosecution! It’s almost like the real world! #SARCASM The plot twist, while obvious to anyone who was vaguely familiar with a Batman plot past his Detective Comics days, was a welcome change of pace. The voice acting, despite having changed actors from the previous Arkham games, was still solid and believable. The “Red Hood” section. I won’t spoil it more than that, but as a fan of the comic series, this made me very happy.The Bad:This game was shipped by WB Montreal one week prior to Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. What this means in layman’s terms was that WB Montreal had NO wiggle room in their release date, since Assassin’s Creed (also being a stealth action/combat game with an enhanced vision mode) would almost certainly have cannibalized their sales. In business terms, they had to ship before Assassin’s Creed no matter what state the game was in – AND IT SHOWS. A number of game breaking bugs were present in both the single player and multiplayer portions of the game, including: NOTE: MINOR SPOILERS BELOWMultiple instances where ledges that appeared to be climbable were not. One instance occurred in Burnley Tower, after the Riddler closes off the only other exit, leaving your trapped inside the Tower FOREVER… or until you fast-travel out or reset the game. If you have time and appreciate nerd rage, just Google “Burnley Tower”. An instance where pulling a raft in a dream-like sequence lead to being unable to drop the rope or reach the other shore. Infinite falling in certain places in the map, which really broke the immersion of the game somehow. If Batman ever runs into an enemy which can actually do this, he’s screwed. No level or stat saving in multiplayer, which is a non-starter for obvious reasons. Funky physics. More than once, I threw a baddie against a wall at just the right angle to make him go spirally hundreds of feet into the air. But even worse, once he landed, he got back up! Which is JUST impossible. Occasionally, you are detected by criminals from whom you have both cover and distance. Conversely, you can fly just overhead of others and go completely unnoticed. Batman sometimes drops combos for no reason, particularly during counters. There was a lack of emphasis on stealth for most of the game, and often going into stealth areas, Batman enters the room through the front door. Perhaps the enemies were expecting the vents, so the door was the most stealthy option? MINOR SPOILERS: In what is probably the worst tragedy of storytelling in this series, Barbara Gordon is portrayed as an enthusiastic teenager who somehow is allowed to access confidential police files and evidence because her daddy works for the police. Brushing aside the lack of realism there, Barbara Gordan, who became Batgirl and then, after the Joker shot her in the spine, assumed the role of Oracle, was NOT the airhead from this game. I almost stopped playing for this reason alone. The method of unlocking certain gadgets and techniques is dependent on performing certain feats. Normally that is fine, except that these feats are very specific and must be performed in the exact order that the skill tree describes. And some of these feats are nightmarishly impossible and require specific areas and circumstances to complete… just leave it at XP, WB Montreal. Come on. The Grapnel Accelerator, described as “experimental” in Arkham City, is mysteriously present years before in Arkham Origins. I understand why they decided to include it, but it represents an obvious break in the timeline of the games. The multiplayer… oh the multiplayer. It requires eight people to play, real people. NOT BOTS. NO BOTS. Good luck finding eight people on the servers a month from now. Make some friends on Steam, get a group together, and it might be feasible. Otherwise, it’s a waste of install space. Also, the shooting is really hit-and-miss, but that makes sense in an engine designed for hand-to-hand combat.Can you play it while the children are awake?:Of course not. Corpses with rictus smiles, tons of on-screen violence, multiple murder scene investigations, psychopathic villains… I could go on. Then again, if you are looking for a creative way to punish them…  While I’m picking nits…Rocksteady better be working on something damned important… like freelance work onHalf-Life 3, or (dare I wish it?) a good Superman game. I know that sounds impossible,but before Arkham Asylum, there wasn’t a good Batman game, either. I would onlyrecommend this game if you haven’t played Arkham Asylum or Arkham City, and thuscan’t compare the quality. Or if you have enemies, you could recommend this game onits multiplayer strengths.Did I make time to complete it?:I put 26 hours into it, primarily into the single player. I know that’s incongruous withmy criticisms above, but I was a big fan on the franchise going into Arkham Origins.This also represents the smallest amount of time I have put into an Arkham game, andnone of the others had multiplayer. I should also mention that a number of the bugsmentioned above have been fixed… but not all.Recommended Purchase Price:$19.99 (so, maybe Steam Summer Sale 2014?)or40% of current retail value of $49.99Reviewer:Rod Kimblehttp://www.gamerglance.com "

												It is a solid game by its own right, however it also is not as good as Arkham City. The story is tight, the boss sequences are amazing and yet it does not have that IT factor. There's no improvement here (well, maybe besides the boss battles). I'm a big Arkham Asylum and Arkham City fan and even though I enjoyed Origins, I would not recommend it, mainly because of the steep price. If you are a Batman fan, wait for a sale.I got this game as a bonus to my video card. If I bought this, I would be disappointed.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum and Arkham City games. The story takes place in a pre-Arkham Gotham city, staring a young and inexperienced Batman. The police force of Gotham is corrupt and mostly not better than the mobsters and criminals that run Gotham. The game takes place on Christmas eve, where Black Mask has hired 8 of the worlds greatest assassins to kill Batman.The gameplay is smooth most of the time as it was in the previous Arkham games. Moving around is easier than ever with the new fast travel. The city is about the same size as Arkham City but is divided between old and new Gotham.The combat system from the previous games returns. It is all based around timing and the rhythm of the fight. The stealth is a lot like Arkham City. You have the same structure of the last two games. New type of enemies and gadgets are introduced to add new elements to the game. There is a new addition to the detective mode. There are parts of the game where you use it to analyze a crime scene and piece together the crime. It is no longer just find something to trace and follow it to from point A to B.The boss fights are improved and feel more serious but are repetitive. The story felt weaker compared to the other games. The main story could also last longer. There are also again side missions, again you have to collect the Riddler trophies. The challenge mode also returns in Arkham Origins.Arkham Origins comes with a multiplayer mode. In my opinion it was not really necessary to implement a multiplayer.Batman: Arkham Origins does enhance the visuals of the Arkham City engine and it is a very great looking game on max settings. The visuals are not a massive step above the already great looking previous game.There is not much music to listen to but the overall theme sounds nice and fits with the whole story. All the characters do sound great. You have plenty of younger versions of characters seen in previous games. The new voice of the Joker sounds really a lot like the Mark Hamil voice.Overall, this game is fun. I enjoyed it almost as much as the other two games.

PROS:+ Batman+ cool story+ cheesy batman one-liners+ casefile investigations+ many unlockable gadgets+ great visuals+ some of the boss fightsCONS:- some glitches in graphics, audio and AI- crashes to desktop happen occasionally- multiplayer part is shutdown since 4th of December 2016- keyboard controls are terrible in some places- some other boss fightsComment:My first Batman game from the Arkham series. As such I cannot compare it to the others, yet. But this also works because it is first on the Arkham game story timeline. The combat is okay but gets a bit more clunky as new enemy types appear. This is coupled with keyboard controls that are not as responsive or well configured. I actually had to swap to a gamepad for the Deathstroke fight (and a couple of more times later in the game). There are lots of collectibles available (Anarky tags, Enigma data packs) and a TON of side missions. Plus 4 challenge ranks you can attempt while playing. But this all contributes to easily missable (and sometimes bugged) content, including some main assassins. Boss fights/levels are hit or miss. While some are great and engaging others become annoying really quick. Some examples - terrible fixed-camera Mad Hatter level and Deadshot hostage level end. A lot of people do not like Deathstroke, but once I switched to gamepad, the fight was actually good. Predator rooms give you options to either stealth or go in with a bang. Although this freedom is crippled by the challenges in Worst Nightmare rank. Because there is a limited amount of predator rooms you will want to do them according to what is in the challenge rank. After you finish up all of the content there is still challenge mode for some trophies but this mode became really annoying/boring fairly quick. Story is what drives this game and, while it is cheesy sometimes, I loved it. However, if you only go for the story the game is rather short. Even so it has glitches and crashed a couple of times. So get it for that nice Batman story or just to roam around Gotham ... but get it on a sale.			"

												As a young studio best known for porting Batman: Arkham City to Wii U, WB Montreal must have been desperate to prove that it belongs in the same conversation as series creator Rocksteady Games. To its credit, it's hard to tell that Batman: Arkham Origins isn't one of its sister studio's earlier releases. That's some achievement, but it's also a mixed blessing.To begin with, the set-up is as economical as Arkham Asylum or Arkham City. Batman is thrust into Gotham on Christmas Eve after Black Mask puts a $50 million bounty on his head and invites eight super-villains to town to compete for the spoils. As with previous Arkham games, that simple set-up then evolves as Batman races to keep up with events.Arkham Origins doesn't leave the strongest first impression though. After a CG cutscene and a short playable prologue in Blackgate Prison, Batman is dumped into a sparsely occupied Gotham that looks tiny on his Batcomputer map compared to some of the open-world playgrounds we've run around in lately. You're free to travel across it all from the start, but players used to maps dripping with icons may be surprised at its cold emptiness.This isn't a game that lacks depth, though - it's just a game with rare patience. Story missions take place away from the streets in carefully knotted set-piece levels built around single locations - like Penguin's hidden casino♥♥♥♥♥arms-bazaar or Gotham City Police headquarters - and as you make progress the open world gradually fills up with distractions.The initial slow burn is welcome, anyway, because it's an opportunity to luxuriate in the wonderful systems and mechanics that Arkham Origins inherits from its forebears. Batman glides through levels even when he's just walking around, those famous bat ears erect with authority, and he moves fluidly in a crouched run, too, barrel-like thighs pumping him from shadow to vent. But when you start actually gliding, it's a minor revelation, opening his wings to the wind and using the grapple to grasp the edge of a distant chimney, reeling it in and launching him over the crest to continue his flight.Watch me play through the first level of Arkham Origins and provide an overview of some of the systems.We had all this before, of course, but you forget how good it was. The same goes for Batman's many gadgets. You start off with quite a few - batarangs, smoke pellets and explosive gel for blowing holes in walls - and of course you have detective vision, the sonar view mode that maps Batman's surroundings so he can track enemies as they move nervously through the darkness around him. You gain other toys at intervals, including the remote batclaw for setting up tightropes between particular grapple points.Batman remains handy in a fight, too. In hand-to-hand combat, a single attack button allows him to flow between targets, ducking and diving through dense matrices of incoming blows, repelling those that threaten to land by reaching for the counter button. It's still quick to build combos, and the final blow, which the game always puts into slow motion and frames up nicely, often has a satisfying crack to it.The one thing Batman still lacks is a gun or grenade to deal with unsuspecting groups of enemies from afar - he can either wade in with his fists and gizmos or try to isolate and pick them off using stealth - but of course that's the point of the character. There is still a slight frustration though that the game often forces you into direct confrontation rather than letting you choose your own approach, especially as tougher enemies arrive with riot shields, knives and body armour to inject complexity into each fight.Still, that is what Arkham Asylum and Arkham City did, so at least it's canon. As is the way the city starts to fill up with intriguing diversions. The Riddler is back, of course, custodian of unlockable fast-travel points that can only be activated when you break into them. This often involves hopping around adjacent buildings examining the exterior of your prize, like a high-tech octopus feeling around the outside of a bottle to reach the fish inside. Enigma has left his mark in other areas of Gotham, too, and you'll be on his various trails all night.He is probably the highlight of the side missions - again, as usual - although he's far from alone in the dark night. Anarky is fed up with Gotham's corrupt rulers and plans to deal with them somewhat more explosively than Batman, so that's a thing, and there are various other threads to follow once secondary characters - friends and foes - present themselves.2Manoeuvring around enemies to set up stealth takedowns is still fun, although you can autopilot a lot of it with two games' experience under your utility belt.So it's fun crawling over Gotham. It can still feel slightly empty at times - you'll never see a pedestrian who isn't a cheesy thug or a trigger-happy SWAT team member - but among the dark rooftops, smokestacks, red brick facades and Ace Chemicals billboards there emerges plenty to do, and I am loath to scold a game for rebelling against the fad of instant gratification. Besides, some of it is there from the start should you be paying attention. There are a host of character-building challenges to complete, for example, by doing things like performing certain combinations in combat or gliding through rings dotted around the city. These tasks are just sitting there quietly listed in one of the pause menus.The one area where Arkham Origins truly distinguishes itself from Rocksteady's work, of course, is the part of the game that UK studio Splash Damage developed: multiplayer.In Arkham Origins' online mode, three of Bane's mercenaries face off against three of Joker's gang across four maps, fighting over capture points and trying to kill the opposition until they no longer have any Battlefield-style respawn tickets left and can be wiped out.As well as limited-use knockoff versions of Batman's see-through-walls detective vision, and loadouts that can be customised with unlockable weapons and abilities such as an explosive RC blimp, each team can also call on their master when they hit a certain threshold. Bane has powerful melee attacks, while Joker has a pair of pistols good for one-shot kills and spamming explosives.The biggest twist, though, is that two other players control a third team of heroes. Yes! Someone gets to play as Batman! (And Robin.) The heroes have a suite of predatory tools including grapple hooks and various batarangs and can stalk their prey from underground passages as well. They are rewarded for performing a variety of takedowns.Despite the competing objectives, matches are simple to understand and often draw to a nervous conclusion, as Bane and Joker's teams run out of respawn tickets and try to pick each other off while the heroes circle. If a player takes out a hero at this stage, their downed team-mates retake the field, while heroes who die in this endgame lose much of their score.Things can yo-yo very quickly, and while this can mean that the preceding drama feels as though it's more for show than anything, it's tense and exciting every time, and really does result in gang members waving their guns around at the shadows in terror, just as it should.It's a fair amount of fun, then, but it's also the kind of mode you will enjoy for an evening rather than a lifetime. Taken on those terms, it's a welcome inclusion.They also feed into Batman's tech tree, although this is one of the weaker areas of Arkham Origins. Batman is already well outfitted and his most useful additions - like the shock gloves, which allow him to power up electrical items and rain fizzly blows down in combat - are rewarded for making progress in the story, so I generally just invested my XP in tougher armour, which is a bit boring. Tech trees where you find yourself rooting around for the least uninspiring upgrade are always disappointing,			"

												Arkham Origins is a great game that doesn't deserve the flak it receives from most reviewers. Arkham Origins takes the gameplay mechanics from Arkham City - the responsive freeflow fighting mechanic demonstrating just how badass Batman is and the tightly coordinated predator rooms that allow multiple approaches - and combines it with a great storyline. If you enjoyed Arkham City, you'll enjoy this game. The gameplay isn’t much different from Arkham City. You’ll have some new/replaced items, some new enemy types are introduced, the city has been expanded and they added a new detective mini-game. Ultimately, these are only minor changes from the solid base that Arkham City created. The game doesn’t offer the revolutionary changes that Arkham City did compared to Arkham Asylum, but rather expands on it.The story features both well-known (Joker, Penguin, Bane) as lesser-known characters (Firefly, Shiva, Deadshot). Not every character is part of the main story, so it is advised to try and play the Most Wanted side missions for the full experience. The well-crafted Mad Hatter stage deserves a playthrough.At the time of writing, it appears WB patched most of the bugs. During my three playthroughs (new game, new game+ and I am the night mode, 100%, roughly 70 hours), as well as during the Cold Cold Heart DLC, I experienced only a single non-game breaking bug. This is coming from an inherently more bug-prone Crossfire system. You’ll see most negative reviews because of bugs are pre January 2014.Traditional rating: 8/10			"

												A lot of people are raging about Origins. They say that it's not as good as the last two games out of the Arkham series. They say it's bugged. They say that the multiplayer part is weak, buggy, not fun and instable.I say that I pre-loaded this game, played it at release day and had a lot of fun with it. Level 174 at multiplayer. I never experienced a game breaking bug. It's running very well on my casual rig (two year old pre-build pc 700€).Is it perfect? It's really close to perfect in my honest opinion. The story is thrilling, the gameplay is solid and fun, the muliplayer is a unique experience(3vs2vs3).Do you like action games with a good story where you don't have to necessary shoot people into the head? Get this masterpiece. You won't regret it!Ignore the trolls at the forums who are writing things like ""Deathstroke is not beatable!"" ""I can't press the two buttons to call the lift at the same time - game is broken"".			"

												Oh my, tough one!I loved Arkham City, but this game... I would suggest to get it if only you truly loved Arkham City.This game feels like DLC to Arkham City, nothing is really new (except few gadgeds, but some of them are pretty trivial - glue grenade that does exactly the same as freeze grenade in AC...), it is a prequel to AC therefore every piece of history that you have found in AC will be here (Blackmask, Mr Freeze (paid DLC!), Calendar Man, Croc etc.).Stories are interesting, I will not deny that. But it feels repetetive - there is no element of suprise cause most of the stuff you have already seen in AC. Fight system is the same, there are some new enemies but very few (like 1? or 2?).Map is bigger, it has a bridge to new part of Gotham, which was unavailable in AC. There is also fast travel (which was lacking in AC) which is ""a must be"" in recent games.To sum up, I feel dissatisfied. I thought I will get a game that will blow me away but instead I get game that feels like AC DLC. There was a huge gap (positive one) between Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Comparing 2 last productions I would say AO is worse :(. Buy this game only if love Batman universe or if you have loved Arkham City or if it's dirt cheap during sales (was -75% already). I really, really hope that Arkham Knight will be much better and will not give me♥♥♥♥♥♥aftertaste after completing it.			"

												A terrible sequel to an amazing series of games. Not only is the combat sluggish and far less responsive than in previous Arkham games, leading to a lot of punches to the face and loss of combo count, the game is riddled with a large amount of bugs including falling through the floor and being trapped in a room forever following your defeat of Deathstroke. Despite being a huge fan of the first two games, this one I rushed through as quickly as possible and avoided the vast majority of the extra content entirely.Overall Rating: 5/10			"

												There's definitely some re-tread going on with Batman: Arkham Origins, but the combat, the relatively good story (B-list villain aside), the powerful feeling of being Batman in video game form has only muted my enthusiasm for the franchise by the smallest of marginsBatman’s always made the shadows his ally, but in Batman: Arkham Origins, he finds the shadow of his own previous games impossible to escape from. It’s as good as Batman: Arkham City in most ways, having inherited an outstanding combat system, but it lacks interesting ideas of its own, and it’s missing the polish and attention to detail that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum great action gamesIts name, “Arkham Origins,” is a flagrant misnomer - it may be a prequel, but this story is neither about Arkham, nor is it an origin story in any significant way. It’s more of a traditional Batman plot that retreads some of The Dark Knight’s most familiar themes over its roughly eight hours of main story content: a self-destructive insistence on working alone, and how far he’ll go to avoid taking a life - a concept the final battle cleverly toys with. It’s a respectable plot that even concocts a plausible reason for Batman to face so many villains all in one night – a $50 million bounty on his head. But it’s the kind of prequel that screams “What were we thinking when we killed off that incredibly popular character? Undo! Undo!”The actors standing in for long-time Batman and Joker voices Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill do a good job in emulating their predecessors - Troy Baker’s Joker, in particular, is close enough that I might not have noticed immediately if I weren’t listening for it. Conroy will always be Batman for me, but his understudy does well enough.This younger Batman already has all his signature moves and gear, flies a fancy plane, and is on a first-name basis with pretty much every villain but The Joker. So at the cost of really selling the idea that these events happen prior to the other two games, Origins keeps the foundation of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City’s amazing combat intact, including every gadget in one form or another. (Mr. Freeze’s absence from the rogue’s gallery means the cryo-grenades are now concussion or glue grenades.)Two new enemy types add a little extra variety, notably the martial artists who can counter your attacks. But the only substantial change is one of those things that’s awesome for the first time you use it, but quickly reveals itself as a bad idea. The Shock Gauntlets are among the last gear you unlock, which is good, because once charged (by hitting a few guys in regular combat) and activated, they let you completely ignore everything that makes combat interesting. Riot shields, stun batons, armored thugs – Batman just punches ‘em. They’re basically a win button, and the kind of thing that doesn’t work in a prequel because why would Batman ever get rid of them?Meanwhile, in the stealth fights where Batman picks off armed thugs one by one, there’s another somewhat dirty-feeling win button: a remote grapple that strings up thugs without them even having to walk under a gargoyle. I found myself deliberately avoiding either of those gadgets, because I’m not in this to not fight criminals.Batman games are like pizza: even when they’re not very good, they’re still pretty good. Next to Arkham City, Arkham Origins is a bit of a disappointment in its lack of new ideas and use of win buttons, making it the least interesting of the trilogy. But as excuses to dive back into the excellent free-flowing combat and predator takedowns go, this story isn’t bad.			"

												I recommend this game...Well...it's a batman game so it could not be bad. The story is amazing,the battle is excellent,flying as batman is one of the things that made arkham series so ''top''. I could say that it is a copy of arkham city,as many times there are characters that do the same things as many characters in arkham city.If you're thinking to buy an arkham series game,i'd suggest you buy batman arkham asylum-->batman arkham city-->batman arkham origins....I think that origins is the worst one.I have played all of them on my ps3 and arkham city and origins on my pc( I have completed the story many times).   Batman arkham city > Batman Arkham asylum >Batman Arkham origins >Batman Arkham Blackgate Have not played Arkham knight yet.			"

												It's Arkham, It's Batman. Need I say more? Just don't expect the improvements like Asylum to City, since it isn't Rocksteady. I wish WB had been more daring with it, it's like they were too scared to alienate fans instead of trying out new things. Don't expect anything terribly fresh. It's largely a copy and paste of Arkham City, which, don't get me wrong, isn't a bad thing. Unfortunately the few changes they did make frustrate the heck out of me. I'll update if I find anything else, but I think I've explored most of the games mechanics by now.Pros: Boss fights: Bossfights are fantastic, infinitely better than rocksteady's to be honest, well, a few of them. (poison ivy anyone?) I've had a few so far, but the Deathstroke and Shiva fights were fantastic. Copperhead as well, can't wait to see what comes next. I loved the challenge, and getting the perfect completion trophies was a great was to test my skills. Few generic fights that every game has, but overall they've been great.Open world: lots of enemies, plenty to explore. Alot of the side missions are unlocked by story progression, so expect to be locked into that. If you liked the design of City, it carries into here.Crimes in Progress: I love these. Usually a tough group of enemies, nice difficulty, just don't expect to wrack up good combos without mashing dodge 24/7 (see below)Cons: (so far)Combat: I wish they had copy and pasted it. I wish. Enemies are extremely aggressive, and youll often find yourself being punched in the face while trying to perform a simple strike, and since batman moves in slow mo you cant hit and counter in time. If you played Arkham City to death like I did, youll notice. It's not obvious, but any veteran of those series will feel the slight change. Its ridiculously frustrating how hard it is to maintain any sort of combo without mashing dodge and striking once. The thugs will teleport punch to you, so even if you use freeflow to move 10 feet away, he'll somehow still hit you. I cant even batclaw slam without being punched in the middle of the slam and they weren't anywhere nearby. Really? EDIT: i tried out the combat challenge mode, and the combat feels totally different. Very quick and responsive, felt even faster than it was in previous Arkham iterations. (Deathstroke is so fast i can barely follow how fast he strikes in focus flow) Not sure why its so different.Collectibles: Scan tags, collect data packs, batarang network relays, interrogate informers. All a copy of different systems used in Arkham City and Harley Quinn DLC. I wouldnt mind but its all so mindless, I've yet to encounter a single challenging puzzle like I did in City. Got all the collectibles in City and had a blast. Here it feels like a chore.Flying: I often find it really difficult to simply shoot to the top of a building and boost past. It likes to select the fire escape on the side of the building and makes it incredibly frustrating to get anywhere quickly. And expect alot of flying around, since you cant unlock all the fast travel points from the get go and the drop points can be rather far from the edge of district.Upgrade Trees: I hate these. I hate these with a passion. I get it, its Batman starting out, he has to learn. Anyone who has experience with poorly designed upgrade trees knows what I'm talking about. Oh yeah, by the way, you HAVE to complete challenges in game to get some of the gagdets. They aren't too hard, but it took too long to get my damn sonic batarang.It's a great game, if you loved Asylum and City you'll enjoy it, just don't expect anything too amazing. Hopefully Knight will remedy all the mistakes here.			"

This is my first Batman game and this game was better than expected. I know how many people have been saying it is not that good because it was not from rocksteady, but i think warner bros did better than expected. you could tell they wanted to make the game as good as the other ones from rocksteady and i think they did.

The Good:* Almost as good as Arkham City* Graphics are smoother than Arkham City* Story seems entertaining (I didn't bother finishing)* Good voice acting* Rewarding challenges systemThe Bad:* Combat is copied from Arkham City and exacerbated* Traveling is annoying* Quick Time Events aplenty* Monotonous and uninteresting environment* Repetitive gameplay* Exploitable combat* Electric glove things make combat far too easy* Atmosphere of the city is uninspired and dullBottom line:If you're looking for Arkham City with a combat system that's almost as good, slower and repetitive gameplay and quick time event-enriched boss fights, finished off with an open-world that you'd rather use fast transport to get around in, then this game is for you.TL;DR:Buy Arkham City.

												I loved the new approach of Arkham Origins;Nobody knows batman in Gotham City, you're just a ""Legend"". We can live the first meeting with the Joker, Gordon, or even his daughter, Barbara (who will become Oracle).If you are a fan of Batman, you just can't miss this game. In my opinion, this is the most exciting story of the 3 games.Gameplay is just like Arkham City, with a few adds, so... perfect.Graphics are almost the same too, Gotham is beautiful in the snow, and the atmosphere of Christmas Eve is ♥♥♥♥ing great.I though that challenges are easier than previous ones, a lot of them need just one try.Well, this game is not a Revolution, Arkham City was. But you can't pass out on this one if you liked Arkham City, and want more. "

												The game fell somewhat short compared to ""Arkham City"", but it did not fail to entertain me with its well written and directed story.  If you've played Arkham city you will be disappointed on the lack of innovation and or changes. Flying around the city is actually boring when you've already used several hours flying around in the previous game. Luckily you are able to fast travel with the Batwing.  I forgive them for making it so, with it being weird if Arkham looked completely different from the Arkham City game. Still I think it was a little sloppy as it looks like a copy-paste from the previous game with some new content and stories.   In all it's kinda like an expensive DLC, I bought this on sale so I cannot say I really regret buying it as it was lot's of fun. Just keep in mind that it's pretty much the same as Arkham city, just with some new villains and what not			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the Prequel-Sequel to the previous 2 Arkham games. Developed and published by WB Montreal instead of Rocksteady, one might be turned off to the idea of this game and would be unwilling to give the game a try. I disagree. Here's why:Arkham Origins takes place a few years before Arkham Asylum, 2 years after Bruce Wayne donned the cowl of Batman. One of the leading criminals, Black Mask, is tired of Batman ruining his plans and sends 10 elite mercenaries (some more elite than others) to kill Batman in one night, Christmas Eve, for 50 million dollars. The story mainly follows Batman evading and defeating the mercs, as well as chasing down the Black Mask. As with Arkham City, there are a few twists and turns along the way, bringing a good time to the game.The ""Origins"" part of the game is very interesting, as it explores the origins of the Joker as the Red Hood (canon in the comics), if not only breifly. It also explores the stuggle Batman is having with himself and how he feels the need to protect gotham from itself and all the super-criminals.Although the voice actors for Batman and the Joker are not the regular that we all know and love (Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy), the replacements that WB Montreal found are absolutely a great substitute. While not the actors that made the characters what they are, the performances were far from sub-par, and should not be the factor that keeps you from playing the game. You can tell that the actors tried very hard to keep the roles what they were, in order to preserve the legacy. The actor who plays the Joker does a phenomenal job, and I did not even realize that the actor was not Mark Hamill until I heard his monologue around half-way through the game. The Batman actor is a bit more noticeable but nothing to complain about.The map is bigger than Arkham City's, and feels as such. There are plenty of side activities to do when you are tired of (or done with) the main story. The most fun of all of these is definitely the Crime Scenes that you can come across, and pretty much ""solve"" murders and thefts. There are also radio towers that Enigma (The Riddler) has hacked. These can be restored through fighting through enemies and using your cryptographic sequencer. This is recommended to do as each tower you restore unlocks the district for fast travel, which signifigantly increases the speed of play. The combat and gameplay is not very different from Arkham City or Asylum's, but this isn't a problem to me, as the combat does not need to be changed too much. There are 2 new enemies to fight, the martial arts expert, and Bane's super enforcers. While adding some diversity to the combat, it can feel repetitive at times, and I found myself avoiding combat situations and crime calls during the free roam parts of the game. Overall, this game is a great addition to the Arkham series, even if not near close to the best game in the franchise, and if you plan to play through all of the games, do not forget Arkham Origins. Though nowhere near a perfect game, I personally find it a better game than Arkham City.8.4/10			"

												I'm conflicted about this game.  On the one hand its a very solid title.  Despite it being an obvious cash in on the Arkham series because WB couldn't wait for Knight to reach store shelves it still offers a lot of Batman kicking♥♥♥♥♥enjoyment.  The thing is people are very divisive about this game.  Either its the best in the series or its the worst.  Its just City with a new paint job don't kid yourselves.  City perfected the formula and Origins just came in and said why fix what ain't broke?The gameplay is so similar to City that you wouldn't even know a difference if it was an expansion pack.  The gadgets feel more gimmicky when in previous games they had a practical application.  The remote claw replaces the line launcher and while its amusing it also makes predator sections even more brainlessly easy when they were already easy.  Who needs to actually stealthily take down baddies with guns when you can hook them to things and each other and take out 5/6 of the room without even moving?  On the flipside combat seems to have gotten harder with counters being a little different in timing and its a lot harder to hold up bigger combos when more variety in enemy types like venom brutes and martial arts experts.  The shock gloves feel like just evening things out at this point.The story is probably this game's strongest part.  Without spoiling much this is Batman early in his career.  He's more stubborn and hot headed.  One of my favorite parts is Gordon and how his character progresses through the story and how he distrusts Batman and thats a really cool dynamic.  Young Barbara already got the inkling to become oracle here as well.  They do a really cool plot twist that is just as disapointing and I wont spoil it here.  I will say that Bane is the strongest part IMO.  As someone who has been waiting for a proper bane in something I am so happy with how they treated him here.  It also kinda helps explain why is the way he is in previous games.  Read the Knightfall comic storyline and see why not even Dark Knight Rises got Bane right IMO.I'm just rambling at this point.  I'm a big Batman nerd if you couldn't tell lol.Also shout out to the awesome voice acting across the board.Finally the last thing I want to talk about is the open world.  This worked so well in City beacause it was all interesting.  It was densly packed and felt bigger than it actually was.  In this case its feels empty.   It feels like a city built around a video game instead of a video game built around the city.  Sense of scope is all scewed.  Parked cars all look like they were designed for midgets.  It doesn't look like a city at all.  It looks like a close up of a model city.  People complained about the riddler trophies in City and how many they were and how they got ""annoying getting them all"" but at least those were interesting to get.  In this there is literally no challenge to getting any of them.  Errr I mean Enigma data packs :/.  You come across one and 5 seconds in you either have the gadget capable of getting it or you don't and move on.  This is actually its saving grace because prepare yourself for this game's biggest let down.  There is no reason to getting these.  Some XP and a little throwback to previous games.  Catching Riddler in City had a point.  He had hostages.  He needed to be dealt with.  He was a real threat and there was more to it than just collecting♥♥♥♥♥♥like an old 90s platformer.....  In this he's  blackmailing criminals and Batman has to stop that because.........  thats worse than beating them up?  Ok then well the completionist in me hated this.  There was no fun in getting them and absolutely no pay off because you don't even catch him.  Save the time and ignore this part of the game and it will be much more enjoyable I promise you.So TL:DR gameplay is almost exactly the same as Arkham City.  Story is cool.  Game map and side missions are lame and boring.  The good outweigh the bad.  If you like Batman you'll enjoy this.			"

												This game gets more hate than it deserves, it's definitely not the worst Arkham game. For one the boss fights alone make this game worth it, the deathstroke fight is one of the most enjoyable boss fights I can think of. One problem I had with this game was the map, it IS a done up version of City's map, just with more snow and less closed in gates, while it does include the extra portion of map, it still feels flat and dead compared to city. I'd give this game an A+ in gameplay and an F in map design. 3rd best in the franchise.			"

												Have you played the previous Arkham games? No? Then do yourself a favor and don't start with Arkham Origins.If you played the others and liked it then you'll likely enjoy this one as well. It is inferior in many ways though, and I'll try to make a comparison of the most pertinent aspects below.Did you enjoy the story hinted on the trailers? If so, I'm  sorry to say this but you'll be disappointed. I won't spoil the surprise (even though I find it hard to believe it's a surprise to anyone by now) but there's a very obvious twist that simply negates the whole story advertised in the trailers. After the disappointment with the story passed I actually quite enjoyed it though! there are some interesting moments and characters. Nothing fantastic but it does its job competently.  Considering this is a prequel they certainly made some strange decisions reagarding the story. We know the villains, we know Alfred never dies, we know Batman doesn't die etc. These things can't really be used as tension effectively, but they certainly tried. They should have used the opportunity to introduce some new characters and put some real tension in there, but that's my opinion.But the true problem with this game is the obvious lack of polish. Bugs, glitches, freezes,crashes, performance drops... you name it, Arkham Origins has it. The lack of polish also shows on most of the gameplay features. A few examples: when in combat mode, the camera will be your worst enemy, showing the wall, hiding behind light posts, losing sight of batman or, when not being completely against you, just sitting the least helpful orientation possible with every enemy on the wrong side of the camera. Other example of lack of polish in gameplay is when gliding accross the city. You'll find yourself frustrated by the grapple's edge detection system. It has the habit of not detecting obvious edges you can see right in front of you, sometimes detecting edges you have no intention of grappling to etc. It's a less satisfying experience to say the least. These examples just illustrate the way the game was rushed to the shelves. It lacks polish, the kind of things solved by tweaking of parameters until everything feels right.My last complaint is the zipline feature. This was one of the fun things in other games, all you needed was a wall behind and in front of you to zip accross it! Fun and a gameplay element that opens up so many possibilities. In this game they ditched that for a zip line you can attach to nodes that are put on the map by the level designer. It's so boring. It's essentially a door/key system in disguise. A very similar dumb move was made by Thief developers when ditching the freedom of rope arrows in favor of predetermined nodes where you can put your rope. It's just a fancy key to a door.It's hard to find something they did better than previous games. I like the graphics a lot! but it's not exactly better, it's just different, more realistic style. But I do welcome the different approach, it looks very nice.If we weren't comparing with previous Batmans (which admittedly is a difficult position for any game to be in) I would say the bugs are the main problem with it. Some of them are absolutely game breaking! but if you can endure that this is a great game. It has my recommendation.			"

												*Contains minor spoilers*I’ve been a fan of the Arkham games since Asylum, and they never fail to impress. That being said, Origins feels like a step backwards from its predecessor, Arkham City.Based during the early years of Batman’s career, the game focuses on a plot by the infamous crime lord, the Black Mask. I’m not familiar with the comics, so I was very happy to see a new primary antagonist replacing the Joker. The only problem was that Black Mask wasn’t the primary antagonist; it was surprise surprise, the Joker AGAIN. It was during the unveiling of this revelation that I became upset with Origins. I understand that he’s Batman’s arch enemy, but he had such a large role in the previous two games that I just wanted a break from his jokes. It became so much easier to compare the game to Arkham City, which was not a good idea.The previous game, Arkham City, had a very deep and original setting. A prison city that was filled with Gotham’s worst criminals was very interesting. In contrast, Origins features a Gotham city roughly twice the size, but only half as interesting. Random criminals prowl the streets and no sign of other life can be found. I wanted cars, pedestrians, and so much more. I expected a living city.There were parts of the game that impressed me though. I really liked the upgrade system. It’s still quite basic, but a definite step up from previous games that pretty much unlocked half of the upgrades from the get go. They added some cool new gadgets that I used quite often. As for the bad guys, I felt they didn’t have enough screen time. One by one they showed up, you fought with them for 15 minutes, and that was the end of them. In particular, the fight against Deathstroke was one of the greatest boss battles I’ve ever played, but after beating it, he never made a return. What’s more disappointing was that his character was only available to play as in the boring and mostly generic challenge maps, rather than the actual campaign. Some of the other villains came and went without me really remembering them at all cough cough Electrocutioner. It kind of felt like Warner Brothers sold the game on the premise that there would be plenty of bad guys to go around, but delivered a mediocre performance from them. Quality is always better than quantity in my opinion.The multiplayer is a new addition to the franchise and I don’t really know how to describe it. I feel as though the game didn’t need it and it was an attempt to get people to continue to play the game. There are times when it’s quite enjoyable, but I always felt as though it needed to be re-worked based on certain over-powered features such as the criminals detective vision.Despite the uninspiring plot twist, the often annoying multiplayer, and the incredibly familiar gameplay, the game wasn’t that bad. I wasn’t too upset, but wasn’t too impressed either. I can safely say it felt like a 6/10 experience on the whole. Worth playing if you like the Joker, not so much if you wanted more.        "

												Oneday maybe they'll make a game called ""Batman in Atlantis.""  Or ""Batman on Krypton.""  Or ""Batman in Metropolis.""  But everyone knows Batman spends his nights in Gotham.When Rocksteady made ""Arkham Asylum,"" it was the best Batman game ever.  It was the closest thing to ""being Batman."" The only downside was that you were being Batman somewhere other than Gotham.  Can you imagine a Batman game on the moon?  It wouldn't be the same, would it?  Batman walks the rooftops and swoops down on dark alleys.  He doesn't spend 365 nights a year in prison corridors.He guards Gotham City.""Arkham City"" took that into account.  But the aesthetic of an abandoned city district turned into a live-in prison is not the glass mountains of the financial district.It's not Gotham.""Arkham Knight"" finally brought us the giant metropolis of Gotham City, rooftop by rooftop, high-rise by high-rise.  With the Batmobile itself to fling around corners in fiery abandon.  Batman: Check.  Batmobile: Check.  Gotham: Check.  Everything was finally in place.  It's a masterpiece.  The summation of decades of Batman stories and runs.  But between ""City"" and ""Knight"" lies ""Origins.""""Origins"" was the game that first left Arkham behind, with it's crazed lunatics and asylum setting.  It's prison decor and cockroaches.  There was good stuff there.  But it was a Batman story on the edge of canon.  With ""Titan Joker"" it simply walked up to that edge and jumped off.  And it's that very plot point that is integral to the entire Arkhamverse.""Origins"" left behind the ever more insane antics of villians from ""Asylum"" and ""City,"" and boiled Batman down to his essence.  A crimefighter.  A detective.  You know, DC, ""Detective Comics.""  It's got more ""police procedural"" in it than any of the others.  Rocksteady made games about Batman losing his sanity.  ""Origins"" is about keeping a cool head and following the clues.  All while the mob has a contract out on your head.""Origins"" left the asylum behind.  It paved the way for ""Arkham Knight.""It brought us Gotham City.			"

Yes, Arkham Origins has stellar vocal performances, lovely physics effects, and the same punching and sneaking you expect from the Arkham franchise. But it's really obvious that the devs were just copying what was done in Arkham City and tripping and falling short. Even now, when most of the PC glitches have been ironed out, the game hiccups, acts wierd, arbitrarily blocks your path, and just feels off somehow. Multiplayer feels even MORE strange. Going back and forth between SP and MP is not recommended as you'll find what works in one, gets you killed in the other. "

												A decent title that stands in the shadow of the two games in the same vein that appeared before it, Batman Arkham Origins is a hard title to recommend even to fans of the other two games. The gameplay copies the other two titles to a T, with no originality thrown in. This is made worse since the combat in the other games flowed much better and this game generally has a small list of bugs. The story is very run of the mill, I found myself extremely disappointed as it started running over old villans for the third time now instead of using the newer villans to greater effect. The game does so little to make itself different from the others, and is so sloppy in execution that the game drags on towards the end.6/10 If you're a fan you can consider getting it on sale, but as a large fan of the past two games I honestly regret the time I spent playing this. Still a great game for completionists with too much free time, and it's not entirely half bad. However Bam Ham Origins would be better to rest in the grave while we wait for the new title from the original team.			"

												I must admit City had a bit more to offer than origins but I must say the game feels good and story is quite over the board...The voice acting is over the top and Troy Baker really nailed up The Joker and was pretty amazing , Origin also features a new evidence scanner which brings out a feel of a real detective .If you are and Batman enthusiast then it's a no brainer , do your self a favour a buy origins :) If not then really this game doesnt offer much if compared to city in general...

												Ehh... it's okay.This one isn't made by the same people that did Arkham Asylum/City, but it plays pretty much exactly the same. And since that was already good gameplay there's little more I can say about it. The story takes place when Batman is still relatively new at his work apparently, but the only real way you see it is in how other characters act towards you. Otherwise, all the skills and gadgets are there for you to use. So it all feels kind of disingenous when everyone acts like you are this new vigilante who might not actually be real, but you have the full skillset of the Batman that everyone later knows. Not exactly what this game said its Batman was like.One highlight of sorts is the voice acting: Batman and the Joker got new VA's for this, and yet I couldn't really tell the difference. They both sound close enough to Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill that, had I not known in advance that the latter wasn't the Joker anymore, I wouldn't have forced myself to look it up to check for sure. So I guess that's something. Oh, and our new Joker is the same guy who voiced Booker Dewitt from Bioshock Infinite. I thought that was neat.I can't call this a bad game, but I wasn't really into it either. I'll give this a ""yes"" because there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this game, but it is, without a doubt, the weakest entry in the ""Arkham"" series thus far.Maybe i'm just annoyed I won't 100% this game because it has multiplayer achievements.

												Batman: Arkham Origins manages to be the worst Arkham game that, disappointingly, barely does enough to justify its asking price of £30, especially if you have played Arkham City. Lets start with the good things. - The story in Origins is very good, possibly the best out of the current trilogy. While there are pacing problems, the overall plot is deep, thought out and even manages to surprise in a few areas. - Sound design and the soundtrack are superb; feeling like they had a real production value and weren't just simply overlooked. (unlike some other things) - The voice acting is incredible, for the most part, with Troy Baker as The Joker stealing the show. (though Roger Craig Smith as Batman does a pretty good job at emulating Kevin Conroy from previous games) I must admit it's jarring to hear Batman's voice at first, (being so used to Conroy's work) but it doesn't take long to get acclimatised, with halfway through the game, barely noticing the difference.- The game manages a decent length of around 10-12 hours for the main story.Now on to the negatives.- The game world, while being of a decent size, is too cumbersome to travel round. Most of your time in the open world will be spent travelling from A to B by grappling rooftops. The fast travel does alleviate this, but you have to unlock the various points by overtaking radio towers as side missions, making the whole thing feeling a bit like too much work.  - Most of the side missions are now completely seperated from the main plot, they are now mostly unintresting and uninspiring filler.- The combat is only slightly improved from City, and with the inclusion of the new shock gloves, makes it far too easy to beat enemies.- Most of the little refrences and in-jokes to other DC comics which made the previous games that little bit more awesome are gone, it feels like most of the devs aren't as passionate as Rocksteady and it would have be nice for a couple of easter eggs here and there. - The first part of the plot (about the assassins) doesn't quite gel with the rest of the story and feels like an excuse to shoe horn some D-list DC villans. - The Penguin's 'assistants' are some of the worst characters I have ever seen in a Batman game. Plus the thick (what I assume is meant to be cockney) accent of one of them is so horrible, it's on par with Bolo Santosi in Just Cause 2.  - While I haven't played much of the multiplayer and while it was fun, it lacks depth to keep my interest, making it only passable at best.- The biggest flaw of Arkham Origins, however, is its MOUNTAIN OF BUGS. While most of the game breaking bugs have been reportedly fixed, there are still a plethora of visual bugs, such as the skybox having circular clouds covering it, textures spazzing out and not unlocking certain areas of the game. Fortunately, in my personal experience, all it needs it a checkpoint restart. Others haven't been so lucky. As WB Montreal aren't fixing the game anymore a minority will most likely never finish the game, buy at your own risk.This game is nowhere near worth its full asking price, and some of it is really good and well done, which only makes it more painful to say that if you have never played the Arkham games NEVER EVER PLAY THIS. If you have played the previous two then wait for a sale, only then it will be worth at least a vague look.4/10			"

												The game has numerous glitches which can prevent you from completing the game. After posting on the official forums the only advice I've received is to start over, as WB has no intentions of fixing these bugs. WB completely dropped the ball on this game, I would not recommend purchasing it. At least they seem to have learned their lesson as they are handing the developer reins back to Rocksteady for the next installment [Arkham Knight] and sticking with publishing.			"

												Batman : Arkham Origins is yet another installment in the popular Arkham series, but it doesn't fall in line with the other 2 games seeing as developement was handled by WB Montreal. Right off the bat I'd like to say that WB did a great job with this game considering how new they are as a studio. Yes, when you start playing, you'll see a different, slightly more cartoonish batman, you'll eventually get over it. The first few hours will feel very empty and pretty much dissapointing, if you have played the other 2 games of this series. The overworld feels empty, geometry detail is very simplified even with DX11 effects enabled. Overall the mood was pretty badly executed as far as the city itself goes. You will only see impressive visual and level design once you go indoors, where lights are elaborate, cinematic and colorful. Colour is much more abundant this time. The combat system, both predator (stealth) and close up combat, remain pretty much identical to previous versions, aside from a few superficial changes like sounds. There is however a new mechanic that increases your damage output towards the second half of the story, but I don't want to spoil that for you. I found that close up combat felt more satisfying than stealth, simply because the stealth rooms were not designed for you to be creative, really. Rocksteady made extremely enjoyable stealth challenges, and WB basically was not capable of getting anywheres near that level of intricate design. All you really have to do in these sections is grapple around, wait for an enemy to seclude himself from the others, and take him down by gliding behind him and performing a silent takedown, rinse and repeat. So basically, this time close up completely trumps stealth, where as I found in City and Assylum, the stealth was more enjoyable than close up. Gadgets remain from the previous games, some replaced by something similar, essentially reskinning previous ideas. The main thing that WB really did right this time, is the storytelling, and the way you progress through the game. Arkham City's progression was fairly short, focused and let's face it, not very complex. Origins obviously tells the story of Batman's beginning, when he was considered a criminal just like the Joker, or Black Mask. Although Batman remains fairly emotionally flat, he lets out a lot of steam, and even interrogates many enemies through semi-torture, something that was rarely adressed before. Batman seems weaker in this game, he is actually a real, relatable person, in some ways. There is a sense of character progression that was completely absent in the other games. Hell, you even finally see some sort of relation between Batman and Joker that actually makes some sense, and let me tell you that relation becomes extremely interesting, and at times it almost seemed that Joker admired Batman, or even loved him. TL:DR: Origins is a narrative experience, lacking the immersion of the previous 2 games but replacing that with a cohesive, understandable story with much more variety. Is it better than the others? No. but is it worse? I can't really say that, either.It is definitely worth the price that I got it at, during the summer sale.			"

												Being an Arkham ""ORIGINS"" game: it's a prequel! And it both sucks and rules at the same time. The success of the prequel comes from the story aspect where WB Montreal explains how ""wuvable B-Man"" met around 10-12 of the Batman franchise characters! This will include Deadshot, Jim Gordon, Barbara Gordon (and her secret identity ^^), and some bosses I was really looking forward to, as seen in the trailers: Copperhead and DeathStroke!The prequel nature of this title debacles in the gameplay aspect since at the start you have more twice the♥♥♥♥♥♥you had in the beginning of Arkham City! This includes the Grappnel Accelerator, among other useful gadgets.The gameplay is the same as AC (some small tweaks and combat gadgets have been added) which is great! Now animations feel a bit more fluid but Batman feels slightly slower overall. You see, in Arkham City, you could punch a guy so fast he couldn't punch/counter. In Origins combat, while very familiar, feels harder and requires more skill from the player.You should also be happy to know that the game works perfectly with mouse and keyboard and the PC port is really good!The graphics are an overall improvement over Arkham City, snow effects are f*cking extraordinary: easily the best I've ever seen! Particle effects are also really fantastic and the punch sounds are beefy and powerful and you feel like a badass!Like said above, sound design is solid! The enemy's guns sound like guns, specially the freaking snipers which are really annoying since they take around 40% of your health per-shot! Every time you punch a guy you feel like you are going to get your whole arms through the thug's face! Moving to the story: It's the best of the Arkham franchise! It's well done, it has enough twists and ""Holy-sh*t! Awesome!"" moments to keep you pumped until the very end, which is satisfying enough (since it's a prequel, the previous 2 games follow the events of this game, so this game's ending isn't a conclusion to the batman games by any stretch of the imagination!).This game also has cool enough side missions to give you a few more gameplay hours without outright boring you from the beginning! I must highlight the 2 assassin/boss side quests!Another thing this game pulls off really well are the boss fights! They all feel different, varied and try to put the various gadgets you have to good use!Origins is also the first Batman Arkham game to have a Multiplayer mode! Is it good? Yeah! The concept is genious and a nice variation over the standard Multiplayer modes. The are 3 teams, 2 of them are standard thugs with guns (the 3rd-person view and handling is surprisingly good! Guns also feel good, surprisingly enough!), the other team is of 2 players (where one is robin and another is batman, and they play nicely, just like in the single player (well, batman that is, you can't play as robin...but he plays exactly like batman but with a bullet shield. He plays just like Batman Arkham City (both the Robin DLC and the Harley Quinn DLC) which is nice!).The Multiplayer customization is vast and extremely deep, it has packs that you get by completing stuff in the SP campaign and MP challenges and stuff like that. There are many guns and level ups in the thugs! As for Batman and Robin it's isn't as varied and deep, but that was kind of expected...My biggest problem with the multiplayer is definately the matchmaking system: it's console ported and it doesn't work very well...it never does, anyways...You will have lag throughout your gameplay sessions but nothing gameplay-breaking! It's perfectly servicable and compared to other bullsh*tty matchmaking games like Aliens: Colonial Marines, Arkham Origins works amazingly well!Overall the game seems kinda perfect, doesn't it? Yeah, almost: It's launch was a disaster (I've seen worse trainwrecks though!) and right now, it has like a bug or two very far in-between and sometimes enemies will get stuck on the terrain causing you to sometimes break your whole combo chain. But since I'm not a combo-chain junky, I didn't mind that. I was more worried about the questionable geometry overall: sometimes there are very small places where you can be and right at the side, you can't. You can't crouch and pass under a pipe when in some other, narrower places, you can, among other annoying stuff. But this is really far in-between and don't break the experience at all. I never got stuck in terrain or anything like that, which is swell! :DOverall, what's wrong with this game is: rare but annoyingly low res textures! Mediocre matchmaking system! Anti-climactic bossfights: (Shiva and Deadshot come to mind) and Bane's is repeated like 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times!Nothing that stops me from recommending it at full retail price of 49,99€ or regional equivalent (I bet Australian pricing is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so there you have it..)-It's easily a 9/10, one of my GOTY nomenees and overall I'd say it beats Arkham City in terms of gameplay, gadgets, boss fights, etc. (well, except the fact that AC was 100% fluid bug-free gameplay and it was highly detailed. Origins is more unpolished than it's predecessor, sadly...)-So that is it, my review of Origins, I think I'll do Dishonored after this, I've already been vastly asked to so a review on it.EDITED FOR TYPOS			"

												Batman: AO seems to get a lot of hate, not only from the media but fans alike. I didn't purchase the game at launch but from what I understand there were quite a few game-breaking bugs and many complained about their being a lack of ""innovation"" in the games core mechanics.  I've already got about 25hrs invested running on DX11 ultra settings and haven't run into the issues that many have reported. That being said, this is probably my favorite out of the Arkham trilogy due the story, characters, and refinement in combat as well as many of the other ideas that have been fully fleshed out over the past two games. The voice acting of Roger Craig Smith (Batman) and Troy Baker (The Joker) works well, albeit Kevin Conroy & Mark Hamill will be missed going forward. Thumbs up!			"

												PROS: It has an interesting plot. The predator sections work pretty well.CONS: Where do I begin?The combat is buggy and does not work well. It often seems like the game is designed to make you break your combo. Counters don't always work. In fact on the harder difficulty you have less time to counter, but the counter indicators stay up – meaning you can think you can counter when you can't. Or Batman will just refuse to counter. Or your combo will just drop for no good reason. I've run into other glitches as well, where quickfire gadgets will just not work, causing the combo to drop. The camera also tends to be too close to Batman, meaning characters can hit you from off-camera and give you no opportunity to counter or even know they were there. Brutes do unblockable attacks and can't be taken down with special combo moves, and you'll often be fighting them in a narrow space with barely any room to dodge.The combat locations are also frequently badly designed, as fights occur in closed-in spaces that give you little space to maneuver and plenty of space for the camera to get stuck. In one case I think I was fighting five guys, one with a shield, in a space the size of an elevator.The abilities tree is also annoying. Many of the most useful special abilities are locked off until later sections of the game and require the completion of entire separate sidequests. For example, disarm and destroy – one of the best ways to deal with shields, guns, and stun batons – cannot be obtained until completing a sidequest that does not appear until the game is three-fourths completed. The grapnel disarm is also locked off until at least halfway through the game.The 'challenges' are also extremely annoying because they, too, are tiered. And worse they don't 'stack' and several special abilities are easily lost forever because they require grinding out challenges that can ONLY be completed in a few areas that do not respawn. If you want the sonic shock batarang, better get Worst Nightmare Rank 6 completed in the bank during the first time you are there or you'll have to do it during the Deadshot mission. You get two chances. Enjoy. If you want to unlock the Dark Knight skin you will spend a lot of the game grinding out challenges.The checkpoints are also badly located. If you need to restart a predator room, for example, it won't save when you begin, so you will often have to spend a minute or two to get back to the room and probably go through an unskippable cutscene, which can be annoying when you need to redo a room to try and complete something very specific and easy to mess up (like knock three people down with one propane tank).I should discuss the boss battles as well. Many people seem to enjoy them but I did not. The Deathstroke battle was really a glorified QTE in terms of how it worked. The Firefly fight was a mixture of QTE, dodging and using the same quickfire gadgets over and over. And the Bane fight was a more annoying and less-good version of the fight from Arkham Asylum. I felt the Mr Freeze fight in Arkham City was by far the best Arkham boss battle and nothing here is close.I find this game immensely frustrating. I've played the other Arkham games – Asylum, City and Knight – and I just cannot like this game. The plot is interesting. But the actual gameplay is so irritating I find myself screaming in rage. Play the other games. Skip this one.			"

												The most important question you have to ask yourself, when considering whether or not to purchase Batman Arkham Origins, is ""what do I want from a sequel?"". If you want innovation, you will be disappointed. If you want the same content that you've previously enjoyed, you will be satisfied.I personally fall into the second category. I could name several games whose sequels have alienated their existing fanbase by changing too much, so I won't criticise Origins for sticking with a successful formula.Origins is almost identical to City, in terms of gameplay mechanics and mission structure. We still have the small scale open world of Gotham, which allows us to take on secondary missions against the lower profile villains in any order. We still have the story missions, which are more linear, require the use of gadgets to bypass obstacles, contain a mixture of direct and stealth combat, and finish with a boss fight against one of the more high profile villains. And we still have the mild puzzle element provided by the Riddler trophies.Combat is as fluid and tactical as always, combining attacks, counters, dodges, gadgets and takedowns, along with a variety of enemy types, some of which require specific moves to penetrate their defences. There are a few new gadgets/abilities, but nothing really revolutionary. I quite like the shock gloves though, which charge up as you hit people, and when activated will add electricity damage to Batman's punches.The story is okay, but it suffers from the same problem that every prequel will in my eyes. I already know what happens later, so I know certain events cannot possibly happen. For example, when certain characters are in life or death situations, but I know they are alive in Asylum or City, I know they cannot possibly die in Origins, which makes those scenes lack the tension they should have. However, I did like that a few different villains were worked in, which allowed me to expand my knowledge of the Batman universe.Origins is very good from a technical point of view. The graphics are fantastic, although maybe there's more of a wow factor for me because I played the previous two games on my Xbox 360. The level of detail in the backgrounds, such as shop signs and wall posters, really brings Gotham to life. However I did have to turn off some PhysX smoke effects to get a consistent framerate. Voice acting is pretty good. I was worried about the changes to key roles, especially losing Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, but this wasn't a problem and their replacements did a good job.I played with a 360 pad because that's what I'm familiar with for this series, and it worked perfectly on this PC version. I didn't notice any bugs at all. Length depends on how interested you are in hunting down all the Riddler stuff, but I've gone over 20 hours and still have things to do, so value for money is great.			"

												Bah.Arkham Asylum was quite great back in the day. Arkham City expanded and improved on that. In both cases, the story was great, the characters memorable, the gameplay amazing. Arkham Origins exacerbates things like Riddler's enigmas and boring sidequests, while the main plot is boring, garbled, and kept me wondering all the time: ""why am I doing what I'm doing exactly?""The crime scenes investigations make little to no sense, and it's not even a fun gameplay system. And the rest of the gameplay? It's basically a reskinning of Arkham City. Not worth it, believe me. Skip this title. It actually got me bored with Batman altogehter.			"

												Arkham Origins exceeds on a technical level, having some really good looking character models and good looking environments. As mentioned it doesn't feel as alive as it could be, but it's not a bad looking game by any means. The soundtrack is one of the biggest rewards here. It's a really good one. About what you'd expect from an Arkham game. The only thing that keeps Arkham Origins down is that so much of it feels like a retread of familiar territory. There's nothing here that really tries to build on the foundation of what was already established in the game before it. Arkham City did a good job of building up on what was established in Asylum despite having a lot of familiar gameplay. It feels like the developers here were playing it safe. The good news is that Origins isn't a step back. It's just not a big step forward. It does have it where it counts, though. A strong story and a good narrative to accompany it. If you liked the previous Arkham games then Origins is worth your time.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins should have been a standalone expansion to the Arkham series.A quick note about glitches: from the 20 hours of gameplay, I encountered some animation bugs but sadly, one major bug that would not let me finish the game with keyboard and mouse at the climax of the game in the chapel.While everybody is talking about the game being riddled with bugs, I cannot help but feel that Arkham Origins was made to cash in on the popularity of the Arkham series. While the story that is set on Christmas Eve is neat, the writing is sloppy, and the assassins are making a lot of dumb and contradicting decisions. Even though I played Arkham City two years ago, I can tell that some of the assets were re-used in this game. Moreover, the gameplay has not changed much, except for some additions to your equipment. So just take what made the Arkham games great, then rinse, repeat.Fans of the Arkham games sooner or later will ask the following questions:- Why does Batman start out with all of his equipment from Arkham City at the beginning of the game?- Where are all the people in Arkham? I guess they are all locked inside, right...- Why is the writing so forced in some areas, especially with the Joker?Do not get me wrong: Arkham Origins is a very enjoyable game and there are some nice moments in it, but this whole origin story could have been dealt with much, much better.If you played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you should not buy the game at full price.

												I loved this game when it came out, the story line is great and the ideas of a younger Batman is also good, but its filled with bugs, like originally with the Burnley Comms Tower being slightly bugged (which developers said they would fix). Now, that whole area is bugged with buildings not loading (they're not solid and have low res textures).Do not buy this until they fix the bloody bugs.			"

												I am writing this review for people that have played Batman : Arkham City (AC) and wonder if they should get Batman : Arkham Origins (AO).If you are looking to get your mind blown by a massive improvement between the two games (say new mechanics, new engine, new gameplay features, new playable characters, maybe vehicles, etc.), then you will be disappointed : AO is basically a glorified AC. It does not bring much more than AC already did. In certain area (playable character), it actually brings less.But if you are looking to extend the AC experience, on a new town with a new campaign, then AO is definitely the game to go for and it will not disappoint you.Let me put some Arkham Origins in your Arkham City :AO is indeed ""only"" a second version of AC, but this is a very good second version of AC. You will get a few new gadgets, a lot of new combat perks, a new ""in game integrated"" achievement system (that you must fulfill to unlock a specific serie of combat perks), among other things.There is now a system which rewards you for your performance after every encounter, with an XP multiplier : the better you do, the more XP you get. This is a very good addition in that it forces you to play well and try different things (do not lose combo, do not get hit, use different takedowns, etc.)They made something different with the boss fights, which are sort of based on quick time events (QTE). While I'm not a fan of QTE, to say the least, it does make up for more cinematic fights and the game is quite forgiving in that if you die, you'll get to retry at the last ""stage"" of the boss fight you died in. The ""amount"" of QTE depends on the boss, so not all the fights play the same. ""I've read everywhere that this game is GLITCHED to the bone!""On that matter, my quick recap as of november 2014 :- the main campaign does not suffer any bug or glitch ;- I did not encounter any problem in the side-missions.Yet, there are two things. First, the game can sometimes ""bug out"" when you need to interrogate a thug. The ""Y"" icon does not appear when you get close to him. It can be fixed by restarting the fight. Since this bug is quite rare, the fights are quite cool and the restart option quite forgiving (you respawn close), it's ok.Second, and this one is not ok, is a glitch with the Enigma datapack. Now, this is particularly annoying because in this game, they made it way more appealing to collect the Enigma datapacks than it was in AC. In Arkham City, I did not really want to look for and solve all 400ish (!!) datapacks. Simply did not want to. In AO, the datapacks are fewer, and they have a much better integration in the game. You get to interrogate thugs which reveal the locations of a few datapacks, which then appear on your map. This is great. But at least one puzzle (extortion file 3, datapack 6) is glitched : you cannot complete it. Which defeats the purpose of collecting any of them, since you can't complete the collection in the end. Really bad.Also, there is a grapple situation. You will not be able to move as freely as you were in AC. Many roofs will not accept your grapple, while they would have in AC. Even if you somewhat get used to it, it remains annoying during all the campaign because you always try to ""grapple up"" and can see many places where it ""should work"", but no, it will not. Mildly annoying. Final impression :So all in all : if you really enjoyed AC and are looking for some additionnal content, definitely grab AO. Despite its flaws, I actually had a better time in AO due to the very satisfying combat system, meaningful achievement system, map interface, decent story, good predator maps, etc. For me, it has a been a better AC.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is definitely a game. But I bet the one person on my friends list who reads these wants more. So in this Batman game you play as Batman. Big surprise there; and I was waiting so eagerly in line for this game so I could play as bloody Catwoman again. The difference is that this time you’re beating up thugs in all of Gotham city instead of just a part of it. Don’t know why because the map is the same size anyway. Obviously the people in charge of Gotham are true visionaries to double the city limits and then section it off. The character list was actually different this time though. Instead of fighting Two Face, Penguin, Bane and the Joker you will be fighting Deathstroke, Penguin, Bane and the Joker. Well I didn’t say it was a big difference. Apparently every villain is supposed to reflect something of Batman; the Joker is his opposite and Deathstroke is his equal in combat. So hell if I know what Penguin reflects. Perhaps it’s Batman’s insecurities or perhaps I’m just trying to make this segment longer. I should remember to cross out the last sentence later.There are two things to do in Gotham city; king-hit pedestrians and label them as thugs or collect Riddler trophies, but let’s be honest, you won’t do the latter. You can finally traverse the Batcave; a privilege I never collected upon because there was nothing in the Batcave with the exception of clutter. Maybe there was a secret, but bugger if I could be bothered to find it. I now see this series taking the Halo methodology in the sense that the developers said Origins was going to be the final game, but now the Arkham series has been taken back by Warner Bros. who have already announced the next game. So I guess I’ll see you back here when that bolt from the blue arrives. And for the record, this game has the twisted oddity of not having Nolan North voice acting a superhero/villain.			"

												Being a big fan of Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Batman in general, I was very disappointed in how boring this game is. Everything is just too repetitive, and some of the encounters can get a little unfair and tedious. Couldn't bring myself to finish it . Play the first two games and skip this one.			"

												As much as it would shorten things to say that if you liked or are at least familiar with previous arkham games, you won't find much new here. You have virtually the same gadgets, same fighting system, same UI, similar city, the only thing that really changed was the voice actors and storyline and for the most part, that’s totally fine if all you wanted was more batman and the DLC for arkham city just wasn't enough, and for the most part, that was me. As of writing, I haven't actually completed the game, but I feel like I got a pretty good impression as to where everything is headed. Because this is a prequel to the other arkham games, it can't really throw too much at you in terms of story as to not mess with the canon, and this kind of permeates the entire game. Everything feels like its playing it safe, and no real effort has been put in to expanding on the previous games in any light, though again, this isn't really a bad thing, it's just something that will constantly be nagging at you in the back of your head as you play.The gameplay mechanics are virtually untouched except for a few minor things relating to the upgrade path. And again, not really bad, because the previous mechanics it uses, are probably some of the best brawler mechanics in recent time. One thing I can do without though is the often clunky PC controls, half of my deaths could be attributed to the weird key presses required to dodge and preform special moves. This was a problem in the previous titles, and I feel like there really isn't anything that can be done about it, so I feel like some sort of ""360 pad required"" tag would be nice.The story isn't really anything special so far, and I’m not sure whether it really will be either, since again, it can't really do a whole lot due to its prequel nature. The thing that stood out to me the most though was the replacement of two of the main characters, Batman and The Joker. In the previous arkham games, they were voiced by their cartoon counterparts. The joker epically was made by Mark Hamill, who is absent in this game. The Joker replacement isn't bad, but Batman, instead of sounding level headed yet very, what’s the word I’m looking for, stern? Now sounds like he is constantly angry and thinks half yelling makes him sound scary. It’s just something that got on my nerves slowly over time. This could have been explained by Batman not being as controlled or weathered by the years, but it’s never brought up and Batman is just as, or oddly if not more capable in this game that in the future games, it just made less sense the more I pondered it. Another thing is the city, while it seems to be bigger, it has less nooks and crannies, and is missing the hidden riddler riddles of previous games to seem ""better"" in any sense, and it just feels like arkham city all over again since its still all cordoned off and populated only by thugs, I don't ever recall seeing one civilian in the game outside of a few scripted cutscenes and segments. Again, this is sort of explained by there being a storm on Christmas Eve, but I really just found it odd.Now, as much as I griped, I still find the game very enjoyable, and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for more batman, or even just getting into the series, since playing them out of order probably doesn't help.

												Story mode completion, didn't touch multiplayer or any DLC.Pros:-Story is great. Really goes in depth of Batman before he's well established in Gotham.-Minor tweaks that help you explore the city are fantastic (I used that turbo grapple thing a zillion times, that made it easy to get around.)-I felt like the level-up progression had mostly good choices, it was hard to decide what to put points into. Shock gloves were awesome to use since they were so powerful too.Cons:-Buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Had 2 crash to desktops, and numerous disappearing walls, To top it all off, my favorite bug was fighting the first boss, Killer Croc, and PUNCHING HIM SO HARD HIS MODEL DISAPPEARS. Fighting an invisible enemy sucks, but at least I got a good laugh on that one. This is 6 months after launch too, I'd hate to have had this on launch day.-They recycled the Bane fight from Arkham Asylum. Not only did they recycle it though, you fight him again later in Origins, and it's the same fight but with more anonymous henchmen thrown in. The other fights, while neat to watch, are pretty quick time event heavy.-Only one new gadget is cool, Glue Grenades. Everything else feels like a gimmick or has been in a previous game in the series.-Collectibles feel worthless. You get XP by getting them, but since you only upgrade the gadgets you like, it feels like a waste.Pick this up if it's cheap and you're bored, everyone else should replay the others.			"

I was expecting another Arkham game and that's what I got! If you just enjoy the series you'll enjoy this game as well. A prequel to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City (also different developer) I felt it did its part in filling in the story while providing satisfying gameplay. Can't state it often enough, I'm a sucker for boss fights, and this game had plenty of them. Loved the plot of having assassins all coming after Batman. Also, Shock gloves forever!			"

												This was a damn great game. Comparing this game to most other games just seems unfair. The story is amazing, the graphics are amazing, the sound is amazing and it all runs and looks very good on my slightly outdated rig. Nothing was done poorly save for the fact that the game has quite a few more bugs in it than would be desirable. If you have never played a game in the Arkham series than you will very much enjoy this game, although I would personally recommend going in order of release (Asylum, City then Origins). That all being said this game is both a prequel and a fairly stand alone story so you can play it out of order if you want.Now, after all that being said let's get some context of where I think this game stands in the series by first stating what I think of the first two games. I consider Batman: Arkham Asylum to be one of the few perfect games ever made. That being said I didn't care for Arkham City all that much. I did still quite like it but I felt that Asylum did everything better. The downsides are that for one the combat feels slightly slower and easier, not by a whole lot but it is noticeable. Being that Asylum felt like it had a perfect difficulty I see this as a downside. Another is that the open world design of City felt unnecessary as you were still locked in an asylum like before but this time it essentially just had a large outdoor room connecting everything. In short it may have been technically open world but it wasn't very open and it wasn't very world either. Asylum however was spooky and claustrophobic and it just worked. Another issue with City was the story. City was all over the place in a way. In Asylum we mainly had the Joker and few other villains on the way and that was fine but with City it just couldn't keep its focus on who the main villain was. Also Asylum had one silly moment in regards to the last part of the game but City felt like it had many silly moments through out.That all being said I would place this game just slightly under Asylum but above City. The combat is back to actually being somewhat difficult as it is sped up from City's slower combat. This kind of all goes out the window once you get a certain upgrade halfway through the game but even then I would hold Origin's combat above City's. Another thing done better is the city itself. For once in the series you actually get to be outside of an asylum's walls and actually stop crimes in progress and solve crimes and such. It actually feels like you are inside of a city which is further helped by about doubling the size of the map from City. Lastly is the story. My god, Origin's story just might be the best. We see a younger Batman who doesn't have much experience and is essentially going through his first significant night of crime fighting. There actually some character progression as opposed to Asylum or City where Batman was already experienced and is who he is. That all being said I would like to repeat as I said above, Origin's only real failing is that this game seems to be quite a bit more buggy than a game should be. I heard at launch it was even worse but even as it stands now I have enemies get stuck in walls making sections temporarily impassible. Nothing has happened that can't be fixed by reloading a checkpoint however so it doesn't detrack too much.To sum everything up here:Asylum: 100/100City: 95/100Origins: 99/100P.S. Oh yeah, there is also a multiplayer but I never bothered to try it. It's designed by Splash Damage so chances are it's quite good but I bet no one plays it anymore.			"

 Some glitches/bugs solutions - on the bottom of the review Storyline  On Christmas Eve, Black Mask has put a bounty on Batman's head and 8 asssassins are trying to kill him - Deathstroke (veteran assasssin), Copperhead (a poisonous contortionist), Firefly (a pyromancer), Electrocutioner (a guy who uses high voltage), Shiva (a  martial artist), Deadshot (expert marksman), Killer Croc (a killer who is crocodile) and Bane (Oh, this will hurt) . And on batman's way the police is trying to capture him . I enjoyed every part of it honestly . It was interesting how you deafeat everyone of them successively .  Gameplay Batman Arkham Origins is an open world stealth game . You play as Batman as well . You have many gadgets which really makes you feel like Batman .When you free roam you use your batclaw to attach to buildings and you can also glide in the air . You also use your other gadgets like cryptographic sequencer which hacks security consoles by guessing the password (which I find really annoying as it was in the previous games), batarang which you throw at enemies (also you can choose remote controlled batarang which you controll), explosive gel - destroying weak walls and lots more gadgets which you also get by deafiting the assassins . When you free roam there are side missions like crime in progress where you help the police from the gangs . There are also Most Wanted missions where you do the side missions of a villian such as Anarky who plants bombs around or Enigma who has data files hidden around (also in levels) . When you stop these side missions you earn points which can be used to upgrade your gadges and etc. The combat is great but really easy (you pretty much do the same - just pressing some buttons) . The whole game didn't have a lot new stuff from Arkham City except one - the world . Its double the size of Arkham City . The boss fights are amazing . The first one which was Deathstroke showed me what Arkham Origins offers with its boss fights. Issues I honestly enjoyed the game a lot, but then the holy experience of glitches began . I even made a countdown for how many glitches/bugs I found and they were 11-12 . I had a glitch/bug in almost every level . I found solutions for them in the internet (well some of them still persist) . Wb Games doesnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game after they realised it .There are missing data handlers, glitches while you glide, some glitches that you just fall and when you get up everything is white and you have unlimited gliding, beatdown glitches (I thought the game was on ubisoft), corrupted save files (mostly on xbox), game-breaking glitches, crashes and a lot more . Verdict After all these issues I do recommend the game for its awesome storyline, amazing boss fights, great world and all these gadgets that makes you feel like Batman. Issues fixes Here are some fixes which MIGHT help you.Corrupted Save Files - Reinstall the game  .Startup Crash - Go to BatmanArkhamOrigins > SinglePlayer > BMGames > Config and delete BmEngine Elevator Glitch - immediately after you press SPACE (elevator button) press Z (first person view) and you shouldn't fall from the elevator Glide bug - Press Ctrl while gliding and then space Joker Beatdown glitch - Low your graphics and turn your wi-fi off Missing Enigma data handler on the pioneer bridge - Restart the last checkpoint and then fast travel to the BatCave and then go back to the enigma data handler and he should be there			"

												Personally, I've played all of the Arkham games and loved them so much that I went to 100% complete each one with the exception of Asylum. This one is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the lot. The world is much larger than the previous game (Arkham City) which is a plus, however that being said, they recycled half of the map from Arkham City as well. The buildings are taller, so you're able to glide from point a to point b with no issues but it's kinda pointless to do so. The fast travel feels very repetitive. The Bat Cave is a neat little addition to the game. The story felt very generic, with a very forseeable twist. It has some really neat easter eggs, like towards the very end of the game you got to meet Harleen Quinzel the intern. The Gadgets... oh my god the gadgets. You start out with the Grapnel Booster for one, secondly they're almost identical to the gadgets from Arkham City. Baterangs, Bat Claw, Explosive Gel, all of that good stuff makes a return. The Freeze Grenade was replaced with a Glue Grenade and it (not kidding) is EXACTLY the same as the Freeze Grenade. The remote claw is neat, but it's comparable to the line launcher. You can even hold a button to ride down it just like the line launcher. Lastly, the Riddler (Now known as Enigma) side objective. It was a joke. What I always do is clear the game, beat all the bosses and start to go for all the thugs that work for The Riddler. After I got all the information where the riddler items are, I go out and find them all. This whole process in Arkham City took me about 40 hours to complete on top of all the other things, so probably about a combined total of 55 hours or so (not including game+). In this game, Arkham Origins, it took about 8 hours to gather all of the riddler items.All in all, this is an okay game. However if you compared to the previous two in the series, it's terrible. If you're thinking of purchasing this game just wait til the Game of the Year edition is released, and goes below $29.99.			"

												I am writing this review for people that have played Batman : Arkham City (AC) and wonder if they should get Batman : Arkham Origins (AO).If you are looking to get your mind blown by a massive improvement between the two games (say new mechanics, new engine, new gameplay features, new playable characters, maybe vehicles, etc.), then you will be disappointed : AO is basically a glorified AC. It does not bring much more than AC already did. In certain area (playable character), it actually brings less.But if you are looking to extend the AC experience, on a new town with a new campaign, then AO is definitely the game to go for and it will not disappoint you.Let me put some Arkham Origins in your Arkham City :AO is indeed ""only"" a second version of AC, but this is a very good second version of AC. You will get a few new gadgets, a lot of new combat perks, a new ""in game integrated"" achievement system (that you must fulfill to unlock a specific serie of combat perks), among other things.There is now a system which rewards you for your performance after every encounter, with an XP multiplier : the better you do, the more XP you get. This is a very good addition in that it forces you to play well and try different things (do not lose combo, do not get hit, use different takedowns, etc.)They made something different with the boss fights, which are sort of based on quick time events (QTE). While I'm not a fan of QTE, to say the least, it does make up for more cinematic fights and the game is quite forgiving in that if you die, you'll get to retry at the last ""stage"" of the boss fight you died in. The ""amount"" of QTE depends on the boss, so not all the fights play the same. ""I've read everywhere that this game is GLITCHED to the bone!""On that matter, my quick recap as of november 2014 :- the main campaign does not suffer any bug or glitch ;- I did not encounter any problem in the side-missions.Yet, there are two things. First, the game can sometimes ""bug out"" when you need to interrogate a thug. The ""Y"" icon does not appear when you get close to him. It can be fixed by restarting the fight. Since this bug is quite rare, the fights are quite cool and the restart option quite forgiving (you respawn close), it's ok.Second, and this one is not ok, is a glitch with the Enigma datapack. Now, this is particularly annoying because in this game, they made it way more appealing to collect the Enigma datapacks than it was in AC. In Arkham City, I did not really want to look for and solve all 400ish (!!) datapacks. Simply did not want to. In AO, the datapacks are fewer, and they have a much better integration in the game. You get to interrogate thugs which reveal the locations of a few datapacks, which then appear on your map. This is great. But at least one puzzle (extortion file 3, datapack 6) is glitched : you cannot complete it. Which defeats the purpose of collecting any of them, since you can't complete the collection in the end. Really bad.Also, there is a grapple situation. You will not be able to move as freely as you were in AC. Many roofs will not accept your grapple, while they would have in AC. Even if you somewhat get used to it, it remains annoying during all the campaign because you always try to ""grapple up"" and can see many places where it ""should work"", but no, it will not. Mildly annoying. Final impression :So all in all : if you really enjoyed AC and are looking for some additionnal content, definitely grab AO. Despite its flaws, I actually had a better time in AO due to the very satisfying combat system, meaningful achievement system, map interface, decent story, good predator maps, etc. For me, it has a been a better AC.

												I only slightly recommend this game for people who want to continue the game series, for others I DONT recommend it. Play the previous ones. I am a fan of the previous games and of batman but this series keeps getting worse, at least for PC.1. The Story is fine. Nothing major. Just fine. You have a lot of side quests to do if you are bored. They are pretty boring after a while because repeating the same bust over and over again seems pointless. Especially the extortion files (riddler things) are boring as they repeat themselves for every territory. No idea who thinks that kind of grinding is fun.Some cutscenes are skipable some are not, just telling you that its loading but it probably isnt.It is a mystery to why it is not possible to listen to tapes while gliding through gotham. Worked in previous game but not here. That means you have to stay in the audio file and wait for it to play till the end. That breaks with the flow of the game.2. The graphics are good considering when it was made, the faces are mediocre though.This game is out for years and there are still so many repeating bugs in there.FIrst bossfight against croc pretty much always glitches and croc himself is dissapearing out of the world and reappearing (flickering) and the sound cuts off at the later stages.If you glide of places you sometimes have a bug where you kinda flap your wings like a bird.The games sometimes even crashes if you enter a ingame cutscene, happend to me at least once, other times it just hang for a short time.3. Controls are as bad as always. You just do sometimes things you dont want to do or sometimes counters do not work even though you pressed.This makes the boss fights so much more annoying. Most of them are stupid gimmick fights. The fight agains Bane just takes forever because of the controls and the limited options of how to take him down.The fight against Deathstroke is probably the stupidest of all with those counters. This is barely a fight and more a game of counter. Who counters better. Considering how early you fight him this is a good spot to just stop playing if you cant defeat him in normal or high difficulty because at first you dont really get the fight after a few tries.The world is essentially a bigger Akrham City I guess. It looks very similar of course. Thats good as you have spots that you remember.4. I have played 2 games of multiplayer. Playing as one of the thugs is horrible if you know how a shooter is supposed to be played. The camera control and controls are so♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dont even try it, believe me. 5. Cold Cold Heart is the only addon that makes sense so dont buy the season pass.I am not gonna say that this game is bad but it has a lot of issues and thats why its AVERAGE at most. After playing this game I am not surprised how broken Arkham Knight is supposed to be on PC.			"

												Arkham Asylum was a revolutionary game. Arkham City was as well. By contrast, Arkham Origins is viewed as an evolutionary game, and between that and the fact that the principal actors and development studio have been replaced a lot of people figured ""eh, I don't need to play this for a year."" Technically speaking, Arkham Origins does feature revolutionary additions over the previous games, but it's in an area that nobody particularly asked for in the first place: online competitive multiplayer. I myself have yet to even launch it, but given that it's developed by Splash Damage I'm sure it's not slapped together. They did after all make the Return to Castle Wolfenstein multiplayer (which got carried over into Enemy Territory, and then Quake Wars, etc).The thing about the single-player is that while it's good, you literally cannot help but compare it against Arkham City the entire time. The combat system and animations are completely carried over, with some additions. You have some new gadgets (one is allegedly ""new"" but in reality is functionally identical to something else from Arkham City) and face a few new common foes. Luckily, one of the gadgets is straight out of Super Inframan and makes combat even more satisfying since you trounce everyone with it, and the others give you more options during the Predator encounters. The enemy AI is altered since the rate at which you counter rather than strike has gone way, way up. Boss battles are VASTLY improved over the previous games, as each one emphasizes that you do different things. At no point do you feel ""well, this is the same thing I did for the last boss.""But even with that said, at most points you DO feel ""well, I've done this before."" Aside from the combat, the sidequests have you doing the same gameplay mechanic as 2 years ago (and 4 years ago) albeit for a different cosmetic reason. Example: in Arkham City you have to quickly travel across the city to answer phones in time to stop a killer. Here, you have to do the same to defuse bombs. It's the same map as Arkham City, albeit with some new zones. It helps a little that you can now fast travel. But there must be fewer grapple points because getting from place to place is a little trickier than it used to be. You'll be fighting and fighting, and with the random ""crimes in progress"" that spawn, you'll fight more. You're rarely going to be scanning the environment unless you're prompted to do so. Crime scene investigations are a new addition, but much like the show CSI you aren't really doing anything yourself. The computer is magically reconstructing a series of events based on your having scanned a body and a spot of blood (which they can't show as red). Then you go beat up a guy. You can't inadvertently defeat the person you meant to interrogate either, so there's no ""save this guy for last"" aspect to combat. But you are now given grades for each encounter, such that higher grades yield XP bonuses. Winning is largely a foregone conclusion given that you're Batman, but winning with an A or S rank is the tough part. In fact, I still haven't gotten the last one because it doesn't always play the *wham* sound effect to denote you KO'ed someone with a hit (I call this the ""BATMAAAAAN!"" since if I could mod this game I would replace that sound with the screaming pug). The game offers various challenges for additional bonuses and upgrades, but it's buggy about deciding whether or not some of them ""count."" I busted my ♥♥♥ doing the ""do 4 exotic takedowns in a Predator section"" and then it didn't count it. And then it turned out there were no more Predator sections in the game. AND it won't let you complete those challenges on the challenge maps, so if you don't do it during the story you're screwed...unless you replay it on the much harder New Game+ mode...The reduced architecture grapples and increased enemy attack rates are somewhat minor, but if there's a major ""step backwards"" here it's one of atmosphere. This Gotham City isn't yet overrun with supervillains who've marked their territory and themed their gangs. The incentive to see the world isn't really as strong. The Riddler's challenges were designed to direct you to all the cool little references, but at this point there is no ""Riddler"" etc so you're basically completing the challenges for the sake of hearing the ""extortion data that's going to harm innocent people"" recordings. Except pretty much all of them pertain to supervillains and corrupt civil servants whom you take down anyway. It feels more like a task since there's less ""reward"" for doing it. Why oppose this so strongly? That's the REAL enigma.The strong negative online backlash to Arkham City's criminal dialogue means that EVERYTHING pertaining to threats or abusive language is long gone (that already got walked back since the Arkham City DLC) so pat yourselves on the back, Team Social Justice. Between that and the fact that Batman is less infallible at this stage of his career, the writing has gotten a lot more praise compared to Arkham City. But for me, it feels less satisfying to beat people up because I overheard them saying they're cold and hungry, or that they're resorting to crime because they lost their job and now they have to not be home on Christmas Eve. This definitely plays into the ""Batman as fascist authoritarian conservative"" reading of the character. I kind of wonder if the writers just hate Batman as a concept, since the villains all expose the flaws in his approach and morality and Batman has no answer because he can't admit ""the reason I can't kill you is because you're all too profitable as IP.""Also, the game takes place over a few hours on Christmas Eve into Christmas Day, yet the amount that happens is absurd. True, a lot happened during Arkham City, but there was planning leading up to it. How can these locations be THIS devastated and re-renovated in just a few hours? And it's not even accidental; the game points out ""yeah, it's been 3 hours."" On the other hand, James Gordon isn't Commissioner yet, so the cops are pretty much all dirty. In this game you get to beat up SWAT team guys, which is the part of ""Year One"" that is the most important. The Assassin's Creed guy as Batman has his highs and mids since he's mostly forced to imitate Kevin Conroy, but with a name like ""Roger Smith"" you'd think he was BORN to impersonate Kevin Conroy's Batman! Troy Baker (who already nailed his Richard Moll Two-Face impersonation in Arkham City) is about as dead-on a mimicry of Mark Hamill's Joker as one could hope, given that Mark can no longer really do that voice anymore. Richard Epcar (voice of the Joker in the fighting games) has a few background lines that jump out to me, but I guess he also directed a lot of the secondary dialogue recordings.I enjoyed Arkham Origins, but I'd still say to hold off on getting it. Not so much because of the issues described above so much as the fact that there's a ton of DLC and all of it's spread out across platforms and retailers due to exclusivity (Challenge maps where you're Bruce Wayne in training, etc). There's a Season Pass which includes that stuff, but it costs another $20 and for now is almost entirely cosmetic. They say there'll be at least one story DLC, but what'll it be about? Maybe something inspired by The Long Halloween? I don't know, so I don't know if that, a few challenge maps, and some cosmetic skins are really worth the money. For now I'd say to pick this up once a ""complete edition"" is available unless you happen to buy a new video card that bundles it.			"

												Batman arkham origins is the first game in batman arkham games that was developed by Warner Bros. Games Montréal not rocksteady and the story is set 2 years before the story in b man arkham asylum. Okay first thing im going to talk about is the story:The story is set on cristmas eve and black mask has hired 8 assassins to kill the Bat. In this game black mask will be important in the story. Batman is trying to save his head by takingdown every assassin my opinion is that the story in arkham asylum and arkham city are a lot better.the second thing is gameplay:the gameplay is the same as the previous games.One thing is realy good and that is the boss battles there are alot more boss battles than in the previous games and thats realy cool.the third thing are the graphics and enviroment The grapchics are the same as the previous games the system requiremens are the same but the problem is that the city is realy lifeles  and not well designet as arkham city so...The multiplayer Batman arkham origins is the first batman arkham game that has multiplayer. The multiplayer is realy fun there is 3 control points that you have to capture all three. When you capture all three you eliminate the gangs reinforcments to win that is invisible predator online mode but there is hunter hunted mode that you have only one life. The rest of the multiplayer you can check on the internet its realy realy fun and you can play as bane or joker or the heroes.The final verdict:The final verdict for batman arkham origins is:story: 7.5gameplay:9.4graphics:7.8multiplayer:10.0 So batman arkham origins is a good game but nothing like batman arkham asylum and arkham city. Thats what i expected when the other company developed a batman game and not rocksteady but the multiplayer rocks for me its the best multiplayer in the history of gaming, but most people would disagree. Well a new batman arkham game is coming out in october batman arkham knight and rocksteady will be developing it so i think it will be epic.			"

												So, after many people asked me about it, here it is. Batman: Arkham Origins feels like a game from the Arkham Franchise. But also, it feels completely different.. The story, the music, the sounds, the gameplay, everything seems to be completely different in comparison with Batman: Arkham City, Batman; Arkham Asylum and Batman; Arkham Knight, but at the same time, you can feel that it belongs to them, on the one or other wise. It is indeed not as good as the other parts, but it deserves to be called ""Arkham"" nevertheless. If you should buy it? Definetely, if you already have the other games of the Arkham Franchise and like them. But if you dont know the others, i would advise to buy another Batman game, like my all-time favourites Batman: Arkham City and Batman: Arkham Knight.			"

												According to many critics a flawed mess, I find it rather enjoyable. Yes, it has a number of weird glitches, but up until now I have not run into anything game breaking. The combat remains pretty much the same from AC, the combos look better, the story is fine, and more detective work is interesting. The side quests are awesome, you will meet old and new adversaries, some of them you already met in the previous games (well, previous games, but in continuity, AO is a prequel). As someone who spent more than 30 hours in both AA and AC I can recommend this game mostly to fans of both games, while new players should really start with Arkham Asylum. 8.5/10, would be 9 if not for the minor glitches which are annoying.Edit: There is hope for some bug fixes in the upcoming DLC Cold Cold Heart, even though they denied they are making anything. At least I find it rather stupid not to fix the common issues with bugged Enigma stuff.Edit n.2: After finishing the story I have to say, AO has the best story of all the Arkham games.Edit n.3: The DLC Cold, Cold Heart is fine. Nothing spectacular, the crash was fixed pretty fast, minor glitches still exist (weird camera angles and the weird movement of the camera). But it was better than the DLC in AC, so a few (literally 2-4 hours depends on your clear time) and it has the well known Freeze backstory. 7/10 for the DLC			"

												WB may have patched the bugs that everyone is complaining about (or maybe I'm just lucky) but I just finished the rather short campaign and never hit any bugs that affected gameplay. The occasional FPS drop and unresponsive counter attack, yes. There felt to be a lot of loose ends with the main story that aren't addressed by the end of the game. Without giving too much away, there are certain villains that take a back seat as the story goes on and the game never revisits them, instead pushing the Bat towards one or two of them until you start to forget about the others. Overall, it's your basic Arkham game: smooth combat, strong storyline (except for the previously mentioned issues) and lots of bonus objectives after the completion of the story. Overall rating: 8/10			"

												Arkham Origins is a pretty fun game with some exceptionally well done boss fights. The combat is the same free flowing wonder from the previous games. Its nice to see the early days of Batman shown in a video game. The vigilante/criminal uncertainty feels nice. The Batman-Joker dynamic is handled really well in this game. One area in which the game lets you down is in the inconsistent world traversal, especially with grappling. When you are gliding around Gotham, it feels as if the developers decided to put in grapple points at random. So you lose the momentum and land when you dont want to. The usual tropes in Arkham games also are present. Mash A to open grates is extremely annoying.All said, Arkham origins tries hard to be as good as the Rocksteady games before it. For the most part it is, but sadly it only comes close.			"

												Played after Arkham Asylum and Arkham city, this game keeps the essence of those two games published before this one.The storytelling is the same as the other two previous games and keeps alive the tension produced by your enemies, villains and criminals in Gotham.I felt like the developers abandoned tis game more than the others because it was not toally polished, it has some noticeable bugs that, in my humble opinion, could have been avoided, In general aspects this game looks much more unpolished than the others I have played in the Batman saga.In a nutshell, Batman Arkham origins keeps the essence of the Batman saga and if you have played any other game from the saga and you liked it, you will enjoy playing this too.

												Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are tough acts to follow, but I think Arkham Origins manages it okay. The gameplay is more or less identical to previous games. You are Batman and it's your job to leave a trail of bruised faces and broken bones through Gotham. One gets the impression as you float over the city that maybe this place isn't worth saving, considering that every single citizen of Gotham is some sort of thug or hoodlum that's plotting to rob the local jewelry store. The game tries to sort of justify this by saying there's martial law, but it's a tad ridiculous. Sometimes Batman even comes across as being the bad guy. A bunch of times I was floating around the city, saw some guys on a street corner and jumped in on them to start punching. Doing that a few times reminded me of Scott Kurtz's ""My Parents Are Dead"", which I don't think is what the devs were going for. So for future installments, having some actual civilians in the city (maybe even areas of the city where people don't try to come punch you on sight!) would perhaps be a good idea. Though I think Arkham Knight starts with Gotham being evacuated so I can't imagine that improving. Overall though, there are some great character moments in here, particularly with the Joker (who completely steals the show from these c-list assassins they have around). And the sneakysneaky/punchypunchy gameplay is just as great as it always is. So grabbing this title is not such a bad idea. I won't be doing the post-story collectibles though.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is not a bad game.In fact it's rather strong.But what holds it back is failure to add meaning full changes to the orignal games.Pros-+A young Batman.A Batman who's not as hardened and is vulnerable.+The excellent Predator gameplay and free flow combat returns from the orignal games.+Voice acting is top notch and Troy Baker does a fine job of Joker.+Crime scene investigation.+Engrossing side missions and activities.+Joker and Batman.+Boss battles are challenging.Cons--Doesn't really move things forward.Most of my feeling when playing was 'been there,done that'.Score-8/10 "

												Being a huge Batman fan, and loved the Arkham series of course i bought this right away. Arkham Asylum is still the best, i'm kinda even with this and City. It's defnitely not so bad as some people say it is..SPOILERS AHEAD!-The story, too much Joker, though this isn't really their fault, Joker has been the main bad guy in the previous titles, and i was awaiting a ""fresh"" villain, and got excited because of black mask. But then again, Joker is the most iconic Batman villain, and completely fits in this story perfectly. Just a bad timing because of the last two games.- The city is pretty empty yes, and they could have used different thugs than just a few models. Gotham is beatifully done, but it's not really fun to explore it, like it was on Asylum and City.Most of the boss battles are great! I loved the Deathrstoke one, it was visually great, Firefly's boss battle is one of my favorite boss battles ever as well, there was some great visuals and felt like a good action movie scene.All in all, i like this game, very much. It's not as good as the ""originals"", but great game nonetheless. Hope WB games does more Batman games.			"

												Ok as far as the Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City goes this game kinda lets u down but those game dont feature multiplayer. Multiplayer of this game not at all like COD where pros dominate u yeah they sure get upperhand as always not everytime quite innovation by adding third team in Deathmatch type match which features batman and robin. Campaign good enough new villains been introduced such as Deathstroke, Electrocutioner(one hit KO), Firefly, Copperhead, blackmask (no boos fight) and same old master of mayhem Mr. J, KillerCroc, Bane, Riddler with Datapacks instead of trophies. Theres two new gadets actually upgraded Grapel Gun and shock gloves. So overall Same old batman game with new villains, new gadgets and added multiplayer mode.And will be waiting for Batman Arkham Knight.			"

												The best batman game so far. It improves many aspects of Arkham City. The campaign is more engaging. The narration is fluid and full of plot-twists. Some scenes are epic, really! The combat system is the same as Arkham City, perhaps a bit harder, and the upgrades are almost the same. That's a bit disappointing, but it's not a huge problem since the previous game hade already a very good gameplay. The map is double the size of AC: old gotham ( arkham city before the earthquake) and new gotham (more verticality). There are a lot of sidequests but not all of them are good... The voice acting is just great! I initially had some doubts about batman's new voice actor, but he surprised me. In my opinion he's even better than Kevin Conroy. Also Joker's voice acting is great! Then there are challenge maps as in the previous games and...the multiplayer, which I haven't tried yet due to some bugs (which they have solved now). good job wb montreal.  9/10			"

The same control scheme is kept, the fights are similar. The map's bigger though, with a south part added to Gotham City.So, while I cannot in good conscience recommend you get this game, you might want to grab it if it goes on sale really cheap like for $5.00 or something - because you won't be getting any patches or fixes if you encounter problems playing it.

												The third installment of the Batman franchise is imo the best and most refined. But is that enough to warrant a recommendation in late 2014, when it really only is an incremental improvement on the five year old  first game?I think it is, but it really depends on whether you own one or both of the other titles, and how much you liked them. There are some new gadgets, enemies, moves, refined crime scene mode with timeline control and much more. The villian roster unfortunately still has the main focus on the same old characters.As usual there's a ton of things to do besides the main story, but I didn't deviate much from it, and completed the game in 15 hours.There were a couple of bugs, which I don't remember from any of the previous games, including enemies gettings stuck out of your reach forcing you to reload a checkpoint.

												The short of it is that this game is a lot like sitting down to eat seconds of a good meal. You've tasted it all before (City, Asylum, etc.), but seconds are filling. The food does the job. You're able to walk away from the table without feeling hungry. Chiefly, I recommend Arkham Origins for the story. It has a numerous plot threads but the primary story concerns the nature of the relationship between Batman and The Joker. Batman and The Joker are cut from the same cloth. They are two sides of the same coin, and their material base is Gotham City. This alone isn't too relevatory if you've seen any of the movies or Batman:TAS. The interesting twist this game supplies is that once having established Batman and Joker as twinsies, so to speak, it digs a little deeper into their respective obsessions for one another. The Joker, of course, plays horribly contrived games but in playing these games he attempts  to carry them to a logical end in a way that will fundamentally reveal the true character of the players. In Batman's case, Batman with little push, violia, might show that underneath his cowl is a clown with very green hair.Fun! Right? It's okay. Batman and the Joker essentially have different answers to the same question, and since I referenced food at the start of this review, I may as well reference it again (and I think this line is used in one of the movies): how loyal do you expect a good dog to be when hungry? The one bad day can turn someone onto many different roads. In the Joker's case, it made him into a crazy. In Batman's, the bad day riddled his being with guilt. The real question is about whether the bad day is an indicator of fate or free will. My leaning is the Joker, at bottom, believes no hungry dog is a loyal dog. It's nature. It's chaos. It's whatever you want to call it. We are all animals destined for a brutal, disappointing life. We just need a little push to reveal our true face. Batman would likely disagree. Life may be one vile task after another, but we have the choice to let it affect us in such and so a way.Anyway, there's a lot more to say here. I jotted down some of the thoughts I had (whether they be right or wrong) after initially completeting the story of the game. There's plenty to think about and for that I give this game thumbs up.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is said to be the weakest game in the Arkham series, and yes it is gameplaywise. Storywise this game isn't really outstanding and you can see the major plot twist coming from miles away. But the characters is what makes this game standout from the other two, especially the Joker. The Joker in this game is the most horrofying version I've met, the developers. We also get an insight in his messed up mind which kinda helps to not only portray him as a monster. Which I like, in the previous Arkham games the Joker is the main villain and only placed there to be a anarchistic lunatic who murders everyone who comes in his way.I've read some reviews saying that this game got performance issues. I for one have not experienced any other than a few small FPS drops when flying through the air which is to be expected. It's a big good looking world where it snows all the time, there is snow on the ground aswell as people even though I have been able to pretty much max this game(except enhanced shadows) on my R9 280x.The game is overall great and is a nice addition to the Arkham series. I would recommend playing this one before Asylum even though it's the third in the series it a nice introduction to it.			"

												This game, Does not work as a sequel. If you own Arkham city, don't even think of buying this game. It is almost exactly a reskin of Arkham City, with a larger map and less memorable levels and boss fights. The map is a slightly modified version of the one from arkham city, with a very large bridge and a equally sized island. The story is okay, but the boss fights are absolutely terrible. Even on the easiest difficulty, I almost broke my monitor on the Deathstroke and Copperhead boss fights, which try to be like the Arkham city boss fights, but fail miserablely. All of them are 0/10 apart from the last Bane battle, which is fantastic like the Mr Freeze fight, exept you cannot hide or run ANYWHERE because of the small size of the room you are in, and Bane is charging everywhere. The combat is great as normal, but the developers could not hold themselves back from adding the Joker. Over all, this game is the same price as the Arkham city GOTY edition, but is worse. Just buy the Arkham City GOTY version. It is better, Funner and far more replayable.			"

Product received for free
Cheap Sale ReviewI'm thinking of doing this whenever the game I had is on sale. Maybe push someone who's on the edge on whether or not to fork out that little dollar they have or make them have a second thought of buying it. Mild spoiler ahead.Batman Arkham Origins(2013) is a spin-off prequel to the Batman Arkham Series developed by WB Games Montreal and Splash Games. Preceded by Arkham City(2011). The other trilogy is developed by Rocksteady.Just like other Arkham games, the combat is enjoyable and can be addicting. It's like playing rythm games but with violence and bone-breaking.You need to push the right button at the right time. With variety of enemy, you'll need to adapt to their different patterns. The additional ranking system, where your combo is judged and marked is a nice additional feature for me.There is also more buildings you can get into compared to Arkham City which I think makes the game feels a bit fresh and new rather than feeling you play Arkham City all over again.The predator challenge where you have to take out enemies one by one is challenging enough. Throughout the game, enemies are more adapt to your techniques. If you keep taking them out from above, they'll mine the gargoyles or ledge. Take them down from below too often, they'll throw bombs. Taking your time to knock them all out , they'll put mine traps.You can also explore the Batcave. You can gain XP by having cheek-in-tongue conversations with Alfred who complains about bats in the Batcave. You can also have virtual combat challenges and training in it.Though debatable, Origins might have the best story compared to other series. It has more emotional side to it. It explores Bruce Wayne as a man full of rage rather than just as his inexperience as Batman and learn what it takes to be Gotham's Knight. He learns he can't challenge Gotham alone. The villains feel really fleshed out. Great rouge galleries. Especially Bane with his ability to outsmart Batman. The story alone is enough reason to play this game. It really felt different out of all the entry in the series.Buuut, Arkham Origins come with it's many flaws.If Arkham Knight suffers from bad port, this game suffers from questionable game design. I'll nitpick the little ridiculous bit first. Why Batman, master of combat can't break thin wooden plank. That's like the first thing you break if you learn martial arts. In the game, you have to explode it with the explosive gel. The map design to say controversially, is lazy. A big part of it is literally a revised copy of Arkham City. They do make it bigger by adding additional area but that only make travel through the city feels more like a chore. This has to do with Batman's navigation ability. Batman can grapple boost to a building to travel faster. Problem is the speed of his glide and grapple boost is the same in Arkham City. Batman's navigation mechanics and the speed may work in moderately sized, condensed map as in Arkham City but not when it's big as in Origins. I think it needs to be faster.To be fair, they had relatively little development time. And the publisher, the infamous WB more or less wants this game to be made just to keep the hype for the franchise alive as Arkham Knight took 4 years to complete.The nygma challenges and collectibles is such a drag as you have to backtrack anything you missed in the huge empty buildings with nothing to do as you had cleared the enemies earlier in the game.The story is great. IMO, the strongest out of all the series but I can't help but feel it was just a retold of separate stories that had been written in the comics which was tailored together perfecly. The man who laughs, The Killing Joke, it's all there. Tailored together and was changed here and there. The other two series Asylum&City, though inspired by the events in comics, their story stands on their own.Was this game worth your time? Yes, definitely but I suggest you play Arkham City first. I think it will give you a feeling of an expansion from the previous game. Deathstroke's fight is great, Anarky's a great philosophical fight and the DLC is the best out of all Arkham series's DLC. The cold,cold heart and Bruce Wayne's training in Korea/Japan(I don't know. I think there's a cultural mix-up in the dlc).			"

												I really really love this game.  Before I say anything I will say there are some bugs. Nothing that has been game breaking for me but others will tell you that there are some nasty bugs and glitches. They have done some 'tweeking' with Arkham Origins that has changed the timing of counters or critical hits. That will have you swinging at air a bit more than in AC. There have been times where I think to myself, ""that was cheap"" but I have been playing AC lately too (I'm on a Batman junk out) and find there are things in that that also kinda irk me. I think they have done something with the flying/gliding that seem to make it more responsive or just plain easier. Either way I am better at gliding in Origins. As far as the gadgets go it's pretty much a wash.  Except for the remote claw which is overpowered but still hilarious just to sling two foes into each other. Instead of a freeze grenade you have a glue grenade. They do exactly the same things, literally.As far as multiplayer goes I can't comment on that. I'm not a big fan of online multiplayer.Overall, I like Origins a little bit more than City. Whether it's because it's newer and the graphics are nicer (that DX11 snow is wicked), the city seems more fleshed out and brighter, the story having more villains, less Nolan North or the fact that Batman isn't wearing his underwear on the outside (yet). At the end of the day I would give this game a 8.5/10. Without really bringing anything completely new to the table I can't give it a much higher score. It's still definitely a must play for comic and Batman fans.			"

												Batman Arkham Asylum in the Batman series covers the previous story,which is good and enjoy the action I saw one article hit sensitivity, respectively. Later, Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham CityBatman series is the content of the movie in order to enjoy a game that you can understand. Even if an error occurs in the middle of the game-play except that a good game. So ratings are as follows. 8 out of 10 points.			"

In my opinion, Arkham Origins deserve to get a Game of the Year Edition release like Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Compared to its predecessor, AO have more interesting story and characters, fast-travel map system using Batwing, Batcave hideout, smaller amount of collectibles so they don't distract player from the story, Batcave (worthy to be listed twice :). The game setting and atmosphere reminds me of a 1992 movie, Batman Returns. Too bad we only get Penguin in the story, no Catwoman in sight. Most of the negative reviews on Steam are for technical problems, but I only had twice of infinite fall bug (need to reload checkpoint)  in 1 playthrough so didn't bother me much. I think the developer pretty much ironed all the techical problems,			"

												While Origins doesn't add much over its predecessor, there are a few new gadgets and enemy types, the boss battles are consistently better, and the story is arguably better than Asylum's story. If you were hoping for a drastic change in the formula, you'll likely be disappointed, but this is easily the best Batman Arkham game to date!You can read ClayMeow full, in-depth review here:http://www.overclockersclub.com/reviews/arkham_origins/Cheers!

												Way to wreck a good franchise. Empty city that feels hollow and gameplay mechanics that got borked. Combat lost the rhythm it had in the previous games and keyboard control is quite a mess. Rocksteady led the foundations, WB Montreal just messed up. They just want to sell you DLC (heck, even the main screen is shouting adverts for various WB websites). This is just a quick cash-grab and DLC spitting machine. Avoid if you liked the other games in the series. Also, bugs, bugs, and bugs.			"

												I enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum and while I was disappointed by it's sequel, Batman:Arkham City, I also enjoyed and completed it. That is where my enjoyment of the trilogy ends, however. I should mention that I played Arkham City with maximum graphical settings and benchmarked at an average of 30 FPS, so the fact that I had graphical issues and slowdown was interesting to me.Within minutes of beginning the game I began to notice graphical issues. During the first boss-encounter with ""Killer Croc"" was a memorable one, since while I'm lead to believe that Croc's special abilities include making him extremely large and strong - the file negates to mention that apparently he has the ability to flicker in and out of visibility. This left Batman looking like he'd made a wrong turn on the way to ninja school and had taken up the art of mime instead.More graphical errors started when I got into a more open world environment, as less than 5 minutes later I was treated to a display of Batman's amazing aerodynamic prowess - gliding gently through the air while symultaneously forward flipping in a fashion resembling a hamster in a washing machine. It was quite entertaining actually.I also have to report that the combat system is what you would expect from this latest generation of Batman:Arkham games - because it's copy&pasted from Batman:Arkham Asylum. From what I can see there have been no changes to the combat engine, Batmans animations or the AI of the... AI. Almost all simple fights can be won by spamming the ""punch, punch, punch, counter, punch, counter, punch, takedown"" sequence and when faced with tougher opponents with knives, body armour or guns, it becomes ""Punch, punch, punch, cape sweep, rapid punches, counter, cape sweep, rapid punches, counter, repeat as necessary until victory."" The aiming system is still rather ham-fisted, in that when there are multiple enemies attacking in close proximity to each other it can be very difficult to judge which of them will be struck. This is especially irritating when one of said enemies is charging their attack (when you would want to counter, if you wouldn't strike them before their blow landed) and hit his buddy instead - losing your combat multiplier in the process. In addition, a ground takedown still can't be interupted in order to counter a standing attack - maybe that's by design but it doesn't feel right to me.I'd also love to know why that ""bat effect"" which occurs on the last punch of every combat decides that my FPS should drop from my average 30 down to 1 or 2 for around 5 seconds? It's been like that since Arkham Asylum and it baffles me as to why it happens.The RPG aspects also feel out of place to me, as they did in Arkham City. It really feels like the whole leveling up system is shoe-horned into the game in order to add play-time to it. Since I have yet to encounter any true ""time limits"" in the game, I see no reason why Batman wouldn't fly around the beginning area, beating up random thugs until he reached maximum level before going out to tackle Gothams meanest and ugliest. I was under the impression that was what his pre-game training was for, but oh well.All in all, if you thought that Batman:Arkham City was a great game, you'll think that Batman:Arkham Origins is also a great game. But if you were, like I was, underwhelmed by the sequel to Batman:Arkham Asylum, then you will be left disappointed by this title.Oh, one last note for the developers: Batman, being the superhero who refuses to kill, would not drop a thug from the top of a building, even if there were a christmas tree to potentially break his fall. It's very out of character and completely broke my immersion in the part - I was from that point onwards playing as Wayce Brune - the cheap Batman knockoff from China, whom evaded customs on the back of a banana shipment.

												I wanted to love this game, but you can tell how it wasn't as polished the same way it would've been if the original developers made it or if only they didn't do a Call of Duty franchise setup with it.Things that made me fall out of love:-The fight setups seem too cramped compared to the original two. It always seemed that the thugs are ganging up on me.-AI is so predictable and frustrating. I already know someone will take a cheap shot at my back when I corner a thug far away from everyone. ALWAYS.-The chaining of moves isn't as responsive as Arkham City. -The grappling hook isn't that responsive when travelling. I always end up on buildings I have to walk around just to pass by it.

												I AM THE NIGHT..........................................Batman Arkham Origins cannot be called a game. It would be insulting to call it a game. Rather it is a expereince. Batman Arkham Origins is the vision of beauty, the perfect Batman simulator. It has detective work, Batman beating up thugs and the Joker. Reviewers complained that it is nothing new from Arkham City and I am not denying that. However, it is still one of the greatest Batman games ever. The predator encounters are intense and the fights are pure awesomesauce. Hearing the thugs reaction upon sneakily performing an inverted takedown is great. Batman feels like the night.  However, the icing on the cake is the boss fights. As you transverse through the story you meet some of your most iconic enemies. The boss fights are awesome because they are not AT ALL scripted events. The bosses take damage like normal enemies.  However combat with them is very fulfilling. Each boss adds variety and menace.Thus I concude by saying that this game is pure awesomesauce and you SHOULD buy it. ♥♥♥♥ IGN. You cant spell ignorant without IGN. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ them.			"

												Before I provide my opinion, please do remember this is all respective of my own experience, as I do not think anyone else will have the exact experience I did. As for the purchase, got this for $10 off of humble bundle and bought the dlcs through steam.I do not suggest this game due to several issues and qualms I had right off the bat (no pun intended), and after a few hours, I stand by my suggestion. The game is poorly ported over, as several major aspects of PC play are completely disregarded and difficult. I personally play on a wide screen monitor, so the fact this game has no ingame FOV or graphical setting to adjust quality to my choosing is deplorable. Furthermore, if you have dual or more monitors running, the game essentially overrides any resolution on these extra monitors despite resolution limitation (i.e. the rest of your screens will be blacked out, kind of pointless dont you think?). The initial graphical settings just consist of Normal and High, not much customization there. Additionally, for those playing on high res monitors, mouse smoothing and the sensitivity options make it extrememly difficult to play as you must manually adjust them through the ini files. This comes to my next problem, as adjusting any of these ini files shoot up the ctd and glitch frequencies beyond the normal buggy gameplay. Of course, I have played the previous games as well, and can shed light on the experience to the plot and mechanics. The mechanics have relatively stayed the same, but imo, have been simplified right off the bat. The executions are far more limited than in previous games and I think the responsiveness of the movement suffers as a result of the above optimization issues. That being said, its pretty much the same thing as the previous game. Some new gadgets and detective methods have been added, but the balancing efforts disrupted much of the combat. I still say play the first two over this one as they were much better imo.With the lack of optimization and subpar experience, save yourself the trouble and dont buy this, but if you must persist, get it during a sale. The skins are unavailable during the initial playthrough which is again a bummer as most of the dlc consists of skin packs, and replay is not an experience I wished to partake in. My advice for dlc's, get the campaign addons, avoid the season pass, you'll save cash.			"

												Arkham Origins is not an origin story for Batman, but rather for how Batman comes across some of his greatest enemies in later years. That being said, Arkham Origins has a dark and impacting story that shapes his character within only one explosive christmas night. Though the game is handled by new developers, combat, stealthing, and other game elements are kept intact are extremely addicting. Though all of Gotham is exposed, the side content doesn't feel as immersive as one would want it to be, despite the fact it's most often fun. There are a few new gadgets, but nothing game changing. A few short conveniences also provide nothing too notable. It may have not stepped up the bar, but it's stil an Arkham Game. 8/10			"

												Finally, I finished yet another wonderful game. And thankfulIy this game has everything it's previous Arkham games had. The ""Hero moment"". To my surprise it's pretty much Arkam city, however, a tad bigger. I mean why wouldn't it be right? Previously ""Arkham City"" had everything except for the feel of an actual city. Rather than just another large prison which was half of the city of gothem itself. Arkahm Origins,The story is pertty stirght forward you are the batman. A myth amongs the good people living in gothem. As well as to the scumbages, and the hardend crminals. You are either a story that's good enough to just pass the time. Or you a force to be reckoned with. To the officals and press, you are nothing more than a deranged person in a costume playing vigalante. To them you are needed to be put down.  On the dawn of chrismas eve a bounty was placed on his head. 50 million dollars in cash, to whomever can kills  this supposedly the Dark protector. Moments later, the worlds deadlyest assassin's come out of the shadows, to come and collect there reward. Cold cold heart,A dlc for Arkam origins that tells the story of Victor fres aka ""Mr, Freez"". Here we would know, how or why did he became the iconic vilian as we all know him to this day. Did he turn out this way becuase of the lush for fortune, fame and power. Or was there a more to his stroy? Let's find out. The combat is solid. Just as it's pervious Arkham games. A stedy beatem up. From the well timed counter attacks to utalizing every single technological, and physical tool at your disposal. Scaring the living daylight out of cold hearted criminals.  On the plus side they got to introduce a few new bad guys to beat up. As well as a few new upgrades. Some of which are just referbished items the older ones. But still interseting. Also you get to have new fast travling system the bat plaine.  Which makes this game an interesting begining to the epic story of the caped crusader. I was one of the lucky few that didn't get to see the deadly bugs that cuased such a headache from launch day. That just ruined the game's overall experience for so many. And I am glad that they even worked harder to fix if. So that gives them a few points in my book.Overall, it's a good game to experiance the: ""I am Batman!!!"" moment . Which makes this still worthy of it's name ""Arkham"".			"

If only one could frolic throught the inner city like we did in the first (being Goldeneye of course). This game brings back all that 60's nam nostalgia you've been craving since that batshit crazy gook bit off your ear, and includes a wonderful soundtrack of whale noises if you preordered it. IF you were to translate it, like I did, using my whale-vionic sound system, you would know that thee whales tell you the tale of our hero as you play. A line from the reading that I found particularly haunting was.... ""OoahawaAAaoOuosuao"" Such beauty in the inflexion there. Similar to James Earl Jones' performance in Scoursese's ""The Lion King"".Anyways, with saggy shorts like these, who could resist this update to the saga?			"

												This was a big dissapointment unfortunately.Arkham Asylum and City were both epic games that were both strong on story and on character. Here all of those elements are stripped away and you're left with the bare bones fighting parts of the game without much purpose.The story is so thin. A bounty has been put out on Batman. Rather than just sit in his cave or spend the night as Bruce Wayne, he heads out into the city for everyone to take pot shots at him. This story is set back when Batman had only just begun apparently. This idea had real potential as we saw in the recent Batman movies but other than a brief mention of it at the beginning there's very little attention paid to this element in the game. And he has the Batwing! Which he never had in the earlier games... so he starts out his career with a freaking jet that he somehow looses later on? Comon!!All the gadgets from the earlier games are also present which doesn't make any sense chronologically either.I've no idea where the Origins element came from but I get the feeling its just a marketing ploy.After ten mins of playing the game you realise you've been here before. City didn't feel like it was just more of the same. It expanded on both the gameplay and story of Asylum's more focussed efforts. This really feels like a mission pack.i would only recommend this to the most die hard fans who won't mind that there's nothing new here.			"

												I honestly fail to understand why this title got slamed by critics. Yes it is very itterative, but so is the assassins creed series, and that does not mean that the game is bad.So let me put it like this: If you have already completed arkham city/asylum and you're looking for more, this is it!However, don't expect any major additions or improvements to the gameplay.

												This game is actually pretty good in my opinion. The combat doesn't feel as smooth or fluid as Arkham City and I do find myself occasionally messing up and breaking a streak when I shouldn't have, but overal this game is really fun and a good time. I suggest you buy it on sale though due to the lack of replay value. You beat it once and never go back. Overall I'd give it an 8/10 :)			"

The pros really cover up most of the cons and the cons (for me at least) aren't really a big deal. This game is totaly worth checking out especially if you played the first 2 Batman games.			"

												I can deal with a game that's a bit buggy, or has serious issues on launch if they get fixed.This still has serious game stopping crash bugs in it though, which apparently will never be fixed.My progress in the game is halted by a persistant game crash after defeating a bunch of thugs in the ship while going after the penguin. I'm only 5% into the game on the mission ""Final Offer"".Don't buy this for any price.Update: Buying a new video card fixed the crash bug I was getting, the game seems ok now. My old card was a 512mb 9800 GTX though, which is above the minimum system requirements. So I still don't recommend this game, it seems like the system requirements aren't accurate or the game has serious hardware compatibility issues.			"

												[PROS]- Tweaks the Arkham Combat System to be slightly faster, more ""crunchier"".- Boss fights are some of the BEST in the series, which includes Arkham Knight (almost non-existent) as well.- Deathstroke is fully playable in Combat and Predator Maps.- Many hours of replay value in order to complete the Dark Knight Challenges, New Game+, and I Am The Night.- Multiplayer mode adds a welcoming distraction to the main game and has its own progression system and Achievements.- Overall plot is a more FOCUSED and easily the most digestible story of the Arkham games.[CONS]- Does not innovate as much as Arkham City; very FEW new game mechanics are introduced.- Many hours of FRUSTRATION to complete MISSIBLE Achievements, Dark Knight Challenges, and ""cheap"" deaths in I Am The Night.- Deathstroke and Bruce Wayne Challenge Maps provide NO Achievements and may be SKIPPED entirely if uninterested.- Features Multiplayer Achievements, some of which may be EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to achieve due to LACK of players online throughout the day or poor matchups.- Adept players of the Arkham Series may find the main story to be quite SHORT and Predator Rooms can be easily solved by ABUSING the Batclaw.""Batman: Arkham Origins features a large open cityscape with few changes to the core game mechanics already established by Rocksteady. Playing as Batman feels very similar as in Arkham City which makes for a easy transition into this installment. Visuals are much improved in this sequel and the voice work is noticeably top notch.Players can expect an additional 20+ hours of gameplay to hunt achievements and complete side quests. Both Batman's upgrades and Dark Knight Challenge progress carry over into New Game+, allowing players to complete tasks they weren't able to accomplish the first time around. New Predator and Combat challenge maps add variety to the entire experience, especially for those who enjoy the gameplay of the Arkham series. Obtaining all 3 medals in every challenge map feels rewarding and justly earned.Multiplayer is a welcoming distraction to the game, but only features two game modes and some very tedious/frustrating multiplayer-specific achievements. Some players may experience PC performance issues that probably won't be solved due to WB Montreal no longer supporting the game.Overall, this game satisfies most Arkham fans, bringing together iconic villains such as Black Mask, Bane, and of course, the Joker, in one compelling story.""

												Arkham origins is a great game dealing with stealth and tactics, with a great combat system. The stealth is great as you sneak and can be utilized with your gadgets. The combat is flowing and rythmic, making it easy to take down large groups of enemies.My only problems with the game would be the out of game UI. It often is lagy and you cannot exit a mission that you have started.Hope you enjoyed this quick review.			"

												I, hand on heart, can't recommend this game.Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy playing it. The storylines good, the challenges have a great learning curve. They managed to keep the same kind of gameplay as Arkham City plus add more scope to the detective cases. This they should be proud of. I'm not going to stop playing it until I've finished Cold, Cold Heart.The bugs are the issue here. When you walk into a room and end up falling through the floor, you know that this game was rushed and hastily put together. The amount of times you see something that should have been flagged straight away by bug testers is amazing.WB Montreal made a statement saying ""We're only going to fix the game breaking bugs"". I gotta tell you guys, you failed. Royally.I'm probably going to dodge anything by WB Montreal and Splash Damage for the forseeable future. I certainly won't be pre-ordering any new titles from either Studio.If you are kind of interested in this, Wait to see if they fix the bugs, then wait until its in the Steam Sale.			"

												This game is crap. He took all the great things away, and gave me stuipd grading on how I fight, tell me I am dumb even if I whoop some butt and don't even get touched. Basically give up playing the game when you get to Deathstroke, at least on Hard. I fought that guy like 10 times, and went touchless the whole fight, and at end he still finds a way to win. No matter what you do, perfectly counter every move, he still gets to hit you. Even when you grapple him, 5 times out of 10, he still counter acts, and still hits you.For this one fight alone, and all the stupid fighting I don't want to do, this game pisses me off more than any. What is point in putting this fight in there, besides to just♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. I am opposite of a button pusher, and I am playing a game that relies on fast button hitting, and they are wanting me to do learn the guys moves, and even when I do, he still freaking gets to hit me. I call BS on the studio, becuase this game sucks, and I don't plan on finishing it. I rather restart and play on Easy rather than face that guy 1 more time.  "

													I don’t understand how this game received a 7.8 on IGN. This isn’t necessarily bad, however, Call of Doge received a score of 8.8, which irritates me endlessly.This isn’t the best of the series, but it still is a lot of fun. The plot is a major improvement to Arkham City’s and the cinematic cut scenes are excellent. I’m not sure why people are upset about The Joker being the main antagonist. This is a PREQUEL! Of course he’s going to be the main baddy because this is technically the first time we are introduced to him! This doesn’t take place right after city, folks; this is before Asylum and the plot clearly indicates that. The free-flow combat is still beautiful, but could have been improved more such as adding more combat moves. IGN deducted points because there’s ‘too many win buttons’, someone please explain that to me. WHY is that a bad thing?The environment of this game is okay, but is not as lively as City; of course because of the thick snow. IGN also says there isn’t enough Easter Eggs… I’m not sure what game they played. Enigma has his challenges all over the map. IGN also said the city was ‘lifeless’. Again, not sure what game the played. You run into crimes in progresses and baddies roam around the streets.IGN was completely unfair reviewing this game. They complain about it not having many changes compared to it predecessor, but YET they gave CoD of Doge an 8.8… Clearly IGN is being paid off here, either that or they got someone who is a big CoD fan to review the game. At least the community votes reveal the truth, as the community gave Origins an 8.9 and CoD of Doge a 3.2. "

												Batman Arkham Origins is a game developed by  WB Games Montreal. The game has an amazing combat like the previous Batman games but i seriously dont recommend it. The game itself doesnt give the player the sensation of playing  Batman as a Superhero. The casting is so weak, so weak!. Bruce Wayne looks Feminine  , and Alfred like a pedophile and pretty much every character design is bad. If you intend to buy a Batman game just buy Arkham asylum or Arkham City. Personally i think this game was a waste of money. I am just going to wait for the next Batman game which is going to be developed by Rockstar.			"

												It may not have the gripping, egdy story of Arkham Asylum, or the pulsepounding gameplay everyone loved from Arkham City but this game still holds a place among some of the greatest Batman games. Simply because the overall formula in terms of combat and manuerverability around the now expansive city of Gotham, it has been given low marks. Personally, I feel that the storyline presented in this iteration of the Batman: Arkham franchise is one of their most unique and intriguing yet. It has shown a much more human side to The Dark Knight than has been seen since the end of Akrham City. Throughout the games, we simply know he is the Batman but here where learn WHY he is the Batman. That should be more than enough to grant this game a playthrough.			"

If you have terrible reaction speed just be prepared to play the same section over and over and over again, and also be prepared to be lost, as this puppy rarely holds your hand through some of the levels.

												i would recommend batman to those who love a good story, a gripping edge game with lots of great mechanics and story, both the single player and the multiplayer are great,Here are some pro's and con's about the multiplayer.Pros:*The game is really fun to play with friends*The hero/villian is simmilar to the star wars battlefront 2 game making the game really fun to play.*Being batman and robin with a friend can make the game really fun systimatically trying to take down all the villians.*Being able to run around and hide as batman and robin makes it good because there are many ways to take out opponents.*The games Mechanics are quite like Gears Of War, making the game a easy game to understand the mechanics off and just pick up a keyboard/controller and get to it.Cons:*in loading scenes if you hear your friends are on before you, that almost always means, you aint joining that game.*there is no grouping system, so you all have to quickly try and get into the lobby while there is space.*Nobody plays the other game mode, unless then cant find a game on the other one.*at the start of a game you can join with a team of just you, even though the game must have 8 players at the start, meaning it kicks them off, which can make one sided games.*Players cant join midgame.

												Do not get your hopes up, if you buy this game. Also do not be fooled.It may have the word Arkham in the title. But it is far from the other great games, in the somewhat recent series. Even with it on sale at 17.99. It's still a risky gamble, to buy this game, as you probably won't like it. However at least it's pretty low risk, and makes some degree of sense at under 20.00 dollars.However, I'm not convinced it's worth it at full price, even slashed a bit at 29.99.The game is filled with bugs, and it plays like, wearing your pants on head RE RE.If the other two games had a younger brother, who fell down a flight of stairs, making him mentally slow and he developed a drinking problem.It would be this game. I say it's a easy pass and it's best to wait for the next one, after looking through professional and player reviews.This game is all but broken.			"

This is Deathstoke we're talking about), the controls are unresponsive and sluggish (I played with an Xbox one controller, the official pc drivers let it act the same as a 360 controller), the game is glitchy (with npc's often clipping into the ground being a particularly annoying problem for me), and you can't even use the costume dlc until you finish the stinkin' game. This game is such a letdown. I have been told Arkham City is much better by my bro who recently finished it. So consider spending your money there if you want a GOOD Batman game.			"

												This installment is definately half-baked and underdone. While the first two game were quite silly, they were still fun.This one doesn't feel fun, the side-quests quests feel more like chores and the main quests are uninspired and repetitions of the earlier games that add very little to the series. Graphically the game feels like it was made BEFORE the others. The levels lack detail and look primitive. A very big step backwards from CITY which had amazimg detail and still looks great. Origins feels like I'm playing a fan-made mod for CITY. The game is BUGGY and glitchy. Stupid little bugs that didn't exist in any of the previous games. Batman sometimes has real trouble figuring out if he's gliding or falling and other times whether he's grabbing a ledge or falling past it. So even the engine is a step backwards. Lastly the storyline....this game does not feel like an ""origin"" story. I think whoever decide to go with ""origin"" was not connected to the rest of the development team. Batman is already well kitted out at the start of the game and there is little-to-no development into how he becomes later Batman. Character-wise and technology-wise he already is (Grapnel-Boost?). It seems the ""origin"" aspect was just a clumsy way to bring back characters that had already died in the previous games.DISCLAIMER: I haven't finished the game, but the way it going I don't know if I will.

												After playing a lot of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I went to Arkhams Origins, and oh boy, it's bad. At first it could be that it is so similar to the other two, which is not a bad thing, all things considered, but more that it is so riddled with bugs and glitchs that it becomes unplayable. I'm talking about unresponsive combat controls, graphics bugs (I found a whole area of the map that is just blank, like the devs forgot to make it) and, after a few hours of playing, I couldn't even keep on, I reached an area where the game froze every time. Definitely not worth it.			"

												Profoundly frustrating experience.  They took something that was near perfect and made it passable.  There are so many annoying little bugs everywhere, the story is forgettable, and the collectibles aren't even hard.  That being said, I still played almost 100% of the content, excluding New Game + and other harder difficulties.  I can only imagine that those modes simply make a frustrating game into a near-impossible one.  Everyone knows these were crumbs Warner Bros. fed us to keep our mouths watering for Arkham Knight.  I'm ashamed to say they did their job very well.			"

												This game was pretty cool, about an 6.5 out of 10.  The game play was very similar to Batman Arkham City.  It pretty much consisted of the same main missions and side missions as Arkham City except with different bad Superheros.  Gadgets pretty much performed the same  actions as the ones in Arkham City except these ""new"" ones had different names and minor tweaks (i.e. new glue gernade instead of the old ice gernade.)  The old Riddler Trophies are now Enigma data packs but they involve almost identical puzzles as to Arkham City.  I could go on about this forever but you pretty much get the point.However, if you are able to play the game on the ultra settings, it is a sight to behold.  I played Arkham City on PS3 but my visual expierence on my new self built computer was a lot better.  The character and city textures and shadows are amazing.  I couldn't believe how the snow on top of buildies realistically reacted to enemies and my footprints when sneeking and fighting.  Knocked down enemies leave body shaped dents in fresh snow cover and each foot print looks like real as if someone was walking through 4-6 inches of snow.  When inside buildings, debris and trash reacts realistically to the enemies that walk through it like ive never seen in a video game.  The texture details really made the game a more enjoyable than the similar one I played on the consul.However, stunning graphics and texture detials comes the need for a powerful unit to process them.  I do not know the exact specificaitons of the game but I tried playing the game on the lowest settings on my middle market laptop and it absolutely sucked.  Now I know that only specific laptops are made for gaming and mine was not made for it but even dumbing down the graphics and reslolution to its minimum wouldnt even get me past the first character interaction.  I then decided to play it on the computer i just built (Intel I5-4430 Quad core, 8GB DDR3 RAM, Sapphire Radeon R9 280 3GB GDDR5 Grahpics Card) and it was able to process everything just find on all Ultra settings.All in all I would not reccomend this game if you previously played Batman Arkham City.  The story lines between the two games are almost identical along with the gadgets and side missions.  Even though the Ultra graphics settings and the texture detials are quite impressive, it is not worth picking up unless you know 100% that you have the hardware required to play the game on Ultra.  Also, I would not buy this game at all for its original price, the only way I would MAYBE get this game was if it goes on sale for very cheap.Go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves,Cory			"

												An ok ish prequel. Stuffed full of bugs. One thing i hated about it was the increased number of cutscenes compared to previous games in the series. That and the fact that, even though the game its self runs fine for the most part, there are glitches (battling with killer crock, he dissapears and reappears with depressing frequecy) or the fact that cutscenes are jerky and out of synch. I am going to give this a big fat dont touch. Buy the first two by all means. They are good little games, which will take an average gamer about 12-15 hours to complete the story of, then a further 5 hours to complete the puzzles. The challenges are a nice touch i suppose.Long story short, it was probably great on console, but on steam it sucks prong.			"

												Completed this game on the first difficulty. Spent no time on side quests or bonus objectives, and the game still took me ~12 hours to complete (Whether that's because I suck or the game is just long). Ive just restarted the game on the second difficulty (which carries over your previous unlocks etc.). I'm currently stuck on the thug fight on the boat searching for Penguin. This game is probably a step behind Arkham City but a short step ahead of Arkham Asylum. All in all, a superb game!Yea:BatmanOpen world with plenty of different villains to apprehend.

												[PROS]- Tweaks the Arkham Combat System to be slightly faster, more ""crunchier"".- Boss fights are some of the BEST in the series, which includes Arkham Knight (almost non-existent) as well.- Deathstroke is fully playable in Combat and Predator Maps.- Many hours of replay value in order to complete the Dark Knight Challenges, New Game+, and I Am The Night.- Multiplayer mode adds a welcoming distraction to the main game and has its own progression system and Achievements.- Overall plot is a more FOCUSED and easily the most digestible story of the Arkham games.[CONS]- Does not innovate as much as Arkham City; very FEW new game mechanics are introduced.- Many hours of FRUSTRATION to complete MISSIBLE Achievements, Dark Knight Challenges, and ""cheap"" deaths in I Am The Night.- Deathstroke and Bruce Wayne Challenge Maps provide NO Achievements and may be SKIPPED entirely if uninterested.- Features Multiplayer Achievements, some of which may be EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to achieve due to LACK of players online throughout the day or poor matchups.- Adept players of the Arkham Series may find the main story to be quite SHORT and Predator Rooms can be easily solved by ABUSING the Batclaw.""Batman: Arkham Origins features a large open cityscape with few changes to the core game mechanics already established by Rocksteady. Playing as Batman feels very similar as in Arkham City which makes for a easy transition into this installment. Visuals are much improved in this sequel and the voice work is noticeably top notch.Players can expect an additional 20+ hours of gameplay to hunt achievements and complete side quests. Both Batman's upgrades and Dark Knight Challenge progress carry over into New Game+, allowing players to complete tasks they weren't able to accomplish the first time around. New Predator and Combat challenge maps add variety to the entire experience, especially for those who enjoy the gameplay of the Arkham series. Obtaining all 3 medals in every challenge map feels rewarding and justly earned.Multiplayer is a welcoming distraction to the game, but only features two game modes and some very tedious/frustrating multiplayer-specific achievements. Some players may experience PC performance issues that probably won't be solved due to WB Montreal no longer supporting the game.Overall, this game satisfies most Arkham fans, bringing together iconic villains such as Black Mask, Bane, and of course, the Joker, in one compelling story.""

												Finally, I finished yet another wonderful game. And thankfulIy this game has everything it's previous Arkham games had. The ""Hero moment"". To my surprise it's pretty much Arkam city, however, a tad bigger. I mean why wouldn't it be right? Previously ""Arkham City"" had everything except for the feel of an actual city. Rather than just another large prison which was half of the city of gothem itself. Arkahm Origins,The story is pertty stirght forward you are the batman. A myth amongs the good people living in gothem. As well as to the scumbages, and the hardend crminals. You are either a story that's good enough to just pass the time. Or you a force to be reckoned with. To the officals and press, you are nothing more than a deranged person in a costume playing vigalante. To them you are needed to be put down.  On the dawn of chrismas eve a bounty was placed on his head. 50 million dollars in cash, to whomever can kills  this supposedly the Dark protector. Moments later, the worlds deadlyest assassin's come out of the shadows, to come and collect there reward. Cold cold heart,A dlc for Arkam origins that tells the story of Victor fres aka ""Mr, Freez"". Here we would know, how or why did he became the iconic vilian as we all know him to this day. Did he turn out this way becuase of the lush for fortune, fame and power. Or was there a more to his stroy? Let's find out. The combat is solid. Just as it's pervious Arkham games. A stedy beatem up. From the well timed counter attacks to utalizing every single technological, and physical tool at your disposal. Scaring the living daylight out of cold hearted criminals.  On the plus side they got to introduce a few new bad guys to beat up. As well as a few new upgrades. Some of which are just referbished items the older ones. But still interseting. Also you get to have new fast travling system the bat plaine.  Which makes this game an interesting begining to the epic story of the caped crusader. I was one of the lucky few that didn't get to see the deadly bugs that cuased such a headache from launch day. That just ruined the game's overall experience for so many. And I am glad that they even worked harder to fix if. So that gives them a few points in my book.Overall, it's a good game to experiance the: ""I am Batman!!!"" moment . Which makes this still worthy of it's name ""Arkham"".			"

												The events in Arkham Origins take place about five years before Batman: Arkham Asylum, in midwinter Gotham City. This is batmans 2nd year for fighting crime.

												The latest in the Arkham Origins series though fun leaves much to be desired. Dont get me wrong I enjoyed the game, but it is the weakest of the 3 out so far. The lag issues are HORRENDOUS could not even complete the first boss fight. Had to go and edit the congif files to get it to run properly. My computer has 2 7770 Radeons which should run this game smoothly. Any time I leveled up and upgraded I would have to leave that area of the map due to lag this was 20-30 FPS or less. Next is the glitching, during the first Bane fight if you are too close to the wall you are thrown through it and fall off the map completely. Enemies can become stuck in guard rails and just stay there. Sometimes when you are flying Batman would have a spasim flipping around mid air for no reason. Combat is horrid as well you can not counter an enemy as you are throwing a punch. Then there are the combo breakers you'll just throw a punch at no one and lose your score. The camera does not always show where your enemies are they can be off screen and sucker punch you.This could be due to Batman doing this for only 2 years but still. Batman can also get stuck if he grapples improperly leaving you with a view of what ever you were standing on and no way out but to just fall for an auto-reset. This game is riddled with bad game mechanics and enviromental issues. There are also continuity issues that plague this game that I won't even get into due to spoilers, but those eat at me so much more than they should. They range from Bat Tech to your enemies. Boss fights were not to par as the other games' were. Pretty much 3-4 stages follow pattern rinse repeat watch cutscene.The game also requires you to fully be aware of your challenges and achievements many of which are missable. Once the story is complete you are out of luck and have to restart to get the challenges and achieves. The environment just feels like Arkham City, in reality is really just is that only cleaned up. I give it a 5.8/10 only for the most die hard fans of the series.  So all in all fun game but the issues it has are too many to overlook in the review. This game came out Oct 2013 and I started in Feb 2015 AND STILL had to find fixes for these issues.Fingers crossed for Arkham Knight learning from these issues and being a great way to end the series.

												Batman Arkham Origins doesn't have much new from Arkham City, tools are like the same, combat animation too but Gotham is really bigger and so nice under the 24th of December. The story is really good, i liked discovering the Joker as Batman.The thing is : why the Joker again the main ennemy? This is the beginning of the fight of the dark knight, why not Black Mask? He's supposed to fight the mob, the Penguin and Black Mask are just part of side quests... Many ennemies just come by then disappear without really influencing the story and that's pretty bad.Arkham Series are not here to simply put villains for show, they have to blend in... like Riddler's puzzles... They are now so simple we can hardly call them puzzles. Everything is so simplified, we lose a real challenge here.Also : bugs and bugs everywhere but it's so common now, why should they bother?It could really have been better but Aside from that i enjoyed that game, we can feel that it's the beginning of the cape crusader in all that is falling on him. Of course playing that in 3D is also a true experience!I recommend this game for the amazing experience in 3D and the story but i won't say it's a fabulous game, clearly if this repetitive business goes on in the future of the Arkham Series i'll gladly stop buying those			"

Introduction : The game, played from a third-person perspective, focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins introduces the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game is the first in the series with multiplayer capability.(+)Graphics : Graphics have been improved comparing to Arkham City . The game looks even more realistic now .(+)Music :  The melodies don't try to go too far and are consistently coated in adrenaline-pumping elements. You're gonna love it .(+)Cutscenes :  Absolutely FANTASTIC. Can't really tell much witout spoiling everything but cutscenes just wants to make you play more and more !(+)Story :  Arkham origins' main storyline is set five years before that of 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and follows a younger, less-refined Batman. So you have the oppurtunity to witness Batman become a legend from a simple .. rumour .(+)Content :  The content is wide and full of possibilities . You can either keep on following the main storyline , or go after the most wanted targets , glide around the city and help cops in need , or you can just simply run around and deal with the Riddler's crazy puzzles .(-)PVP :  Completely unnecessary . When i first heard about Origins multiplayer option i was very excited , but after actually having a chance to test it out myself i found out that it's nothing like the Singleplayer . In singleplayer you can bash in through your enemies and knock them out witout breaking a sweat . But in multiplayer , batman fights like he is drunk . Not recommended if you're buying for the multiplayer .(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is pretty much like any other Arkham games . Same tools , same counter design , a bunch of different takedowns , but still not boring .My opinion on this game is that it's definitely worth every dollar . If you liked the other Arkham games you'll probably get hooked up on this too .8/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												Sweet graphics and tight controls. If you liked Arkham Asylum, you'll like this game. Perhaps a bit too toned down in terms of simplicity of the introduction to the gameplay. (It assumes you've never played an Arkham game. And, for those who have not, that's fine. For those of us who have, there should be an option to skip such.)  Not as grand as the two prior games. But, a more than worthy addition to the family.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is the third installment of the Batman Arkham series and the pre-quel story of Batman Arkham Asylum, and was developed by a different team than the first two games. Although I must say that Batman AO is inferior compared to its predecessors gameplay-wise but still pretty good story-wise. I recommend you to play Batman AO if you are a fan of the Batman Arkham series, and I FULLY recommend you to get the Cold - Cold Heart DLC since its got a really good and interesting story, as well as the bad*** new suit  THE XE SUIT ,TL,DR; I still quite enjoyed playing Batman AO, but I don't feel the solid gameplay that I got when I played the previous installments.Pros:+ GOOD gameplay, but somehow I felt that AO has an awkward feel and controls compared to its predecessor. + GOOD story. + GOOD fighting system. Free Flow Combat with this new feature ( Shock Gloves ) is a huge fun.+ GOOD array of gadgets, allowing you to takedown enemies with your own style. + GOOD sound. + GOOD atmosphere. + GOOD graphics, better than the previous games. + GREAT characters and voice acting, the characters really felt like they are coming right out of the comics. + Detective Mode Case Reconstruction is a fun new feature, but could be done better.+ Dark Knight System is a good addition as well, but is implemented poorly, especially the Predator System.+ Batwing drop system, allowing us to Fast Travel to certain points in Gotham City.Cons:- The controls feel a bit awkward and clunky.- Most areas are just copied from Batman Arkham City maps.- More collectibles, but less Riddles.- Gotham City is a huge city, but the lack of any civilians feels weird to me. All I see are thugs. Is this Gotham City? or Arkham City, where all its inhabitants are criminals?- Dark Knight System Challenges should be able to be done in ANY ORDER, to avoid any missable challenge(s).- Missable predator challenge, because some of them can only be done in certain maps of the STORY mode. This is seriously annoying, especially because this game uses autosave system. Imagine if you forgot to do a 1 predator challenge, progress through the story, autosaving and BAM you just missed the opportunity because its the only area where you can do the challenge.- Less polished, Batman AO still has many bugs, such as: -> gliding achievement sometimes not triggered, it takes a few tries. -> sometimes after the Riddler Informant was interrogated, NO new collectibles are marked on the map, and then you must run around to find ANOTHER Riddler Informant.-> sometimes predator challenges are not counted when the conditions are met, but sometimes counted when the conditions are not met. I know, I am confused as well...Overall: 80/100 "

Introduction : The game, played from a third-person perspective, focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins introduces the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene and identify the culprit. The game is the first in the series with multiplayer capability.(+)Graphics : Graphics have been improved comparing to Arkham City . The game looks even more realistic now .(+)Music :  The melodies don't try to go too far and are consistently coated in adrenaline-pumping elements. You're gonna love it .(+)Cutscenes :  Absolutely FANTASTIC. Can't really tell much witout spoiling everything but cutscenes just wants to make you play more and more !(+)Story :  Arkham origins' main storyline is set five years before that of 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and follows a younger, less-refined Batman. So you have the oppurtunity to witness Batman become a legend from a simple .. rumour .(+)Content :  The content is wide and full of possibilities . You can either keep on following the main storyline , or go after the most wanted targets , glide around the city and help cops in need , or you can just simply run around and deal with the Riddler's crazy puzzles .(-)PVP :  Completely unnecessary . When i first heard about Origins multiplayer option i was very excited , but after actually having a chance to test it out myself i found out that it's nothing like the Singleplayer . In singleplayer you can bash in through your enemies and knock them out witout breaking a sweat . But in multiplayer , batman fights like he is drunk . Not recommended if you're buying for the multiplayer .(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is pretty much like any other Arkham games . Same tools , same counter design , a bunch of different takedowns , but still not boring .My opinion on this game is that it's definitely worth every dollar . If you liked the other Arkham games you'll probably get hooked up on this too .8/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												People hated this game, they said that it wasnt as good as Arkham City.Story wise thats true, doesn't change the fact that this games story is still good, I mean who doesnt want to see batman's origins and his first encounter with Joker is amazing.In my opinion the side missions for this game blow the City's out of the water. I constantly found myself just doing the side missions because they were fun and interesting. All up this game is a good one, they didnt change too much but what they did change improved on City. Yes this game was a little glitchy from time to time but its a welcome edition to the Arkham family. "

												The Bat has existed for a while, the legend is known to roam the night, pulling thugs from the light into the dark.Gotham is changing.. slowly but steady, even though the law is not with him, it's still in him, he knows true justice and knows the gray balance between the black and white that right and wrong is.However the city changes to terror for one night, Black Mask puts up a bounty on hes head and the night ends up nothing like The Bat might expect.. even though he expects the worst.This Batman game is the third to be a part of the Arkham series, known infamously to be the worst, which in all honesty is untrue, the game is (after a lot of updating) finally fairly polished and provides well over 20+ hours of entertainment with a slick and fresh Batman. Fighting mechanics has been fixed the Batwing provides the well needed transport and the villains provides the drama, action and fireworks that these comic heroes needs.The Best Arkham game in my HUMBLE opinion.9/10			"

												Hands down the best in the series; you will not be dissapointed. This is the best looking, most badass batman out of all the series. The boss fights are absolutely amazing with astonishing cutscenes. I cannot stress enough how great this game is, and how ""more badass"" it is.  I have not run into any bugs , and I am currently on my 6th playthrough. Most of the negative reviews came from the bugs, but I guess they are all fixed now. The city looks flawless. The sandbox environment is very good and really makes you feel immersed. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are really great games, but this one tops it all off. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you feel really jacked when you fight Deathstroke and Firefly. V: 10/10A: 10/10Story: 10/10 Realism: F--- you, I'm Batman.P.S. I actually have over double (almost triple) the hours you see above.			"

												Sweet graphics and tight controls. If you liked Arkham Asylum, you'll like this game. Perhaps a bit too toned down in terms of simplicity of the introduction to the gameplay. (It assumes you've never played an Arkham game. And, for those who have not, that's fine. For those of us who have, there should be an option to skip such.)  Not as grand as the two prior games.

												Batman Arkham Origins doesn't have much new from Arkham City, tools are like the same, combat animation too but Gotham is really bigger and so nice under the 24th of December. The story is really good, i liked discovering the Joker as Batman.The thing is : why the Joker again the main ennemy? This is the beginning of the fight of the dark knight, why not Black Mask? He's supposed to fight the mob, the Penguin and Black Mask are just part of side quests... Many ennemies just come by then disappear without really influencing the story and that's pretty bad.Arkham Series are not here to simply put villains for show, they have to blend in... like Riddler's puzzles... They are now so simple we can hardly call them puzzles. Everything is so simplified, we lose a real challenge here.Also : bugs and bugs everywhere but it's so common now, why should they bother?It could really have been better but Aside from that i enjoyed that game, we can feel that it's the beginning of the cape crusader in all that is falling on him. Of course playing that in 3D is also a true experience!I recommend this game for the amazing experience in 3D and the story but i won't say it's a fabulous game, clearly if this repetitive business goes on in the future of the Arkham Series i'll gladly stop buying those			"

												I think my main problem with this game is that I love Arkham City and Asylum and even though Arkham Origins tries hard to be on the same level in terms of game design it just isn't as good - by far. Plus even though it features Gotham City, this city is just as dead as Arkham City (where this made a lot more sense!). So after all Arkham Origins doesn't add anything new to this amazing series and the gameplay IMO isn't as much fun. Sure, it's not entirely a bad game, and if you don't mind playing more of the same with a lesser quality or if you're new to the series, then it might be worth the money but for me it wasn't enough this time!

Still I felt a lot of repetition and getting some franchise fatigue. The same thing I have with Assassin's Creed series. Great games but they didn't really need to make them that often.Overall if you're a big fan of the series I would recommend the game.			"

												The pacing of the story is slow and a little underwhelming at the begining of the game but, makes up for it by the end. For the gameplay is very much touch and go all the time. Half the time batman does what you tell him to do and, other times he jumps in front of a guy with a shotgun and causes you to die. This problem in terms of the gameplay doesn't seem to stop at this game but, continues throughout the series. It's one of the most annoying aspects of the game but, could just be the PC port I'm not sure seeing as I only own a PC. The story in the begining like I said is slow and underwhelming with a lot of bits sprinkled about and having you piece them together by the middle of the game. By the half way mark the game really starts to pick up big time at least the depth of the story. Most of my time during the game actually took place doing the side repeatitive side missions. Granted the side missions will take up most of your time if you choose to do them. The world just like other batman games is vibrant and full of life everything from the steam shooting out from the vents to the interactive snowfall. The skill upgrades are lacking to a degree and, my first and probably only play through I did on Hard and by only upgrading the melee side of the tree. This made it extremely easy by mid game once you start mastering the flows of a fight getting easily 40x hit combos. This part of the game is only made easier by the electric gloves you pick up during the game downing twenty enemies fairly easily. The boss fights however were fun and hair pulling. Every boss fight you go through on hard difficulty will take you more than five times to complete and, you end up knowing all the moves of the boss by the end of the fight. One other part of the batman games I don't care for is the fact they seem to hand everything to the character as they go holding their hand all the way through. Overall I'm glad I stuck in and played the last half of the game for me it's a 6/10			"

												If you're anything like me and you've played the other Arkham games but overlooked this game as it wasn't made by Rocksteady and got mediocre reviews, but are still itching for some more Batman fun then this game is worth a try.I can't really say too much bad about this game, it's alright really. Nothing special, but worth a play through. It's very similar to Arkham City and even reuses a lot of the same assets, but it differentiates itself enough for it to feel like it has its own thing going on.The story is a bit routine and mundane but it does have its fun moments, and it does a decent job of providing the Arkham series with a starting point in its narrative, not that I necessarily feel like that was actually needed. I particularly liked the boss battles. I won't spoil it by naming names, but there is one boss battle in particular which makes this game worth playing.There is some slight oddness with the free-flow combos for me, like they just don't quite work nicely, and I often dropped out of a combo when I feel like I shouldn't have. It's like the timing on pressing the buttons at the right time is a little too slow. I had a few slight glitches and I had one hard crash towards the start, but generally speaking the game works quite well. I got a pretty consistent framerate and the graphics are fairly pleasing if unremarkable.I would say this game is better than a lot of the initial reviews may have made it seem. That being said I understand the game was reported to have had a lot of bugs and issues at release, but I didn't play it until recently. I got the game for free with all the DLC from WB after the whole Arkham Knight debacle. I'm not so sure I would have been too impressed with the game had I paid full price, but I would say it's definitely worth buying if you can get it on sale for a decent price.			"

												Unforuntely, this game felt like a cheap cash-in by WB. I am hoping that Rocksteady's next installment will be much better. This game lacked the length and substance of the previous installments, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.			"

												I don't understand why this game has some negative reviews. Most agree that this is the weakest entry in the Arkham series so far, but I don't see it. I have really enjoyed my time with Arkham Origins. The story is great and the voice acting is even better. It really puts the events in Arkham City into perspective. I will be replaying that one next just because of this game lol. If you are a Batman fan, there is no excuse not to pick this up! It has challenging bosses, fun stealth missions, and a story with all kinds of fun twist and turns! The game is not perfect though. I have encountered a crashing issue every so often. It's annoying but by no means harms the game as a whole. I recommend picking this up if you are looking for an exciting adventure with a story that will suck you in! Enjoy =) "

												Main game: fun, but too many ideas borrowed from Arkham City.  The final boss fight is literally a rehash of the ingenius Mr. Freeze fight from B:AC.  The story is decent & Troy Baker's performance as the Joker is excellent.  Bane is closer to Nolan's version of an intelligent villain rather than the cartoon versions of a stupid brute, so that's good.  I loved Arkham City & while I'd say this game was fun, I understand that they had no original ideas and used Arkham City to tell another Batman story.Final verdict: 7.5/10DLC: How long was it Angry Joe?  3.5-4 hours, including getting all of the achievements.  The story was okay.  Where as the main story had an original take on the Joker and other's origin stories, this was Mr. Freeze's origin story and was pretty much an exact retelling without much deviation from other versions.  At least it felt somewhat different with the new ice moves and stuff, but that's not really enough to recommend at anything over $2.  Oh, and the other DLC in the season pass was some garbage challenge maps and different suits for Batman which you can only use once you've beaten the main game and go for new game plus or plus plus (aka: I Am The Night mode).Final verdict there: 6/10 and don't get the season pass			"

												If you enjoy a monotonous tasker that underwhelms, this is a game for you. Otherwise, this game gets boring pretty quick doing the same thing over and over again. Go Here, go there, do this, but before you can finish it, you have to do that. Not nearly as boring as the recent Assassin's Creed installments, but I can't recommend this game as it becomes quite tedious doing too many similar actions with little to no variation in between.

												This game gets a lot of hate and I don't know why.  I can understand people being upset by game breaking bugs, I had one such bug when the game initially released, but it was patched within a day or two.  I can even understand people being upset by annoying bugs that happen frequently, in which I had that as well.  But none of that matters when you're able to be sucked into such a beautiful world of beating the crap out of bad guys looking like a bat.  If you love anything about Batman, you need to play this game.10/10			"

												Another great entry to a great series. Batman: Arkham Origins deserves none of the hate it gets from fans of the Batman games. I'll tell you one thing, though, WB did not innovate too much on the gameplay from the previous Arkham games. But, I ask you a question: is this really a bad thing? WB was wise to do this instead of taking the risk to change the game in a series that doesn't belong to them. So, what we get is another Batman game that lets us explore Gotham City once again and relive the beginning of the Dark Knight. The story, by the way, is a great excuse to throw in some SICK boss battles. The boss battles are each so different and challenging, I'll tell ya. And while I hear this game has major bugs at launch, all seem to be entirely fixed at this point in time, more than a year after launch. Speaking of fixes, this PC port is AMAZING! It runs beautifully, all settings maxed out, getting 40 fps (which is good enough for me for a 3rd person game) on my GT755M, a laptop graphics card, mind you. And with all of the nvidia-specific features, you'll be happy you're a PC gamer. And going back to the game content itself, Batman: Arkham Origins has the usual massive amount of side quests and things to do outside of story missions. Now, I've, for the most part, only played the story missions, but I plan on going back soon enough to do more side quests. One string of side quests I saw a bit of on youtube has you finding the Most Wanted Criminals of Gotham, letting you fight more boss battles, and ultimately squeezing as much as you can out of this worthy entry. While Origins doesn't add too much to the gameplay aspect (which is already simply perfect), there is no reason you shouldn't pass up the chance to enjoy it again in addition to a surpringly good story.9/10--Origins is a game which follows the rule: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".... and I appreciate that.

												-> MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD <-Batman Arkham Origins when it was initially released had too many bugs to count, that frankly not only ruined the overallexperience but in some cases made the game literally unplayable. Having played the previous Arkham games and seeing the Trailer for the game I got really hyped, it looked promising. So how does the game fare?-Intro:To start off - the setting is great, playing the role of an unrefined Batman struggling to survive on Christmas Eve being targeted by 8 hired killers of Black Mask and the one and only - Joker whilst getting to know himself, what he wants, his ambitions and goals in life and who he is or will become, how to world views him. Meeting familiar faces and forging the friendships and rivalries we know and love from DC characters.-StoryThe Story is mediocre and it throws its trump-card, the big reveal WAY TO EARLY!I don't want to spoil anything so I won't continue with this section.-The WorldThe game starts at the Blackgate Prison Facility, being overrun by criminals, and the beloved ""super-criminals"". Batman has to investigate who is behind the prison break and put an end to their deeds. While the prison segment is great, the intro fantastic, and later being introduced to all the assassin that you will face later on, with amazing backstories and cinematics, through that little segment the goals are set and you have a purpose as a player and as Batman!<->And it pretty much goes downhill from here except one or two points in the game.<->Getting to explore all of Gotham sounded great! (on paper) The game features the same places as Arkham City, adding in the rest of Gotham (an island south of the Arkham part) Two equally large places for you to travel and explore! The game introduces a fast travel option which makes the whole exploration thing a lot faster getting from place to place. One of the biggest drawbacks of this game is that freeroaming Gotham isn't as fulfilling or satisfying as the previous game. The world is really bland (going as far as to say the city feels dead at some parts). The snow that is covering ALL of Gotham is there so they can hide the fact that they are unable to create a lust and immersive city for the player to explore and interact.You will feel like you are making circles around the place or just seeing the same places over and over again, because you can't tell where you are going or making progress, forcing you to open and close the map every 5 seconds to get your bearings. Both upper and southern Gotham, are 99% most of the part boring, they don't offer any interesting places to explore and the places that are rehashed are more interesting that the new places (solely for the fact that you want to find how much bland the Arkham City part is).In contrast-> Arkham City felt alive, every detail there made the gameworld so much more vivid and much more interesting to explore, it gave the motivation to learn more about this place and its habitats/prisoners/criminals. Listening to prisoners talking to each other, badmouthing their bosses, witnessing prisoners bullying other prisoners, other random events, from the carefully placed billboards featuring known places to people who read the comics or seen the movies. Everything was placed with care and Rocksteady with respect to the Batman/DC lore. Getting to know the villains from their interesting and long side-missions, sympathize with them and pity them at the same time. [That brilliant writing from Rocksteady isn't here to no-ones surprise]-The Side-mission CharactersWhile great in the comics, here they are pushed aside for no reason, the missions are rushed and the payoff isn't at all great or fulfilling and you will end up wanting more of these characters, without recordings, no other interactions, all but one or two missions are very anti-climactic and feel half-arsed. The other new addition is the ""extensive"" (in quotations) detective mode, which would have made you feel more like Batman, while the concept seems promising it isn't executed well. The game will hold your hand throughout all of the investigation scenes, telling you exactly where the interaction points are, while looking cool and impressive your involvement in this as a player is minimal at best.-The Gameplay Its pretty much the same as City, but slightly changed so that is more forgiving with the addition of some charged fists weapon. The combat might seem the same to a lot of people but from my experience with it, it is more cheap that City, when a enemy swings his fist, sometimes it connects when it shouldn't and feels more clunky and unnatural,                          (Like the Batman vs Bane fight in the Dark Knight Rises, HEYO!)I came to that conclusion because having finished every Riddle combat challenge with every character in Arkham City, (which is a lot) I have a near perfect understanding of the combat system and can safely say that they ruined the combat formula by changing little things here and there.The last things that needs to be addressed are the -Boss Fightsand-Voice ActingBatman is not voiced by Mr. Conroy anymore and Joker not by Mark Hamill. Which turned many people off, it was little discouraging I'll be honest, the fact that THE definite voices for these two characters are getting replaced is off-putting. Batman's new voice is surprisingly very fitting and suits the character and timeline VERY well, the actor portrays him faithfully and is a welcome addition and worthy (If you may) to play the Batman role.On the other hand we have Troy Baker taking the role of the Joker. Honestly I was in shock when I heard his voice in the game, the laugh was SPOT ON and portrayed the character to a T. I'll go on a whim and say that he is ON PAR with Mark Hamill, In my humble and honest opinion no-one could have voice this Young Joker more *perfectly* that Baker. I was honestly scared when he made a threat (Like the Nolan Joker) always laughing even when beaten to a pulp.They can't replace them but where a welcome and great addition to the franchise.The thing that is bar none, no questions asked, no argument here: are the boss fights (most of them a least)The payoff is fulfilling and deserving to call itself an Arkham game based on how it handled the boss fights.For the most part they are diverse and unique. The most hyped battle in the game with Deathstroke, delivers ALL it promises: (Black-Bar Short Description about the fight )---Very Minor Spoilers--- Fluid combat, different stances/phases, gadget integration, PRECISE counter-presses, satisfying and INTENSE fight sequence. The fight will be most enjoyed with Hard mode ON, NO COUNTER-ICON indication.It is one of the best boss fights ever and the most difficult in the series yet.Losing 4-5 times before nailing Slade. The downside is that you will never see Slade again, only in some ending cut-sceneFINAL PART (PROS)1)Fantastic Voice Acting2)Great looking visuals/textures3)Great Boss FightsFINAL PART (CONS)1)Uninteresting Game World2)Mediocre Plot3)Bugs/Glitches (Gamebreaking ones, official patches/support ended)4)Unbalanced Gadgets5)Not fleshed out side-characters6)Multiplayer still unbalanced and may never be fixed7)Rehashed assets not put to good use.I wouldn't recommend this game despite its pros. They are way, way outnumbered, I would recommend buying Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, they are VASTLY superior to this title, its just not up to par. I could recommend it only to the hardcore die-hard fans of the Bat and the series and only after a huge price drop.---EDITOR NOTES---Thank you for reading my first game review, I want to do more of these so if you feel so inclined, PM me your thoughts, positive/negative, criticism is much appreciated :) +English is not my native language sorry for any syntax or grammatical error/mistakes.

												I don't usually bother writing reviews for games I've played, but I felt this game warranted one. As far as I can tell, there hasn't been any attempt to improve/innovate upon the previous Arkham games. Nearly evey single gadget/ability/upgrade has been copied and pasted from previous Arkham games into this one. Gotham City feels completely lifeless. I have yet to encounter anyone that isn't either a cop or a criminal. There a way too many buildings that can't be grappled onto which makes getting around a hassle at times. However, the new voice actors do an OK job as Batman and the Joker (not great but alright). And if you enjoyed the previous Arkham games most of what you liked about those games can be found in this game. All in all though, this will probably be the first Arkham game that I don't 100% and I would not reccommend buying it if you're on the fence about it even if you did enjoy the previous installments in the series.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE!!The reason i say that is not because the campaign is bad or the multiplayer is plain and boring, it's purely due to the sheer amount of bugs and glitches that currently exist in this game. If it wasn't for the bugs that liter this game, then this game would be a full fledged complete package that would be well worth your time and money. The single player is very good overall. the graphics are great, the pc port is managable, the game mechanics without a rebind of keys is reasonably good and can be used easily when put in comparison to a controller. the multiplayer admittedly being rather sparse in terms of it's game modes and amount of maps, is fun, enjoyable and can get very tense especially in the hunter, hunted game mode which plays like search and destroy in call of duty in the sense that you have one lifeand one only, die and thats it, very emersive indeed. But the bugs in this game seriously hamper the amount of enjoyment you will be able to extract out of this title. in addition to the bugs, the developers of this title have no current plans to fix and improve the game which is bad and near insulting to hardcore batman fans and fans of the previous arkham titles. therefore i cannot recommend buying this game to anyone unless you are willing to encounter and ignore the near game breaking bugs that currently exist in the game then by all means play and enjoy but for the rest of us, i suggest staying away from this game.

												After suffering through a horrible first impression, I waited for the devs to fix it. Unfortunatly they didn't. I have a mid range game rig so was not expecting the game to look good, so I set the game at my benchmark given to me by nVidia, annnnnd, 10 fps max. I set the settings lower and I got even LOWER fps. This was after the sopposed ""fix"". Note to everyone out there my specs fit the requirements. I waited 3 months and reinstalled the game and nothing was fixed. So I did some browsing and found a unofitial patch that took out something in the graphics but the game ran ""fine"". The game was not even that good. The combat was the same we've seen, not even any new moves/animations. Also the story was entertaining but had little logic and some of the villan side missions (like Anarchy's bombs) felt forced. Overrall if your computor can get passed the obviously false system requirements. Then you can suffer through a game that has nothing importent to show you. Overrall statement 5/10.			"

												After the critically accliamed Arkham City, this does not live up to its standard. WB Montreal really screwed this up. From bugs and DX11 glitches to random game crashes, this game has it all. A real shame as the storyline is still pretty good, but the lack of support from WB into patching the game is astoundingly blatant. This game could have been another favourite of mine but I felt suckered into buying this thinking it was going to surpass Arkham City. They also love to spam unskippable logos of the companies, thanks now we know who ♥♥♥♥ed this game up everytime I start the game up.My rating: 5/10 Would have been a 3 if not for a redeemable storyline if you have the patience to deal with the issues of this game.....Do not reccomend			"

												A good addition to the series, Origins shines mostly through its story and characters that it brings to the table, as well as the clever and fun boss fights that you encounter along the way. It perhaps isn't as good as Arkham Asylum and City, but it still holds up as a good Batman Arkham game.			"

												I'm a massive Batman fan. I know a lot of people claim that, but I challenge anyone to find a Batfan as big as me. I loved Asylum and City, and when I saw Origins was being delivered by a different studio, I swore never to play it.And then it went on sale.Figuring 'hey, what's ten bucks?', I bought it. I now have no idea what people are/were complaining about. Yes, there are some shortcomings when compared to the previous games, but that comes with any franchise. I mean, what if nobody played another Zelda game after Ocarina of Time? People talked crap about Windwaker, but it's one of my favourite games.Arkham Origins is a superb game. It's Batman all over. Does it hold up to its preceeding titles? Not 100%. But you can't let two near perfect games ruin a wonderful one. Is it worth $50? That's up to you. But if it goes on sale again, I thoroughly recommend picking it up. As long as you go in with an open mind you won't be disappointed.			"

												A compadre of mine recommended that I keep my expectations low when going into this gae, so I did. I expected little more than a bit of mindless, Batman flavoured fun, and for the most part that's what I got. There was a brilliant, and all too short flash of what it was like to BE the joker, but other than that, this game is basically more of the same. If I had one major criticism, it's that I think they threw away the chance to make a really good origins game on this piece of hasty cash cropping. 6/10			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the third installment in the Batman: Arkham series of video games; it serves as a prequel to both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and provides an insight into the early days of Batman's career. This is the first game in the series I have played extensively, despite owning the other two titles.This game follows Batman/Bruce Wayne on Christmas Eve in Gotham City; the villain Black Mask places a significant bounty on your head, meaning the best and brightest villains flock to Gotham on Christmas Eve to take down Batman. I thought this was a great way to provide diversity in the villains you'll encounter, each with their own characteristics and different fighting styles; Bane, Copperhead, the Joker, Deadshot, Mad Hatter, Deathstroke, Electrocutioner and the Penguin are all villains that Batman will encounter in one way or another. The voice acting and motion capture of these characters is absolutely brilliant, and it was very enjoyable to face off against them.This game is a sprawling open world brawler; Batman has a number of tools and gadgets to navigate the vast environments such as grappling hooks, glue grenades, smoke grenades and batarangs, all of which come in useful in a variety of ways. You can glide across the cityscape uninterrupted; this is one of the best features of the game, as the player is allowed to navigate the world as you choose without limitation.Gameplay in Arkham Origins consists of engaging in fist fights with goons, sneaking around areas, solving puzzles and gliding around Gotham. Like previous entries in the series, Arkham Origins uses the freeflow combat system; as Batman, you can fly around a punch up whilst delivering hits and countering attacks. Different enemies require different fighting styles and techniques, and the enemy diversity as well as the range of tools means the fights are always entertaining and challenging. The stealth sections are equally entertaining, as you can use your tools and the environment to eliminate enemies undetected. You'll also come across challenging puzzles within the game, such as bypassing traps and blocked areas as well as solving puzzles left by Enigma.Video and sound design in this game is also very good. Excellent attention to detail in combination with a highly appealing graphics engine, this game looks absolutely stunning on high settings. Voice acting and sound design is also fantastic, and feels like a highly authentic Batman experience.This game was very enjoyable due to its highly polished gameplay and compelling story. Without spoilers, the scenes concerning the Joker and his early meetings with Batman provide a unique take on the story that I found extremely interesting and riveting for the game. If you enjoy action packed brawlers in an open world setting, I highly recommend this game. Loads of replay value and excellent value for money, Batman: Arkham Origins is an epic game for fans of Batman and action games in general. 9 / 10			"

												A functional but uninspired addition to the Arkham series, and arguably my biggest disappointment of 2013.Takes the great framework left by Arkham City, but doesn't really do anything to improve upon it (with the exception of the new crime scene missions), and new combat tools such as the shock-gloves remove a lot of the challenge that came from planning your approach to each fight.Coupled with a completely throw-away multiplayer componant, its a somewhat enjoyable, but totally unnecessary entry in the series.Bottom line: Asylum and City are two of the greatest games of this past generation. Origins isn't.			"

												First of all, this game appears to have built entirely from recycled Arkham City maps... and before I get on to the rest of my complaints, I'll point out that this, more than anything, contributes to feeling that Arkham Origins is just an extremely half-baked expansion pack for it's vastly superior predecessor.The narrative, if you can call it that, is held together by a single fraying thread... and you feel like you stumble from one uninspired set piece to another with nothing logically or emotionally tying any of it together. That alone wouldn't be too horrible (this is an action-based videogame, after all) except...Ye gods, what did they do to the combat!? The loosy-goosy combat has gotten so simple that you barely need to participate to make progress, that is, until you reach one the game's absurdly annoying QTE-laced boss fights. We're not talking the occassional QTE either, but full-blown, unavoidable, QTE-centric battles.Look, this game isn't fun. Or good. There are better games out there and this contributes nothing to the Arkham franchise. It's not just not worth your money, it's not worth your time. Spend both on something more rewarding.			"

												I would really like to say that I enjoyed this game.  I want to say that I enjoyed the combat system, the exploration, the visuals, maybe even the story line.  I want to say that I <was> looking forward to DLC.  I did purchase a season pass after all.But now, I am going through major buyer's remorse after the unethical business practice, that is literally refusing to fix the game any further, and instead focus on the story DLC coming out.Well, unless I can get a refund, I am in it for the long run, so I may as well find out.  And if you haven't bought the DLC already, DON'T.  If you haven't bought the game yet, DON'T!  Just read this article: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/batman-arkham-origins-has-no-plans-to-fix-several-game-breaking-bugs/1100-6417619/And I want you to tell me if you'd still want to buy the game otherwise.I loved this game.

While the story is not totally on Asylum levels, it's still much, much better than  City. The twist at the half point of the game might be a little disappointing, but the back part of the game gets really good anyway.			"

												Main game: fun, but too many ideas borrowed from Arkham City.  The final boss fight is literally a rehash of the ingenius Mr. Freeze fight from B:AC.  The story is decent & Troy Baker's performance as the Joker is excellent.  Bane is closer to Nolan's version of an intelligent villain rather than the cartoon versions of a stupid brute, so that's good.  I loved Arkham City & while I'd say this game was fun, I understand that they had no original ideas and used Arkham City to tell another Batman story.Final verdict: 7.5/10DLC: How long was it Angry Joe?  3.5-4 hours, including getting all of the achievements.  The story was okay.  Where as the main story had an original take on the Joker and other's origin stories, this was Mr. Freeze's origin story and was pretty much an exact retelling without much deviation from other versions.  At least it felt somewhat different with the new ice moves and stuff, but that's not really enough to recommend at anything over $2.  Oh, and the other DLC in the season pass was some garbage challenge maps and different suits for Batman which you can only use once you've beaten the main game and go for new game plus or plus plus (aka: I Am The Night mode).Final verdict there: 6/10 and don't get the season pass			"

												It's like they took everything bad about Arkham City and made an even larger game about all the bad parts.  Everyone and their sister has guns now so you can't just get into fights without getting wtfpwnd, and the game is terribly unclear about what your objective is.  It's just, ""lol u need to do this, but idk how loloololololl"" and last game you at least had the detective vision but now they added these jammers that ♥♥♥♥ that up so you can't see how you're supposed to progress, which I guess appeals to people who enjoy dark souls.  Then there's that they made the city 3 times larger, then cut your flight speed in half, and you can't go faster by swooping down, oh no, cuz you see the human body travels just as fast going at a 5 degree angle as it does at a 90 degree angle.  Just ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, the boss battles have been reduced to nothing more then press RMB and LMB to win.All in all 1/10.			"

This game is terribly underrated.For the past few months I've been struggling with whether or not to get the game and play it, since all I've heard was harsh criticism. I got through the game and I can't understand WHY this game got 74/100 on steam. It has everything we could have asked for! Story is remarkable and I don't see absolutely anything wrong with it. In fact, I would say some parts are even better and more mind blowing than in Arkham City. This is so far the darkest and most interesting Batmans IMO, since it tells us so many stories that shine the light on things some players were wondering about (those who didn't read the comics, of course). Glitches? Bugs? They happen! Throughout the game I had some here and there, but they didn't even frustrate me to the point where I would even bring it up if others didn't. I absolutely love this game.The only bad side is the graphics. It looks downgraded compare to Arkham City. My personal rating for this game is 9.5/10 "

												This review can be wrapped up in a single sentence. Not as bad as many people will say, but not good enough to carry the Arkham series name. This game is utterly passable. The controls, looks and overall execution are just fine (as they should be, since it's primarily just borrowed from the previous titles), but the scale of the game falls significantly short of Arkham City. I don't think purists will be the only people irritated by the anacronystic, and fairly schizophrenic, way that this origins Batman has advanced, and regressed, from his Arkham predecessors... wait... successors... well, you see my point. Anyway, overall, not actually a bad game, but when compared to the excellent games from which it was spawned, you must wonder if it's existance was necessary as it seems to do nothing to advance the franchise. That said, if cheap enough, and you just want more Arkham, pick up this game... just set those expectations down a level or two, and you won't be disappointed.			"

Making a prequel to the events in Asylum and City and mastering it is not an easy feat. It was laid out perfectly and I loved the way they portrayed each faction and the way they reacted. Perfect 10 out of 10.Multiplayer was actually a lot of fun and definitely a great added addition to an amazing series. (After you got over the random crashes that randomly occured). I hope to see them fine tone it, if they decide to do it again. When I completed the achievements only one mode was unlocked,, however I know now they added another mode, but it would be nice to see that happen during the initial release.Most DLC is mainly silly skins and a couple challenges(not needed for achievements), but the one DLC that is actually worth something was the Cold Cold Heart DLC.~ It adds as much as the Harley Quinn DLC in Arkham City did, and it was very well done. The story was spectacular and I enjoyed the way they developed it and how it connects all the puzzle pieces. Also the new batsuit was badass and needs to make a reappearance.			"

												Ah Batman Arkham Origins the game I waited for sense febuary when they gave clues for it. The game that I played right after preloading it. The game I completed 100% in less than a month after the games release. I am going to say I was in love yet also dissapointed with this game. First of all the game is very alike to arkham city with I am completely fine with. But the changes I found in the free-flow combat and predator missions were bad. With predator moving to gargoyle to gargoyle is not as smooth as the previous games and silent takedowns sort of glich out with their knockout smash's. In free-flow, the game has lost it's rythm with going from enemy to enemy. With that a side let's talk about the story. While not written by Paul Dini (the writer of asylum and city) instead it is written by Corey May and Dooma Wendschuh, which is fine because the story is great, but leads to a lot of screwed up continuity with Dini's work. Now let's talk about something new: the multiplayer. The multiplayer is created by splash damage not WB games Montreal. I found it very enjoyable to play with batman in predator maps with real players. There are two modes from the time of making this review: Invisible Predator Online and Hunter, Hunted. These are both extremely enjoyable and kept me playing. So the final verdict of this review though it is very alike to Arkham City it is still a fun Arkham game and with the addition of multiplayer I recommend this game but, with the bugs, glitches and other problems it detracts for the experience noticeably. So if you like batman and that is what you want more of, buy Arkham Origins. 8.6/10			"

If it was a straight beat em' up game I'd be happy but even then there are huge gaps between the action while you swing around the map like spiderman. What ever happened to the Batmobile?

First of all the game is very alike to arkham city with I am completely fine with. But the changes I found in the free-flow combat and predator missions were bad. With predator moving to gargoyle to gargoyle is not as smooth as the previous games and silent takedowns sort of glich out with their knockout smash's. In free-flow, the game has lost it's rythm with going from enemy to enemy. With that a side let's talk about the story. While not written by Paul Dini (the writer of asylum and city) instead it is written by Corey May and Dooma Wendschuh, which is fine because the story is great, but leads to a lot of screwed up continuity with Dini's work. Now let's talk about something new: the multiplayer. The multiplayer is created by splash damage not WB games Montreal. I found it very enjoyable to play with batman in predator maps with real players. There are two modes from the time of making this review: Invisible Predator Online and Hunter, Hunted. These are both extremely enjoyable and kept me playing. So the final verdict of this review though it is very alike to Arkham City it is still a fun Arkham game and with the addition of multiplayer I recommend this game but, with the bugs, glitches and other problems it detracts for the experience noticeably. So if you like batman and that is what you want more of, buy Arkham Origins. 8.6/10			"

												Considering that this game is very similar to Arkham City in this review i'll simply point out the differences between the two. If you didn't played Arkham City (or Asylum) I strongly advise to play those before this one. The Good General (slight) graphical improvementsThe new snow effect is very nice and add to the atmosphereAtmospheric boss fights, different from each other (Deathstroke and Copperhead being my favourite, but be advised most of them make a heavy use of QTE)The area of the city you can navigate is doubled in extensionBatman got an armor The Bad The gamebreaking bugs have been fixed, but you may still encounter some occasional glitch. The story is decent, good at the start, while it suffers from being extremely predictable later on, it's anyway worse than AC one. The city environment is lacking character and atmosphere if compared with ACPoor level design, moving through the city with the grappling hook is not as enjoyable as in AC. The Wasted Multiplayer mode that is actually quite fun, but it was not supported by the dev, you WILL experience crashes and the infamous ""lost connection to steam"" bug that will prevent you from playing most of the times.Massive improvements on the Ivestigation Mode where you can re-enact what happened on the scene based on the evidence you collect, but it's all wasted due to the red arrow that point you to the evidence you need, taking away any kind of ""detective feeling"" or sense of accomplishment, incredible wasted opportunity.This game is in my opinion still inferior to Arkham City but if you enjoyed AC and want more of the same this game is worth your time and money.

												Игра потрясающая, очень радует визуально новый подход к раскрытию преступлений, а именно реконструировать их и проматывать как видео-запись. Системные требования игры, по моему мнению, ниже чем у Arkham City, так что те кто боится что их долгожданная Arkham Origins не пойдёт также хорошо как предыдущая часть, так как на дворе конец 2013-начало 2014, не беспокойтесь и смело берите игру. Отличный сюжет и неожиданные повороты, так что фанаты останутся довольны.			"

Don't fix what isn't broken, one of the few cliches that still work.I bet if people didn't know this wasn't Rocksteady studios they wouldn't even know the difference. It's like asking people to tell the difference between drinking bottled water and municipal water and then asking which one tastes better.I'll rate this game high, I don't care. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Origins. If Arkham City were the third installment and this were the first one, then people would be making same complaints. I'll settle for the Uncharted 3 argument/syndrome but there is little to no reason to downgrade this game because it more or less features same core gameplay. And WHAT IS that ""same""? Refined fighting system, satisfying action, old and new upgrades (that you have to actually work for this time around by completing challenges), expanded itnel/database, enigma's games, superb voice acting, crime investigations, top notch cinematics, joker's side of the story (a clock work orange), a plethora of new and old characters each of whom require a different takedown approach, the perma-death mode, among many other things, the horror!There's little to no innovation? Well, for starters you can't innovate much when it comes to something that happened in the past. But there are small changes there and there. You can now slide into the grates and open them. You can daze your foes with smoke and they will swing their arms at each other and punch it each by accident. Many fights are no cakewalk. Many enemies become armed towards the middle of the game, the ninjas, the martial arts experts and Bane's brawlers can make fights quite tough. The environments are also more varied. There is still no blood splatter anywhere, however. Many fights requires preparation in advance - disable guns, check; disable gun crates check; mark the ones you want to bump together, check; throw the smoke pellet in the middle of the crowd, check; swoop in and start kicking♥♥♥♥♥The game is considerably longer than the other two. It took me 30 straight hours to beat it and I have only completed around 60% of the game. The game literally goes on and on.The game is much more Tim Burton-y this time around. There are more highrise buildings so there is greater satisfaction of gliding and plunging down. The city is filled with gangs and crimes that you can prevent. The streets are wide so there is more maneuverability. There is more approach to targets. The old Arkham City area is filled with somewhat disturbing Christmas decorations. The art design is off the charts. I also like the fact that you are kind of on your own in a sense that cops and criminals don't really know what to make of you. The graphics are also somewhat expanded, noticably the lens flare, the smoke that adjusts to your movement and changes its shape (nonexistent on the consoles), and physx (ah, those snowflakes dancing around when you fight 10 people at the same time - the consolites are missing out), AND LET'S NOT FORGET THERE IS NO GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE.Each boss fights requires a level of investigation, psychological build up and later on skill and patience - something that Arkham City wasn't too famous for later in the game (which was one of GS's gripes by the way). The ultimate bane fight was as close to the Mr. Freeze fight as it got. The uneasy alliance with Gordon was also played out pretty well.I can only wish this was the first installment. Arkham City was pretty much a perfect game but it doesn't preclude Origins from being a great game.P.S. Don't skip the credits scene. "

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a great, very fun, immersive, and visually stunning game! Most people prefer Asylum and City, since they were developed by Rocksteady instead of WB Montreal; while I don't necessarily prefer Origins, it didn't disappoint me either. One thing that is MUCH better about it is the visual detail and overall smoothness of gameplay. With my system (specs at the bottom) and new drivers, I play Origins in 3D Vision, rendered at 4K (using DSR), with EVERY setting maxed, except for AA being on TXAA low plenty smoothly enough for me to play very enjoyably and literally be blown away by the Nvidia Physx and rich visual detail all around! The footprints and thug impressions in the snow, the the sense I should be feeling the snowflakes hitting my face, the fun of demolishing the thugs, the joy of exploring the richly-detailed city as the Batman, along with many more great points make it great! This game has the same style and feel of the earlier games, which is AWESOME, and offers players a MUCH larger map to roam around as they wish! Great game, worth the money, and worth many hours of immersive gameplay!Can't wait for Arkham Knight (back to Rocksteady)!System Specs:Case: NZXT Phantom 001BKCPU: Intel i7 3970XMOBO: ASUS Rampage IV Extreme x79RAM: 32GB 1600 DDR3 4x8GB (Quad channel)GPU: EVGA GTX 780 Classified w/ ACX coolerSound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Recon 3D ChampionRaid 1 for OS: 2 10,000 RPM 300GB VelociRaptors1TB 7200RPM data driveMonitor: Asus VG248QE 144Hz refresh, 1ms response, 80M:1 Contrast Ratio, 3D Vision supportSurround Sound: Logitech THX-certified Z-5300e			"

												Even if not such a huge leap and not many changes from City to Origins like the changes from Asylum to City, it still was a great game. The studio tried to make it as good as city, copying but in a good way elements from City, it has a good story, great characters and misions, the city is nice, even if a big portion of it it's from City. I liked playing as Catwoman in City and here you only play as Batman in singleplayer, but it was a great campaign. The combat is as usual amazing, the best combat in any video game ever in my oppinon, and the Arkham series are my all time favorite games! :)The multiplayer is pretty good as well, even if not many people play it, it's great playing as Batman/ Robin there and as Joker or Bane if you can take control of them! Still, I would have liked to be able to queue for a match as Batman/ Thug, but then everyone would go for Bats right?:DAwesome game, even if not as epic as City and Asylum, I really recomment it! :) 9/10			"

												This games gives a glimpse of how Batman became Batman.Most of the reviews donot support this game as it was not developed by Rocksteady. The game is really good not the best in the series but still playable and interesting, The predecessors of this game had set the bar high and hence it was tough to compete with them but on an overall scale the game is nice.The gameplay is more or less the same as that of Arkham City and not a lot of changes have been made in this aspect.The story is well written with points in the game which will make you really happy while at other times the story will leave you not quite interested.This is a christmas day special so if you plan to enjoy the next christmas with a similar theamed game, you can give this game a try.Overall the game is OK types can be skipped and you'll never miss it once.

												This is one of the worst games i have ever played.I got it for free with my NVidia GPU and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.The gameplay is boring, the opponents are weak (even on the hardest difficulty) and the surroundings are lifeless, dull and repetetive. You can win almost any (non-boss-)fight by clicking the right mouse button. And if it gets too hard just use the batclaw and jump to a random ledge nearby.The only thing I enjoyed in this game is throwing batarangs on insanely stupid opponents. You can basically sit on a ledge right above them and throw stuff at their faces and they don't even notice. This has to be one of the worst AIs I have ever encountered. Also they don't take damage and can't fall of their platforms. There are invisible walls. In a game from 2013. That normally costs 50€. Wow.I have no idea how there are that many positive reviews for this piece of crappy software. Please enlighten me if you can.			"

												I will commend this game on the premise and story. While not a particularly original plot, it is told well and at a good pace. This Batman is younger and more angry, and it was interesting seeing people react to him as a new figure in the city of Gotham. These things alone made the game worth playing. Even the item collecting seemed a bit more grounded, which made that more entertaining as well.However, one is left with the sense that the game simply did not get enough playtesting, or not enough time to react to the results of playtesting. There are minor glitches here and there, but the most glaring oversight is in the combat.Batman is no longer able to consistently interrupt his own attack animations. This most commonly manifests itself when trying to counter an attack that begins after you've already started attacking someone else. You'll find yourself getting hit a lot more. More difficulty is fine, but not allowing the player to respond to threats as they happen generally makes the combat feel unfair. This seemingly small change makes much of the gameplay less satisfying than in previous iterations, but is rendered moot about 2/3 into the game when you get a new upgrade that makes the combat fairly easy.Batman Arkham Origins is not a bad game, but given its predecessors and its potential, it is a disappointing one.

												For a Batman: Arkham [something] game, this game was incredibly weak and full of bugs. It wasn't terrible, but they managed to make the most important part of the game frustrating and inconsistant: the combat. In the previous Arkham games, combat flow was silky smooth, and guiding the Batman around the fight was intuitive and consistent. In this game, that all goes away. It is incredibly hard to maintain freeflow, often at no fault of the player (Batman seems to randomly miss blocks and strikes, no matter how you are aiming the camera, and sometimes it is impossible to target the opponent you want, with it seeming like Batman is attacking everyone except the baddy you want him to take out). If these issues were consistent and predictable, it wouldn't be a big deal, but as they aren't, fighting goes from fun to frustrating in a hurry. Going back and playing Arkham City after playing this game was like a breath of fresh air. This game could have been a worthy addition to the Arkham games, but when it breaks the very thing that makes the Arkham games so much fun, I just can't give it a positive recommendation.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the prequel to the Arkham series, but will you want to play it ?Batman: Arkham Origins take place in the first year of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman. On Christmas Eve Black Mask hires 8 assassins to hunt down and kill Batman for 50 million dollars. So it's up to you to capture every assassin and save Gotham.Gameplay is almost identical to Arkham City. It adds new elements like shock gloves that speed up combat, but do less damage. Overall the combat is identical to Arkham City and if you played that you know what to expect.Graphics are also identical to Arkham City, but unlike AC they add snow and snowing effects and add Christmas decorations to make you feel like Christmas is just around the corner. Graphics are amazing to say the least even though they are just a re-skin.The soundtrack is awesome. When you fight some of the bosses and the music kicks in is just awesome and makes the fights even better.The game is a bit harder than the other titles. Stealth play's a bigger role in this game and the armed enemies do more damage. But the game is still really easy.Level design is mostly taken out of Arkham City, but there are new locations. Overall it's really well made but there is one location that has horrible design is the Gotham Police station. I got lost and confused multiple times. I would have liked for them for not make it that confusing.Game is pretty long. It took me 17 hours to finish the main story and complete all side quests. 2 hours more to play the Cold, Cold Heart DLC. Not to mention there's also a lot you can do after you finish the game and also there are challenge maps. The game is incredibly buggy. During a boss fight, the boss got stuck in a wall. I needed to restart for it work again. Sometimes, I couldn't interrogate people after I beat them up. The game doesn't have any game breaking bugs and restarting from a checkpoint fixes the problem. The multiplayer mode is kind of fun but now it's full of hackers and it's kind of hard to get into a game. My suggestion is to skip all MP dlc.Batman: Arkham Origins isn't as good as the previous titles. The game is buggy and it get's boring really fast, but it's still really fun. The boss battles are interesting and are fun as hell. The story is really interesting too. Overall if you are a fan of Arkham games this is a must own. But my suggestion is to get the game on sale only. I give Batman: Arkham Origins a 7/10			"

												Despite the fact that a big part of the Batman community reacted to Arkham Origins with unacceptance, my point is that this is one of the coolest and breathtaking about-Batman-game we have ever played. The atmosphere of Christmas Eve is extremely awesome. Arkham Origins gives us the opportunity to plunge into an intriguing detective story and take part in the high-grade savage beat 'em up. Famous DC-villains are already waiting for us: Killer Croc, Black Mask, Bane, Firefly, Deathstroke, etc. Oh, wait, Deathstroke. He is a hot potato, a real brutal mack daddy. You'll have to work hard to overcome him. I'm pretty sure that Arkham Origins deserves attention no less than the previous games of the series.			"

												Graphics over gameplay, it's always a bad decision. The MOST important gameplay aspect in an Arkham game is the fighting mechanic. That's what wrong here...I won't go into detail, although I could, you can watch some random video and YOU WILL see, how broken it is. Especially after playing WB's ""Shadow of Mordor"", which feels superb, this is a frustrating mess. For the first time in an Arkham entry I actually felt, like Bruce is indeed a crazy person, wearing a Bat-costume without any sense of empowerment.So, yeah I suggest to skip this one, I could not finish it due to the above mentioned problem. Isn't it ironic? A NON-Rocksteady game has some amazing graphics and a solid performance, but not the awesome gameplay, while Arkham Knight is the other way around? What a crazy world we play in...

												A valiant effort by WB Montreal, but ultimately too many things wrong with it for me to recommend. Rocksteady perfected the combat with Arkham City, but for some reason WB Montreal decided it would be a good idea to tweak things that would create a ""no step forward, two steps back"" sort of situation. At least on the PC, interrupting attacks to counter foes has been removed. Batman's attack animations are needlessly lengthy and sluggish, creating a situation where trying to attack an attacker head-on will result in Batman being beaten to the punch, 10 times out of 10. There are two problems with this: your default attack button now becomes Counter, and Batman is reduced to lower in skill than a common street thug. The changes to the combat compared to Arkham City remove the power fantasy of being Batman. The game was incredibly buggy on release, as well. There are nitpicks, too, like the leveling design being completely linear, or the electric gauntlets basically invalidating any strategy the original two games required for dealing with special foes, but those are minor things. The real issues are in the combat, and when that's most of what this game is, you've got a problem.Play Arkham City instead, or wait for Rocksteady's next installment. I can't recommend this one.

												Compared to the previous 2, this game is a buggy mess. The story isn't bad but there are things like events not triggering or enemies getting clipped into walls. Sometimes the AI gets stuck on objects, other times it doesn't read your input correctly. They just did a bad job overall.And there's no benefit to doing certain sidequests like the Riddler one. You don't even get to catch him this time around like in the other 2 games after completing all of the challenges, lots of them being highly unintuitive (you'll be looking them up online). He's just...not there, like they ran out of time to complete his story even though they force you to take over his towers to fast travel between districts. The game just feels like they ran out of ideas and decided to make you do fetch quests, beat up mobs, and backtrack excessively to make up for the lack of content.TLDR: Decent story, bad execution, not worth doing sidequests, achievements, or DLC (which is a standalone mode). You'll probably buy/play it anyway. Season Pass not worth it. Also, fast travel shows unskippable cutscenes.			"

												There are a couple great moments, but Origins is a big step back for one of my favorite game series.  The story is a joke, the environment seems dead, and the fantastic Freeflow combat system is somehow worse at targeting than the first game. I bought the game a fair time after release and still ran into more bugs than Asylum and City combined.  After playing I learned that development of the series changed hands, and it really shows.

No Wonder this is Almost Non-Canon.Batman: Arkham Origins is a spin-off made by Warner Brothers, NOT the same devepers as the original trilogy of the Arkham games (those are made by Rocksteady) and it shows. It really does.STORY As the title suggest, this game takes place before any event of the Arkham games, precisely 2 years from the beginning of the Batman, for many just a misterious figure, with no knowledge if friend or foe. Obviously, the currupted police of Gotham sees it as an enemy, so it does his best to take him down.Anyhow, this Christmas Eeve Black Mask claims a bounty on your head of 50,000$ to anyone who manages to kill the Bat, on which 8 super hitmans, from Deathstroke to Bane, decided to give a shot to take the money and the glory. It's up to you to stop them and bring peace to Gotham.But something does not add up, since Black Mask might not actually be himself, but a new misterious figure, which- ok its the Joker, its on every advertisment, and it's an unwritten rule that you cannot have a Batman game without the Joker. If the premise sounds pretty weak, is it because it actually is. The other Arkham games always made sense, since Batman always found himself stuck in an Astylum or the city itself by a threath greater them him, but in this game the only reason he's tied to his city is because ""he must do what is right"", even tho is never really established that the citizen are in danger, except for the last moments where they throw in the classic underground bombs.The only really good part about the story is the  Joker's origins: it follows very closely the source, and its very well exposed. Personally, I would have prefared if the plot stick more to this, instead of showing me a  Joker who acts like a 12 years old on too much sugar.GAMEPLAYLiterally the same as Arkham City, but somehow worst. The grappling hook feels very unresponsive most of the time, and quite often during combat some moves didn't do as I wanted.But in the moments where I couldn't realize what was happening, the game was either trying to hold my hand way too much, or just flushing himself down the toilet with his billion bugs and glitches.when I say that this game is incredibly unpolished, trust me, it really is, and I'm not talking about performance issues. I never really had framerate drops or crashes, it worked fine for that, but in my playtime I had:-Enemies stuck in walls that stopped my progress-Enemies coming back from being unconcious staring at me doing nothing-Enemies flying away after a takedown-Ragdolls going crazy-Batman getting stuck in places-The takedown ability randomly stopped workingThis was quite frustrating, since it made me die, or worst, forced me to boot up the game from the start, killing the whole atmosphere.COLLECTABLESThis might feel like a pointless rant for lots of people, but hear me out: this game has the worst riddler collectables possible. I played every single Arkham game 100%, doing everything possible in each game. Arkham Asylum rewarded me with some really cool insight, and recordings that are incredibly well acted. Arkham City gave me a story line, and the possibility to punch the Riddler in his stupid mouth. Arkham Knight literally gave me an intense boss fight with the Riddler, and with the whole completion, a secret ending.So what does this gave gives you for discovering and completing everything? Absolutely nothing. Sure, you get some recordings in here aswell, but they're not as fun as Asylum, and they didn't even bother to give you and enounter face to face with the Riddler, or even him aknowledging the fact that you ruined his plans. There was no reward whatsoever, which really felt underwelming, and kinda made me feel ripped off. I do not suggest to even bother trying to collect everything from this game, if you care about completion like me.GRAPHIC AND MUSICIt's the same engine as City but more detailed, not much to say. It looks great, even tho the cape often glitched around instead of being amazing like the previous games, but not much of a complain.I actually noticed the textures had some troubles loading sometimes, but after a second of pop up, it would work pretty smoothly.The music was clearly not composed by the same author of the Arkham Trilogy. Don't get me wrong, is still ""all right"", is just not as effective. I liked the ""Nutcracker"" snuck here and there, since the game takes place in a Christmas setting. Other then that, not a whole lot that was incredibly stunning.FINAL RATING: 5/10This was pretty much a cash-in on the name of the Arkham games. They tried to replicate the exact glory that Arkham City earned by copying what they did right and not even trying to spice things up. It's just a lazy attempt to breath some fresh air on something that is perfectly fine the way it is. Warner Brothers, if you really want to launch yourself in those superheroes games, just bright us a new title with a new superhero, maybe a game about Flash, or if you don't want to leave your Bat-comfort zone, give us a proper Suicide Squad title.Just try for god sake.

												If you see people saying Origins is horribad, rest assured, they're wrong.First thing first, Origins is almost copy paste of Arkham City, the 2nd installment of Arkham series. It definitely brings many good things Arkham City (and Asylum) had. Similar gadgets, similar combat styles, familiar characters (well, of course, it's Batman after all), and it's always nice to know Batman before he became established super hero. If you've played the previous two, you wouldn't feel any awkwardness playing the game.Navigating in an open city couldn't be easier. Batman can jump from building to building, grapple with ease - much ease than on AC from my fingers' memory - and now can use 'teleport' aka fast travel with Batwing to reach other corners faster. ...well uh, after completing Tower missions against Enigma, of course.There are also many other hidden objects and sidequests you can do like in Arkham City. Enigma Datapack, destroying poison barrels etc. The template pretty much the same like previous installmentPersonal preference: I've played all three Batman installments on Steam, and I feel the smoothest combat is from this Origins.Performance wise, so far I am having zero problem with Batman Origins set up on all low settings. On Batman Arkham City, though, I've had considerable slowdown, not because of my weak graphic card, but because it was bugged game engine - thanks to PhysX.For the contents on Steam aka DLC, there's zero reason to get multiplayer DLCs. This game's intended to be played as SINGLE player. Why on earth would they be pushing MP contents into Batman I don't know. Just buy the SP DLCs and you're good to go, or wait until GOTY pops up. By that time, then, I think Arkham Knight will have been in existence. Game's on sale for 75% off quite often, so I would recommend to pick it up at that price.And don't forget, this game's best played with controller. I have no issue with both Dinput (using x360ce) and Xinput gamepads.So yeah, Arkham Origins is the game you either hate or love. It's a copy paste from previous game, and adds almost nothing except better combat and or navigation in city, perhaps. Well what can I say, don't fix what ain't broken? Isn't that the golden rule?At any rate, this game is a must have if you're Batman fans.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is a mixed game with some notable highs and lows. I dig the story, the younger and rougher Bat, its enemies and the few new gadgets like the remote claw. But whereas Arkham City was an improvement  over its predecessor, this new Batman game lacks the thrills of the early games and is rough around its edges. Which is a shame. The current state of the game is also buggy to say the least. Just check the forums to see for yourself. Experienced multiple problems when playing which hurts the gameplay. I only recommend it if you are a die hard fan.			"

												This feels like a game made by people with all the right tools at their disposal, but possessing insufficient ability or care to get enough out of them.The tone is set from the very beginning, with juddery intro videos, and the glitches persist from there. The game is riddled with little glitches, like unconscious enemies remaining standing, or hitting an invisible floor when cut down from gargoyles so that they float in mid-air. It also suffers from sharp framerate drops even on a 1080.Aside from consisting of a B-list of villains, the boss fights are often badly designed. The first in particular sets a poor tone by being badly unbalanced and frustrating, while later ones are ruined by the grossly overpowered shock glove weapon which renders them ridiculously simple. The detective scenes offer a glimmer of hope as an interesting new concept, but the game tells you, audibly and visually, exactly what you have to to every step of the way. There is no skill or thought required. They are glorified QTEs. Indeed, much of the game feels this way - it is constantly telling you exactly what you have to do.It has its good moments - a few strong cutscenes, some decent voice acting, generally decent graphics - but is not in the league of its two predecessors.

												If there will be another Batman game in the future i hope it won't be for another couple years as this felt like a rehash of everything. Like they took Arkham City's world, Asylum's animations and tacked on a crappy multiplayer and made the game buggy as hell.The 'origins' storyline felt like a reason to add in the ever-popular Joker and many of the other assassins hardly added anything to the game other than a checklist to complete. The villain roster was decent but none really stood out like in Asylum or City.Roger Craig Smith as Batman was ok. Too many of his lines were dry and his tone felt forced. Troy Baker's Joker is almost spot on and listening to his dialogue was one of the few immersive moments I've experienced in this title.If you want the best Batman experience, play Asylum. It may not be as open-worldy, but the gameplay is tight and focused. I'm glad I only spent $15 on Origins.6.8/10			"

												A perfect example of milking a franchise based on previous installment's success! This game is no where near the level of Batman Arkham Asylum and City. Both are amazing games and should be played to fully enjoy the series. This one however feels like a DLC.The good part about this 'dlc' is that it goes back to show the story before the events of Arkahm Asylum. Aside from that and few new gadgets, the entire game looks and feels like a copy-paste of previous installments. This one even comes with occasional glitches that I've never encoutered in the other twos. If you've played the first two games, play it as a ""steam sale, gotta have it"" style game. It will expand the story a bit.On the positive sides however, the game does introduce some amazing mechanics, most notably the detective-simulation type system to investigate a crime scene. Hopefully in the next TRUE Batman game, it will be implemented with better, improved, and complex elements. I recommend this as a good buy, but it is not to be compared to the first two games.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins review. It's no Arkham Asylum or Arkham City.Set just two years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, the game has our caped crusader still as yet unknown, a myth amongst criminals and a wanted man by Gotham City PD. Bruce is on his own, and Origins explores how Batman becomes protector of Gotham.Let's start off with the bad. There are a HUGE amount of horrific bugs and control issues that really hamper the game, including a few game breaking ones. Combat flows awkwardly and haphazardly, with serious AI issues abounding all throughout. Often the gadgets can stop working, and many times it's not always clear where to go next. However, YMMV in these areas, so take that with a grain of salt.That being said, there are flashes of pure unadulterated brilliance in Origins. The story is AMAZING, and I would put it superior to both Asylum and City, even if they played it a bit safe with the ending. Fights with Deathstroke, Deadshot (♥♥♥♥ that fight) and even Firefly are great to see and pulled off nicely. Deathstroke's fight is absolutely brilliant, requiring strategy and constant awareness to do flawlessly.The game looks very nice, even on my middle-range system. I can only imagine what a beastly rig would make this game look like. Environments however are a little bland. Would have liked to see more greenery, but the setting of the game at Christmas does explain away that omission.Overall, while not as tight mechanically as Asylum, or City, Origins is worth your time. A great imagining of a Batman not yet a recognisable hero, but still a threat to the criminals of Gotham.Rating: 3.5/5Warner Brothers has no intention of patching bugs that don't break the game, so be aware that some issues can and most likely will arise while playing.

The challenges were poorly designed in some ways; some of the challenges become impossible to complete at a certain point through the story and the player doesn't necessarily even know about the challenge system until it is too late because it is never really advertised.  They should have made it so challenges can be completed in the training system in the bat cave like previous iterations.  Other than that one dissapointment, I'm happy with the game.			"

It is a well-crafted game, very fun and a treat for Batman fans such as myself. Even the fact that Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hammil (Joker) don't do the voice acting in this game, the actors they got were just as good as the originals. Be forewarned, however, there are a few bugs still, but they do not take away from the overall enjoyment factor.I recommend this game whole-heartedly as I am on my third play through and I'm enjoying it as much as the first.

												For the eight hours of seamless gameplay I was able to enjoy, this game was surpassing my best expectations. A really well paced game, worthy of being a game of the year. If it were not for a game breaking bug on the Royal Hotel level. When I reach the 40th floor, about four or five paced in, the game crashes. Over and over again. I redownloaded the game - and still the same issue. I´m really sick of the cr***y  console ports that devs hastily make for PC. I sent each co-developer a bug report two days ago, and all i´ve received is silence. If the bugs didnt exist, I would recommend this game. A real disappointment in my opinion.			"

												Yeah it's fine, assuming you liked Arkham City, which of course you did because it was brilliant. This is pretty much exactly the same. Same(ish) plot, same(ish) boss fights, absolutely the same setting. It's a bit cheeky to ask thirty quid for it then, it might have done well as an expansion pack. So, if you don't own Arkham City, get that instead. If you do own Arkham City, play it again instead. At least until teh price drops. Origins will be worth £20 but you'd be annoyed if you paid full price.			"

												I got this game at a cazy deal and yet I still find this game to be such a let down. I was and am a HUGE Batman Arkham Series fan. I really loved the dark atmosphere and challenge (on hard) of the first game and the high replayability of the second game. With that said, this game in no way pushes the series forward. The raved about boss fights are lazy. This game completely exhausted the combat system (believe or not) and then compounds that with repetitious uninspired stun/beatdown boss fights. The story was also weak and spent way too long to show itself different or new. I found myself (a Batman fan!) getting more and more cynical as I played. I have about 25% of the main story left and I'm not even the slightest interested in how things turn out. (6/10)PS: For an inspired boss reference, I think Poison Ivy with Catwoman, Killer Croc in BAA, Mr. Freeze, Solomon Grundy, and even Bane in BAA were inspiring boss fights.UPDATE: I have now completed this game (after some reluctance) and the final fight is just about the ONLY inspird boss fight I've found in this game.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games.  Only 2 years into being Batman and helping out in Gotham, Batman has his toughest night yet since this Christmas Eve the villian Black Mask has put a bounty of 50 million dollars on his head and 8 deadly assassins are in Gotham looking to score.The game looks really great and runs well even on my older laptop with an Nvidia GeForce 310 512MB card.  Occasionally has some small bugs like batman gliding through the air and flopping up and down constantly, or even more infamous, quick time events where the buttons don't register (If you can, use a controller).  Combat is the same as the other Batman games.  Very quick and fluid combos against large groups of enemies, or Predator set pieces where you pick off enemies one by one in sneaky fashion.The story is much more fleshed out than the previous games as well. Without giving too many spoilers, It shows how Batman's relationship evolved with the police and Liutenant Gordon, why so many villains want him dead and how he earned his reputation in Gotham as a hero.If you liked the previous Batman games and want more, you will definitely like this game.

												EDIT: I have been playing the online a lot lately and I have to admit that the online is actually very, very fun and creative. The same cannot be said about the Single Player.Whoever says that this game is not repititive has obviously not played the masterpiece known as Arkham City. Remember the Payphone Killer missions? Well, they are back again as bomb missions. The Bane ""Blow Up TITAN"" mission is replaced with Black Mask's ""Blow Up Drug Containers"" mission. The Freeze Blast/Cluster/Mine grenades are now replaced by the huge rip-off known as the Glue Grenade. The Line Launcher is now replaced by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ replacement known as the ""Remote Claw"", which Bats literally stole from Slade the Terminator. The Remote Electric Charge gun is now replaced by the Shock Gloves. And the Beyond skin is only available in multiplayer!!! And as if it just wasn't already repititive enough, the TITAN dudes are replaced by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""Enforcers"" Bane boss fight is another giant rip-off of the TITANs, Firefly is extremely similar to Clayface and you even use the same gadget, the Glue/Freeze grenade to defeat both of them AND you have to dodge around to avoid either charges or, in Firefly's cas, the Flamethrower. Mad Hatter's mission is a rip-off of the Scarecrow Hallucination minus it isn't that exciting, AND I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN STORY YET!!! Remember the Epic Fight in the gladiator pit in Penguin's museum? Well, it's back again. The TN1 Bane fight is a rip-off of the Mr Freeze fight, it's just without the feeling of helplessness, and the feeling that it truly is a game of cat and mouse in City. Copperhead is a huge rip-off of both Ra's Al Ghul AND Scarecrow, and while I admit it is enjoyable, the Deathstroke fight is also copied from Ra's Al Ghul, remember the Beat-Down sequences and countering huge attack chains? Collecting all of these communications circuits or whatever they were is a huge rip-off of destroying Penguin's Jammer, and you do it to apprehend the same guy again! How great is that? I should also mentioned that I enjoyed the setpieces in Arkham City, but the setpieces in Origins, espicially, the Main Theme, SUCKS. And remember how it would have been nice if the plot was about Batman screwing Black Mask up? Well, it's about the Joker again! Also, while some parts of the dialogue is nice(e.g. Joker's first conversation with Harley), most of it SUCKS, espicially the Predator Inmate Conversations. P.S: They've also somehow managed to screw up the Freeflow Combat in this game. Controls are unresponsive and you cannot cancel your own blows to counter anymore, and some of the new sounds(e.g. knockout sound) are terrible			"

												If Arkham Asylum offered the thrill of becoming Batman, and Arkham City offered the thrill of exploring Gotham in free flight, and Arkham Knight will (supposedly) offer the thrill of piloting the Batmobile, then Arkham Origins seems to be offering the thrill of experiencing the genesis of Batman's most important relationships: Alfred, Gordon, and an array of his iconic nemises. However, Arkham Origins does not, as you might think, tell the story of how Bruce Wayne became the Batman. In fact, the circumstances of Wayne's childhood tragedy, training, and return to Gotham as reborn vigilante is already in the past, before the game begins, and he is already equipped with batarangs, grapnel, and Batwing jet. Instead, the 'Origins' referenced are the seeds planted in the story that will eventually mature into the Arkham City future. Along the way, Batman grows from a shadowy rumor to a renowned crime-fighter, having already taken bites out of local threats like Penguin and Black Mask, but also starting to attract enough attention to himself to begin to tip the established balance of power that will change Gotham forever.Unfortunately, where the previous Arkham Games have built and expanded on the fantasy of 'becoming' the Batman and living his adventure, with his gadgets, intelligence, and fortitude, Origins deviates very little from the City forumla of roaming the night, dealing justice to criminals, solving crime, and saving the city from an overarching threat. There's nothing new here, which is probably good news if you enjoyed City, but will disappoint if you're looking for the Arkham franchise to raise the ante. In a very real sense, Origins is a sort of deluxe-sized expansion pack for Arkham City that transposes that sequel's gameplay back in time.The good is that the polish and production values are as high as ever. The animation, cinematics, voice acting, and so on are extremely immersive, and Gotham looks great as a proud, post-industrial metropolis beginning to decay from the inside out. All of Batman's gadgets return, and there are now even more districts to explore, with never a shortage of thugs to beat into unconsciousness. There is a full compliment of challenge maps to medal in, side quests to complete, and obscure objects to find and collect, as in City. The main addition to the Arkham series overall is the ""Crime Scene"" sequences where Batman explores and reconstructs various crimes in order to solve a problem. While these are very, very simple puzzles, the actions and narrations do give the player a solid sense of being the ""World's Greatest Detective"", which is often neglected in Batman movies and games.The bad is that it will feel very much like playing Arkham City all over again, in a more mundane environment, and with a story campaign that feels noticably shorter when you consider it apart from all the diversions that you might explore along the way. Batman gains new abilities by completing various challenges according to the Dark Knight system, but what might have been enjoyable can easily become a frustrating grind when the challenge requirements do not properly align with the actual given opportunities within the game, forcing you to replay the game over if you want to maximize your potential. Lastly, this is clearly the least stable, most buggy iteration of the Arkham franchise. While most of the issues have been resolved by now, the game does not seem to have been coded cleanly or elegantly. Expect to experience crashes along the way.Concerning the DLC: The Initiation Pack only features Challenge Map content, which is a good value if you like that gamplay (I do). You can play pre-Batman Bruce Wayne in a weaker, stripped-down form on all the standard maps, along with a difficult, 5-map campaign simulating his training as part of the League of Shadows. Conversely, the ""Cold Cold Heart"" DLC is a standalone, story-only campaign, with no challenge maps, that doesn't interact with the main Origins storyline at all. If you just like the Batman story and experience without the tedium of Challenge medals, then this is perfect content for you, featuring a complete set of side quests, equipment upgrades, open-world exploring, and plotline with new enemies and characters, and a challenging new boss fight integrating stealth, combat, and gadgets together. As for the Batman costume skin packs, I didn't find them ultimately worth the value. The various suits and costumes generally did not fit well into the strong, well-established artistic design the game already possesses, and were at best comical and at worst distracting.In summary, Arkham Origins is retelling stories you have probably already heard before. If once was enough, you should probably take a pass, but if you can't just get enough, Origins is happy to offer more. "

												While the origin story of a lot of the villains and Batmans opponents is good in its own right, the successor to Arkham City seems to be riddled with some bugs that can be quite annoying from time to time.

												Overall the game is very very good the combat has depth and is not too complex, maling it really feeling like one of the only games that feels like it can stand on combat alone if needed but with the platfroming/ puzzle solving mechanics that give it a balance of fun that I feel that only this and the orgional price of persia series has accomplished in the 3d relm. The story is engaging and gritty while keeping the plot simple and is meant to give of a feeling of determination to stop what is going on rather than putting 50 plot twists in or going down so deep in Batman lore that you have to read years worth of Batman comics or stop the game to search in wikipedia to understand (thats is not saying there will be no charcters that people will not know before getting into the game but rather the game does a very good job explaining who they are through both the cut scenes and gameplay styles and areas that you interact with them in). Thank being said I think there is two things holding the game back. The main one is that the city in the single player just feels so....... empty you end feeling like your saving a city with nobody in it. Now, the games excuse is that everyone is staying in their homes due to a huge storm, but in reality there are still some people out and about even in snow storms (now saying that is smart or not, that is a different subject) so could had a least a couple of people out and about in the streets, something like saving a woman when those sudden crime reports come up? Even a few npcs would make it feel that your in a living city and not an apocalytic one. (and for any of those that will say that the world is more for collecting, the orgional Crackdown was a collect-a-thon in almost the same exact way and still managed to create a livelier city than this AND was released in 2007) the other promlem is that the multiplayer is boring, which I know is a very common complaint and is really not the reason people buy this game but it still dosen't change the fact that it could be done better than a generic thrid person shooter with batman combat, what makes it frustrating is that all it need to be good was a endless oneline mode with friends similar to the single player challenges or some online co-op.  Don't let the negatives deter you though this game is good just could have been better if Wb interactive wasn't trying to release a new game every year  like it is the combat version of call of duty which I am very afraid that it is becoming like that with the new game announced for this year.

												This game, well everyone who loves batman arkham series, especially akrham city, would like or hate this game. Batman Arkham Origin is the prequel of the Arkham series where the Bruce Wayne just passed two years in battling criminal as the caped crusaderThe story of this game, despite not being developed by Rocksteady nor written by the previous game writer. This game has the best story in overall arkham game series. You will questioning how the moral standard of batman that he will not kill or let anyone get killed, even his most dangerous enemy. When playing this game maybe you will think, ""If I were him, I would kill that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so there will no other victims."" And this game told more about Alfred that really wanted his master just live a normal billionaire life, forgetting his night vigilante routinity. And there will be some other origin story about joker too that previously been told by ""The Killing Joke"" comic. Overall this game has really done a good job in his story aspect about Batman loreThe gameplay, well this is a little bit down of this game. The overall gameplay is almost identically the same with Arkham City. Even the city is almost the same with previous. Only a minor tweak to the gadget and character proggression system. In this game there will be some achievement that will rewarded you with some perk. But some of the achievement is quite hard to earn and only able to do in some specific places. So maybe for people who don't want to read any guide or such will find himself frustated because you can't do some achievement and your only hope is to do the new game plus that been harder than normal playthroughMy verdict is, 8 out of 10. Yes I heavily value a story from the game I played. And Batman Arkham Origin has done really good job in telling the story. Even it's not really told the ""Origin"" about Batman nor about the Asylum itself but I really love the story of this game. More emotional and more character is more lively compared to previous game. But if you value the gameplay more then you will eat a same burger, but this time the ketchup is plentier than the previous.			"

COMPLETED 100%I got this prequel to the ever sucessful Arkham series, hoping it'd be better than what critics have made it out to be. But as it turns out, the game is more of an overall disappointment to what it could have been a signifciant improvement to Arkham City. While AC was so flawlessly free of technicalities, this game is still riddled with quite a few glitches and bugs the devs couldn't be bothered with. Nothing so game-breaking at least. Where the games shine, the combat system, AO does away by making for slightly more challenging enemies and variations. This is surely a good thing, if not for the numerous control input problems and fight inconsistencies that simply ends up screwing up the enjoyment of gameplay. Especially annoying when the game expects you to perform up to task for the stupid Dark Knight System and ranked challenge maps.Thankfully there's the very unbalanaced and overpowered Shock Gloves, to compensate for this. A new and important gadget to this game, it makes you wonder why the heck wasn't Batman using this OP weapon in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. I mean it helped  defeat Bane and save Alfred from near-death. It's so glorious, there's no reason to abandon it.  There's only one thing AO has made the biggest improvement from the past games. The main story missions are now more noticeably fun and interesting to get through, despite the silly premise which mainly serves as a subtle excuse in order to chuck a whole bunch of notable Batman villians in this one single game. It's also slightly longer and less than straightforward, compared to AC's main campaign, which is nice.. The dark cinematics and presentation are also brilliantly well done in coveying the tone of the game. If only the actual game looked as good... Boss fights are exceptionally great fun as well but makes Batman look too darn overpowered for someone just starting on an early vigilante career. The open world of Gotham is much bigger than the Arkham City in Arkham City, many similiar buildings stand out, being bigger in size, and the layout is mostly different enough to distinguish as being unique. It's also as completely unrealistic as ever, as a city completely void of civilians. Another ridiculous excuse to prevent Batman from making ""social interations"" with civilians. What a bummer.Collectibles still remain the same, data packs replacing riddler trophies this time and the number of packs hidden and are spread around the city. Finding or acquiring them isn't as hard as before, with less puzzles and challenges to solve. A show of leniency to completionists, or just a lack of effort on the devs' part in rushing this game. 3.5/5 - Game presentation is great, some areas of gameplay is an improvement, others is a thumbs down. A great game regardless, nevertheless, but nothing much so noteworhy for the upcoming Arkham Knight to follow and adapt from.			"

												GRAN JUEGO DE BATMANHabía leído y escuchado harta mala fe hacia este juego: que si no era un verdadero Arkham, que si Rocksteady no tenía nada que ver, que a nivel técnico era muy cutre, etc. Total que esperé a verlo a 45 pesitos en una venta de Steam y creo que si te gusta Batman, vale mucho mas que eso.PROs+La ambientación+Las peleas contra jefes (Deathstroke, Luciérnaga y Bane las mejores)+Los gráficos+Cold Cold Heart+La música+El doblaje (voz de Batman)CONTRAs+De repente el timing en el combate se siente chafón+El doblaje de muchas otras voces que no sean Batman está bien piñatón+Al final del juego ya desbloqueaste cosas que en AA apenas obtienes. Wut?En conclusión, el juego está muy bien hecho y aunque por alguna razón se siente diferente a otros Arkham, no es tan tedioso como (a mi parecer) Arkham City. Sin duda muy recomendable si te gusta Batman, si disfrutas de los juegos de Arkham o si simplemente buscas un buen juego de fregadazos con las 3 B.			"

Unlike arkham knight boss battles, this installment brings back the feeling of what its like to fight actual bosses who could kill you if your not too careful for example bane, deathstroke, cooperhead and others.

												Fun, but not as polished as the previous two games. Seems to be glitchier, multiple times I've ended up bat-swinging into areas I shouldn't be able to reach (And getting stuck there), and once I managed to leave the map altogether and ended up falling into an endless abyss. The voices, unfortunately, are no longer the DCAU cast, but the new VA's do a great job at filling those rather large shoes, although the Joker's VA seems to be trying a little too hard with his Mark Hamill Joker voice and it's tenDENcy to STRRRRRRETCH out CEEEEEERtain syllables... Regardless, if like me you like batman and you liked the other two games you'll probably still really like this one. The fact that it's not made by the same team is obvious but the fun's still there.			"

												The game is good. Low scores press and players were given for the fact that it has no significant changes. So the developers themselves say that they will not make a radically new. Thus, the game killed themselves fans who were hoping for a level of development Rotsksteady. But the game came out very good. But the main drawback - the bugs that are corrected gradually but one bug that there was at me in the game (side quest Birds) I had to remove savegame and all of my time I spent in the game was spent in vain. As a result, we have a very good single player, multiplayer interesting that you need to refine and still a lot of bugs that need to be addressed. Better buy this game will come when all the DLC ,fix all the bugs and preferably on sale (price in Steam is quite high, at least in Russia).			"

												Good game, if you don't mind playing Arkham City again.  Essentially a carbon copy of the last game, but with a new story  That being said, the same great combat mechanics.  It's still fun to string together huge combos, and flying around the city is still super smooth.  Besides the lack of any significant improvements over the previous game, the largest complaint I have about this game is the absence of Mark Hamill as the Joker.  The new voice actor just doesn't even compare.			"

												This current entry in the Batman/Arkham series is a lot of the same for fans of the previous titles -- as Batman, you explore a large segment of Gotham, dealing with a multitude of villians and optional objectives during a particularly heated Christmas Eve, setting some groundwork and backstory for the previous Arkham titles and the upcoming Arkham Knight.The game flow follows a somewhat rigid structure of exploring the city freely for bonuses that earn you some unlockable abilities, as well as data and viewable charater models, while the main objectives require you to go into large interior areas and set peices and finishing up with a unique boss battle. I would say that for some fans fatigued with the series this could be considered a negative, but the story is well-written and paced, set during a time where Batman is still getting into his role and is considered inexperienced. That said, the voice acting is superb, and the game holds together well on its presentation.Combat is also copied verbatim from the other Arkham titles. It is a very fluid system that rewards the player for fighting large groups of enemies without getting hit and most importantly, not breaking the literal flow of combat by stopping for any reason. This one has some tougher enemies than in the other games, requiring more combinations of evasion and disarming to manage the enemies, which I assume is also trying to push the point of a Rookie Batman and making sure experienced players still stay on their toes.For the very experienced and people demanding a challenge, the game offers a permadeath mode called ""I Am the Night"" which adds a much greater layer of tension, and I'm happy to see it offered up.It looks like the game had gotten some heat when it was initially released due to some bugs and glitches, but in its state as of posting, I only had one isolated instance of a massive framerate drop in the Batcave that resolved itself after about thirty seconds that I believe may have been on my end. All in all, I'd say this game is a very worthy purchase for a fan of the Arkham series or people interested in jumping into the Arkham series.			"

												TL:DR >  Watching Batman movies and reading Batman comics is great and all, but if you really want to feel like you are the Dark Knight, playing Arkham Origins is probably as close as you can get without becoming a billionaire and having your parents murdered. What makes the game so great is that it features all the elements of being Batman: Detective work, awesome gadgets, martial artistry, chasing crazy people, wearing your underpants on the outside, and so on.Long review:Graphics: Excellent, well tuned to NVIDIA GPUs, notably DX11 Tesselation and PhysX. AMD guys may have a different story to tell.Gameplay: For these new to the game, some boss fight scenes will be a considerable challenge, so prepare to die and restart the game from that point and get taunted for failing.Story: Well-developed characters and story line that explains a lot about the prequels, and dropping subtle hints that allows the Batman universe to intertwine in all the three games. This is one of the strongest points in the game; Take for instance, the origin of Mr. Freeze, Bane's breakdown, the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his butler, and the Joker's over the line insanity.Tips: Get the season pass to access the rest of the DLCs. If you don't need online play, the season pass has you covered with the rest, such as the Initiation DLC and stuff. That adds extra hours of immersive gameplay that'll keep you practising and on edge to keep up with your enemies.Length:Well balanced. On average, it is possible to pull off both the main and side missions without being sidetracked too far from the game, and also offers sweet upgrade points which reward the gamer's time spent on the side missions. Replay value: Owing to the excellent challenge mode(s) and extra game play modes, you8 cannot play this game once. Overall rating: 10/10. This game is perfect.PS: Did I mention there were Ninjas? Yes, I did. Overall: 10/10. Gameplay reminiscent of Batman Arkham City.Extra notes for AMD users: On DirectX 11 tesselation, use normal settings and avoid all NVIDIA ""enhanced"" settings, they can cripple the game's performance. The same aplies to people using NVIDIA GPUs priot to Kepler.			"

												Horrendously glitchy, the flight controls will mess up mid flight, data packs are still there after you grab them, gadgets will get stuck to controls and you cant switch to something different, pathing issues where you can climb things that make no sense and can't climb things you should definitely be able to, enemy units getting stuck on walls and barriers (Had a thug get stuck in a wall during a predator room to the point where i had to try and use explosives near him to blast him out of the wall so i could progress).The QA for this game was horribly done and the actual implementation is a little flawed as well. Never mentions anything about scanning items and you have to figure out for yourself it actually matters for collectibles).I don't mind that its a repeat of mostly the same mechanics with some new gadgets, i gladly accept that and would gladly play it and enjoy it. However the near constant glitches and the flawed implementation of the game prevent me from enjoying this title. I do not count it as a true Arkham game and consider it a flawed product. It is the first game i have ever played as a finished product where i wanted to start writing bug reports for the developers.			"

												This game i s pretty good, theres a strong combination of story and open world while at the same time having a well written story and addictive gameplay. The only part of the game i had an issue with was that the game kept dumping me into the same room. It has two levels, a bunch of badies, vents, and gargoyles. This same level is recreated at least 15 times throughout the game. No matter where it is! The broken bridge, the mesuem, the bank, the prison. The game just keeps emptying the player into the same room when its time to transition between levels, othe than that pretty good.If i had made this review before i finished this game i would have given it a lower rating, then i figured out i was an idiot. The puzzels, i guess you could call them that, got me stuck super hard for almost an hour on each one. Then i realized i didnt use the one item on my utility belt needed to pass that level, or i was in the wrong room, or i was in the right room but couldnt figure out what the dialouge was telling me. Now that ive had my ""wow im and idiot"" moments i can say that this is a game worth praise. 8/10			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an odd one. While the gameplay itself has been tightened up, for example the combat flows a lot better and enemies are generally more aggressive than they were during previous games, the innovation is seriously lacking.The collectibles are uninspired compared to the original riddles and the main story is just downright dire, with the assassins that are supposedly after you falling more into sidequests than anything else. The copy/paste assets of Arkham City doesn't do the game any favours either, as it feels more like an expansion than anything.Graphically the game looks great and there are a few nice touches here and there such as PhysX enabled snow and it has been optimised to hell and back so it runs fantastically (game breaking bugs aside), but it still doesn't look as good as Arkham City does.It's a good game if you are a fan of the series, but I would hold off and get it a little cheaper unless you really have to have it.

												Mechanically, this game boasts a lot of improvements from Arkham City. The fighting feels smoother and a little more challenging. Better use is made of your detective skills this time around, as piecing together the crime actually segways into larger plot elements. I also found the scavenger-hunt style skill upgrades engaging too. The problem is, that this game falls back on the previous games far too much for its plot points. The adventure  starts with a rogue's gallery of more obscure Batman's Nemisises (Nemesisi? Nemisiss? is this even a word?) but eventually circles back to all of the same antagonists the previous games used. The story isn't bad exactly, just sort of boring.Still, it's a pretty solid game, it just plays things a little too safe for its own good.			"

												When I heard about this game being developed by a different company, I thought it would be a refreshing experience. I am not opposed to change, if that change is good. But then, when I played it, I immediately realized that I was wrong. This game is not a change. Let me explain why:• In terms of gameplay, Arkham Origins is identical to Arkham City. It even has the same map. The environments are different, but that difference is merely superficial. The devs made the easiest decision: don't innovate, just recycle. Even the gadgets are the same. Most of them we've already seen before, and the ""new"" ones are just different versions of the same thing (remote claw=line launcher, though the claw is a bit of an improved version; glue grenade=freeze cluster). The shock gloves are a very nice addition though, but because of its usefulness, every fight after you get them is a joke. Except boss fights of course, in which you will be screaming to your monitor the word ""bull****"" several times.• In terms of story telling, it follows their predecessors with extreme accuracy. The story itself is different, of course. It includes several villains that weren't present in previous installments, but it also includes several that were, and without the need to do so. But there are no plot holes, and the story shapes out well as a prequel to Arkham Asylum. I recommend staying through the credits (despite the fact that credits are extremely long).• In the graphical aspect, don't even get me started on the bugs. Man this game is buggy as hell, considering it's been released some time ago. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you get past your first boss fight without issues. And pray that enemies don't get stuck behind walls forcing you to start a fight all over again, and this applies to boss fights as well. I wouldn't say this feels like a beta, but it's certainly close. When it's not bugging out, it's the same as Arkham City. Don't expect anything new here.It has its epic moments, don't get me wrong, but it all feels the same to Arkham City, and that's where the game fails: originality. Still, I would recommend any fan of the franchise to get this game, but only when it's on sale, it's not worth the full price.Final score: 3.25/5			"

												I've just finished the game (main story).I liked the fighting system better than the previous Batman games, because there are harder enemies to deal with and some improvements in the combat (some new moves you can use).The story was very nice and all, but I personally like Arkham City better as an overall of Batman.It is still worth getting this game if you liked the previous games.

												Prior to Batman: Arkham Origins the only game Warner Bro. Monreal had worked on was the port of Arkham City to the Wii and  Lego: Legend of Chima Online.  That being said, they had the impossible task of trying to fill the shoes of Rocksteady Studios.  A company that revolutionized the superhero genre of videogames. A game that made us, possibley for the first time, feel like the superhero in question. No liceneced game, much less a superhero game, had really nailed it like Rocksteady did in the Arkham games. I'm not an Warner Bro. Montreal apologist but if Arkham Orings had been the first games to release we'd have been blown away.  It's disappointing we didn't get more interation in the third time out but what's there is solid.  Origins feels like a game that a produced by a studio that's just getting it's sealegs. Bugs abound but most of the game breaking issues have been resolved as far as I can tell. I didn't have nearly as many issues as most where having but I could chalk that up to luck.If you like Batman there just isn't a good reason not to pick this up now that some of the kinks have been work out. Batman: Arkham Orgins is wonderful game for Batman fans with enough combat and story to entertain a non-comic nerd.			"

												Although this wasn't done by Rocksteady, this is still a solid game in the Arkham series. There weren't any drastic changes from Arkham City except that they made the map bigger. The story is great and the boss fights are challenging and memorable. All of the major bugs that were present when the game was first released have been fixed; there are just a few minor bugs remaining. Overall, I recommend any fan of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City to give this one a couple playthroughs. 9/10			"

												Arkham Origins didn't try to be something else.It takes the combat,visual art and challenging boss fights from it's predecessors.Why fix something that ain't broken?The combat is very similar to Arkham Asylum and City but of course it looks and feels more fluid.It is improved but not so much that you'll feel a major difference.Gameplay-wise,Origins follows the same exact patterns as the previous games.You will have lots of Predator encounters where you try to take out armed enemies silently,followed by tons of skirmishes against various enemy types,and then boss fights.I don't complain,but they didn't even try to bring something new.At least the game's combat is good enough so you won't get bored to death.The boss fights are good and interactive,with good dialogue.The story-line is good.It's not fantastic,but it's good.I must say,stuff happens too fast and it might seem confusing at times but it's decently presented and delivered,with good portrayal of the characters from the comics.Arkham Origins tells the story from the begining and it brings cool personalities like Deadshot,Deathstroke,Black Mask and so on.My least favorite part are the ''side-quests''.They feel like a chore.You just run around the city doing mostly unsatisfying stuff in order to reach a goal.I know it's supposed to be for completionists,but at least try to spice it up a little.Batman Arkham Origins is a good game,alongisde two great games.It's the lesser game when compared to City and Asylum but it's still good.

												This game really makes me want to play Batman: Arkham City. It just doesn't seem as polished, with the exception of the combat animations which seem to have been improved this time around. The story is pretty interesting but I got bored of it pretty quickly. It's a little predictable. The gameplay is basically the same as the other games. I think the level design is what makes me not like this game as much as the others, the others have more unique monuments and it seems like this one just has a big bridge and then some buildings.It's worth it if you get it on a sale assuming you have played the other games, however I would not reccomend it to someone as their first Arkham game.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is very similar to the last game, Arkham City which isn't a bad thing as the previous game was a masterpiece in it's own right.The story isn't as good as the previous two but it's still amazing, at times predictable but at other times surprises you with a plot twist that you didn't expect.The general plot of this game follows Batman on Christmas Eve as a bounty has been placed on his head that many major and minor villains will attempt to get from you.It should be said that this game was developed by Warner Brothers Montreal which is a different studio from the previous two and the upcoming Arkham Knight game which were all developed by Rocksteady Studios, it's because of this that I can forgive this title from not having too many changes from the last games.There is so much to do in this game even after you complete it, for example there is a most wanted side quest that allows you to try to stop criminals such as The Mad Hatter and The Penguin and bring them into custody. The Good - Good Story- Many interesting villains, even some you may not have heard of- Graphical improvements from previous game (not too much)- Fun side activities- Improved mechanics- Battle system is great with only a few problems- You can be Batman, who doesn't want a taste of that Batman lifestyle am I right? The Bad - Battle system is repetitive at times- Not many improvements from the previous games- A few glitches had to be sorted out, I never ran into many glitches like the fatal error or controlling flight issues however I did have to fix an issue with the cutscenes as mine lagged a lot; I ended up finding a guide on the steam community to help me.- Some tasks such as the collectables are still a chore in my opinion and I wish they were done more interestingly than they are in this game, for example Arkham Asylam had audio logs from the villains which were interesting to listen too and made me want to collect them.

												Batman Arkham Origins is an Action adventure, beat - em - up game. It has a whole city to explore, which makes it quite hard to get around. Luckily we have the fast travel system where you would need to destroy ""Comm Towers"" to be able to fast travel with the Batwing. The game also offers quite a number of bosses and side quests. The story line was amazing and I enjoyed every single bit. The only part I wasn't very fond of was that you would have to cross the ""Gotham Bridge"" a lot which gets a bit annoying. Other than that everything seems good to me, and also the graphics were phenomenal. I recommend you buy it and play it immediately !!!			"

												An absolutely amazing game, building on the success of the previous installments, this game brings everything to the table. The story basically picks up after the Batman: Year One graphic novel, faithfully keeping the characters within ""canon"" boundaries and building upon their personalities with excellent voice acting, extremely articulated facial programming. The story is worthy of the Batman title, and the action is a step above the previous two games. The gadgets have been revamped slightly, and the ""Dark Knight"" challenges make you feel like the Bat yourself as you complete them. The visuals are drop-dead gorgeous and the art direction was well thought out. This extended and restored version of Gotham City is beautiful and keeps you exploring for hours and hours on end. With so much content, the replayability and longevity of life that this game has it tremendous. Sure the game launched with a few glitches, but they were promptly corrected by WBMontreal, and we now have a perfect game.			"

												I am an avid Batman fan and I truelly enjoyed the grittyness and raw ability that Batman dmeonstrates in this game.  In this game you play a Batman who is young and not as refined as the one we typically think of.  This allows for an experience unlike most Batman adventures where we do not see an unsure and angry Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The detective mode is extremely enhanced over the past two Batman games.  Most boss fights are challenging and enjoyable.  The overall story is compeling and feels like a batman movie.  Lots of gadgets, some detective work, and tons of action. Overall a very enjoyable expansion to the franchise.  I rate this game 9/10.  In the end, ask yourself if you want to be batman fighting against some of his greatest foes and some lesser known villians, than this game is definitely for you.			"

												I had my doubts about this game after seeing a swapping of hands for developers and the metacritic scores, in comparison to the previous games (not that the metacritic was all that bad, its just lower than the previous titles.), but after picking this game up for $7.50, I can say that I got my money's worth and left satisfied. Although we saw the departure of Rockysteady on this title, presumably because Arkham Knight is quite resource consuming, WB Studios stepped in and did a fair job. They kept the good stuff (combat, open world, gadgets) and added a few nice features. Were you not aware of the change in studios, the only differences that might alert you to the fact would be the WB Studios logos and the new look interface. Otherwise, this game plays very much like the previous Arkham games. In my opinion, thats a good thing because it signals the developers knew what worked and didn't try to butcher it. For others, that is the inherit problem with this game; the fact that it is pretty much a clone of Arkham City. Were it not for a few changes, this game would be an exact clone. I really didn't have too much of a problem with this, seeing as its only the 3rd game in the installment and I'm not quite sick of doing the same thing over and over again yet. While its true that there isn't much innovation here, I'm glad that the new developers stuck with a route that worked and not one that tarnished the series. For that, we should all be proud. The story in this game is fits well in the universe and unravels the beginnings of several overarching plot points in the series, mainly the beginning of the Batman-Joker conflict and early versions of Harley Quinn before she goes evil, for example. On that note, it was interesting to see the beginnings. Sure, they could have been fleshed out a bit more, but I'm not complaining. The story was good until the end, and I really didn't have any qualms about it. Like I said, gameplay is more or less the same, save for a few reskinned gadgets with slightly different (although still true to core functionality) uses, as well as some new enemies to fight. Combat is the same, with perhaps some new moves down the line when you level-up. The world is still open, and it plays very similar to Arkham City with a myriad of things to do. One thing I really liked, however, is they definitely fleshed out the detective mode here. While its still a very minor part of the game, you can analyze the crime scenes more by reanacting the crime and investigating more clues to solve the crime. Sure it holds your hand and it doesn't feel like it should, but its a welcomed addition that was missing from Arkham City that made me happy to see. In addition, the boss fights have been improved in my opinion, and overall, were a bit more satisfying than the previous game. This game is not free of issues, however. I found that the counter key/button was only responsive 75%-80% of the time, causing large fights (10+ enemies) or counter heavy battles to be frustrating at times, as the counters would just not work at all some of the times. This also applied to ground takedowns. It just seemed like the key/button wasn't registering for me at times. There are also some combat bugs, such as enemies flying off the screen when hit or enemies clipping into buildings (still fightable even if you couldn't see them), but nothing gamebreaking here. A major issue, however, is the crashing. It shares a similar crashing issue with Arkham City. While this game crashing didn't seem to lock up my PC, it did seem to crash more often than the last game. I'd say it crashed once every 3-4 hours, and sometimes more often. If you are looking for a new Batman game that innovates the series, you'll have to look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a solid and faithful prequel to the last two games, look no further. While this game is nowhere near perfect thanks to some bugs and such, it is a game worth playing and is enjoyable from start to finish. Recommened. 8.5/10			"

												Overall, it's a good game.  If you liked Arkham City, and you want to play it again but you're tired of the dialogue, here's your chance.  There are one or two new tweaks to the combat system and gadgets, but from all the trailer content we definitely saw that coming.  The story's not bad, but actually I liked it more before the plot twist came in.  Dialogue was excellent, and I really liked watching characters bring up why Batman is not the right answer to every problem.There's a lot more emphasis on boss fights in this entry, and some of them are cool!  But some of them are quite frustrating, especially since this game seems to be a bit buggier than the two before it.  This probably has something to do with the larger scale.  Since the only thing to do in this larger world is fight goons, and you will assuredly find more goons.  Combat is just about the same as Arkham City, so to me this more felt like padding the game's length than an actual improvement.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games.  Only 2 years into being Batman and helping out in Gotham, Batman has his toughest night yet since this Christmas Eve the villian Black Mask has put a bounty of 50 million dollars on his head and 8 deadly assassins are in Gotham looking to score.The game looks really great and runs well even on my older laptop with an Nvidia GeForce 310 512MB card.  Occasionally has some small bugs like batman gliding through the air and flopping up and down constantly, or even more infamous, quick time events where the buttons don't register (If you can, use a controller).  Combat is the same as the other Batman games.  Very quick and fluid combos against large groups of enemies, or Predator set pieces where you pick off enemies one by one in sneaky fashion.The story is much more fleshed out than the previous games as well. Without giving too many spoilers, It shows how Batman's relationship evolved with the police and Liutenant Gordon, why so many villains want him dead and how he earned his reputation in Gotham as a hero.If you liked the previous Batman games and want more, you will definitely like this game.

												Excellent game! The story is just amazing. I think through out all the game it keeps you wanting more. I think more than one left the Enigma clues til last. That's the only thing that haven't changed. But still this time the clues are easier to solve. Thumbs up for that. The story is about, well, you know, Batman... He finds out at the beginning that some guy offered 50 grand to the person that killed the Bat. He finds out who and then the story goes... bla bla.The variety of weapons is a little similar to the previous Batman. Although I am satisfied with the weapons offered I might wanted to get more surprised by the weapons I could have gotten.Ok, what else? Oh. Combat engagement is ridiculously fun! It has a lot of moments like God of War where you have to press buttons to get free or fight an enemy. This thing really makes the game more appealing.Graphics are great just as the other Batman. Of course Origins has better graphics, more fluid animations and so on.The other thing that kept me going with this game is the online. Right now I have about 22 hrs played. 'bout 12 hours of singleplayer story. and 10 of multiplayer. The customization of your online character loadout is really original. Joker team is my favorite. Now here are the cons of the online:I know this is the first Batman with online multiplayer game but still is very simple. I think you should have had more guns or customization of guns given to your disposal. While being the hero is great... being the bad guys isn't as great. The developers should have been far more in to it.I recommend this game. It will give you tons of fun and variety in the Arkham saga. For the first Batman multiplayer they did a great work!			"

												I find that the game is a worthy prequel to Arkham City. It retains most of the features from Arkham City and because of that, some might say that it should have been a big DLC rather than a whole new game. However, it expanded the map, added in a whole new story and a bunch of new side activites that can bring you 16 to 20 hours of new gameplay. There are some flaws however. I felt that it was slightly easier than Arkham City and the challenge mode imo is not as enjoyable as the AC either. The game was also riddled with bugs during the first week from performance issues to being unable to complete certain missions/quests. Those should have been patched by now. You can't play stealth for many of the main story missions either so that could be a major flaw to some.tldr: Get this game if you are a big fan of Batman series or just want to have some fun. Whether on a sale or at full price, this game is a must get for 2013/2014			"

												It has the same graphics and setting as the Arkham City title but it feels a lot more lacking. Combat is rather dull and neverending as ""interesting"" means a lot of enemies. The story feels a bit lacking too and conflicting in logic. I really miss the great cinematics from Arkham City and the characters. I could not make much sense of the upgrade system or what's worth or not getting. There is no proprer learning curve as you litteraly get dropped in the city where the main activity is fighting groups of various size of enemies. I didn't really get to be drawn in the game and play a lot of time because it just feels empty, of mechanics, of story, of characters... I believe they are just trying to milk the franchise some more on less bucks invested in the game.			"

Tho the game doesnt really come up with its own new ideas it is still a fresh and young look at the story. Unlike the other two games that follow to a more adult version of the 90's animated series Orgins fills much more like you are playing one of the Tim Burten flicks. Its christmas time and everything.

												*NB: Some minor spoilers in this review* I came to this game late in the day. I love Batman, but having been burned by game breaking glitches in both Asylum and City, I refused to pay top dollar for Origins. especially at launch. Add that to no Conroy and no Hamill, and I had real concerns about how Origins would stack up. So I waited, and eventually it went on sale. Well, I was partly right. Troy Baker is no Hamill as the Joker. He puts in a valiant effort, amd he should be applauded, but he is in the master's shadow. Otherwise, though, Origins is superb, perhaps even the best in the series. The combat is the most enjoyable of the games so far, and the villains - most of whom it is fair to say are in the Batman B cast  - are actually very engaging. The writing is also top notch, the highlight for me being when Joker's rhapsodizes the bat at the same time as seducing Doctor Quinzel. It's also fun to play Batman as he finding his feet. Detective vision takes on a more literal meaning for the 'world's greatest detective', actually used to solve some mysteries, as opposed to finding out where the nearest grapple point or wall to explode is (though you still use it for that). So, it's great. If you love the series, or enjoy seeing Batman done well, you should enjoy this.Edit: Some people have said this game has issues with Mouse and Keyboard controls. I used a controller, and had none.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an interesting beast, given the two excellent games that precede it. While some may cite the recycled environment from City (with the addition of South Gotham) and items (with the addition of the Shock Gloves and Remote Claw) as reasons why this game should be skipped, looking at the full package, this game is worth playing. It boasts a compelling story as a rougher, younger Batman confronts a number of assassins who attempt to kill him on Christmas Eve, some of whom have never been featured in the ""Arkhamverse"" before. He also must deal with Black Mask, and more importantly, a sadistic, psychopathic criminal known only as ""The Joker."" This ""forging of key relationships"" that the game sells itself on is consistent throughout the game's narrative, helped by some excellent CGI cutscenes and voice acting from Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker. There are some bugs that might hinder one's playthrough, and the number of collectibles do have the tendency to make the side quests drag on, but Origins remains a solid game hampered by relatively minor problems. These problems don't prevent the best moments of the story from feeling like an unhinged, flaming roller coaster ride.			"

I felt this game was a little too open at times (as in travelling took a while) and when I played i finished the side quests rather quickly which made the late game a bit more boring but overall it was still a ton of fun.TL;DR - Very similar to City.

												When I first bought Batman: Arkham Asylum, I was disappointed that there wasn't that much more to do after completeing the main story line. Just riddler challenges and the extra combat/predator challenges. In Batman: Arkham Origins, after you complete the main story line there is just so much to do, including a bigger world to explore then just being on a single island like in Arkham Asylum. Not to mention an online mode, a couple more game modes after finishing the main story. Hundreds of medals to hunt down. Just a lot of end-game material, such as doing side missions, completeing crimes in progress. Really an upgrade from Arkham Asylum. If you're an achievement hunter then you'll spend a lot of time hunting achievements on this game, finished the main story and I'm about 20% done with achievements.			"

												Batman Fans Rejoice! The Prequel for the Batman Arkhamverse is now here. Origins is set in the early days of Bruce Wayne as Batman. Although it says ""Origins"", it is well over two years from the beginning of his vigilante crime fighting. In this game, you will encounter a lot of ""first"" as you battle enemies, and established alliances.Its story may lack the intensity and direction unlike the two original arkham which was written by paul dini. However, the game still delivers quite a compelling story. The game starts off rather plain but once you get to the middle part, that's where it kicks in. Gameplay is identical to the previous games, but with some new features like gadgets, and a new class of enemies. The game is beautiful in terms of its graphical presentation. The only problem with this game is the amount of bugs and glitches it has that seem to destroy my immersion throughout the game. In addition, this game now supports multiplayer where you will be facing joker's and bane's thugs as you get to play as Batman or Robin. But to be quite frank, the multiplayer doesn't live up to its expectation and fails in giving you a good gameplay.In Conclusion: Aside from its multiplayer and a ton of glitches, this game is a solid one and I recommend playing this game especially if you are a batman fanatic.

												Wow....just wow. That pretty much describes this game. As a child I've watched Batman the animated series numerous times and as  all kids do I wished I was Batman, well my dream came true. I AM FRIGGING BATMAN! Not only can you ""hunt down"" criminals but my favorite part is hanging people upside down. The fighting is top-notch, you're not fighting just a few thugs, no they throw waves and waves of people at you and IT IS AWESOME! The voice acting and the story is also very good, the only thing i would change is the invisible walls...I've had instances where I couldn't even walk over a 2 inch ledge because there was something in the way. But overall very fun and highly recommend!			"

												Forget the bandwagon naysayers. Arkham Origins has a better story comapred to Asylum and City. I am a big fan of the Arkham Series and although Arkham Origins did not give me the same feeling as Arkham City did, it's still a must get. I wish I didn't hesitate from buying, so here's my advice, BUY IT.			"

												Ya know, I actually liked this game. Not at first though. Oh hell no! I hated this game with a passion when it first came out. New voice actor, no K. C. = perfect plan for backfire. Thought it was cookie-cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some third-party no-name developer decided to take over from Rocksteady. But after my encounter with it, I went back to Arkham City an found the combat in Origins was a bit more visceral. More crunchy, more impactful. And I admit, Chris Redfield did a great job doing the bat(albeit, some lines get repeated to bludgeoning effect[""I'll make him/her talk.""]. But that withstanding, its got a decent roster and good story. Oh! And Booker Dewitt's in this game too! :D			"

												An absolutely amazing game, building on the success of the previous installments, this game brings everything to the table. The story basically picks up after the Batman: Year One graphic novel, faithfully keeping the characters within ""canon"" boundaries and building upon their personalities with excellent voice acting, extremely articulated facial programming. The story is worthy of the Batman title, and the action is a step above the previous two games. The gadgets have been revamped slightly, and the ""Dark Knight"" challenges make you feel like the Bat yourself as you complete them. The visuals are drop-dead gorgeous and the art direction was well thought out. This extended and restored version of Gotham City is beautiful and keeps you exploring for hours and hours on end. With so much content, the replayability and longevity of life that this game has it tremendous. Sure the game launched with a few glitches, but they were promptly corrected by WBMontreal, and we now have a perfect game.			"

												I've enjoyed this game for the story and the fact it's Batman and the assorted characters from the Rogue Gallery.  The graphics are OK, but the game is glitchy where I've got stuck inside walls etc a few times.  Sometimes different goons get stuck in a frozen akimbo position on the street while a fight is going - very odd.  Comabt is a bit chunky and does not feel very smooth. I play with mouse and keyboard, and perhaps it makes a difference using a gamepad, but I could not play comfortably using my Logitech F310.Side-missions get a bit repetitive like looking for all the Riddler's hidden data packs.The game doesn't seem as good as the first two Arkham games, possible due to being released by a different developer.I don't recommend purchasing this game if you haven't played the other two first.  I do recommend purchasing it if you are a fan of Batman, have played the previous two games, and want to experience the story.  Overall, I would give it 3 stars out of 5.			"

The gameplay is ""follow this line"" or ""press X to Jason"" and the game is far too glitchy. Enemies disappear at random and boss battles are either too short or too long. This is a complete waste of time wrapped in a AAA title. Do not purchase this game at ANY price.

I felt this game was a little too open at times (as in travelling took a while) and when I played i finished the side quests rather quickly which made the late game a bit more boring but overall it was still a ton of fun.TL;DR - Very similar to City.

												For a game that I remember receiving a lukewarm reception at its launch, I was really impressed with Arkham Origins. Whenever the reins of a franchise is handed over to another developer, there's always that worry of how the end result will turn out and in this case, I don't think you'd even notice any difference whatsoever. The game follows the formula of the previous games almost to a fault and while it doesn't come close to matching Arkham City, there's a few moments within the story that really stand out from the series that I think it should be remembered for. If you've enjoyed Asylum or City, you'll enjoy this. If this is your first Batman game, while there's nothing really wrong with this, I'd probably encourage you to play Asylum first.			"

												Arkham Origins is a fun addition of the ""Arkham"" franchise.  It lacks much of the polish, and some of the charm of the Rocksteady games, but has an interesting story and nicely varied boss fights that fans of the series will be able to appreciate.  They do a decent job of keeping things in line chronologically, and there are only a few noticable anachronisms that break the illusion of a story that takes place before Arkham Asylum.  Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that persist even now, and some of them are game-breaking.  However, in my playthrough of the main story, i managed to avoid every one of them (the My Alibi Bug is easily avoided).  ""Cold, Cold Heart"" (the story DLC) is the only place where I ran into game-breaking and unavoidable bugs.  That said, I was able to retain the fidelity of my save file by simply quitting after the bug had triggered (not trying to save again), and everything loaded fine.  The only thing that is still in error, is that two of the Steam Achievements have not triggered appropriately for me during ""Cold, Cold, Heart"".At the end of the day, I strongly recommend Arkham Origins for fans of the previous two Arkham games, especially if you get it cheap (A Holiday sale would be best, since the story takes place on Christmas Eve).  It's not one of the Rocksteady games, but it's a fun way to spend a bit more time in their world, especially while we wait for Arkham Knight.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the newest title in the Batman Arkham franchise. I noticed that it got very negative review and i thought i would write my review to clear some things up.First of all Arkham Origins is not trying to do something new or redo a major part of the game and for a good reason if WB Montreal had added something new or redid something Rockstedy put in place they would have been blamed by fans for messing up what Rockstedy had created.First of all the story it's really good. The first two Arkham games had an okay story but it wasn't a story i really connected with i mostly finished the game and that was that. Arkham Origins on the other hand has a story that keeps you on your toes wondering whats going to happen next. In my opinion it's way better than the past Arkham games.One of the biggest things Origins got blamed for was the difficulty but i personally like the challenge. The first two Arkham games always felt to easy i went through them really quickly and after that it was over. Origins adds to the challenge and might have overdone it the game could be argued overly hard but once you get the hang of it it becomes pretty easy.The boss battles are much more interesting take the firefly battle for example avoiding fire while a bridge was falling apart was really enjoyable. The boss battles also gave me something new a feeling of satisfaction when you defeat a boss. This was never really in the Arkham games.My favorite part of the game was the Multiplayer it adds a whole new aspect of the game and can be pretty scary. You really feel what the criminals you encounter feel as you see something swoop past you and then take you out from behind. The bane and joker games are your average 3rd person shooter but playing as Batman or Robin is really fun.While the game may not have added much it delivers in one category making an excellent Arkham game. all in all I rate this game7/10 it had some major glitches that should have been fixed.

												I would recommend this game for any other platform, but the comp version has so many glitches and bugs, it's just not worth the frustration. My first playthrough was cut short at over 30% completion when my Batman exited a building and fell into a bottomless void, and of course the game autosaved there. Nothing new is added to the gameplay, though it is arguably more challenging, and the one amazing new gadget of course raises questions about the continuity of the series. If you do own another system however, I highly recommend getting it for that. The boss fights are EPIC and the game adds a lot to the overall story and lore, though not in any unexpected ways.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an interesting beast, given the two excellent games that precede it. While some may cite the recycled environment from City (with the addition of South Gotham) and items (with the addition of the Shock Gloves and Remote Claw) as reasons why this game should be skipped, looking at the full package, this game is worth playing. It boasts a compelling story as a rougher, younger Batman confronts a number of assassins who attempt to kill him on Christmas Eve, some of whom have never been featured in the ""Arkhamverse"" before. He also must deal with Black Mask, and more importantly, a sadistic, psychopathic criminal known only as ""The Joker."" This ""forging of key relationships"" that the game sells itself on is consistent throughout the game's narrative, helped by some excellent CGI cutscenes and voice acting from Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker. There are some bugs that might hinder one's playthrough, and the number of collectibles do have the tendency to make the side quests drag on, but Origins remains a solid game hampered by relatively minor problems. These problems don't prevent the best moments of the story from feeling like an unhinged, flaming roller coaster ride.			"

												Horrendously glitchy, the flight controls will mess up mid flight, data packs are still there after you grab them, gadgets will get stuck to controls and you cant switch to something different, pathing issues where you can climb things that make no sense and can't climb things you should definitely be able to, enemy units getting stuck on walls and barriers (Had a thug get stuck in a wall during a predator room to the point where i had to try and use explosives near him to blast him out of the wall so i could progress).The QA for this game was horribly done and the actual implementation is a little flawed as well. Never mentions anything about scanning items and you have to figure out for yourself it actually matters for collectibles).I don't mind that its a repeat of mostly the same mechanics with some new gadgets, i gladly accept that and would gladly play it and enjoy it. However the near constant glitches and the flawed implementation of the game prevent me from enjoying this title. I do not count it as a true Arkham game and consider it a flawed product. It is the first game i have ever played as a finished product where i wanted to start writing bug reports for the developers.			"

												TL:DR >  Watching Batman movies and reading Batman comics is great and all, but if you really want to feel like you are the Dark Knight, playing Arkham Origins is probably as close as you can get without becoming a billionaire and having your parents murdered. What makes the game so great is that it features all the elements of being Batman: Detective work, awesome gadgets, martial artistry, chasing crazy people, wearing your underpants on the outside, and so on.Long review:Graphics: Excellent, well tuned to NVIDIA GPUs, notably DX11 Tesselation and PhysX. AMD guys may have a different story to tell.Gameplay: For these new to the game, some boss fight scenes will be a considerable challenge, so prepare to die and restart the game from that point and get taunted for failing.Story: Well-developed characters and story line that explains a lot about the prequels, and dropping subtle hints that allows the Batman universe to intertwine in all the three games. This is one of the strongest points in the game; Take for instance, the origin of Mr. Freeze, Bane's breakdown, the relationship between Bruce Wayne and his butler, and the Joker's over the line insanity.Tips: Get the season pass to access the rest of the DLCs. If you don't need online play, the season pass has you covered with the rest, such as the Initiation DLC and stuff. That adds extra hours of immersive gameplay that'll keep you practising and on edge to keep up with your enemies.Length:Well balanced. On average, it is possible to pull off both the main and side missions without being sidetracked too far from the game, and also offers sweet upgrade points which reward the gamer's time spent on the side missions. Replay value: Owing to the excellent challenge mode(s) and extra game play modes, you8 cannot play this game once. Overall rating: 10/10. This game is perfect.PS: Did I mention there were Ninjas? Yes, I did. Overall: 10/10. Gameplay reminiscent of Batman Arkham City.Extra notes for AMD users: On DirectX 11 tesselation, use normal settings and avoid all NVIDIA ""enhanced"" settings, they can cripple the game's performance. The same aplies to people using NVIDIA GPUs priot to Kepler.			"

												I am Vengeance.I am the Night.I am Batman.Okay, don't let my playtime discourage you from reading my review. I have completed the game on my PS3.If I were to describe this game in one word it would either be great or underrated.This game is great, IMHO the free roam is better than City. In City there weren't as many enemies to fight and the map could be traversed in minutes. In Origins there are a ton more in groups of 8 or 9ish, the map is also bigger too. Crimes also make the game a lot more fun, they're better than they were in CityThe story is just as good as City, but there are some parts I dislike in Origins, and City's ending is better. I also like the costume in Origins over City, it's more intimidating and realistic.I haven't experienced any crashes or stutters except for a micro stutter and a small FPS drop (won't drop below 58 usually) when zoning. I've heard that using DirectX11 Enhanced makes the game unstable so I don't bother with it.I have never bothered with the multiplayer but I've heard it's bad.SummaryPros:Great StoryGreat gameplayAfter game free roamThe music is as good as City'sMixed:Not the same voice actors, but this is a younger Batman so I guess...Cons:Some costumes are annoying to unlock Batman breaks his rule at one point, he kills Bane then revives him. I thought that was bad Some of the boss fights are disappointing and even frustrating compared to cityThe occasional FPS dropEnigma (Riddler) challanges are boring.9/10This review may be updated soon as I play it more.Specs:GTX 780 6GBi7-2600 @ 3.40GHz16 RamI didn't run this game at ultra but might chagne the settings.

												Really grows on you this one. I found it hard to get into at first attempts as it feels very similar to City before it really kicks in and the fact that Batman has practically more if not better suit and equipment and abilities takes some fathoming considering this is meant to be his humble beginnings.Aside from those thing once you get into it, the story and visiting all the key players for the first time in the humble beginnings as well as linking things canon to Arkham Asylum & City make for quite a treat making it a must for a fan of the series.This is especially true with all the issues remedied and the game looking quite sexy too. So overall a really solid origins campaign for Batman with loads of fun elements and interesting tales to tell minus the usual busy work (I recommend the Cold, Cold Heart DLC also).			"

												I am an avid Batman fan and I truelly enjoyed the grittyness and raw ability that Batman dmeonstrates in this game.  In this game you play a Batman who is young and not as refined as the one we typically think of.  This allows for an experience unlike most Batman adventures where we do not see an unsure and angry Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The detective mode is extremely enhanced over the past two Batman games.  Most boss fights are challenging and enjoyable.  The overall story is compeling and feels like a batman movie.  Lots of gadgets, some detective work, and tons of action. Overall a very enjoyable expansion to the franchise.  I rate this game 9/10.  In the end, ask yourself if you want to be batman fighting against some of his greatest foes and some lesser known villians, than this game is definitely for you.			"

												The Batman: Arkham series has swiftly become one of my favourite franchises. This one is developed by a different studio and suffers from some bugs, story issues and general feel of ""same-iness"" but it's still an enjoyable experience.It's in the vain of a 3D ""Metroidvania"": You explore a vast world, getting upgrades that allow you to reach previously inaccessible areas. Traversing through that world you encounter countless thugs that you beat up in a very satisfying free-flow combat experience, or take them out one by one using stealth, in the ""predator""-style encounters. It all feels very Batman.Play Arkham Asylum and/or City first as they are better games, but this one is still really good so you should give it a try afterwards.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games.  Only 2 years into being Batman and helping out in Gotham, Batman has his toughest night yet since this Christmas Eve the villian Black Mask has put a bounty of 50 million dollars on his head and 8 deadly assassins are in Gotham looking to score.The game looks really great and runs well even on my older laptop with an Nvidia GeForce 310 512MB card.  Occasionally has some small bugs like batman gliding through the air and flopping up and down constantly, or even more infamous, quick time events where the buttons don't register (If you can, use a controller).  Combat is the same as the other Batman games.  Very quick and fluid combos against large groups of enemies, or Predator set pieces where you pick off enemies one by one in sneaky fashion.The story is much more fleshed out than the previous games as well. Without giving too many spoilers, It shows how Batman's relationship evolved with the police and Liutenant Gordon, why so many villains want him dead and how he earned his reputation in Gotham as a hero.If you liked the previous Batman games and want more, you will definitely like this game.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an interesting beast, given the two excellent games that precede it. While some may cite the recycled environment from City (with the addition of South Gotham) and items (with the addition of the Shock Gloves and Remote Claw) as reasons why this game should be skipped, looking at the full package, this game is worth playing. It boasts a compelling story as a rougher, younger Batman confronts a number of assassins who attempt to kill him on Christmas Eve, some of whom have never been featured in the ""Arkhamverse"" before. He also must deal with Black Mask, and more importantly, a sadistic, psychopathic criminal known only as ""The Joker."" This ""forging of key relationships"" that the game sells itself on is consistent throughout the game's narrative, helped by some excellent CGI cutscenes and voice acting from Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker. There are some bugs that might hinder one's playthrough, and the number of collectibles do have the tendency to make the side quests drag on, but Origins remains a solid game hampered by relatively minor problems. These problems don't prevent the best moments of the story from feeling like an unhinged, flaming roller coaster ride.			"

												This current entry in the Batman/Arkham series is a lot of the same for fans of the previous titles -- as Batman, you explore a large segment of Gotham, dealing with a multitude of villians and optional objectives during a particularly heated Christmas Eve, setting some groundwork and backstory for the previous Arkham titles and the upcoming Arkham Knight.The game flow follows a somewhat rigid structure of exploring the city freely for bonuses that earn you some unlockable abilities, as well as data and viewable charater models, while the main objectives require you to go into large interior areas and set peices and finishing up with a unique boss battle. I would say that for some fans fatigued with the series this could be considered a negative, but the story is well-written and paced, set during a time where Batman is still getting into his role and is considered inexperienced. That said, the voice acting is superb, and the game holds together well on its presentation.Combat is also copied verbatim from the other Arkham titles. It is a very fluid system that rewards the player for fighting large groups of enemies without getting hit and most importantly, not breaking the literal flow of combat by stopping for any reason. This one has some tougher enemies than in the other games, requiring more combinations of evasion and disarming to manage the enemies, which I assume is also trying to push the point of a Rookie Batman and making sure experienced players still stay on their toes.For the very experienced and people demanding a challenge, the game offers a permadeath mode called ""I Am the Night"" which adds a much greater layer of tension, and I'm happy to see it offered up.It looks like the game had gotten some heat when it was initially released due to some bugs and glitches, but in its state as of posting, I only had one isolated instance of a massive framerate drop in the Batcave that resolved itself after about thirty seconds that I believe may have been on my end. All in all, I'd say this game is a very worthy purchase for a fan of the Arkham series or people interested in jumping into the Arkham series.			"

												It's a bad copy of Arkham city. The story is great, the characters are pretty good, though you don't see them that much. Combat seems harder, while Arhkam city was balanced. Filled with bugs, even after a huge patch. Bosses are really boring and annoying, basically all you do is repeat a sequence on how to hurt them, and dodge their attacks. A bonus is that they integrated achievements into the game, so you have a reason to get them. The map is a bit big, and the interiors maps aren't fun. The riddler challanges are awful. Most of them are just one gadget away from taking a collectable. The reward for finishing them was decent, but not as rewarding as in City.The online game is fun and original. It made this game as a whole, less bad for me. On the other hand, it has no real balance. Experienced players smash newer ones. Also, when super villians come out (part of the game), the game becomes super hard. Also filled with way too much bugs, connection drop outs which just has to get on your nerves.I can't say it's all bad, I did enjoy the story, and some aspect of the game. It's worth a play, at least for the story, but not remotely close to the last game.Some of the worst programming ever.

												New comers, WB Montreal take the well respected and loved Arkham Universe and give it an Origins story in, Batman: Arkham Origins. Knowing the weight they carried, the developers kept everything the fans loved from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and added to it. This payed off in the game play element but yet lacked in the environment. With the same beautiful feel of the Arkham games there was an unfortunate emptiness. As enjoyable as the Origins has been, it stands out as the weakest of the three games. Recommended none the less, and a big thumbs up!!			"

												Overall the game is very very good the combat has depth and is not too complex, maling it really feeling like one of the only games that feels like it can stand on combat alone if needed but with the platfroming/ puzzle solving mechanics that give it a balance of fun that I feel that only this and the orgional price of persia series has accomplished in the 3d relm. The story is engaging and gritty while keeping the plot simple and is meant to give of a feeling of determination to stop what is going on rather than putting 50 plot twists in or going down so deep in Batman lore that you have to read years worth of Batman comics or stop the game to search in wikipedia to understand (thats is not saying there will be no charcters that people will not know before getting into the game but rather the game does a very good job explaining who they are through both the cut scenes and gameplay styles and areas that you interact with them in). Thank being said I think there is two things holding the game back. The main one is that the city in the single player just feels so....... empty you end feeling like your saving a city with nobody in it. Now, the games excuse is that everyone is staying in their homes due to a huge storm, but in reality there are still some people out and about even in snow storms (now saying that is smart or not, that is a different subject) so could had a least a couple of people out and about in the streets, something like saving a woman when those sudden crime reports come up? Even a few npcs would make it feel that your in a living city and not an apocalytic one. (and for any of those that will say that the world is more for collecting, the orgional Crackdown was a collect-a-thon in almost the same exact way and still managed to create a livelier city than this AND was released in 2007) the other promlem is that the multiplayer is boring, which I know is a very common complaint and is really not the reason people buy this game but it still dosen't change the fact that it could be done better than a generic thrid person shooter with batman combat, what makes it frustrating is that all it need to be good was a endless oneline mode with friends similar to the single player challenges or some online co-op.  Don't let the negatives deter you though this game is good just could have been better if Wb interactive wasn't trying to release a new game every year  like it is the combat version of call of duty which I am very afraid that it is becoming like that with the new game announced for this year.

												Arkham Origins - I love the Batman Games, but this game attracted me more than Arkham City and Asylum. I loved playing the story and the game's side missions. The story adds better boss fights (use of stealth this time in some bosses) and fun missions such as predator missions. The side missions have you foiling the plans of Edward Enigma, Bird, Penguin and other Batman villains. This time around Batman had multiplayer, which is a really good feature that I feel didn't get enough attention. This multiplayer has 2 players playing as hereos - Batman and Robin (With heaps of skins from your favourite Batman comics) and 6 other players split between either Bane or Joker thugs. These characters have firearms, traps, grenades and many other weaponry to take down the stealthy hunter (the hereos), these character are customisable aswell, changing their outfit, archytypes and accessories. I have heaps of fun playing with my friends online and think any player should expierence this. So please, do yourself a favour, and buy this game :)			"

												I loved this game, as I loved the previous two. Everyone seems to complain about bugs and glitches but I completed the game without encountering more than 2. The two which did come up cleared by itself within 10 seconds. The story in my opinion is the best out of the series because unlike the previous ones which seemed to almost be like a montage of Batman Adventures, this one shows Batman going through some growth. It feels more like a movie because the main character does not stay static like the previous ones. I love the new voice actors and it's a great re assurance that we will still have Batman and Joker in the future since Konroy and Hamill seem to be retiring soon. The boss fights are quite good, I really don't get what everyone is saying. Although the mechanics are pretty much the same as City's it feels just as satisying to clear a room as it always had. If it ain't broke don't fix it. The cutscenes are amazing and the soundtrack complements them better than City did. Graphics of course have been improved and the added part of Gotham is great to see since it contrasts the Old Gotham so much.TL;DR, Judge this game for yourself and not join the circle jerk of ""omg so many bugs"" because there really aren't that many.

This payed off in the game play element but yet lacked in the environment. With the same beautiful feel of the Arkham games there was an unfortunate emptiness. As enjoyable as the Origins has been, it stands out as the weakest of the three games. Recommended none the less, and a big thumbs up!!			"

												This game is actually good if you haven't played the precedent games...but in fact the action is repetitive, nothing special new. I love Batman but Arkham City and Arkham Ayslum are more good and also more cheap. Better buy them if you don't played them yet, if you did  wait for Arkham Knight.			"

												This is a good game, yes, but it lacks a certain something that the Rocksteady-made Arkham games have. The city feels far less memorable than Arkham City, and that bridge will never not be a pain. Furthermore, I've encountered more glitches in this game -- no game-erasing ones thankfully -- than both Asylum and City, the latter of which I also played at launch.Looks good, true. Plays decently, though combat has been changed -- there seems to be a tighter window for countering, for example. It's not a terrible game, as I said. But I'm not inclined to play it again and get all of the Enigma datapacks, not like how I went and replayed Asylum recently. Recommended, but not as strongly as the other two Arkham games.			"

												A lot of reviewers didn't like this game and I actually disagree with them because I enjoyed this game a lot. Yes, they used the Arkham city from the last game but it was the city after all. They massively improved a game I really enjoyed and that made it better. The map was better, the enemies were way more unique and the story was really good. It did a good job starting out batman and introducing elements that would eventually carry over to asylum. My only critique is that it was very unfortunate they couldn't get Mark Hamill to voice the joker... I mean, they had a good story for starting joker out but without the right voice, it just didn't work. I'm sorry, but Mark Hamill is the living embodyment of Joker. Without him, the joker seems flat, unsadistic and kinda sad. Putting that aside, I loved this game and had tons of fun and I'd even say its better then Arkham city. City was enclosed, only had a few areas, and the side quests were uninteresting compared to this game. I can't wait for the next installment though I'll be sad to see such an amazing series come to a close.			"

												Ever since the release of Arkham Asylum, I have been a diehard Batman video game fan. I had doubts for Asylum that were quickly disproven and from that point, I went to the midnight release of Arkham City. That being said, as soon as I saw that WB Montreal was developing a prequel game, I began to worry. Now, some of those worries were founded, others not so much.Arkham Origins is a mixed bag. It brings both good and bad things to the Arkham franchise. I'll start with the negatives.Deja-vu. You'll play this game wondering what is different about it than Arkham City. You have almost the same gadgets, combat upgrades, grappel abilities, etc. It's not bad; it's just really familiar. Mission types are similar, if not the same, and a good portion of the map is the Arkham City map covered in snow. Granted it's in greater detail with a graphical overhaul, but it's the same map. The good: Story. It's not as good as Arkham City's story with all the twists and great care and attention that were given it, but it's decent. It introduces many of Batman's familiar villains in a plotline that isn't disappointing. That's something that isn't easy to pull off.  The voice acting is good, with Troy Baker stealing the show with an excellent Joker presentation. (especially considering that he isn't Mark Hammill) The graphics can be excellent, but can also disappoint. Some areas have great details and effects, but even those aren't jaw-dropping. I run this on a 1GB GTX 650ti and get around 45FPS average, which is decent for the settings I run it at. The sound editing could use some work, as it was difficult to hear voices over SFX sometimes, even after altering the levels. I haven't tried multiplayer much yet, to be honest I probably won't do it at all. I didn't buy this game for the multiplayer and I'd be surprised if anyone did. The single player doesn't disappoint, but it really doesn't exceed any expectations either. It's a good entry in the series, but it's not as excellent as we've come to expect from an Arkham title. If you're a fan, it's worth getting, but you may want to wait for a sale to purchase this game.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to the Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games.  Only 2 years into being Batman and helping out in Gotham, Batman has his toughest night yet since this Christmas Eve the villian Black Mask has put a bounty of 50 million dollars on his head and 8 deadly assassins are in Gotham looking to score.The game looks really great and runs well even on my older laptop with an Nvidia GeForce 310 512MB card.  Occasionally has some small bugs like batman gliding through the air and flopping up and down constantly, or even more infamous, quick time events where the buttons don't register (If you can, use a controller).  Combat is the same as the other Batman games.  Very quick and fluid combos against large groups of enemies, or Predator set pieces where you pick off enemies one by one in sneaky fashion.The story is much more fleshed out than the previous games as well. Without giving too many spoilers, It shows how Batman's relationship evolved with the police and Liutenant Gordon, why so many villains want him dead and how he earned his reputation in Gotham as a hero.If you liked the previous Batman games and want more, you will definitely like this game.

												The Batman: Arkham series has swiftly become one of my favourite franchises. This one is developed by a different studio and suffers from some bugs, story issues and general feel of ""same-iness"" but it's still an enjoyable experience.It's in the vain of a 3D ""Metroidvania"": You explore a vast world, getting upgrades that allow you to reach previously inaccessible areas. Traversing through that world you encounter countless thugs that you beat up in a very satisfying free-flow combat experience, or take them out one by one using stealth, in the ""predator""-style encounters. It all feels very Batman.Play Arkham Asylum and/or City first as they are better games, but this one is still really good so you should give it a try afterwards.			"

												Even though it says I've only played this game for five hours, I mostly played this game offline and have completed the campaign. I must say that although the game is great, it is no match to what Arkham City had. The story was great, loved the part with the refrences to the Killing Joke and Joker's origin. However, what really began to tick me off was the combat, it was much slower and not as fluid. I found myself having the slow down, which is not a good thing when facing fifteen people at once. The only way I could take down some of the later battles were the shock gloves, which were way too overpowered in my opinion. The younger Bruce Wayne does actually feel younger, he seems more arrogant and less experienced, and I loved having Alfred talk to me rather than Oracle for a change. This is not just Batman's story though, it is also a story about the Joker, whom I found intriguing. The new voice actors suprisingly fit well, but nobody can beat Kevin Conroy. Gotham City seems really like a cut and paste Arkahm City, but it has some new tricks up its sleeve. Overall, even though this game is probably the weakest in the series, it's really well done. I'm suprised it was good, as it was not Rocksteady who made this game, but WB Montreal. 8.4/10			"

												I wish, I wish, I *wish* that this game were better.  It's good in the same way all the Arkham games are good, but there is so much wasted potential.  Not least of which: if this is an origin story, why is Batman all kitted out in crazy body armor and fighting with just as many gadgets and just as effectively in the other Arkham games.However, the gameplay is still pretty tight, and it's still fun.  Just ... not worth full price, like Asylum and City were.Having finished it, though, I do have to say props on the story - I actually think this might be the strongest story of the Arkham games.			"

												While not as good as the other Arkham games, it is still a great game. The story is interesting, and the dialogue is well written. It is very straight to the point, and the story makes it clear that this game is all about the boss fights, and in that regard, it doesn't dissapoint. The boss fights are varied, and very fun. From the hand-to-hand fight with Deathstroke, demanding split second timing and reflexes, to the surreal brawl with Copperhead, and the tactical stealth ancounter with Deadshot, this game will keep you busy with each passing boss fight.Sadly, I can not say the same for the side missions. It is the same thing we've been doing since Asylum. Scan this, collect that, go there. Not much variety at all. It doesn't help that you're doing this on the same map as Arkham City. Sure, they have added new areas, but it doesn't offer much in terms of variety. It is hard to know your way around the map, when everything looks the same. They say in the game that you have to go to the industrial district, but the entire city looks like an industrial district! In fact, like Arkham City, the entire city looks like a war zone in an industrial district. It makes sence in City, being a cut off part of the city for prisoners, but in Origins, that is not the case. Things are on fire, the bridge is covered with piles of crates, broken cars and criminal activity. And navigating it has gotten harder. I swear they have reduced the amount of grapple points in the city. Even in places where there is no logical reason why I wouldn't be able to grapple, I can't. It gets very frustrating. And there are fewer things you can climb up on. Sometimes you can clumb up on objects that are, maybe, 3 and a half meters tall. At other times, you can't even climb up on something waste high.Then there's the gadgets. You won't find much in terms of variety here either. Most of the gadgets are just altered versions of the old ones, or the exact same ones. But they do the job. If I have one major criticism of the gadgets, it is one that applies for all of the Arkham games. The gadgets are a bit far fetched. They feel out of place. It feels like they belong in a sci-fi game. They explosive gel has no reason to be a gel. In the comics and other media, Batman frequently carries explosive charges. Why does it have to be gel here? It feels a bit contrived. And why does he have to spray it in the shape of a bat symbol? Wouldn't that just take more time? And the disruptor looks like some sort of plasma rifle. I don't mind what the gadgets do, I just think they look a bit to futuristic. But that is just preference on my part.All in all, I think it is a really good game. Its charm doesn't lie in its open world, or the side activities. It lies in the boss fights,, the the different levels and the characters. If that is what you're looking for, then I wholeheartedly recommend Arkham Origins. But if you are looking for a great open world game, with a lot of things to do, I recommend waiting for Arkham Knight, or pick up Arkham city which, while not very good at side activities either, does at least offer more grapple points, and climbable ledges, making the city easier, and more enjoyable to navigate.

												Pros: Take the reviews of this game with a grain of salt in the most. Its a classic addition to the Arkham series. I especially enjoyed this one due to the boss fights, each one of them had a very unique feel in which games today are lacked of. I enjoyed that the developers also took their time with this PC edition and it ran beautifully with my EVGA 780. the story was solid, gameplay was fun, and the entire experience was never dull. Not to forget all of the side activities in this game. (i never touched the multiplayer as i do not play batman games for multiplayer.)Cons: it was lack of anything really new. outside of the story and bosses everything had a ""been there done that"" type of experience. that knocked it down from being the best one. imo AA still holds the crown.

												Not quite the flawless masterpiece that Arkham City was, but still a very strong installment none the less.If WB did anything wrong; their crime is resting on Rocksteadys mechanics and calling it a night. That however, does not make it a bad game, far from it.Everything is here you'd expect in an Arkham game: Great story, great graphics and pc compatibility, great combat, interesting characters, the lot; and of course Batman!If you somehow missed playing the other two masterpieces, I'd offer this up as the first installment you play. It's chronologically the first one. With Batman being relitively green at this point. And the Joker completely unaware of his existance up until the story unfolds.Final score: Great game, just a little samey: 8/10 "

The story pits a fairly new Batman, with only a couple of years of crusading under his belt, against some of his most powerful adversaries, many of whom he will encounter for the first time. This game features a gripping story line, amazing graphics, and the revolutionary combat interface that makes this series a must have. I own this game on WiiU and PC, and I am happier with the PC version. The WiiU version had a number of glitches and problems that made it difficult to play at certain points of the story. The game is fantastic on either platform, however, and I would certainly recommend it for WiiU owners.The absence of the voice talents of Mark Hamill (Joker) and Kevin Conroy (Batman) may have diminished this title, but only slightly.  Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker fill in for the roles respectively, and do a very nice job. I will always prefer the former couple, but the latter don't spoil the fun. I can't help but believe that this change, as well as the fact that Rocksteady didn't develop the game, is what earned this game a generally lower score from most critics. Personally I find the tighter battle elements that were introduced, particularly in some of the boss fights, has only pushed the series forward. The boss battles are varied and engaging, and the I Am The Night mode gives the title enormous replay value. There is also an online mode for PC which allows the player to conrol either a hero or a villain's cronie in a fight for control of a map. 10/10			"

I don't know why most aren't people satisfied with this game because i sure as hell am.Single playerThis game has a good story, a slightly similar combat system of arkham city with a few new added gadgets , new enemy types, and about 9 villains you get to face off and fight. Unlike arkham knight boss battles, this installment brings back the feeling of what its like to fight actual bosses who could kill you if your not too careful for example bane, deathstroke, cooperhead and others.MultiplayerThe multiplayer in this game is also good. There are 3 teams Jokers gang, Bane's gang and batman and robin .You get to play as one of the elite henchmen who work for either the joker or bane and you get to play as batman and robin, sort of like a predator/prey system where about 6 players are henchmen(prey) and 2 players are batman and robin(hunter). I like how the mutiplayer gives you the opportunity to play as henchman and get to experience their perspective of being stalked by batman, you maybe thinking how hard can it be to spot a man in bat costume or even be scared of him but trust me after playing as a henchmen you will FEAR THE KNIGHT.The drawback to multiplayer is that its really hard to find a match when there aren't many online players, each matchmaking session takes about 10-15 minutes which is abit frustrating and things get even worse when a game starts with people who are either afk or disconnected during the match since there is no vote to kick feature and players can't join during multiplayer sessions. This game may not be as good as arkham city but its still worth buying and playing. I recommend buying when its on offer like i did, then you won't regret your decision if you dont like it.			"

												An absolutely amazing game, building on the success of the previous installments, this game brings everything to the table. The story basically picks up after the Batman: Year One graphic novel, faithfully keeping the characters within ""canon"" boundaries and building upon their personalities with excellent voice acting, extremely articulated facial programming. The story is worthy of the Batman title, and the action is a step above the previous two games. The gadgets have been revamped slightly, and the ""Dark Knight"" challenges make you feel like the Bat yourself as you complete them. The visuals are drop-dead gorgeous and the art direction was well thought out. This extended and restored version of Gotham City is beautiful and keeps you exploring for hours and hours on end. With so much content, the replayability and longevity of life that this game has it tremendous. Sure the game launched with a few glitches, but they were promptly corrected by WBMontreal, and we now have a perfect game.			"

												I've enjoyed this game for the story and the fact it's Batman and the assorted characters from the Rogue Gallery.  The graphics are OK, but the game is glitchy where I've got stuck inside walls etc a few times.  Sometimes different goons get stuck in a frozen akimbo position on the street while a fight is going - very odd.  Comabt is a bit chunky and does not feel very smooth. I play with mouse and keyboard, and perhaps it makes a difference using a gamepad, but I could not play comfortably using my Logitech F310.Side-missions get a bit repetitive like looking for all the Riddler's hidden data packs.The game doesn't seem as good as the first two Arkham games, possible due to being released by a different developer.I don't recommend purchasing this game if you haven't played the other two first.  I do recommend purchasing it if you are a fan of Batman, have played the previous two games, and want to experience the story.  Overall, I would give it 3 stars out of 5.			"

												If you are a Batman fan , you must play it. If you are just looking for a great action game, play Arkham Asylum or City instead. The only problem with Origins is, it's not new, it's just a copy and gamers should look at it as an expensive DLC to the Arkham series.			"

												To be fair to Arkham Orgins you will have to forget about how amazing Asylum and City were. Orgins is a great game. Not a breath taking one by any means but its a fantastic look at that part of gotham before the Events of the orginals. Tho the game doesnt really come up with its own new ideas it is still a fresh and young look at the story. Unlike the other two games that follow to a more adult version of the 90's animated series Orgins fills much more like you are playing one of the Tim Burten flicks. Its christmas time and everything. So if you liked City and Asylum you will enjoy Orgins.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins should be for Batman fans only.  If you are looking for a revolutionary game that takes the franchise a step forward, then move along.  The mechanics are the same, there are little to no new gadgets and the city is lifeless (much like Arkham City).However, Batman fans will enjoy the story immensly.  It isn't anything new, but it is still compelling.  One critique: Please stop using the Joker/Bane combo.  There are so many other worthwile villains to base a story around.  Also, Riddler isn't a complete idiot anymore (post Batman: Forever) so stop making him one.  Fans of the ""Cold, Cold Heart"" DLC should watch ""Heart of Ice"" from Batman: The Animated Series.  Definately one of the best stories ever told in the Batman Universe.View it here, definately worth the $2[www.amazon.com] "

												Batman: Arkham Origins is an odd one. While the gameplay itself has been tightened up, for example the combat flows a lot better and enemies are generally more aggressive than they were during previous games, the innovation is seriously lacking.The collectibles are uninspired compared to the original riddles and the main story is just downright dire, with the assassins that are supposedly after you falling more into sidequests than anything else. The copy/paste assets of Arkham City doesn't do the game any favours either, as it feels more like an expansion than anything.Graphically the game looks great and there are a few nice touches here and there such as PhysX enabled snow and it has been optimised to hell and back so it runs fantastically (game breaking bugs aside), but it still doesn't look as good as Arkham City does.It's a good game if you are a fan of the series, but I would hold off and get it a little cheaper unless you really have to have it.

												The game is a prequel to Arkham Asylum in order to get you going with the events that follow. It's classic beat the hell out of everyone in your path game, as intended. Super villains and lots of punching as the comics! The only drawback for me was the weird controls of the map where you can't use the mouse to pin point a location and becomes frustrating trying to do it with the keyboard after a while.

												When I heard about this game being developed by a different company, I thought it would be a refreshing experience. I am not opposed to change, if that change is good. But then, when I played it, I immediately realized that I was wrong. This game is not a change. Let me explain why:• In terms of gameplay, Arkham Origins is identical to Arkham City. It even has the same map. The environments are different, but that difference is merely superficial. The devs made the easiest decision: don't innovate, just recycle. Even the gadgets are the same. Most of them we've already seen before, and the ""new"" ones are just different versions of the same thing (remote claw=line launcher, though the claw is a bit of an improved version; glue grenade=freeze cluster). The shock gloves are a very nice addition though, but because of its usefulness, every fight after you get them is a joke. Except boss fights of course, in which you will be screaming to your monitor the word ""bull****"" several times.• In terms of story telling, it follows their predecessors with extreme accuracy. The story itself is different, of course. It includes several villains that weren't present in previous installments, but it also includes several that were, and without the need to do so. But there are no plot holes, and the story shapes out well as a prequel to Arkham Asylum. I recommend staying through the credits (despite the fact that credits are extremely long).• In the graphical aspect, don't even get me started on the bugs. Man this game is buggy as hell, considering it's been released some time ago. Consider yourself extremely lucky if you get past your first boss fight without issues. And pray that enemies don't get stuck behind walls forcing you to start a fight all over again, and this applies to boss fights as well. I wouldn't say this feels like a beta, but it's certainly close. When it's not bugging out, it's the same as Arkham City. Don't expect anything new here.It has its epic moments, don't get me wrong, but it all feels the same to Arkham City, and that's where the game fails: originality. Still, I would recommend any fan of the franchise to get this game, but only when it's on sale, it's not worth the full price.Final score: 3.25/5			"

												Mechanically, this game boasts a lot of improvements from Arkham City. The fighting feels smoother and a little more challenging. Better use is made of your detective skills this time around, as piecing together the crime actually segways into larger plot elements. I also found the scavenger-hunt style skill upgrades engaging too. The problem is, that this game falls back on the previous games far too much for its plot points. The adventure  starts with a rogue's gallery of more obscure Batman's Nemisises (Nemesisi? Nemisiss? is this even a word?) but eventually circles back to all of the same antagonists the previous games used. The story isn't bad exactly, just sort of boring.Still, it's a pretty solid game, it just plays things a little too safe for its own good.			"

												I enjoyed the game, but there were some issues with the port. There are no mouse settings to change in-game, the default layout for keybindings show a controller first and you have to click another button to find the keyboard, and you can't navigate the map with a mouse. The mouse settings can be changed in a notepad file so it's not that big of a deal. Not being able to control the map with a mouse is irritating as all hell though and is one of my biggest gripes about the game. Not that big of a deal, but constantly irritating.Now, on to the good. The combat is just like Asylum and City, but with some changes such as the upgrade paths and some of the upgrades. There are actually more ways to counter all those things that were uncounterable in the last game so fighting is now more fluid. The absolute biggest improvement over the last games were the cinematics; they were god damn awesome.  The rest of the game was pretty much the same as the last games, but with a new story.I didn't play the multiplayer and don't much care to. I bought this game for the single player campaign and the multiplayer is pretty much a quick gimmick you play and then leave.			"

												It has the same graphics and setting as the Arkham City title but it feels a lot more lacking. Combat is rather dull and neverending as ""interesting"" means a lot of enemies. The story feels a bit lacking too and conflicting in logic. I really miss the great cinematics from Arkham City and the characters. I could not make much sense of the upgrade system or what's worth or not getting. There is no proprer learning curve as you litteraly get dropped in the city where the main activity is fighting groups of various size of enemies. I didn't really get to be drawn in the game and play a lot of time because it just feels empty, of mechanics, of story, of characters... I believe they are just trying to milk the franchise some more on less bucks invested in the game.			"

												I have mixed feelings. And this review, admittedly is subjective. I'm playing on normal.....and its...Hard. Very hard. It seems like you get out of one boss fight, and there's another waiting right around the corner.I'm playing on normal and I'm dinding it really tough.....and I'm not that far into the game (Ive played it on console)I like it. But, the endless ,really hard fights, right off the bat, isn't going to be good for everyone.I have to admit. It's annoying. VERY anooying. Arkham city is tough. But, this game amps up the diffuculty to a whole new level. I'm giving this one a 3 out of 5. The experience I've had is there's never a chance for a break.....to just have fun. Honestly, I don't see how you could play this on keyboard either. I'm all about the Batman games. But this one is meh compared to Arkham city and Arkham Asylum. It's just tooo damn hard. And since that's subjective. Take it it any way you want. Maybe I just suck at this game, I can accept that. I beat the other two, never got bored. This one is exasperating....maybe too much running around, a ridiculously long bridge.....that I effin hate.....wanting to be several games in one....I don't know. I just don't love itI'm still going to reccomend it though. It IS Batman after all			"

												*NB: Some minor spoilers in this review* I came to this game late in the day. I love Batman, but having been burned by game breaking glitches in both Asylum and City, I refused to pay top dollar for Origins. especially at launch. Add that to no Conroy and no Hamill, and I had real concerns about how Origins would stack up. So I waited, and eventually it went on sale. Well, I was partly right. Troy Baker is no Hamill as the Joker. He puts in a valiant effort, amd he should be applauded, but he is in the master's shadow. Otherwise, though, Origins is superb, perhaps even the best in the series. The combat is the most enjoyable of the games so far, and the villains - most of whom it is fair to say are in the Batman B cast  - are actually very engaging. The writing is also top notch, the highlight for me being when Joker's rhapsodizes the bat at the same time as seducing Doctor Quinzel. It's also fun to play Batman as he finding his feet. Detective vision takes on a more literal meaning for the 'world's greatest detective', actually used to solve some mysteries, as opposed to finding out where the nearest grapple point or wall to explode is (though you still use it for that). So, it's great. If you love the series, or enjoy seeing Batman done well, you should enjoy this.Edit: Some people have said this game has issues with Mouse and Keyboard controls. I used a controller, and had none.			"

												While its debatable where this ranks in the series of Arkham games, one thing's for sure...we're going to have a lot more Batman. At first I was opposed to WB throwing together a new studio to create filler Arkham games while Rocksteady tooled away on their next creation, but you know what? I don't mind so much anymore. Arkham Origins might not be the most polished title but it certainly is just as fun as the previous two installments. You have the same great gameplay you're used two, new villains from the DC universe, and some more backstory to our brooding hero (and villains). The multiplayer is flawed but I like that they took the risk of building something out because it's open for improvement (for future iterations). I'm looking forward to the Mr. Freeze DLC and hopeful (fingers crossed) that the time taken to create this new content will be worth the wait.My biggest gripe that doesn't spoil any sort of story aspect of the game are the costumes. Costumes that you can purchase or unlock but can't equip in the campaign until you've played through the game at least ONCE. That's a big gamble for WB to assume that we as gamers and consumers have the patience to play this again. Yes you can change your costume on the Challenge maps but not all of want to play that mode. If there was a cheat in the main menu (like Arkham City) that allowed to temporarily unlock costume play for that play session, I think everything would be fine (who knows, maybe this is in the pipeline).Minus my complaint about the costumes, I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit. Having had some time to think about it post completion; I'd give this a solid 7.5 with room to improve with the new DLC.			"

												According to my opinion the other two games of the Batman Arkham franchise were so far better than this except in graphics (does it matter?). TBH this game was not the kind of game that I hoped would be the next installment after Arkham City. Though it is supposed to be a prequel to Arkham Asylum they could have made the game somewhat better than the previous ones. Huge amount of bugs and frequent huge updates for them is kind of hard to deal with when playing this game. I played this simply beacuse I wanted to complete the Batman Arkham Franchise so far. So if you are a Batman fan go for it otherwise think twice before buying it. Hope the next one will be great since Rocksteady does it.			"

												Arkham Origins - I love the Batman Games, but this game attracted me more than Arkham City and Asylum. I loved playing the story and the game's side missions. The story adds better boss fights (use of stealth this time in some bosses) and fun missions such as predator missions. The side missions have you foiling the plans of Edward Enigma, Bird, Penguin and other Batman villains. This time around Batman had multiplayer, which is a really good feature that I feel didn't get enough attention. This multiplayer has 2 players playing as hereos - Batman and Robin (With heaps of skins from your favourite Batman comics) and 6 other players split between either Bane or Joker thugs. These characters have firearms, traps, grenades and many other weaponry to take down the stealthy hunter (the hereos), these character are customisable aswell, changing their outfit, archytypes and accessories. I have heaps of fun playing with my friends online and think any player should expierence this. So please, do yourself a favour, and buy this game :)			"

												A decent follow-up to the Arkham series, with the trademark combat that we all know and love from the Arkham series. Though it pales in comparison when compared with its predecessors, it was still an enjoyable experience to play. Authough it was developed by Warner Bros. Montreal and not by Rocksteady, who had developed the previous Arkam games, the still got many things right. First of all, the story was captivating. I won't spoil too much, but it was pretty enjoyable. Secondly, the voice work for this game was amazing. Though I would always prefer the classic portrayal of Batman and Joker by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill respectively, Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker deliver an exceptional performance. Still, this game has its own fair share of cons. The world felt bleak and without much character, unlike Arkham city, where each segment of the world reflected of the personality of whichever mob was controlling it. Secondly, authough Warner Bros. Montreal tried new and innovative things, afew of them fell short, such as Electricutioner's gloves, which were too overpowered.Overall, I would give this game a 7.8 out of 10.Good game, but many flaws.

												I actually don't like Batman or most super-hero stories or comics; so it was really stupid of me to think that I would like this game for some reason.  To be fair, the game has good reviews from gamers and game publications alike, but if you simply don't like batman like me I don't think you will be able to cut past that.			"

												Not sure why some people find this game so offensive. It's quite good! You play as Batman (doi!) and this takes place in the early days. Batman's a little younger, a little stubborn, and yet still has all those magnificent toys.You're in an area that's roughly twice the size of Arkham City. Though you clearly cover the same area that was eventually blocked off to create Arkham City but before it was all crappy. Plus another section of Gotham. Origins also impliments a much needed fast-travel system.You'll see some fun Batman enemies like Penguin, Killer Croc, Black Mask, Bane, and a stable of other villians from the Rogue Gallery. Some you've never seen in an Arkham game prior to Origins. I've heard some people complain about the boss battles, but I had a lot of fun with them.People also complain about glitches. Perhaps this was an issue when the game released, but as of today (1/27/15) it seems to be fine. Only a couple that I noticed, and they were NOT game breaking. Such as a defeated thug clipping through the floor, and some minor animation sync problems. Otherwise I had no issues.In the end: Fan of Batman? Get it. Fan of Arkham games? Get it. Never played an Arkham game? Start with Arkham Asylum, then Arkham City, then get it. Hate Batman and/or Arkham games? What are you, some kind of joker!?8.5/10 - Will play again, will continue to try and 100% it, will BATMAN!			"

If you have played any of the other Batman Games this is as good or even better then those. The Story behind this game is awesome and the side quests fit right in with the main story, they somtimes don't even feel like side quest. Simple amazing, and this is only the single player I have not touched the mutiplayer.			"

												Arkham City sits at one of my most favorite games of recent years, it was perfectly made and well paced. How exactly could they improve it, shortly put.. They didn't. This game, after being handed over from the orginal developers, was flat out copied over. It feels generally like what I would expect in a DLC, not a full priced game. However, I do recommend this game fully. Just not at full price. I preordered this not expecting much, but what I did get was a dose of strong story telling and character development and is definitely worth playing if you can make it past the thirty year old man child that is our immature protagonist. - The map is now larger, covering portions of soon to be Arkham City and New Gotham, albeit empty due to a cop out excuses of curfew. Even with this larger area, the game feels intolerably lonely and devoid of creativity that was present in the previous titles. + The music is more fitted to the Christmas themed enviroment, my favorite being The Joker's Theme. Which is allowing of an eerie but calming feel.- The Boss battles fall flat, being a series of button mashes and repetition. Except Deadshot, it took me forever to beat him and I loved every single agonizing death with restart. This though does not make up for the failure which very well could have been a surpass to the fight with Mr Freeze in Arkham CIty. + A semi-detailed look into the canon background of The Joker, directly referencing The Red Hood. With a major plus of showing him as being what he is, the polar opposite of Batman.. being given no choice to do what he must because that is the way society has made him, just as Bruce has been made into what he is by the actions of others... mainly Joe Chill. + Well delivered characters especially Edward Nigma, whose appearance was more horned in than ever before, but welcomed. He made me question if what I was doing was the moral thing to do, yet Big Bad Bat Bruce seemed to ignore it, lost potential there. - Immature Brat Bat. I understand that this is supposed to be an origin story, ignoring that Bruce crowned the cowl two years before the start, but he is such a ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. He is even straight cruel to Alfred and even endangers him time after time because of his careless nature. +/- The newly added and changed features were some iffy choices.     - No Bruce, You cannot have gadgets seven years before the prototype was made.     + Crime Scenes show the true detective skills that make Batman the ""World's Greatest Detective."" (Even if they were kinda look here click, look there click.)    - Very Eh Upgrade system, feeling more like the linear choices of Arkham Asylum. I could go on for hours about this game, and no I didn't play the multiplayer and am ignoring the glitches because I didn't buy it for the multiplayer and I'm sure anyone reading this has yet to buy the game, not needing to worry about now patched glitchums. The bottom line is the game is good, but falls short of the hype and glory that Arkham City had. It's worth looking into buying to see how the story progresses, just don't look for a worthy sequel/prequel in this. If City was a strong 10/10 than this would have to be at max 6/10... Asylum 8.

												Good, but not as good as Arkham Asylum or City.If you haven't played Arkham City yet, grab that game instead. But if you enjoyed Arkham City and want more, Arkham Origins is the game for you. In many ways it's more of the same, and you may think of it as a (very large) DLC to AC since it takes place in the same city, although earlier in the storyline.The story is decent, and the glitches are not as bad as I feared from earlier reviews, so although it's not a great game, I'll still recommend it.

												As a fan of both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, I definitely recommend Origins. However, some of the drawbacks that others have mentioned - filler content, uninspired gadgets, etc. - are true. Compared to the previous installments, Origins does seem to lack in the content that doesn't directly contribute to the overall story; they're bland and don't stand out.That being said, I do feel like the main story is worth the reduced price that the game is selling at now. It's quite long (and plods somewhat in the middle), but it allows the player to get a look at a Batman that isn't the calm and collected Dark Knight which we're used to seeing.8/10			"

Yes, the fomula is pretty much the same as the other Arkham games with small additions here or there, but it's fun, addictive and well-made , so I'm not complaining. Throughout the game, I experienced zero bugs and the game only crashed once during my playthrough (whereas Arkham City crashed about 6 times).I don't think this game is ""average"" or ""okay"". I think it's a very well made game that shoudn't be overlooked.			"

												Unlike too many open world games in recent memory, Batman: Arkham games don't fall into the trap of giving you a world packed out the ears with boring menial tasks.  If you took away the world and put Batman in a room fulll of thugs, this game could still easily stand on its own.The combat encourages timing over button mashing, improvisation over spamming, and thoughtfulness over bullheadedness.  The stealth gameplay is a rare example of one that blends in so well the action rather than taking away from it.			"

												A good Arkham game. Not the best sure... But still overwhelmingly good!The backlash at this game is surely reasonable, seeing that it's done by a new developer and as such is not a Rocksteady game. But, the backlash is unjustifiable. This game is really good and a solid addition to the Arkham series. It may not be Rocksteady, and may not be too innovative. But it does innovate and does the Batman: Arkham formula right!The game's story is set on Christmas Eve when Black Mask decides to put a bounty on a very young Batman, who's still in his second year of crime fighting, which attracts the world's 8 deadliest assassins to track him down. The story is easily the best part about the game and is a very good Batman story. It does what other Arkham games dind't do, which is explore the dynamic between Batman and his allies, mainly Alfred, Barbara (AKA Batgirl) and Comissioner Gordon. The story is set 5 years before Asylum, but quite honestly, it should be 10. The characters are way, WAY younger than their Asylum counterparts and really, since Asylum depicts Tim Drake as being the current Robin, while Origins depicts Batman working alone. It just doesn't fit well... but that's a nitpick.The gameplay mechanics are pretty much the same as City. Free flow combat. Stealth gameplay. Crime scene investigations. Open world gliding and grappling. Riddler trophies. It's really similar to City, but still has some twists of its own. Some new gadgets such as the Reverse Claw and the Concussion Detonator offer some cool dynamic gameplay mechanics to both Stealth and Combat. New enemy types such as the Martial Artist are also a very welcome addition that really make combat much more interesting and less repetitive.It's easily noticeable that this isn't a Rocksteady game since the way the grappling works and the enemy AI are, really feel different... I feel like this is a nitpick, but it's just something I felt having played both other Batman games. Still, glitches and bugs were a rare occasion for me personally, yet I felt they were more than City or Asylum ever had.Multiplayer is interesting, offering a 3v3v2 scenario. Playing as a goon in Joker and Bane's gangs is acceptable. It's a very standard 3rd person shooter. Still, the feeling of having Batman or Robin on your tail really helps you understand how the goons you beat up in singleplayer feel like. Batman and Robin themselves are the same as usual, but knowing that the goons you take out are players really change the feeling of pulling off a sucessful takedown. The assymetric aspect of the multiplayer however is its downfall. Having Batman, Robin, Joker, Bane and goons all play different is not only confusing, but also frustrating since you never seem to catch a break and play with who you want.This is a Batman game however and what matters is the singleplayer. Thankfully Arkham Origins delivers a good Batman experience with some minor tweaks but innovations nonetheless. An amazing story and the solid gameplay from past Arkham games make it a very cool game. Just don't expect a Rocksteady game. Still, WB Montreal's first game is an amazing one for a first game.Buy it if you want some more Batman action before Arkham Knight. It's really good but if City was just the ammount of Batman you were craving, you can skip it without missing out on too much. But, if you haven't played the others, by all means, buy this game. It's really good!Highly recommend it.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is very similar to the last game, Arkham City which isn't a bad thing as the previous game was a masterpiece in it's own right.The story isn't as good as the previous two but it's still amazing, at times predictable but at other times surprises you with a plot twist that you didn't expect.The general plot of this game follows Batman on Christmas Eve as a bounty has been placed on his head that many major and minor villains will attempt to get from you.It should be said that this game was developed by Warner Brothers Montreal which is a different studio from the previous two and the upcoming Arkham Knight game which were all developed by Rocksteady Studios, it's because of this that I can forgive this title from not having too many changes from the last games.There is so much to do in this game even after you complete it, for example there is a most wanted side quest that allows you to try to stop criminals such as The Mad Hatter and The Penguin and bring them into custody. The Good - Good Story- Many interesting villains, even some you may not have heard of- Graphical improvements from previous game (not too much)- Fun side activities- Improved mechanics- Battle system is great with only a few problems- You can be Batman, who doesn't want a taste of that Batman lifestyle am I right? The Bad - Battle system is repetitive at times- Not many improvements from the previous games- A few glitches had to be sorted out, I never ran into many glitches like the fatal error or controlling flight issues however I did have to fix an issue with the cutscenes as mine lagged a lot; I ended up finding a guide on the steam community to help me.- Some tasks such as the collectables are still a chore in my opinion and I wish they were done more interestingly than they are in this game, for example Arkham Asylam had audio logs from the villains which were interesting to listen too and made me want to collect them.

COMPLETED 100%I got this prequel to the ever sucessful Arkham series, hoping it'd be better than what critics have made it out to be. But as it turns out, the game is more of an overall disappointment to what it could have been a signifciant improvement to Arkham City. While AC was so flawlessly free of technicalities, this game is still riddled with quite a few glitches and bugs the devs couldn't be bothered with. Nothing so game-breaking at least. Where the games shine, the combat system, AO does away by making for slightly more challenging enemies and variations. This is surely a good thing, if not for the numerous control input problems and fight inconsistencies that simply ends up screwing up the enjoyment of gameplay. Especially annoying when the game expects you to perform up to task for the stupid Dark Knight System and ranked challenge maps.Thankfully there's the very unbalanaced and overpowered Shock Gloves, to compensate for this. A new and important gadget to this game, it makes you wonder why the heck wasn't Batman using this OP weapon in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. I mean it helped  defeat Bane and save Alfred from near-death. It's so glorious, there's no reason to abandon it.  There's only one thing AO has made the biggest improvement from the past games. The main story missions are now more noticeably fun and interesting to get through, despite the silly premise which mainly serves as a subtle excuse in order to chuck a whole bunch of notable Batman villians in this one single game. It's also slightly longer and less than straightforward, compared to AC's main campaign, which is nice.. The dark cinematics and presentation are also brilliantly well done in coveying the tone of the game. If only the actual game looked as good... Boss fights are exceptionally great fun as well but makes Batman look too darn overpowered for someone just starting on an early vigilante career. The open world of Gotham is much bigger than the Arkham City in Arkham City, many similiar buildings stand out, being bigger in size, and the layout is mostly different enough to distinguish as being unique. It's also as completely unrealistic as ever, as a city completely void of civilians. Another ridiculous excuse to prevent Batman from making ""social interations"" with civilians. What a bummer.Collectibles still remain the same, data packs replacing riddler trophies this time and the number of packs hidden and are spread around the city. Finding or acquiring them isn't as hard as before, with less puzzles and challenges to solve. A show of leniency to completionists, or just a lack of effort on the devs' part in rushing this game. 3.5/5 - Game presentation is great, some areas of gameplay is an improvement, others is a thumbs down. A great game regardless, nevertheless, but nothing much so noteworhy for the upcoming Arkham Knight to follow and adapt from.			"

												GRAN JUEGO DE BATMANHabía leído y escuchado harta mala fe hacia este juego: que si no era un verdadero Arkham, que si Rocksteady no tenía nada que ver, que a nivel técnico era muy cutre, etc. Total que esperé a verlo a 45 pesitos en una venta de Steam y creo que si te gusta Batman, vale mucho mas que eso.PROs+La ambientación+Las peleas contra jefes (Deathstroke, Luciérnaga y Bane las mejores)+Los gráficos+Cold Cold Heart+La música+El doblaje (voz de Batman)CONTRAs+De repente el timing en el combate se siente chafón+El doblaje de muchas otras voces que no sean Batman está bien piñatón+Al final del juego ya desbloqueaste cosas que en AA apenas obtienes. Wut?En conclusión, el juego está muy bien hecho y aunque por alguna razón se siente diferente a otros Arkham, no es tan tedioso como (a mi parecer) Arkham City. Sin duda muy recomendable si te gusta Batman, si disfrutas de los juegos de Arkham o si simplemente buscas un buen juego de fregadazos con las 3 B.			"

												Arkham Origins is a fun addition of the ""Arkham"" franchise.  It lacks much of the polish, and some of the charm of the Rocksteady games, but has an interesting story and nicely varied boss fights that fans of the series will be able to appreciate.  They do a decent job of keeping things in line chronologically, and there are only a few noticable anachronisms that break the illusion of a story that takes place before Arkham Asylum.  Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that persist even now, and some of them are game-breaking.  However, in my playthrough of the main story, i managed to avoid every one of them (the My Alibi Bug is easily avoided).  ""Cold, Cold Heart"" (the story DLC) is the only place where I ran into game-breaking and unavoidable bugs.  That said, I was able to retain the fidelity of my save file by simply quitting after the bug had triggered (not trying to save again), and everything loaded fine.  The only thing that is still in error, is that two of the Steam Achievements have not triggered appropriately for me during ""Cold, Cold, Heart"".At the end of the day, I strongly recommend Arkham Origins for fans of the previous two Arkham games, especially if you get it cheap (A Holiday sale would be best, since the story takes place on Christmas Eve).  It's not one of the Rocksteady games, but it's a fun way to spend a bit more time in their world, especially while we wait for Arkham Knight.			"

												Let's be honest: I have been a fan to the Batman franchise exploited by Rocksteady Studios (Batman: Arkham City; Batman: Asylum). Batman: Origins is very similar to these previous titles under many respects. Good points to notice:+ the pace of the game:    ... the gameplay feels rapid, smooth and comfortable; ennemies are very different from one another and the many tactics at your hand will have to be adapted accordingly (some parts require stealth and range, while others require you to go full melee);    ... the scenario is faithful without being submissive to the original comics; events happen at a pace that favours narrative tension and suspense;+ the richness of the main story and the coherence between the main story (as developed from the main quests) and the side quests:    ...  alternance between primary and secondary quests feels natural and allows you to play with a certain degree of freedom with respect to which quests you will actually pick, and with respect to the order in which you will tackle them (that can be only good given how big the ""world"" or ""map"" is);    ... the staging of the game in that the cut-scenes and the transitions between gameplay footage and cut-scenes creates a very pleasant yet coherent experience; thus you can start figthing a boss on the rooftop of a skyscraper only to have him escape by air, so that you have track him down to the sewers of a dark, high security prison.+ the richness of the environments and details; this contributes to make you immerse into the universe of the famous D.C Comics detective;+ optimization: the game runs properly even on 3-year+ old laptops (like mine).Bad point to note:- poor debugging; but I have never come across a bug I could not overcome by reloading the last checkpoint.

Posted: June 25, 2014
												Very underrated game from the Arkham franchise. People usually complain about this title not coming from Rocksteady and constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how bad it is when in reality it's not that bad at all. The story is actually pretty good considering Warner Bros. Montreal made it and not Rocksteady. The feel of the game and the atmosphere is good because it is an open-world Batman game and fans of the series will realize the familiarity of the map to Arkham City (because it's a prequel to Asylum). The world is beautiful but feels a bit limited in the free roam after about 15+ hours of gameplay. When you glide from building to building you there's a point when you go like, ""I should be able to grapple that but I can't"". The gameplay itself is well clunky compared to the Rocksteady titles if you put enough time in it. Combos and free flow combat are smooth but later you'll feel that sort of miss that refined finish Asylum and City had. Side missions are a blast in this one as they were in Arkham City but I find myself finishing them quicker and easier than in previous games. The boss battle are the usual cape-stun battles but there are a few that stand out that are amazing (Deathstroke, Shiva, Joker, etc). Overall Arkham Origins isn't a masterpiece or a real upgrade from Arkham City, but it indeeds fulfills the roll of entertaining levels and the player feeling like a BAMF when playing Batman. Fans of the series will definitely enjoy Arkham Origins and others might.			"

												If you are looking for a game that is as revolutionary to the Batman franchise as Batman: Arkham Asylum was, then move on. In terms of gameplay, Arkham Origins doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Instead it refines a few of the issues that were present in Asylum and City (such as fighting ""brute"" enemies where you defeat them by piggyback. There is hardly any, if any at all, of that here), and brings to light an origin story that can can almost rival Frank Miller's Batman: Year One.Paralleling Miller's epic remastery of the Dark Knight's origins, Batman has his work cut out for him as not only does he have to fight the super villians and crime lords that have plagued Gotham for decades, but he also has to fight an overly corrupt Gotham City Police Department. James Gordon is only a Captain, and the way Commissioner Loeb runs things ol' Jimmy doesn't really know who he can trust. With a trigger happy SWAT Leader Branden to contest with, doing his job isn't easy either. Furthermore, we also get to see the Joker fall even farther into depravity as he questions what really is maximum fun. Before it was just the mob, politicians, and a whole lotta money, but with the Batman in the mix there is just no telling what life has in store for him! Even so, with cameos from 'B' grade and 'A' grade villians, there aren't as many easter eggs in this Batman, particularly because they really don't exist yet. Still, it leaves Gotham feeling a little empty. In particular I would liked to have seen Harvey Dent in the mix somewhere. He and Bruce/Batman were good friends before he became TwoFace, and having that ally in his origins (such as with Miller's adaptation) could have made for some interesting story development.All in all, as I said if you are looking for something revolutionary in terms of gameplay you should probably move on. But if you are looking for a damn good origin story, this is a great place to start.			"

Batman Arkham OriginsWorst Arkham game? Arguably yes. But is it a bad game? I can confidently say, NO.It's a well produced game, while it's feel more like a re-skin of Arkham City with very very small changes, but it still give a good free roam experience. The Main Story is ""meh"" for Arkham standart, but the whole package is good.PROSSolid action free-roam experience.Better city design than Arkham City.Some of the Boss Fights are super satisfyingFast travel system is great.CONSNot really an ""origins"".It just feels like Arkham city, with better graphics.Lacks of immersion compared to previous Arkham games.Side missions are shallows, just fillers to make the world feels ""full"".Easier combat than previous Arkham games (can e a pro too).Multiplayer is dead.Now, should you play this? If you're a hardcore Arkham series' fan, you can skip this one. Not much to find on this one.But if you just looking for a solid free-roam action game, I can say just try it especially on discount.It's a good game, just doesn't have enough magic like previous Arkham games has.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a sequel that presents minor new tweaks and features over its predecessors. But it manages to be a good game and a worthy sequel nevertheless thanks to the still kicking Arkham formula and few good elements on its own.Regarding the gameplay, Origins focuses mostly on direct combat encounters: the few new gadgets you will get are suited for direct confrontations and the game will throw new kinds of enemies at you, the majority of which are able to either retaliate from your attacks or be downright invincible till you'll perform the right ""trick"" to bring them down to normal. The stealth sequences, on the other hand, didn't recive any improvement or new gimmick whatsoever.That said, two of the new gadgets tend to make the late game much easyer: the electric gloves can nullify every kind of enemy defense, effectively breaking down the main appeal of the fistfights, while the remote claw can connect an enemy to an explosive object from the environment or a vantage point for an easy takedown, without any ammo limit to prevent you from clearing up entire rooms.The new expanded map features environments you already visited in Arkham City, albeit reskinned accordingly for a prequel, along with new areas of Gotham, including a long bridge that separates the two. The level design and the attention to the original sources are as polished as usual for an Arkham game.The plot is the most praised aspect of Batman: Arkham Origins, since it feels original and makes an overall good use of the various characters. As a reader of the comic books, however, I would had handled the main antagonist a little better and crafted  the various assassins and criminals into the plot better, at the cost of reducing the importance of already enstablished Batman rogues.The multiplayer mode is a novelty for the Arkham series, and is about a capture the control point kind of experience between two weapons-wielding gangs while a third team of two people, who control Batman and Robin, try to thwart them as much as possible via stealth gameplay. While controlling the elite forces of either the Joker or Bane (and sometime the bosses themselves) in a third person shooter fashion and customize them as you see fit when it comes to weapons, gadgets and gear is a new and interesting feature, Batman and Robin are so much less effective in this mode than in the main game, making playing them sometimes more an annoyance than a blast. Beside that, the multiplayer mode as a whole is a worthy addiction, all things considered.The Initiation DLC is just another challenge campaign tided up by some unique cutscenes and an original setting, an eastern ninja training ground. While the change of scenary is surely a novelty, the various combat and predator challenges are nothing new, gameplay-wise.The Cold, Cold Heart DLC is the only story-driven pack for Arkham Origins, which basically shows the first encounter between Batman and Mr. Freeze. The DLC itself is very short, with its main story being beatable in two or three hours, and the few side quests are just recycled from the main game. There isn't anything new even on the gameplay's front. The only highlight of Cold, Cold Heart is the final battle against Mr. Freeze, a challenging predator encounter.Batman: Arkham Origins can be considered a fairly good attempted for an official prequel for the series, but really suffers from several not stellar development choices			"

												Really grows on you this one. I found it hard to get into at first attempts as it feels very similar to City before it really kicks in and the fact that Batman has practically more if not better suit and equipment and abilities takes some fathoming considering this is meant to be his humble beginnings.Aside from those thing once you get into it, the story and visiting all the key players for the first time in the humble beginnings as well as linking things canon to Arkham Asylum & City make for quite a treat making it a must for a fan of the series.This is especially true with all the issues remedied and the game looking quite sexy too. So overall a really solid origins campaign for Batman with loads of fun elements and interesting tales to tell minus the usual busy work (I recommend the Cold, Cold Heart DLC also).			"

												I am Vengeance.I am the Night.I am Batman.Okay, don't let my playtime discourage you from reading my review. I have completed the game on my PS3.If I were to describe this game in one word it would either be great or underrated.This game is great, IMHO the free roam is better than City. In City there weren't as many enemies to fight and the map could be traversed in minutes. In Origins there are a ton more in groups of 8 or 9ish, the map is also bigger too. Crimes also make the game a lot more fun, they're better than they were in CityThe story is just as good as City, but there are some parts I dislike in Origins, and City's ending is better. I also like the costume in Origins over City, it's more intimidating and realistic.I haven't experienced any crashes or stutters except for a micro stutter and a small FPS drop (won't drop below 58 usually) when zoning. I've heard that using DirectX11 Enhanced makes the game unstable so I don't bother with it.I have never bothered with the multiplayer but I've heard it's bad.SummaryPros:Great StoryGreat gameplayAfter game free roamThe music is as good as City'sMixed:Not the same voice actors, but this is a younger Batman so I guess...Cons:Some costumes are annoying to unlock Batman breaks his rule at one point, he kills Bane then revives him. I thought that was bad Some of the boss fights are disappointing and even frustrating compared to cityThe occasional FPS dropEnigma (Riddler) challanges are boring.9/10This review may be updated soon as I play it more.Specs:GTX 780 6GBi7-2600 @ 3.40GHz16 RamI didn't run this game at ultra but might chagne the settings.

												Arkham Origins is an excellent installment into the franchise to the series and definately one worth buying. I played the first two Arkhams on the Xbox 360 and plugged in a 360 controller to my computer to play this game as well, so the controls for me felt very familiar. The combat is smooth and a lot better, though the better fights also mean the fights are significantly harder, but the lack of game changing elements (other than new and better gadgets) make the fights also begin to feel repetitive at times, like little things you have to do in order to get to the sweet, wonderful boss fights. However, it's not the gameplay that makes Arkham so great, but rather it's fantastic story. Every plot point ties in with eachother beautifully and, even despite this game being a pre-quel, it creates a completely fresh and new story with many unexpected moments and incredible feats of character/character development for Batman and his villains alike. The map here works better than City's, though not due to it's size, but rather it's believability. City tried too hard to make every notable building have something going on with it, whether a side mission or just snipers on the roof, while Origins leaves many buildings just building while still adding enough features on their other buildings to feel the need to travel wisely. If you enjoyed the last Arkham games then i would definately recommend this game, to the point where the story and bossfights alone are worth it.			"

												Very good game if you like the Arkham series. Although the PC version is still a little buggy. Not buggy enough to ruin the game for me, but I would never even attempt the ""I am the night"" mode because of the bugs. Also, this game slightly lacks the  attention to detail that the other Arkham games had. i.e. some steam vents can't be plugged with a glue grenade while others can etc. Also, the combat system timing is a little off. Sometimes, quickfire gadgets don't work. I have to jump a couple times to get them working again.Not at all game breaking, but still knocked off a couple points for me.7/10UPDATED: 04-23-2014Cold, Cold Heart DLC:Some people have been playing this and have reported bugs. I played this and did not encounter a single bug or visual glitch. This was more stable than the original game. It is fun and story driven. The new thermal suit is a little funny looking, but is still quite fun. This DLC is about the same length as Harley Quinn's revenge, from Arkham City. You can beat it in about 1-2 hours depending on how much of the side missions that you complete. It's nice to play a DLC that is more than just a new costume or map. I wish more games would do this.8/10			"

												Ok let's get this out of the way, this is the worst game in the series so far. Now you might be asking yourself: lol is dis duud on meth or sumting. Well, actually you might think that I'm gonna say some logical reason for making such a statement(not the meth thing). So le't get down to it. The fighting and stealth are both still really fun. So what is the problem? Well the problem is that they are indeed fun, but they were also fun in Arkham city(I would acually say that they were both better in Arkham city), and they have not really been changed at all since then. Overall the gameplay is nearly identical to Arkham city. Everything that worked there, also works quite well here.They did add few neat things, but I was hoping for more. And yeah, there is that multiplayer mode....that nobody really wanted to see. There are also a lot of glicthes in the game, some are small and some are serious issues. The game does also crash quite often.But anyway, what about the story? Well the joker has a big role in it...again. The joker is a great character, but could you give the spotlight to someone else please, he already had a huge role in 2 games! There is also that 8 assassin's hire by Black mask thing, which doesn't really get as much attention as I hoped. The boss fights that they were bragging on about are not even that special. Some of them are quite good, and some are the quite bad.A lot of people were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroiy are not in the game, but those new voice actors for Batman and the joker both do a good job, so no need to worry about that. But overall the story and characters are all quite good. I would even say that the story, might be the best in the series. The problem is that it lacks tension, because it's a prequel.Ah whatever, I think that I have said all that there is to say.Even though Arkham origins is quite clearly the weakest part of the series, I still had some fun playing it, but I was left hoping for much more. It's a solid entry in the series that still needs some major fixes. After that it might even be a pretty good game			"

												The second Arkham game I played. Numerous glitches made this game problematic - especially for PS3 users who (much like PC users with AK) were majorly shafted with several problems that were never fully solved and remain in gameplay to this day - ranging from graphic problems with lag during glide-mode all the way to Batman becoming 'stuck' during boss fights. The 'shock gauntlets' (for lack of a better name) while an interesting gimmick for less-capable players, took away much of the challenge that City contained and lacked any option to disable them. Like Batman himself this game was much more rough-around-the-edges than what was to come; but what it did right it did well and for that it deserves appreciation. The story, the atmosphere and the young Bruce/Batman MADE this game approachable even if you weren't familiar with the series. It is an origin story without actually being one. The new 'random event/cop in danger' missions that crop up from time to time over the police band are a welcome distraction that feels like it could have been used in Knight. The much larger map of Knight with randomly generated numbers of foes and victims to save would have been quite a simple feature and is one of the reasons I still play Origins. Getting back to the story - and it isn't hard to do so - the plot in Origins moves around much more quickly than City, Asylum and Knight as well. The feel of a goal - a purpose - is much more present in Origins. Gotham - for the first time in the series history - actually FEELS like a city (or at least a town) with the much larger scope and map. Also, the origins the game gives for characters and areas that are introduced through the narrative are not only plausible, they (in many ways) are more streamlined and believable than many things DC has produced to date! The writing of this game - coupled with actors like Troy Baker - leave you wanting more even if you get stuck during that fight with firefly.			"

												I don't know why this game didn't get more love.I have had this game in my library for over a year and after reading so many negative reviews I was afraid to play it thinking that it must be super bad and not worth playing. After reading some reviews I expected it to even barely be recognizable as a Batman game.  However, having liked Arkham Asylum and absolutely loving Arkham City I figured I had to give it a try, especially if I plan on trying Arkham Knight. I was expecting a dog. Maybe it was because my expectations were so low, but I really enjoyed it a lot.Granted, it didn't add a whole lot to the gameplay of Arkham City, but it was a great story in its own and having access to many of the gadgets and abilities right from the beginning, made it that much more enjoyable. There were a lot of varied things to do and for the first time I started playing in some of the challenge modes and I enjoyed the addition of the skill challenges during regular gameplay. I loved the Combat Challenges which helped train me as I went back into the game.It might have lacked a bit of the polish that was in Arkham City and at times combat seemed a little bit clunkier, especially when trying to do a followup attack on a downed enemy, but I really feel that if this game had come out before Arkham City, it would be getting all of the praise and Arkham City would have been looked down on. It was a solid game and it stands on its own. Some say it was more like DLC for Arkham City, but I have never gotten this much time and enjoyment out of any DLC for any game. My current hours spent on this one surpass those I spent in Arkham City.I don't consider myself a Batman fan or even a DC fan (I always liked Marvel and Spiderman). I am, however, a great fan of these Batman games and yes, that does include Arkham Origins.  If you enjoyed Arkham Origins and Arkham City, you have to play this one. If you found Arkham City repetetive and not so good, don't play this one. Please, if you did like the other Batman Arkham games, you owe it to yourself to try this one. Don't be influenced by all of the naysayers. This is a great game!!			"

												I remember being excited for this when it came out, but then got influenced by others saying it was just mediocre, that the 'detective' work left something to be desired. I ended up putting Arkham Origins down after beating Deathstroke. I have recently started playing it again, and I gotta say, it is _always_ satisfying to jump into a mob of baddies and punch them in the face while avoiding their attacks. The story is fun, the action is great, and who cares about 'mediocre detective work?' The point is you're BATMAN, so of course he's going to make deducing any crime scene trivial. If you like Batman, and the previous games, or Shadow of Mordor, this game is for you. If you set it down like I did, pick it back up, dust off those electrified gauntlets, and put the hurt on some baddies!			"

The story is fantastic has explore the begining of the relationships that Batman builds during his career. The Joker scenes are probably the best part of the game.But the gameplay is not innovative. The boss fights are easier, probably the easiest in all the series so far. Especially the Deathstroke fight is too early in the game and the Bane fights (except for the last one) are too rinse and repeat.The puzzles are ok but easier compared to the previous games.The extra costumes are awesome. The online multiplayer is down, but then again I bought this game for the single player campain.Get this game on discount. Don't buy it on full price.			"

												Like the other Batman - Arkham games, Origins delivers on great story, graphics, and gameplay. You'll see both new and old gadgets, combos, and takedowns and If you played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, then you would be remiss not to add Origins to your collection as it holds up very well to - if not surpasses - its counterparts. If you haven't played the others then I encourage you to do so but Origins is as good a place to start as any since its events actually take place first.Cold, Cold Heart is a good side story DLC that tells the story/creation of Mr. Freeze, but it is very short so you may want to wait until it is on sale.

												This game got blasted in reviews for essentially being the same as Arkham City.  This is true, but I don't view it as a negative.  The game inherited a winning formula, and rather than change it unnecessarily, they kept it as-is.  As a result, Arkham Origins has a winning formula as well, rather than a broken ""New Coke"" design.I feel like the story is the strongest of the Arkham games so far, and the game looks visually stunning.  Playing with PhysX especially was a revelation as to how much more convincing that tech can make a game's environments, and I really hope to see it adopted in a wide range of future titles.Most of my complaints are things inherited from the past games.  I'm not a big fan of the overly muscled look for everyone in the game, sans Joker and women.  Nor the way Batman pinballs around the room during combat.  There's got to be a better way to represent rapid motion than that.Though the map is larger than Arkham Asylum (and City), because you spend so much time gliding overhead, City and Origins feel much smaller to me.  The various buildings in City and Origins are largely pointless and tend to blend together in a way that the environments of Asylum never did.The rock-paper-scissors nature of a lot of the enemies is annoying.  The game is at its best when it creates those ""I'M BATMAN"" moments of the player dropping into the middle of 50 guys and cleaning house - thugs that require a special gimmick to be defeated (stun the armored thug, get behind the stunner thug, etc) break that feeling.  It isn't that they're hard, but that they reduce your options in a fight down to one, and it's the same one every time.  The only complaint I have that is exclusive to Origins is that the voice actor for Batman is terrible.  I'm not a Kevin Conroy fan (I'm in the minority that prefers the Bale voice), but the new guy is terrible enough that it pulls me out of the game.  This just isn't Batman's voice coming out of Batman.But those things aside, this is still an excellent game, and may actually be my favorite of the trilogy so far.  Walking around the Batcave, for whatever reason, is particularly enjoyable to me.  If spending an hour exploring the Batcave and trying to read every blurred text-containing texture appeals to you, put this one at the top of your wishlist.			"

												I know there are those people who didn't even play this game, because it wasn't made by Rock Steady. There are even those who do not include this in the Arkham series, but I highly disagree. I actually loved it and it is my favourite in the bunch after Arkham Asylum. It brings the whole thing down a bit. Even though it is in the city, it felt a little bit more confined and more like the first game instead of Arkham City. Or maybe it was the story which was more down to earth and not so much larger then live. But then again, I am a sucker for origin stories. And at the end of the day, this is my opinion. And you should take it as only that.			"

												Great Game really instense! It brings back the origins of Batman being in a situation that he's about to begin before he did his wildest adventures in Asylum and City. 8.7/10Singleplayer:This is a great story in Campaign while you're fighting againest assassins and roaming around the city. The 8 Assassins are quiet what we didn't expect. The Joker makes a brief appearance when he turned out to pull the plug on Batman, and me must stop him on his first time meeting him. Black Mask puts a bounty on his face, and he must survive the night and evade the GCPD and the Assassins getting the bountyMultiplayer:It sucks Worst things ever in batman history Laggy, Glitchy, Buggy. You should've tried HARDER!!!! Q A TEST IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  .Overall:It's a Decent Game but very Glitchy, but that doesn't stop the game ruining it self. The Developers, WB Games Montreal did a bad job. I hope Rocksteady comes back with a better game.Verdict:6.7/10 Worst Arkham Game in the Franchise.			"

												I honestly don't understand some of these negative reviews. While it is obvious that WB wanted to cash in on the franchise, the same thing can be said for just about every successful video game franchise. This game is by far the best of the trilogy so far. I've even complaints about it having obscure villains...If you don't know who Deathstroke and Deadshot are (btw these are hardly obscure characters) then you should really revisit your batman lore.The boss fights are extraordinary and who doesn't want to play batman when he's first introduced to some of the most infamous villains in gotham? Honestly this game deserves a solid 10. If you like Batman, and you liked the other two games then purchase the game and you will not be disappointed.			"

												First, this game is no Arkham City, although it tries too hard to be be.It's not bad but nor great either. The story is fantastic has explore the begining of the relationships that Batman builds during his career. The Joker scenes are probably the best part of the game.But the gameplay is not innovative. The boss fights are easier, probably the easiest in all the series so far. Especially the Deathstroke fight is too early in the game and the Bane fights (except for the last one) are too rinse and repeat.The puzzles are ok but easier compared to the previous games.The extra costumes are awesome. The online multiplayer is down, but then again I bought this game for the single player campain.Get this game on discount. Don't buy it on full price.			"

												This game got blasted in reviews for essentially being the same as Arkham City.  This is true, but I don't view it as a negative.  The game inherited a winning formula, and rather than change it unnecessarily, they kept it as-is.  As a result, Arkham Origins has a winning formula as well, rather than a broken ""New Coke"" design.I feel like the story is the strongest of the Arkham games so far, and the game looks visually stunning.  Playing with PhysX especially was a revelation as to how much more convincing that tech can make a game's environments, and I really hope to see it adopted in a wide range of future titles.Most of my complaints are things inherited from the past games.  I'm not a big fan of the overly muscled look for everyone in the game, sans Joker and women.  Nor the way Batman pinballs around the room during combat.  There's got to be a better way to represent rapid motion than that.Though the map is larger than Arkham Asylum (and City), because you spend so much time gliding overhead, City and Origins feel much smaller to me.  The various buildings in City and Origins are largely pointless and tend to blend together in a way that the environments of Asylum never did.The rock-paper-scissors nature of a lot of the enemies is annoying.  The game is at its best when it creates those ""I'M BATMAN"" moments of the player dropping into the middle of 50 guys and cleaning house - thugs that require a special gimmick to be defeated (stun the armored thug, get behind the stunner thug, etc) break that feeling.  It isn't that they're hard, but that they reduce your options in a fight down to one, and it's the same one every time.  The only complaint I have that is exclusive to Origins is that the voice actor for Batman is terrible.  I'm not a Kevin Conroy fan (I'm in the minority that prefers the Bale voice), but the new guy is terrible enough that it pulls me out of the game.  This just isn't Batman's voice coming out of Batman.But those things aside, this is still an excellent game, and may actually be my favorite of the trilogy so far.  Walking around the Batcave, for whatever reason, is particularly enjoyable to me.  If spending an hour exploring the Batcave and trying to read every blurred text-containing texture appeals to you, put this one at the top of your wishlist.			"

												Ever since the release of Arkham Asylum, I have been a diehard Batman video game fan. I had doubts for Asylum that were quickly disproven and from that point, I went to the midnight release of Arkham City. That being said, as soon as I saw that WB Montreal was developing a prequel game, I began to worry. Now, some of those worries were founded, others not so much.Arkham Origins is a mixed bag. It brings both good and bad things to the Arkham franchise. I'll start with the negatives.Deja-vu. You'll play this game wondering what is different about it than Arkham City. You have almost the same gadgets, combat upgrades, grappel abilities, etc. It's not bad; it's just really familiar. Mission types are similar, if not the same, and a good portion of the map is the Arkham City map covered in snow. Granted it's in greater detail with a graphical overhaul, but it's the same map. The good: Story. It's not as good as Arkham City's story with all the twists and great care and attention that were given it, but it's decent. It introduces many of Batman's familiar villains in a plotline that isn't disappointing. That's something that isn't easy to pull off.  The voice acting is good, with Troy Baker stealing the show with an excellent Joker presentation. (especially considering that he isn't Mark Hammill) The graphics can be excellent, but can also disappoint. Some areas have great details and effects, but even those aren't jaw-dropping. I run this on a 1GB GTX 650ti and get around 45FPS average, which is decent for the settings I run it at. The sound editing could use some work, as it was difficult to hear voices over SFX sometimes, even after altering the levels. I haven't tried multiplayer much yet, to be honest I probably won't do it at all. I didn't buy this game for the multiplayer and I'd be surprised if anyone did. The single player doesn't disappoint, but it really doesn't exceed any expectations either. It's a good entry in the series, but it's not as excellent as we've come to expect from an Arkham title. If you're a fan, it's worth getting, but you may want to wait for a sale to purchase this game.			"

												Even though it says I've only played this game for five hours, I mostly played this game offline and have completed the campaign. I must say that although the game is great, it is no match to what Arkham City had. The story was great, loved the part with the refrences to the Killing Joke and Joker's origin. However, what really began to tick me off was the combat, it was much slower and not as fluid. I found myself having the slow down, which is not a good thing when facing fifteen people at once. The only way I could take down some of the later battles were the shock gloves, which were way too overpowered in my opinion. The younger Bruce Wayne does actually feel younger, he seems more arrogant and less experienced, and I loved having Alfred talk to me rather than Oracle for a change. This is not just Batman's story though, it is also a story about the Joker, whom I found intriguing. The new voice actors suprisingly fit well, but nobody can beat Kevin Conroy. Gotham City seems really like a cut and paste Arkahm City, but it has some new tricks up its sleeve. Overall, even though this game is probably the weakest in the series, it's really well done. I'm suprised it was good, as it was not Rocksteady who made this game, but WB Montreal. 8.4/10			"

												I wish, I wish, I *wish* that this game were better.  It's good in the same way all the Arkham games are good, but there is so much wasted potential.  Not least of which: if this is an origin story, why is Batman all kitted out in crazy body armor and fighting with just as many gadgets and just as effectively in the other Arkham games.However, the gameplay is still pretty tight, and it's still fun.  Just ... not worth full price, like Asylum and City were.Having finished it, though, I do have to say props on the story - I actually think this might be the strongest story of the Arkham games.			"

												While not as good as the other Arkham games, it is still a great game. The story is interesting, and the dialogue is well written. It is very straight to the point, and the story makes it clear that this game is all about the boss fights, and in that regard, it doesn't dissapoint. The boss fights are varied, and very fun. From the hand-to-hand fight with Deathstroke, demanding split second timing and reflexes, to the surreal brawl with Copperhead, and the tactical stealth ancounter with Deadshot, this game will keep you busy with each passing boss fight.Sadly, I can not say the same for the side missions. It is the same thing we've been doing since Asylum. Scan this, collect that, go there. Not much variety at all. It doesn't help that you're doing this on the same map as Arkham City. Sure, they have added new areas, but it doesn't offer much in terms of variety. It is hard to know your way around the map, when everything looks the same. They say in the game that you have to go to the industrial district, but the entire city looks like an industrial district! In fact, like Arkham City, the entire city looks like a war zone in an industrial district. It makes sence in City, being a cut off part of the city for prisoners, but in Origins, that is not the case. Things are on fire, the bridge is covered with piles of crates, broken cars and criminal activity. And navigating it has gotten harder. I swear they have reduced the amount of grapple points in the city. Even in places where there is no logical reason why I wouldn't be able to grapple, I can't. It gets very frustrating. And there are fewer things you can climb up on. Sometimes you can clumb up on objects that are, maybe, 3 and a half meters tall. At other times, you can't even climb up on something waste high.Then there's the gadgets. You won't find much in terms of variety here either. Most of the gadgets are just altered versions of the old ones, or the exact same ones. But they do the job. If I have one major criticism of the gadgets, it is one that applies for all of the Arkham games. The gadgets are a bit far fetched. They feel out of place. It feels like they belong in a sci-fi game. They explosive gel has no reason to be a gel. In the comics and other media, Batman frequently carries explosive charges. Why does it have to be gel here? It feels a bit contrived. And why does he have to spray it in the shape of a bat symbol? Wouldn't that just take more time? And the disruptor looks like some sort of plasma rifle. I don't mind what the gadgets do, I just think they look a bit to futuristic. But that is just preference on my part.All in all, I think it is a really good game. Its charm doesn't lie in its open world, or the side activities. It lies in the boss fights,, the the different levels and the characters. If that is what you're looking for, then I wholeheartedly recommend Arkham Origins. But if you are looking for a great open world game, with a lot of things to do, I recommend waiting for Arkham Knight, or pick up Arkham city which, while not very good at side activities either, does at least offer more grapple points, and climbable ledges, making the city easier, and more enjoyable to navigate.

												Awesome game! Graphics a an increase of the last game in the series and defintly uses the direct 11 to give the best it can! Game play is the same from the last game but opens the world more and adds some more dynamics that you have to play to experience. Totally worth the money!			"

												pros: visuals & graphics options, benchmarking available, challenge modes, crime scene investigation improved from the previous arkham games, characters are well voice acted, narrative experience to batman's origin, the signature arkham-style combat as we all know it, side missions & other villains to fightcons: no fullscreen windowed mode, can't skip game launch logos, the city is visually lacking compared to arkham city, binds run & jump to one key (spacebar) - unable to bind them to separate keys, STILL makes the player mash spacebar to open vent doors (like the previous arkham games), mash spacebar to move a raft on water, immersion breaking transitions to video cut scenes, random fps drops, unable to use the mouse to navigate the map, clunky ingame menu, sometimes abilities are unresponsive (especially during combat) which is the drawback of multi-button abilities (thanks to console design), some buildings will not let you grapple on them (even though they realistically could be grappled on), deathstroke suddenly vanished from a fight (I had to re-load my last save point), deathstroke battle is a tedious trial & error fight, boss battles are hit or miss (some can be really clunky like the firefly fight) & final boss fights were tedious, the game constantly make you crisscross the center bridge in-between missions, some of batman's audio cues overlap with each other, online is a hit or miss experience, map is littered with tedious enigma ""batarang this thing"" data itemOverall, the game runs stable considering the game's disastrous launch (stability issues in every arkham game during launch). Although the bugs that prevented you from progressing the main story have been patched, from what ive read a lot of the game's major bugs will not be patched (post-launch support completely ceased). This game feels bare bones compared to Arkham City (more of a narrative experience in comparison), but I welcome the improvement to crime scene investigations.Batman: Arkham Origins has my recommendation if you are new to the Arkham series, hit or miss if you have played the other Arkham games. This game feels more like a half-effort extension/DLC'ish to Arkham City.			"

												As much as the game seems better than the critic reviews, it's a hell lot like Arkham City and the graphics let you down sometimes. The story is good and the side missions (Penguin crates, etc) and Enigma missions is just passed down from City. Boss fights are really fun as you have to devise several different ways to defeat the 8 assassins. One of the bad part of this game is that its buggy, fell right through the floor and out of the map at one instance. Irrelevant multiplayer is one bad part of this game too and if there's bug to report Customer Service isn't that efficient either. But still if you want the 'Batman' sort of thrill, just get it. Preferably when it's on 75% sale.			"

												So far I have 16 hours in Asylum(100%), 34 in City(Main Story, all Riddler bull♥♥♥♥, and DLC) And 23 in this game; ""Arkham Origins"", to me this is part of the franchise, it is a bit glitchy but the story, refined gameplay which is the best so far in the series(IMO) and better side missions really made it up to me. I don't get a lotta the hate, but I enjoyed this engrossing game. I still prefer city, but THAT'S ARKHAM CITY AND THIS ISN'T EVEN BY ROCKSTEADY! I loved the boss battles which felt intense and challenging, The DLC was also great, and the crime scene addition is impeccable. So far this is my ranking1. Arkham City2. Arkham Asylum3. Arkham OriginsPros:StoryGameplayLots of ContentCons: Glitchy Feels lazy by only re-doing the map and adding a few districts.Verdict:8.5/10Worth the money and a fun game to play. Pick it up whenever, preferably on sale like I did because it is a little bit glitchy.However I can understand something like the flying animation glitch, because that seems like it would be impossible to fix. But I had one crash, two checkpoint restart glitches(I was stuck and invincible.), and sometimes I had to get collectables a second time even though it saved afterwardss.			"

												First let me say I like a fair amount of things about the game. Some of the boss fights are the best in the series. The introduction of some of Batman's major villains is pretty cool. Some of the setpieces are great. It's not a bad game. What it is, is a tedious game. The Riddler puzzles feel largely uninspired and just vomited onto the map, there are 400 challenge mode medals to get, and there are two tiers of new game plus. Mechanically, it feels very much like a placeholder game meant to keep you distracted while waiting for Arkham Knight. Play it if you're itching for more Batman and have beaten the three Rocksteady games.			"

												A great Batman game, being a fan of Rocksteady’s Arkham series, this WB title was definitely a must play. The story was impressive with plenty of great interactions, clashes with batman’s villains, side quests to level up, new and interesting characters, well-made cut scenes, fantastic voice acting and a great soundtrack. The gameplay didn’t change that much from Arkham City and Asylum aside from a few tweaks and a bit more challenging encounters. There are also a few new gadgets and ways to use them.The map itself is huge and well designed to fit Gotham’s environment, but It is lacking a bit more population aside from gang members and police officers, since this is Gotham city and not a prison city anymore, but still a good job nonetheless. I am not a big fan of the multiplayer version of the game, because a game like this should be focused more on the single player aspect, but aside from its micro transactions it is entertaining.The challenge maps and campaign maps are always a nice addition, as well as being able to play as Deathstroke, sadly they didn’t give him an expansion story, but fortunately they released the Cold Cold Heart DLC which is pretty good.I do recommend the game and it is pretty cheap in its full price, but since it still possesses a few bugs and glitches, I would advice getting it on sale			"

												Has to be one of the best games I've played. I don't take to FPS type games easily but Batman is one of the best FPS/beat-em-ups going. The meleé combat system is relatively easy to get to grips with and progresses nicely as the story unfolds; the story is engaging and creates a great Batman-esque (dark) atmosphere; and the voice acting is spot-on.I have the game running fairly well under Windows 8.1 with a 4GHz Core i5, 8GB RAM, GTX 760 2GB graphics card, and all the graphics options maxed (except for AA on GeForce TXAA Low) - roughly 30fps or above @ full HD. The game is visually stunning, Gotham is beautifully recreated with lots of detail and a fluid system of moving around.The gameplay is split between action in the cityscape and action in buildings/enclosed areas. There are some nice alternative sections too and a little puzzle solving to obtain certain objects.I loved Gears of War on the XBox and this is just as easy to get into. I haven't completed the game yet (30%) but there has been plenty to do and there is good replay value in various challenges you can unlock and training modes.It's not perfect, mind, there are the occasional camera angles issues and the odd glitch that requires a game restart.If you like Batman and like FPS type games then this is a no-brainer, for everyone else it's close to a no brianer, and for those that hate these types of games you may be surprised at how good it is.Now, can someone make a Spiderman game with this engine and dynamics?

												The game itself is fine. It plays fine, the story is not bad. There are times where the game will show glitches, such as Batman falling THROUGH THE GROUND, or landing in water when he should be landing on the ground. Those, quite frankly, shouldn't bother anyone too much as they aren't too bad. Now, I am not too familiar with all the glitches, however I can tell you: STAY AWAY FROM 'MY ALIBI'. After you fight Bane, there will be a prompt to go after someone called The Bird. There are three places you travel to in order to complete the mission. The last place is 'My Alibi.' When I played it, I did the mini-boss fight with The Bird, then I was able to walk around. I walked into an adjacent room which turned black, as if I were between layers. Then I tried to leave the building but got stuck, so I restarted the game. When I continued the game, I saw Batman stuck in limbo, completely rendering the game broken. I've checked around and I see that it is a common glitch that occurs.I have only had this game for about a month, so whatever updates occured to fix this problem never carried over to when I bought it. I'm recommending this game because as I have said, it is fine and most of the glitches aren't too bad. All you need to do though, to be safe, is to completely avoid going into 'My Alibi.'			"

												At its core, Akrham Origins is a game that delivers more of what made Arkham City great. It stayed true to the combat and stealth priniciples from the previous games. The places where the game tried to expand the franchises didn't fare as well, like investigating crimes through Detective Mode, however this was not to the detrement of the game overall. I like how the game used the origin story to explore Batman's relationship withe The Joker. Looking forward to where the series goes in the next game.			"

												I know there are those people who didn't even play this game, because it wasn't made by Rock Steady. There are even those who do not include this in the Arkham series, but I highly disagree. I actually loved it and it is my favourite in the bunch after Arkham Asylum. It brings the whole thing down a bit. Even though it is in the city, it felt a little bit more confined and more like the first game instead of Arkham City. Or maybe it was the story which was more down to earth and not so much larger then live. But then again, I am a sucker for origin stories. And at the end of the day, this is my opinion. And you should take it as only that.			"

												As the third installment in the Batman Arkham  game series, Origins goes back in time to when Batman first encounters the Joker.  Origins is a third-person, detective, mystery/crime/superhero game much like the previous ones.  The game is tough and challenging at times, but is rewarding once you get through them.  I started with Origins, but don't have a desire to move on (or back) with the games.  I would consider this one if you are interested in the series, and would definitely play this over Arkham Knight.  Overall I'd give Origins 8/10 it's pretty a good game.			"

												New comers, WB Montreal take the well respected and loved Arkham Universe and give it an Origins story in, Batman: Arkham Origins. Knowing the weight they carried, the developers kept everything the fans loved from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and added to it. This payed off in the game play element but yet lacked in the environment. With the same beautiful feel of the Arkham games there was an unfortunate emptiness. As enjoyable as the Origins has been, it stands out as the weakest of the three games. Recommended none the less, and a big thumbs up!!			"

												It's a bad copy of Arkham city. The story is great, the characters are pretty good, though you don't see them that much. Combat seems harder, while Arhkam city was balanced. Filled with bugs, even after a huge patch. Bosses are really boring and annoying, basically all you do is repeat a sequence on how to hurt them, and dodge their attacks. A bonus is that they integrated achievements into the game, so you have a reason to get them. The map is a bit big, and the interiors maps aren't fun. The riddler challanges are awful. Most of them are just one gadget away from taking a collectable. The reward for finishing them was decent, but not as rewarding as in City.The online game is fun and original. It made this game as a whole, less bad for me. On the other hand, it has no real balance. Experienced players smash newer ones. Also, when super villians come out (part of the game), the game becomes super hard. Also filled with way too much bugs, connection drop outs which just has to get on your nerves.I can't say it's all bad, I did enjoy the story, and some aspect of the game. It's worth a play, at least for the story, but not remotely close to the last game.Some of the worst programming ever. I'm not blaming the developers, maybe they weren't told to fix stuff, but to focus on other tasks. I mean, man, it's so bad you even lose credits you earned, because of so many issues. Please don't♥♥♥♥♥♥of your players!!!!!			"

I don't know why most aren't people satisfied with this game because i sure as hell am.Single playerThis game has a good story, a slightly similar combat system of arkham city with a few new added gadgets , new enemy types, and about 9 villains you get to face off and fight. Unlike arkham knight boss battles, this installment brings back the feeling of what its like to fight actual bosses who could kill you if your not too careful for example bane, deathstroke, cooperhead and others.MultiplayerThe multiplayer in this game is also good. There are 3 teams Jokers gang, Bane's gang and batman and robin .You get to play as one of the elite henchmen who work for either the joker or bane and you get to play as batman and robin, sort of like a predator/prey system where about 6 players are henchmen(prey) and 2 players are batman and robin(hunter). I like how the mutiplayer gives you the opportunity to play as henchman and get to experience their perspective of being stalked by batman, you maybe thinking how hard can it be to spot a man in bat costume or even be scared of him but trust me after playing as a henchmen you will FEAR THE KNIGHT.The drawback to multiplayer is that its really hard to find a match when there aren't many online players, each matchmaking session takes about 10-15 minutes which is abit frustrating and things get even worse when a game starts with people who are either afk or disconnected during the match since there is no vote to kick feature and players can't join during multiplayer sessions. This game may not be as good as arkham city but its still worth buying and playing. I recommend buying when its on offer like i did, then you won't regret your decision if you dont like it.			"

												According to my opinion the other two games of the Batman Arkham franchise were so far better than this except in graphics (does it matter?). TBH this game was not the kind of game that I hoped would be the next installment after Arkham City. Though it is supposed to be a prequel to Arkham Asylum they could have made the game somewhat better than the previous ones. Huge amount of bugs and frequent huge updates for them is kind of hard to deal with when playing this game. I played this simply beacuse I wanted to complete the Batman Arkham Franchise so far. So if you are a Batman fan go for it otherwise think twice before buying it. Hope the next one will be great since Rocksteady does it.			"

												Arkham Origins - I love the Batman Games, but this game attracted me more than Arkham City and Asylum. I loved playing the story and the game's side missions. The story adds better boss fights (use of stealth this time in some bosses) and fun missions such as predator missions. The side missions have you foiling the plans of Edward Enigma, Bird, Penguin and other Batman villains. This time around Batman had multiplayer, which is a really good feature that I feel didn't get enough attention. This multiplayer has 2 players playing as hereos - Batman and Robin (With heaps of skins from your favourite Batman comics) and 6 other players split between either Bane or Joker thugs. These characters have firearms, traps, grenades and many other weaponry to take down the stealthy hunter (the hereos), these character are customisable aswell, changing their outfit, archytypes and accessories. I have heaps of fun playing with my friends online and think any player should expierence this. So please, do yourself a favour, and buy this game :)			"

												As the third installment in the Batman Arkham  game series, Origins goes back in time to when Batman first encounters the Joker.  Origins is a third-person, detective, mystery/crime/superhero game much like the previous ones.  The game is tough and challenging at times, but is rewarding once you get through them.  I started with Origins, but don't have a desire to move on (or back) with the games.  I would consider this one if you are interested in the series, and would definitely play this over Arkham Knight.  Overall I'd give Origins 8/10 it's pretty a good game.			"

												7.5/10It's a good game, better than Asylum but worse than Arkham City. Why? Though the map is supposedly bigger and the Bat gets a couple of new gadgets, the game overall feels a bit clunky and unpolished. Even with a good rig (970 gpu), the game has crashed several times, frozen, and had game-breaking glitches. Honestly it was fun for me to exploit the games bugs, such as the one where you can enter a huge empty building in the middle of the map and just watch the animations twist Batman's durable armour. SInce the game is set in Gotham during a winter, it also feels washed out compared to Arkham City's sharp textures. Gotham in BA Origins is also a lot more spread out, but it suffers because of it. While BA City was packed and interest to explore, Gotham feels empty and lifeless if not for the occasional gang of thugs. In general graphically the game can look gorgeous, and then suddenly a texture begins glitching out and the immersion gets completely lost.Story-wise it is OK, the battle with Deathstroke being the most memorable in the series for me. However, it doesn't feel like much new or interesting; it's just the general Batman vs All story. Considering the game is for 5 bucks right now, I would say definitely buy it. However, if you don't have BA City already and can't buy both that game and this one, I would recommend the purchase of BA City.			"

												I don't know why this game didn't get more love.I have had this game in my library for over a year and after reading so many negative reviews I was afraid to play it thinking that it must be super bad and not worth playing. After reading some reviews I expected it to even barely be recognizable as a Batman game.  However, having liked Arkham Asylum and absolutely loving Arkham City I figured I had to give it a try, especially if I plan on trying Arkham Knight. I was expecting a dog. Maybe it was because my expectations were so low, but I really enjoyed it a lot.Granted, it didn't add a whole lot to the gameplay of Arkham City, but it was a great story in its own and having access to many of the gadgets and abilities right from the beginning, made it that much more enjoyable. There were a lot of varied things to do and for the first time I started playing in some of the challenge modes and I enjoyed the addition of the skill challenges during regular gameplay. I loved the Combat Challenges which helped train me as I went back into the game.It might have lacked a bit of the polish that was in Arkham City and at times combat seemed a little bit clunkier, especially when trying to do a followup attack on a downed enemy, but I really feel that if this game had come out before Arkham City, it would be getting all of the praise and Arkham City would have been looked down on. It was a solid game and it stands on its own. Some say it was more like DLC for Arkham City, but I have never gotten this much time and enjoyment out of any DLC for any game. My current hours spent on this one surpass those I spent in Arkham City.I don't consider myself a Batman fan or even a DC fan (I always liked Marvel and Spiderman). I am, however, a great fan of these Batman games and yes, that does include Arkham Origins.  If you enjoyed Arkham Origins and Arkham City, you have to play this one. If you found Arkham City repetetive and not so good, don't play this one. Please, if you did like the other Batman Arkham games, you owe it to yourself to try this one. Don't be influenced by all of the naysayers. This is a great game!!			"

The characters and environments are well-detailed and nothing really important seems left out.Main story takes about 10-14 hours.Final Verdict: 7/10			"

												This is a good game, yes, but it lacks a certain something that the Rocksteady-made Arkham games have. The city feels far less memorable than Arkham City, and that bridge will never not be a pain. Furthermore, I've encountered more glitches in this game -- no game-erasing ones thankfully -- than both Asylum and City, the latter of which I also played at launch.Looks good, true. Plays decently, though combat has been changed -- there seems to be a tighter window for countering, for example. It's not a terrible game, as I said. But I'm not inclined to play it again and get all of the Enigma datapacks, not like how I went and replayed Asylum recently. Recommended, but not as strongly as the other two Arkham games.			"

In this game, you can enjoy playing as Batman (of course) or a mercenary called DeathStroke (in challenge mode). There are 4 game modes (new game, new game +, I am the night - you mustn't die and challenge mode), 3 difficulties and a lot of upgrades. Story of the proloque  (spoiler warning)The story takes place in Christmas Eve, the time Batman didn't know Joker and Black Mask was still the biggest villain of Gotham. Batman found out that Black Mask made a night called ""One night to kill the Bat"": He invited to Gotham 8 assasins: DeathStroke, DeadShot, Copperhead (female), Firefly, Bane, Shiva (female), the Electrocutioner and Killer Croc. Their task is simple: ""Kill the Batman in the Christmas Eve night, if you want to get 50 000 000 $"", told Black Mask to them. Is Batman going to defeat them or is someone going to pick up the bounty?

												I am not going to lie, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, despite the fact that the gameplay mechanics were relatively unchanged. This does not even compare to Arkham City, but doesn't make it a bad game either, not at all! This prequel to the Arkham series puts you in the suit and cowl of Batman as expected, but this time years before the events of Arkham Asylum. Batman is still the experienced fighter as he is in Asylum, but does make mistakes that you don't see in Asylum or City, which I enjoyed, it shows he wasn't always the perfect interrogator and is still a human, albeit an incredibly skilled, master detective with loads of gadgets at his disposal.Now the gameplay remains almost untouched, with a few new things here and there such as the new martial artist fighters, and a new feature to the detective mode of which I'm too lazy to talk about. There you have it, those are the only additions in terms of gameplay, which isn't much at all, and if you ask me they were very unnecessary. The addition of multiplayer was also unnecessary, and rather crummy, this is a single player game, so don't try to tamper with it in that manner! If you've played Arkham City, you've basically already played Arkham Origins, in terms of gameplay at least. Other than gameplay, the story is new and worth playing through, the main reason I bought it actually... well that and it was on sale! The story was great, and that's what made it feel like a worthy addition to the series, seeing the events that came before arkham and particularly getting to have a one-on-one match with Deathstroke was awesome. I won't say much else about story as to not spoil it. Overall this game was a fun game to playthrough, but after beating it I found myself bored of the game because it didn't have a lot more to offer than the previous game Arkham City, just the same gameplay and not much joy in finding the Riddler packages, I've already done enough of that in City and the puzzles to achieve them weren't exactly new either. This was more or less a story expansion that I enoyed playing through, but didn't find it worht my time to go for 100%. If you were to choose between Arkham City and Arkham Origins, go with City, this may have been a worthy addition to the series, but you don't actually need it to understand any of the story from Arkham Aylum or City. 7/10, would still recommend, but only if you want to experience the story.

												The game was made to keep fans busy until Rocksteady released the official sequel in the series, and it shows. While it seems interesting on paper, the the studio behind this game played things as safe as they possibly could. The map is largely borrowed from Arkham City, most (if not all) of the new gadgets are just the old toys with slightly different mechanics and passed off as ""New"", nothing new to batman's move set as far as combat goes, the missions feel like they were recycled from the first two games... This prequel never steps sets out to improve on the games before it.But at the same time, it's not bad. It just feels like a step back in quality a bit, and whatever new things this game adds their so minor that they really don't make much of a difference. Gamers label this game as glorified DLC for a reason.If you had to choose, forget this title and just play the original games. The game may be titled ""Origins"", but believe me when I say you're not missing anything. In a way, this game has about as much importance to the Arkham series as Harley Quinn's Revenge had to Arkham City. It's just filler. Though, despite my complaints, I can still recommend this game. Just... not for at full price. Wait for a Batman Steam sale and scoop this up for $5.00... hell, even the season pass wouldn't hurt for the Mr. Freeze side story, challenge maps, and additional costumes. For $10.00, it's worth it, but for the asking price, you're better off buying the first two or putting that cash towards Arkham Knight.			"

												Now that I've finished it and everyone sort of looks down on it might as well review it. I've enojoyed my time with Arkham Origins not only because of the differences it had from Asylum and City but because of its dark atmosphere. The boss fights (excluding Bane) weren't constanly being drawn out with ""Venom"" and there were less chores to do all around. Asylum didn't have this problem but with City I saw every villian as an annoyance whereas Origins' villians threatened something I cared about. The end of this game wasn't a bulky boss fight but more so an outlet for you to taste revenge and release Batman's anger. I am absolutely satisfied with this pickup that costed about 7$ on GMG.			"

												Unlike too many open world games in recent memory, Batman: Arkham games don't fall into the trap of giving you a world packed out the ears with boring menial tasks.  If you took away the world and put Batman in a room fulll of thugs, this game could still easily stand on its own.The combat encourages timing over button mashing, improvisation over spamming, and thoughtfulness over bullheadedness.  The stealth gameplay is a rare example of one that blends in so well the action rather than taking away from it.			"

												Incredible graphics and excellent game overall.The loading is incredibly fast, given the amount of details and the great quality.Precise and comfortable controls and amazing story make this game really enjoyable for hours and makes you want to play again when you finish (the replayability is guaranteed when you unlock new modes).Buy it and you probably won't regret it.

												Long story short: I LOVE THIS GAME!Before starting, let's just be clear about the things I didn't like:- If you want to complete the ranks of Worst Nightmare, you MUST do it during the story line, because the Predator rooms do not respawn after you complete them during the story. This is a real pain in the butt if you completed the story line. I even had to play the I Am The Night mode (you die, you start all over again) for completing this rank.- The same condition of ""finishing the ranks just during the story"" make the ""challenge maps"" unatractive. And besides, you just get achievements if you get ALL of the medals. I mean, c'mon! at least give me an achievement for getting almost all of them!- Sometimes (not often, but it happened to me a couple of times) bugs will make you restart to the last checkpoint. As an example, I was fighting the last boss, and suddenly Batman and the boss stopped moving and just stared at each other... It was kinda funny, thou.Said this, let's go to everything I totally loved:-The whole story is something amazing! whorty of any comic book!. I would go into details, but I don't want to spoil anything. I just loved it so much that playing the normal, new game plus, and I am the night mode was a total pleasure. The only ""but"" is that I consider it to be too short, compared with Arkham City, but it is compensated by the many side stories that are allowed by the Most Wanted missions.- You gotta love Barbara Gordon <3- I do think this game makes the Batman to be more a detective than the previous games, which is a very fun thing to play. It's kinda easy thou, since the Batman does everything for you. - If you can, buy the DLC Cold, Cold Heart. The way they explain the origins of Mr. Freeze is stunning! - The gameplay is, as always, something intuitive. I played Arkham City like... two years ago? and now I just graved the PS3 controller (yes, **** you, Microsoft!) and it was like riding a bike... people don't forget!- Getting all the collectibles, all the upgrades, all the tags, everything, will give you lots and lots of hours of gameplay. I did reach 100 hours of gaming just with the singleplayer mode (my brother also played the game, so, I didn't actualy play that amount of time). I might have taken my time, thou, I'm sure you can do it faster.About the price, yes, 30 dollars for all the time I played is worthy, but yet, that amount of money for just one game is kinda too much for me. I got this game during the Summer Sales, and those 7.5 USD I did spend for this game are one of the best buying I have ever made. But, If you're ok about paying 30 USD for one game, I'm telling you, DO IT!! you wont regret!.I can't really talk about the multiplayer mode. I'm not too much into playing online, then I just tried it for a while. It was fun.Summary: GO FOR IT!			"

												Ever since the release of Arkham Asylum, I have been a diehard Batman video game fan. I had doubts for Asylum that were quickly disproven and from that point, I went to the midnight release of Arkham City. That being said, as soon as I saw that WB Montreal was developing a prequel game, I began to worry. Now, some of those worries were founded, others not so much.Arkham Origins is a mixed bag. It brings both good and bad things to the Arkham franchise. I'll start with the negatives.Deja-vu. You'll play this game wondering what is different about it than Arkham City. You have almost the same gadgets, combat upgrades, grappel abilities, etc. It's not bad; it's just really familiar. Mission types are similar, if not the same, and a good portion of the map is the Arkham City map covered in snow. Granted it's in greater detail with a graphical overhaul, but it's the same map. The good: Story. It's not as good as Arkham City's story with all the twists and great care and attention that were given it, but it's decent. It introduces many of Batman's familiar villains in a plotline that isn't disappointing. That's something that isn't easy to pull off.  The voice acting is good, with Troy Baker stealing the show with an excellent Joker presentation. (especially considering that he isn't Mark Hammill) The graphics can be excellent, but can also disappoint. Some areas have great details and effects, but even those aren't jaw-dropping. I run this on a 1GB GTX 650ti and get around 45FPS average, which is decent for the settings I run it at. The sound editing could use some work, as it was difficult to hear voices over SFX sometimes, even after altering the levels. I haven't tried multiplayer much yet, to be honest I probably won't do it at all. I didn't buy this game for the multiplayer and I'd be surprised if anyone did. The single player doesn't disappoint, but it really doesn't exceed any expectations either. It's a good entry in the series, but it's not as excellent as we've come to expect from an Arkham title. If you're a fan, it's worth getting, but you may want to wait for a sale to purchase this game.			"

Bugs go from simply annoying bugs, like enemies getting stuck in props or suddenly stop fighting for no reason, to major ♥♥♥♥ups as the game crashing altogether.The game is not bad on itself. It's Arkham City, just a bit bigger with a few new missions. I got it on a sale for $10.. wait until it gets to $7.50 to get it and you can probably overlook the horrible bugfest to have some fun :3			"

Batman is awesome! EVERYTHING is just awesome! <Yes I did just use awesome alot> My only complaint is is that some of the areas on the map are copy and pasted from Arkham City. Now I really don't have a HUGE problem with that because I mean it is after all a part of Gotham City it's just that like it looks pretty much EXACTLY like it does on ""City"". like the broken windows and all that other stuff. Like wth? But still! GREAT game! The story is aweosme! The multiplayer is incredible! Imean I die like every five sceonds but I still love it! :D So yes.

												A really good game, and answers many questions prior to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Still riddled with some annoying bugs & glitches here and there, but doesn't take away the experience in general.City seems to be less atmospheric than in Arkham City, however the character is usually involved in missions rather than adventuring throughout the city, in that case, i'm pretty fine with that.The details in Arkham Origins is near-perfect (at least to me). The characters and environments are well-detailed and nothing really important seems left out.Main story takes about 10-14 hours.Final Verdict: 7/10			"

Personally I found the online to be a strange addition to the game, there are plenty of better/more polished 3rd person shooters out there and as a fan of the single player/challenge mode I would have preferred it to be a beat em up for online rather than a shooter.

												First, this game is no Arkham City, although it tries too hard to be be.It's not bad but nor great either. The story is fantastic has explore the begining of the relationships that Batman builds during his career. The Joker scenes are probably the best part of the game.But the gameplay is not innovative. The boss fights are easier, probably the easiest in all the series so far. Especially the Deathstroke fight is too early in the game and the Bane fights (except for the last one) are too rinse and repeat.The puzzles are ok but easier compared to the previous games.The extra costumes are awesome. The online multiplayer is down, but then again I bought this game for the single player campain.Get this game on discount. Don't buy it on full price.			"

The Batman is back (or maybe is starting as this is supposed to be the ""Origins"") with lots of cool fights and moves. The main story arc was also really nice.The movement of the Batman felt a bit more awkward than last two games, but maybe it was because I'm getting old, or because I was using the XBox controller with this series for the first time. Some of the combat scenes were awesome! At least the one with Deathstroke, Copperhead and Firefly were top notch...			"

												The Arkham series has been setting the bar for melee combat for some years now.  So Origins has big shoes to fill.   Fans have gotten used to an unbelievable experience AND a serious evolution in gaming style each time a batman is released.  So it’s understandable why Origins has gotten poor reviews especially from fanboys.  What Origin actually turned out to be was an excellent game cut in the same mold of Arkham City, but without any evolution in gameplay. Putting the fanboyism aside the game is not a money grab by copy and pasting City.  It’s just a solid game in the series and well worth anyone’s time. To be fair however Origins has some serious problems that are odd considering their nature.  Having basic bugs still in core gameplay mechanics months after release is a huge bone for fans to pick.  Especially since we didn’t see those bugs in the two previous games and this new developer had Rocksteady’s work to build on.  The worst problem still unresolved is what I call a hitbox (I am sure it has a real name) basically when the cursor is placed over an object the command will flash and allow you to use the key.  In Origin I frequently had near game breaking problems with the hitbox.  Trying to quickly go from perch to perch was nearly impossible in this game.  I could put my cursor over the location and it just refused to allow me to go there.  Sometimes it would just be a delay of a second but other times it would never register.  This ruined a key part of a batman game and got me killed countless times. I would rate the Plot and theme done by this developer a B or B-, it’s not something I found interesting but it was enjoyable.  I think the bottom line with Origins is that you have to take it for what it is; it’s another 20 hours or so in Arkham City with some new twists that will marginally intrigue you.  Is it a true successor to the Arkahm family no, but it’s worth 50-60% of full price.   My Score  75/100			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is the 3rd action-adventure gamein the Arkham series where you play as Batman in Gotham. Arkham Asylum, the first, was great. Arkham City, the second, was even better, even though the story did get convoluted at times just to fit in all the content. Arkham Origins just feels like it's something to tide us over until Arkham Knight is finally released.The story is both better and worse than City. It definitely has more focus than City, which started off simple but had an incredibly convoluted build-up to the end.The gameplay is definitely worse, in both small things and bigger things. There are glitches where Batman can get stuck or enemies suddenly stop registering as enemies and just stand there looking goofy, ground takedowns seem to work only when they feel like it, and sometimes necessary encounters simply don't happen until you leave an area and come back. Mind you, this is with all the patches and fixes that are likely to ever be applied this is as good as it gets. It never gets so bad that it makes Origins unplayable, but it's just not as polished as City.Multiplayer had so much potential, it was awesomely paced, had an easy to understand objective, well balanced set of teams and skill ceilings. Servers wouldn't save data for the opening week though and no one played it again. Sucks to see such squandered potential.Pros:+ Another installment into the Batman franchise+ Good Plot+ Improved and interesting boss fights+ Great voice acting+ Incredible amount of side quests and other things to do, albeit it was poorly paced+ Incredibly fun multiplayer if you can get a group of friends to play with youCons:- Basically just Arkham City rebooted; Same combat and gadget system as Arkham City- Bigger map but somehow more boring to explore- Multiplayer that dropped the ball on launch- Plethora of bugs and glitches scattered around the gameTL;DR7/10Fun game if you like the Batman story, gameplay-wise and innovation-wise you're better off playing Batman Arkham City or Knight. I definitely got my money's worth but it wasn't as fun as the previous.			"

												While not as good as the other Arkham games, it is still a great game. The story is interesting, and the dialogue is well written. It is very straight to the point, and the story makes it clear that this game is all about the boss fights, and in that regard, it doesn't dissapoint. The boss fights are varied, and very fun. From the hand-to-hand fight with Deathstroke, demanding split second timing and reflexes, to the surreal brawl with Copperhead, and the tactical stealth ancounter with Deadshot, this game will keep you busy with each passing boss fight.Sadly, I can not say the same for the side missions. It is the same thing we've been doing since Asylum. Scan this, collect that, go there. Not much variety at all. It doesn't help that you're doing this on the same map as Arkham City. Sure, they have added new areas, but it doesn't offer much in terms of variety. It is hard to know your way around the map, when everything looks the same. They say in the game that you have to go to the industrial district, but the entire city looks like an industrial district! In fact, like Arkham City, the entire city looks like a war zone in an industrial district. It makes sence in City, being a cut off part of the city for prisoners, but in Origins, that is not the case. Things are on fire, the bridge is covered with piles of crates, broken cars and criminal activity. And navigating it has gotten harder. I swear they have reduced the amount of grapple points in the city. Even in places where there is no logical reason why I wouldn't be able to grapple, I can't. It gets very frustrating. And there are fewer things you can climb up on. Sometimes you can clumb up on objects that are, maybe, 3 and a half meters tall. At other times, you can't even climb up on something waste high.Then there's the gadgets. You won't find much in terms of variety here either. Most of the gadgets are just altered versions of the old ones, or the exact same ones. But they do the job. If I have one major criticism of the gadgets, it is one that applies for all of the Arkham games. The gadgets are a bit far fetched. They feel out of place. It feels like they belong in a sci-fi game. They explosive gel has no reason to be a gel. In the comics and other media, Batman frequently carries explosive charges. Why does it have to be gel here? It feels a bit contrived. And why does he have to spray it in the shape of a bat symbol? Wouldn't that just take more time? And the disruptor looks like some sort of plasma rifle. I don't mind what the gadgets do, I just think they look a bit to futuristic. But that is just preference on my part.All in all, I think it is a really good game. Its charm doesn't lie in its open world, or the side activities. It lies in the boss fights,, the the different levels and the characters. If that is what you're looking for, then I wholeheartedly recommend Arkham Origins. But if you are looking for a great open world game, with a lot of things to do, I recommend waiting for Arkham Knight, or pick up Arkham city which, while not very good at side activities either, does at least offer more grapple points, and climbable ledges, making the city easier, and more enjoyable to navigate.

												While it can be said its just a reskinned arkham city, there Is much more too it than that. Personally I found the story and amount of side missions much more enjoyable than AC. It was like the first time I watched Dark Knight, type of a feel. which is great. If it weren't for the bugs/crashing on the PC port I would rate it a lot higher. Its my favorite of the series so far and It lets you be batman in a video game where you actually feel like your batman. unlike prior batman games. If your a fan, or you haven't played any of the prior Arkham games Id recomend you pick this one up. Id even say before the others.			"

It's always the same actions and moves, combat is buggy and a silly ""press counter button""-design. I don't know how people that stand away 15m can still hit me with their fists, just because they started their slo-mo punch when I was standing next to them.There are way better designed and still challenging stealth games around.Don't waste your money on any of these Batman games...

												A misunderstood game with a bumpy start, Arkham Origins is an often-maligned yet fun and gripping prequel to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Visually, the game is superb. Even on low settings, the snow-covered streets of Gotham are a sight to behold. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, and taking on rooms of thugs and mercenaries by yourself is still as fun as it first was back in 2009. You actually feel like Batman at certain moments in the game, and the side-quests (which involve tracking down and stopping crimes in progress and the schemes of minor villains) are fun distractions from the main story.Multiplayer is finnicky, but it might appeal to some people. I would recommend the game for the singleplayer alone, as you're guaranteed to get a lot of time out of that. All-in-all, I would give this an 8.5 out of 10, docking points for the disappointing plot twist halfway through the game, user-unfriendly multiplayer, and occasional bugs that pop up in free roam. Buy it on sale if you're hesitant about the game or new to the series. Only buy it full-price if you're a fan of the other Arkham games or a diehard Batman fan.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is the 3rd action-adventure gamein the Arkham series where you play as Batman in Gotham. Arkham Asylum, the first, was great. Arkham City, the second, was even better, even though the story did get convoluted at times just to fit in all the content. Arkham Origins just feels like it's something to tide us over until Arkham Knight is finally released.The story is both better and worse than City. It definitely has more focus than City, which started off simple but had an incredibly convoluted build-up to the end.The gameplay is definitely worse, in both small things and bigger things. There are glitches where Batman can get stuck or enemies suddenly stop registering as enemies and just stand there looking goofy, ground takedowns seem to work only when they feel like it, and sometimes necessary encounters simply don't happen until you leave an area and come back. Mind you, this is with all the patches and fixes that are likely to ever be applied this is as good as it gets. It never gets so bad that it makes Origins unplayable, but it's just not as polished as City.Multiplayer had so much potential, it was awesomely paced, had an easy to understand objective, well balanced set of teams and skill ceilings. Servers wouldn't save data for the opening week though and no one played it again. Sucks to see such squandered potential.Pros:+ Another installment into the Batman franchise+ Good Plot+ Improved and interesting boss fights+ Great voice acting+ Incredible amount of side quests and other things to do, albeit it was poorly paced+ Incredibly fun multiplayer if you can get a group of friends to play with youCons:- Basically just Arkham City rebooted; Same combat and gadget system as Arkham City- Bigger map but somehow more boring to explore- Multiplayer that dropped the ball on launch- Plethora of bugs and glitches scattered around the gameTL;DR7/10Fun game if you like the Batman story, gameplay-wise and innovation-wise you're better off playing Batman Arkham City or Knight. I definitely got my money's worth but it wasn't as fun as the previous.			"

It brings back the origins of Batman being in a situation that he's about to begin before he did his wildest adventures in Asylum and City. 8.7/10Singleplayer:This is a great story in Campaign while you're fighting againest assassins and roaming around the city. The 8 Assassins are quiet what we didn't expect. The Joker makes a brief appearance when he turned out to pull the plug on Batman, and me must stop him on his first time meeting him. Black Mask puts a bounty on his face, and he must survive the night and evade the GCPD and the Assassins getting the bountyMultiplayer:It sucks Worst things ever in batman history Laggy, Glitchy, Buggy. You should've tried HARDER!!!! Q A TEST IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  .Overall:It's a Decent Game but very Glitchy, but that doesn't stop the game ruining it self. The Developers, WB Games Montreal did a bad job. I hope Rocksteady comes back with a better game.Verdict:6.7/10 Worst Arkham Game in the Franchise.			"

												Arkham Origins is a love story about two men who have an unhealthy, obsessive and mentally/physically abusive relationship. One of them enjoys wearing tight black leather, boots, ropes and various toys he hangs from his belt.The other likes to haphazardly smear on make-up, and die his hair rad colors and wear bright multi-colored clothing.The black-clad ""bear"" often beats his ""sub"" while the sub laughs manically. Just when you think it's going to go too far, ""safe"" phrases like ""You won't kill me! HAHAHA"" and ""DO IT HAHAHA KILL ME! You can't can you?!"" show that behind all the seething and gritted teeth, there is a mutual respect between these two love bats.Even though it made me puke, I enjoyed this game, like too much booze.

												While its debatable where this ranks in the series of Arkham games, one thing's for sure...we're going to have a lot more Batman. At first I was opposed to WB throwing together a new studio to create filler Arkham games while Rocksteady tooled away on their next creation, but you know what? I don't mind so much anymore. Arkham Origins might not be the most polished title but it certainly is just as fun as the previous two installments. You have the same great gameplay you're used two, new villains from the DC universe, and some more backstory to our brooding hero (and villains). The multiplayer is flawed but I like that they took the risk of building something out because it's open for improvement (for future iterations). I'm looking forward to the Mr. Freeze DLC and hopeful (fingers crossed) that the time taken to create this new content will be worth the wait.My biggest gripe that doesn't spoil any sort of story aspect of the game are the costumes. Costumes that you can purchase or unlock but can't equip in the campaign until you've played through the game at least ONCE. That's a big gamble for WB to assume that we as gamers and consumers have the patience to play this again. Yes you can change your costume on the Challenge maps but not all of want to play that mode. If there was a cheat in the main menu (like Arkham City) that allowed to temporarily unlock costume play for that play session, I think everything would be fine (who knows, maybe this is in the pipeline).Minus my complaint about the costumes, I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit. Having had some time to think about it post completion; I'd give this a solid 7.5 with room to improve with the new DLC.			"

												The game itself is fine. It plays fine, the story is not bad. There are times where the game will show glitches, such as Batman falling THROUGH THE GROUND, or landing in water when he should be landing on the ground. Those, quite frankly, shouldn't bother anyone too much as they aren't too bad. Now, I am not too familiar with all the glitches, however I can tell you: STAY AWAY FROM 'MY ALIBI'. After you fight Bane, there will be a prompt to go after someone called The Bird. There are three places you travel to in order to complete the mission. The last place is 'My Alibi.' When I played it, I did the mini-boss fight with The Bird, then I was able to walk around. I walked into an adjacent room which turned black, as if I were between layers. Then I tried to leave the building but got stuck, so I restarted the game. When I continued the game, I saw Batman stuck in limbo, completely rendering the game broken. I've checked around and I see that it is a common glitch that occurs.I have only had this game for about a month, so whatever updates occured to fix this problem never carried over to when I bought it. I'm recommending this game because as I have said, it is fine and most of the glitches aren't too bad. All you need to do though, to be safe, is to completely avoid going into 'My Alibi.'			"

												At its core, Akrham Origins is a game that delivers more of what made Arkham City great. It stayed true to the combat and stealth priniciples from the previous games. The places where the game tried to expand the franchises didn't fare as well, like investigating crimes through Detective Mode, however this was not to the detrement of the game overall. I like how the game used the origin story to explore Batman's relationship withe The Joker. Looking forward to where the series goes in the next game.			"

												Such a great game, beside the few bugs that it's got which dont occur that much.Only happened twice for me.The story line seems dull at first but as it progreses it gets really really great.The combat is so much better than Arkham: Asylum or City.The ending is insane.I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a memorable Batman experience.8/10 would've given 9/10 if there were no bugs.

												While its debatable where this ranks in the series of Arkham games, one thing's for sure...we're going to have a lot more Batman. At first I was opposed to WB throwing together a new studio to create filler Arkham games while Rocksteady tooled away on their next creation, but you know what? I don't mind so much anymore. Arkham Origins might not be the most polished title but it certainly is just as fun as the previous two installments. You have the same great gameplay you're used two, new villains from the DC universe, and some more backstory to our brooding hero (and villains). The multiplayer is flawed but I like that they took the risk of building something out because it's open for improvement (for future iterations). I'm looking forward to the Mr. Freeze DLC and hopeful (fingers crossed) that the time taken to create this new content will be worth the wait.My biggest gripe that doesn't spoil any sort of story aspect of the game are the costumes. Costumes that you can purchase or unlock but can't equip in the campaign until you've played through the game at least ONCE. That's a big gamble for WB to assume that we as gamers and consumers have the patience to play this again. Yes you can change your costume on the Challenge maps but not all of want to play that mode. If there was a cheat in the main menu (like Arkham City) that allowed to temporarily unlock costume play for that play session, I think everything would be fine (who knows, maybe this is in the pipeline).Minus my complaint about the costumes, I actually enjoyed this game quite a bit. Having had some time to think about it post completion; I'd give this a solid 7.5 with room to improve with the new DLC.			"

												I had to write a quick review on the 3 things that made me 1 crap myself from excitement and 2 buy the game. 1 is the challenge maps, 2 is the new villians + younger joker and non venom bane, 3 f**king deathstroke (you get to play with him period). Haven't played the story yet but the gameplay footage on youtube looks cool, but i doubt im touching it for at least a week while i play with deathstrokes staff :D. 1 more thing, update your video cards or you'll be stuck at 1120x992 resolution at max and that will suck.Enjoy			"

												I remember being excited for this when it came out, but then got influenced by others saying it was just mediocre, that the 'detective' work left something to be desired. I ended up putting Arkham Origins down after beating Deathstroke. I have recently started playing it again, and I gotta say, it is _always_ satisfying to jump into a mob of baddies and punch them in the face while avoiding their attacks. The story is fun, the action is great, and who cares about 'mediocre detective work?' The point is you're BATMAN, so of course he's going to make deducing any crime scene trivial. If you like Batman, and the previous games, or Shadow of Mordor, this game is for you. If you set it down like I did, pick it back up, dust off those electrified gauntlets, and put the hurt on some baddies!			"

												So far I have 16 hours in Asylum(100%), 34 in City(Main Story, all Riddler bull♥♥♥♥, and DLC) And 23 in this game; ""Arkham Origins"", to me this is part of the franchise, it is a bit glitchy but the story, refined gameplay which is the best so far in the series(IMO) and better side missions really made it up to me. I don't get a lotta the hate, but I enjoyed this engrossing game. I still prefer city, but THAT'S ARKHAM CITY AND THIS ISN'T EVEN BY ROCKSTEADY! I loved the boss battles which felt intense and challenging, The DLC was also great, and the crime scene addition is impeccable. So far this is my ranking1. Arkham City2. Arkham Asylum3. Arkham OriginsPros:StoryGameplayLots of ContentCons: Glitchy Feels lazy by only re-doing the map and adding a few districts.Verdict:8.5/10Worth the money and a fun game to play. Pick it up whenever, preferably on sale like I did because it is a little bit glitchy.However I can understand something like the flying animation glitch, because that seems like it would be impossible to fix. But I had one crash, two checkpoint restart glitches(I was stuck and invincible.), and sometimes I had to get collectables a second time even though it saved afterwardss.			"

												******REVISION*******My original opinion was that this game had major flaws that didn't let it hold up to Asylum and Arkham City. I stand by that opinion. This game STILL has some problems but a little bit of hindsight makes me realize that the other two Arkham games are phenomenal, and if I compare this to them, Origins falls short. However Arkham Origins on its own merit is a playable, enjoyable Batman game. Some of the story in the later parts of the game is acutally quite good. It's a shame that the most interesting parts of the story are at the end where a large majority of players will never get to. There is some psychological insight into the relationship of Batman and one of his major enemies that I've not seen in quite that way before. I said this in my original, brief review but I got a kick out of the early character models for penguin and some of the other rougues from the Batman gallery. If you can get to the last third of the game there are some good story beats in there. The combat is flawed but you can adjust to it. I've changed my recommendation from a no to a reserved yes. You still feel like the Bat.....and that is pretty cool.**********End Edit************************** I paid $5 for Arkham Asylum GOTY. I paid $30 for Arkham Origins. It should have been the other way around. I'm only two hours in and things may change but it feels like this third installment is a step backwards. The fighting doesn't have quite the right rythm to it. Animations often times slide just a little bit to far from one side to the other in order to make a fight sequence work. There are some issues that even early on just don't make sense. This is an origins story, so why does Batman have all the devices that he had in the later games? I will say that seeing the ""younger"" version of some of the characters from this version of the world is neat. I'm going to continue playing but unless you're a die hard, I don't feel like I could recommend this version without a MAJOR sale.			"

												Now that I've finished it and everyone sort of looks down on it might as well review it. I've enojoyed my time with Arkham Origins not only because of the differences it had from Asylum and City but because of its dark atmosphere. The boss fights (excluding Bane) weren't constanly being drawn out with ""Venom"" and there were less chores to do all around. Asylum didn't have this problem but with City I saw every villian as an annoyance whereas Origins' villians threatened something I cared about. The end of this game wasn't a bulky boss fight but more so an outlet for you to taste revenge and release Batman's anger. I am absolutely satisfied with this pickup that costed about 7$ on GMG.			"

												Unlike too many open world games in recent memory, Batman: Arkham games don't fall into the trap of giving you a world packed out the ears with boring menial tasks.  If you took away the world and put Batman in a room fulll of thugs, this game could still easily stand on its own.The combat encourages timing over button mashing, improvisation over spamming, and thoughtfulness over bullheadedness.  The stealth gameplay is a rare example of one that blends in so well the action rather than taking away from it.			"

												Long story short: I LOVE THIS GAME!Before starting, let's just be clear about the things I didn't like:- If you want to complete the ranks of Worst Nightmare, you MUST do it during the story line, because the Predator rooms do not respawn after you complete them during the story. This is a real pain in the butt if you completed the story line. I even had to play the I Am The Night mode (you die, you start all over again) for completing this rank.- The same condition of ""finishing the ranks just during the story"" make the ""challenge maps"" unatractive. And besides, you just get achievements if you get ALL of the medals. I mean, c'mon! at least give me an achievement for getting almost all of them!- Sometimes (not often, but it happened to me a couple of times) bugs will make you restart to the last checkpoint. As an example, I was fighting the last boss, and suddenly Batman and the boss stopped moving and just stared at each other... It was kinda funny, thou.Said this, let's go to everything I totally loved:-The whole story is something amazing! whorty of any comic book!. I would go into details, but I don't want to spoil anything. I just loved it so much that playing the normal, new game plus, and I am the night mode was a total pleasure. The only ""but"" is that I consider it to be too short, compared with Arkham City, but it is compensated by the many side stories that are allowed by the Most Wanted missions.- You gotta love Barbara Gordon <3- I do think this game makes the Batman to be more a detective than the previous games, which is a very fun thing to play. It's kinda easy thou, since the Batman does everything for you. - If you can, buy the DLC Cold, Cold Heart. The way they explain the origins of Mr. Freeze is stunning! - The gameplay is, as always, something intuitive. I played Arkham City like... two years ago? and now I just graved the PS3 controller (yes, **** you, Microsoft!) and it was like riding a bike... people don't forget!- Getting all the collectibles, all the upgrades, all the tags, everything, will give you lots and lots of hours of gameplay. I did reach 100 hours of gaming just with the singleplayer mode (my brother also played the game, so, I didn't actualy play that amount of time). I might have taken my time, thou, I'm sure you can do it faster.About the price, yes, 30 dollars for all the time I played is worthy, but yet, that amount of money for just one game is kinda too much for me. I got this game during the Summer Sales, and those 7.5 USD I did spend for this game are one of the best buying I have ever made. But, If you're ok about paying 30 USD for one game, I'm telling you, DO IT!! you wont regret!.I can't really talk about the multiplayer mode. I'm not too much into playing online, then I just tried it for a while. It was fun.Summary: GO FOR IT!			"

												I recently finished Batman : Arkham Origins. Always been a huge fan of the Arkham series and this game did not disappoint! I played it for around 12.5 hours, completed the story and most of the side quests (aside from Enigma and the escaped inmates)It's definitely a solid game and I personally feel it deserves 7.5/10. It was well worth the 9.98$ I spent (the game and its season pass cost me 4.99$ each), couldn't be happier! Thank Gaben for Steam Sales! That being said, I doubt I would be this cheerful had I paid the full price for the game and the season pass (19.99$ each). As you all know, no game is perfect and there were a few things that bugged me. Of course, there were also some positive points about this very successful game by WB Games Montréal, so let's talk about them. Starting with the good stuff.*Boss fights - each boss fight felt unique and intense. The devs impressed me in this category. These fights were fun and left me wanting for more.*Setting - What can I say? It's always fun to glide around Gotham City in the middle of winter, looking for thugs to beat up and serve some sweet justice.*Story & Dialogue - They did a very good job in this department, plus the cut scenes were really good. I especially enjoyed how well Batman and Alfred worked together. The butler's banter and affection for Bruce adds a little something to the game.*Fast Travel - Nice little addition to the series, after playing the game for hours and hours, you may want to skip gliding across districts and just take the Batwing.*Solving Crimes -  The crimes are one of the highlights of the game. The Bat is the world's greatest detective so it's always a pleasure watching him work.Now to list some of the small complaints I've got....*A longer story - I could not help myself from wanting more! I think I finished the main story in just 8 or 9 hours. Would be great if the story was just a little bit longer.*I badly wanted to wear other suits but I had to finish the main story first! That was not the case in Arkham City as the developers released the cheat codes. Wish they would have done something similar for Origins.*I noticed only policemen, thugs and victims were out on the streets. I wish there were more people that I can see and interact with. I think the reason that they were indoors was because of a curfew but I wanted to see more people in Gotham. Maybe a girl is being mugged and I get to save her. An old couple walking in the park and suddenly there are thugs who want to cause trouble. Batman just so happens to be around and saves the day. Something like that.Again, they're all very minor and I am happy with the game. Thank you to everyone involved in making this game! I highly recommend it! Looking back, I still feel that there was not enough time between Origins and Arkham City to make any revolutionary changes...in other words, not enough innovation but I can't deny that it is a damn good game.

												(I don't recommend this game. I somewhat-recommend it. There is no in between for Steam reviews, but that is exactly how I feel with this title.)My initial thoughts on this game were overwhelmingly negative; I found myself uninstalling it after 8 grueling hours of stressing over when the next game breaking glitch would occur and it felt refreshing to rid myself of this game's torture. However, I attempted a new game recently just because I had a hankering for some Batman: Arkham-style combat and here I am now, having just finished the campaign without a single save-corrupting, fall-through-the-floor, get-stuck-in-a-building-glitch occuring. And, I have to say that now that I've experienced the game the way it was meant to be experienced I can say that this is a deserving entry in the Arkham series, from a creative standpoint. Strictly. From a creative standpoint.Why is it a creative standpoint you ask? Because the developers of Origin are technologically inept and couldn't program better than a monkey with a brain tumor. Okay, that might be a little too much, but seriously, let me tell you about these developers.Warner Brothers Montreau's first game was Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition. It was a special edition Wii U version of the award winning Batman: Arkham City, and it was alright. It was essentially Arkham City with a little gloss and a dash of confetti to spice it up. Then they made a web-based game that I don't know anything about.Then they made Batman: Arkham Origins. This game.Now get this: The developer has worked with this engine before, with the Armored Edition of Arkham City. Now they're using the same map and the same engine ONCE MORE, except this time their making an entirely new game instead of just an enhanced edition.So you'd think they'd be fairly competent with their game's techincal quality right?Nope. Nada. Nuh-uh. Sorry. Zip. Zilch. NO.The game was released with more bugs than a bug petting zoo set on a planet inhabited entirely by humanoid bug creatures. OK, they were rushed by the publisher! Big deal! Ok, sure, maybe they were ""rushed"" for the release. HOWEVER, get this, in February the developers stated the following: ""The team is currently working hard on the upcoming story DLC and there currently are no plans for releasing another patch to address the issues that have been reported on the forums,""and later that the game:""will unfortunately no longer be addressed.""They did say they would fix gamebreaking and progression stopping issues somewhere during that article, however those issues still exist, so it doesn't matter.HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PATCH YOUR GAME!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, OH GOD I'M GOING FULL ON JOKER HERE HAHA HA HA!Another interesting thing: the game hasn't had a patch since April, if you look at the Steam news under the game. So it's true. The game is forgotten. Completely inexplicably forgotten, for no reason other than that the developers just said no.Now that this rant is over, I'll tell you why I think Arkham Origins is a good Batman game.The following pros and cons are in the context of this game being the same game as Arkham City, which it pretty much is, but with a different story. So feel free to add any of the pros and cons for that game into here.Pros+ Combat is improved greatly; there are several new enemy types, each a joy to fight. Combat is also smoother, and the animations seem to flow better.+ Graphics are better. They're not next-gen, in fact they're essentially Arkham City's graphics just enhanced with new visual effects here and there.+ Story is awesome. As much as I disdain some aspects of this game, notably the developers, I applaud the plot here. It draws heavily upon Batman mythos and one of my favorite Batman graphic novels: The Killing Joke. Though I suppose the writers had nothing to do with the programming so huzzah for the writers!+ The game is generally more cinematic, with superior cut scenes when compared to the previous two entries.+ New voice actors for Batman and Joker were well cast and do an excellent job+ Character design is awesome, Copperhead looks genuinely cool, Bane is actually treated as Bane for once (super strong, but also super smart) Deathstroke looks cool.An interesting addition to Origins was the detective segments, which are greatly improved over the previous games' attempts. However, I'm not going to add this as a specific Pro since i believe that it's simply not significant enough, they're essentially pseudo-quicktime events that look cool but nothing more.Cons- The game is buggy. Very. Very buggy.- The developers do not care about their customers.- The game heavily relies on rehashing content from the first two games and rarely adds anything of its own.- The open world here is empty and less interesting. It may seem like there are more things to do in Origins when compared to City, but in actuallity there isn't a lot. Collecting extortion files is boring compared to solving riddles, the side missions are boring and not as well written, the random goon voices you'll hear throughout the city are downright dreadful to listen to, they never say anything cool or funny and you'll hear the same lines OVER and OVER the entire game. I remember smirking and being genuinely interested in what the goons in Arkham City had to say. Here? Nope. Also, I hate to make this single con in an already long-winded review so long, but the opening of Arkham City was seriously cool, wheareas the opening here is very, very lackluster. Sorry, I just needed to say that.I'm not going to add a con for this, since it wouldn't really be fair, but I always note when games have Nvidia's Physx technology. Unless you have an Nvidia graphics card or a NASA processor, you can't enable this without suffering massive FPS drops. In game there's lots of cool cloth simulation and papers/flyers flying about among other things when you have it activated. It's been said elsewhere and I'll say it here, my graphics card is capable of these things but Nvidia, being a greedy company made it to where you simply cannot efficiently use this technology on anything other than Nvidia cards. Games should be played the way the developers meant them to be played, not the way greedy companies meant them to be played (yes, Nvidia pun).In all, I'd give Arkham Origins a 6/10. It's worth a playthrough if you liked the first games, for its story and the improvements made to combat. If you've never played an Arkham title, please go back and play Arkham Asylum or City first.I'd rate the developers of this game a 4/10. The only reason they don't go any lower is because somewhere within that cesspool of ""gaming development"" there are writers and creative directors who did a remarkable job trying to follow up an award winning series with their own take. And for that, I feel they deserve a commendation. For the rest of them? Please learn how to program before making a AAA-title, and always put technical stability above more content. How can we play the new content if we can't play the game? Oh, you hear that? I think it's the sound of ""logic"".WARNING: Know this if you buy the game, there are still game breaking bugs present. You MAY run into them, and you MAY lose hours of progress, though some people never even experience one of them, others, like myself ran into TWO in my first 8 hours. It took three new games before I finally was able to beat the game. There are some workarounds out there for the majority of them, as well as backing up your saves.TL;DR: The game is okay and worth it for fans of the series but the developers used mostly rehashed content, then botched the rehashed content somehow producing a truck load of bugs and now refuse to fix it and instead want to make more money with DLC.

												this is a spoilerfree review of the entire gameI have no idea why this arkham game is getting so much more♥♥♥♥♥♥thrown at. Ill review it on its own but let me at least say that compared to the other games it holds up just as well. like seriously I imagined it being a monstrous piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥becuse unlike arkham asylum and arkham city I never see it being talked about let alone glorified which kind of made it look like a mistake that should be forgotten. nevertheless it wasnt.The story is pretty much what you'd expect. You are batman and you are trying to keep the people of gotham safe and put all the bad guys in the jails hospital. The bad guys are almost all very well known classic batvillains. gameplaywise you do 3 things:1 fly around in the city going from one sidequest or quest to another (the city being so big that you will probably use quicktravel at some point.) the mechanics of grappling and flying are very well done. you dont exactly controll where you grapple though which can lead to you going to places you didnt want to go to, but not very often. in this open world you can also get a ton of collectibles. (I miss the way the riddler presented those though)2: melee beat ups. here the classic combo-fighting style the series has become known for shines. and despite different types of enemies it isnt that hard to win a fight most of the time.3: stealth. and here is my problem. I SUCK at stealth. Hitman and dishonored always became a shooter at some point for me. one of the problems I have here though is that the controls are somewhat impresize somtimes. like I just wanna slide in a ventilation shaft and I stylishly throw myself over a railing towards the enemy. or I try to silently and deadly land behind an enemy and smack on the ground in front of him. that being said though you have a lot of gadgets to assist you. so maybe if you dont suck you will have fun here to. I got frustrated enough to ignore one of the bad guys who was only accesable via sidequest, because it was a stealth fight with him. I watched a vid on what happens though and its not very story relevant or interesting.and also I guess 4: boss battles, but those are usually a combination of 2, 3 and a couple gadgets.the looks are good enough but I have to say I am not an FPS junkie meaning I dont cry when the framerate drops beneath 60 FPS because I dont even know what that would look like. to me it really never was an issue. other technical issues are occasinal bugs and glitches. somtimes they even can be gamebreaking. thats basicaly all the negative stuff I have to say.If you liked the other arkham games you will like this one to and if you are new to the series this is as good a game to start with as the others, with the advantage of being a prequel and therefor letting you experience everything chronologically if you start here.

												This game is good & comparable to Arkham City in many ways.  In fact, a lot of assets from AC look like they were used in this game.  The downside is it's not AC & it's hard to say whether it's better or worse than AC in general because there are a lot of issues with this game that keep it from greatness, but it also adds a lot more to the game as well.PROS-Large open City to Explore (roughly 3-4x larger than AC)-More Villains & Boss Fights-Same great combat system-Even more gadgets & upgradesCONS-Bugs & Glitches-Performance Issues (DX10 Fix Needed)-Feels Copy/Pasted from AC-WB has no intentions of fixing what's brokeFEATURESA good example of something good this game adds is the way you unlock certain abilities by completing challenges.  This may seem tedious at first & in the end it actually is, but it does add a bit more depth to how you earn & unlock certain gadgets.  The downside is all the gadgets in this game are all just carbon copies from AC with very few new additions.  The best new addition to your arsenal would be the Grapnel Hook which allows you to silently take out enemies from a distance or crowd control during combat.  Another new addition is the Concussion Grenade but I found it fairly useless.  It's only use is crowd controlling one target & it only stuns for about a second.  It's hot key is also set up in such a way that it's hard to quickfire so I never found myself using it.There are also detective segments that are kind of interactive cut scenes where you rewind/fast forward to find clues hidden in the area.  These aren't a huge addition & don't really make you feel like a detective since it just feeds you everything you need to know.  It would have been more interesting to have actual puzzles or something to make you feel like a detective looking for clues at a crime scene like in L.A. Noire.  How is Batman the ""World's Greatest Detective"" if he just lets his computer do all the work for him?The campaign in this game is done very well & is probably the only thing in this game that's better than AC.  It's set up around the period where Batman first meets The Joker & the main story is about Black Mask hiring all sorts of assassins to ""Kill The Bat"" during Christmas Eve, with a good plot twist near the end. It's extremely well done.  The voice actors are all A grade & the guy playing Joker does an excellent job of imitating Mark Hamill's Joker.  Honestly, you probably wouldn't know it isn't MH playing him unless you read the credits.  There is also a lot more to do in this game than in AC.  Well over twice the amount of content, with a city almost 3x (maybe more?) it's size.  This means more collectibles & many more Riddler items you will need to collect in order to beat him.  There is also a fast travel where you call your jet to pick you up & drop you off.  You do need to unlock towers that Riddler has locked down in order for your auto-pilot to find you & you can't unlock them all right away as some require gadgets that you unlock through the story.   The city is huge & full of things to find & there's also random ""Crimes in Progress"" that happen periodically that will keep you busy well after completing the game.There are also several more enemies & boss fights in this game.  The downside is that all the boss fights are full of fake difficulty.  Pretty much every boss in this game (with a few exceptions) you fight along side his minion cohorts.  Now the other games did this as well, but when they did it they gave you opportunities to take out many minions at once either by controlling bane or a giant mutant, but this one is set up with little to no actual devices for that.  Sometimes the boss may hit a minion, but most of the time he'll focus on you & when he does actually hit a minion by accident little to no damage is taken & it mostly serves as a short stun effect.GLITCHES & ISSUESThis game also has several glitches that WB has no intention of ever fixing & these range from minor failings to major oversights.  One in particular is in the beginning of the game in the first boss battle with Killer Croc.  When it triggers he will constantly flash invisible & most of the sound will stop working properly.  Another glitch involves interrogating certain enemies similar to Riddler henchmen in AC, except they can't be KO'd however this KO invulnerability will sometimes bug out & render the interrogates unable to interact with & requires a reload of a previous save.  Another annoying glitch is the 2x enemy speed that sometimes happens in free flow focus mode.  Enemies are supposed to be slower but sometimes they'll be much faster & nearly impossible to counter.  There's also a glitch that happens during gliding which seems to be an animation bug where you constantly go in/out of a dive.  It's not a huge issue but it should be noted.  Civilian faces are also very messed up looking with their eyebrows stretching beyond their forehead because of the forced expression that is on their faces.  First time I saw this I thought it was a glitch, but nope.  Every civilian seems to have high-arced eyebrows.  Also, they all seem to be men for some reason.  I guess WB didn't want to depict civilian women being attacked by male villains & then being saved by a male hero possibly to avoid SJW propaganda backlash.PERFORMANCEI found myself having to use a 'fix' to put the game in DX10 mode in order to actually play this game.  If you're experiencing any slowdown, long loading, or anything else you may need to do this as well.  This fix is mainly for those of us running older hardware.You'll need to find BMengine.ini in your game files, open it with notepad, CTRL+F ""AllowD3D11"".Set ""AllowD3D11"" to FALSE & ""AllowD3D10"" to TRUE.  This usually fixes several performance issues that people experience with older/lesser graphics cards while playing the game.  If you still experience problems try setting both to FALSE.  This will force the game to run in DX9 mode.The only feature the DX11 mode adds is better graphics & shading so if you don't mind the graphical downgrade & rather have a playable experience on an older machine this fix OVERALLOverall this game is good, but not as good as AC imo.  It's got a lot more to offer content wise but at times it can be too difficult & it's lack of polish when compared to its predecessors shows greatly.  It's still highly recommendable & worth playing.  You may even like it more than AC as a lot of people do.  For me it's great but not quite better than AC due to it's technical issues & lack of polish when it comes to glitches & animations.  If this were a more polished game it would be better than AC, hands down.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is a game made simply to cash in on the Arkharm's series success, so I was suprised when I found out that the game itself doesn't feel as cold and calculated as one would expect from a cash grab. Warner Bros. Montereal has hands down made one of my most favorite Batman origin stories to date. What they do here is something Hollywood should take notice of, if they ever decide to reboot Batman entirely. We don't need to see how the man became the bat all we need to see is what happens once he dons the cape and suit. In this regard I feel they peform quite amazingly. Now onto the gameplay, which still feels good even after three games. Some people would start getting tired, but I really do feel that this is Batman and it is the best way to play him. The gameplay overall escpecially the fighting is more refined than ever before. Although I do feel that the Predator sections are not designed as well in the past. Most of the times it feels like they are because what's a Batman game without making people scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? All in all it's a strong game and a great entry in the seires. The sidequests themselves I believe are really good although some lack the same creativity that in shown in Mad Hatter's story line. Deadshot for one is an example of it just coming up to getting a very tricky predator sequence that you have to pass to defeat him. Not as aswesome as the Wonderland you explore in Mad Hatters quest. FOR PEOPLE: Who want more Batman! The game is great and the storyline I dare say is second only to Arkham City.NOT FOR PEOPLE: Who can't see past the cash grab that it is, fine don't play it and you will just be missing out on a really great game.

												If I understand the general consensus correctly, the main criticism of  Arkham Origins  seems to be that it's just ""more of the same"" when compared to its awesome predecessors  Arkham Asylum  and  Arkham City.  And while I agree that  Origins  suffers from over-familiarity with the series' bag of tricks, I still enjoyed the hell out of it and would recommend it to any fan of the previous two games.It is true that, by now, taking down a roomful of thugs using Arkham's combat or stealth mechanics has become routine (assuming you've played the first two games). But it's also still incredibly fun. And given the series' typical excellence in storytelling and character design, it's always a thrill to return to the Arkhamverse.I'll leave out a specific discussion of the story, since some of the biggest joys in the Arkham games are the inevitable plot twists and surprise guest appearances. Suffice it to say that  Origins  boasts an impressive rogues gallery of familiar and new faces alike. Unlike in the previous two entries, the intensity of the narrative doesn't rise to a fever pitch so much as it maintains a steady (though never quite scalding) burn. For that reason, the ending feels rather abrupt.  Origins  also lacks the previous two games' intriguing (if largely unexplored) awareness of the hypocrisy of Batman's extra-legal crusade against crime. Nevertheless, it's still superior comic-book material; it won't make you think, but it will thoroughly entertain you.Aside from complaints about the over-familiar gameplay,  Origins  was also notorious for having bugs upon its release. Playing it in 2015, I didn't encounter anything game-breaking, even though I ran it on a laptop that I bought a couple years ago. I  did  run across a few glitches -- occasional stuttering or enemies getting trapped in corners -- but these only amounted to minor annoyances, and may have been due to my decidedly less-than-state-of-the-art setup. Overall, I think that the criticism of  Origins  as ""more of the same"" rings true, but still doesn't detract from it as an enormoursly entertaining experience. While I never got quite the same high from it as I did from  Asylum  or  City,  I was still satisfied throughout. Highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something to tide you over while  Arkham Knight  remains in limbo.			"

												Game's not going very good at the moment. Compared to Batman Arkham City, it's like a step backwards. Will play more before adding a better review.PROS1. Refer to Review on Batman : Arkham City2. BatarangsNever noticed how important it was to scout with. It's also possible to KO a thug with an electrified Batarang. CONS1. Bugsa. Takedowns do not trigger while at very close range, Batman will go into a fighting pose instead.b. Frozen thugs. Uploaded screenshot.c. Unclimbable locations. Uploaded screenshot.2. Grapnel GunHorrible. It's far worse compared to Batman : Arhkham City. How could the coding actually get worse? You reduced the range significantly, reduce the number of points you can grapnel on a building and you auto climb ledges when you grapnel to them. All bad ideas.3. Remote ClawAnother item to scroll through? Couldn't you just combine the Remote Claw into the Batclaw, so you get a 2-for-1?4. DisruptorHow often does one use it? Combine it into the Cryptographic Scanner so that it's used more often. Despite the fact that it can disable guns, I don't use it like that.5. Entering Floor GrillesIt is more intuitive to double tap Space rather than L-Ctrl Space. 6. Inverted Ledge TakedownIsn't this Batman's signature move? Why do you have to drop the body so it's noisy?7. Broken WallsToo many in unthematic places. E.g. A fully functional GCPD has crumbly walls? I can understand crumbly walls in a burning city that is left to rot but not one that is properly built up.8. Entering through a DoorWhy does Batman still walk through the main door? He's Batman.SUGGESTION1. Electrified BatarangsWith technology, it makes sense that Batman would turn them into mini-tasers.			"

												More of the same.That's really all that can describe this game. If you enjoyed Arkham City tremendously, you'll find Arkham Origins entertaining. The gameplay is the same, the story is very much familiar, and the characters themselves are much the same with a few cameo appearances.Still, the place this game excels is in its storytelling and the environments. Sure, it's more of the same, but you really get a feel for Gotham this time around. From the sewers to the Royal Hotel, you get plenty of sight seeing opportunities.If you're a fan of Batman, or the DC Universe in general, this game should give you a fun few hours.			"

												If you've played the previous Arkham games, you'll know what to expect. I had a lot of fun kicking♥♥♥♥♥as Batman for the 3rd time in this series, but it has gotten a bit repetitive. Some of the villains have been previously used and the gameplay is pretty much the same. If you haven't played any of these games, they mainly consist of 3rd person view combat along with Batman's cool gadgets. The boss battles are somewhat interesting, but in this particular game they're not as memorable as the previous games. Maybe it all depends on the difficulty setting you play through, but you could generally beat these bosses in 1-2 tries. I'm not saying they should be impossible to get through, but they were slightly above the combat you face from regular enemies. Still, it is interesting to play as a rookie Batman. I give this game a 3.5/5 and I recommend it.			"

												TLDR: The Batman Arkham saga continues in this prequel to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Arkham Origins had technical problems (bugs) but as far as I’m concerned, it’s still a fun game.  8/10If you’ve played the 2 previous Batman Arkham games you may remember that they were developed by a company called Rocksteady, who did a great job on them. This time around the game development was taken over by Warner Bros, and the quality has diminished, though the general feel of the game is similar to the previous games. Since Arkham Origins is a prequel, Batman is kind of making his debut in Gotham City with no allies other than his trusty butler Alfred. Nobody knows who or what he is and most people don’t even believe he exists. Gotham city is ruled by gangs and corrupt police, and just like the previous Batman games practically everyone you find on the streets is a thug just asking to have his head bashed (including a large number of cops). Your primary nemesis in this game is the crime boss Black Mask (not sure why he wears the mask since people already know his identity) though there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. Black Mask has put a huge bounty on Batman’s head, and a bunch of world class assassins are here to collect, including some familiar faces: Bane, Deathstroke, Firefly, etc.Just like the first 2 Arkham games, Arkham Origins is a third person half stealth/half beat ’em up action game making extensive use of the grapnel boost, which helps launch Batman into the air so he can soar around with his cape like a hang glider. Most of the bat tools from the previous games appear but the key mapping for some of them has been changed for some reason, and if you play the games back to back like I did, there may be some confusion as to why the developers made certain changes. The flow of combat is very similar to Arkham City though, so if you have decent reflexes you should be able to counter just about any enemy attack, as expected. A couple other noticeable differences from the previous games are the reworked skills system and the reduced number of collectibles. Now the skills that you can unlock at level ups are in a sort of horizontal tree, whereas in the first 2 games you could just pick whatever you wanted. If you’re like me and do a lot of side quests, you may find yourself unable to buy the good skills for a while since they’re locked behind story progress requirements. No critical hits for about half the game this time! As for the fewer/easier Riddler collectibles, this change is welcome to me since I’m not a big fan of searching out 500 collectibles in a game playthrough. Unfortunately to actually face the Riddler you still need to get all of them, which is a challenge even if you are actively trying to do it, armed with an online guide.Pros:+The story is pretty good, as expected from a Batman Arkham game. Some people have said that the game uses “third tier” villains, and I guess I can’t argue that point. But as long as they provide an interesting plot I don’t care. +This time the game encompasses the entire Gotham City, not just a small section of it (although it really isn’t that much bigger than Arkham City). The city map is now large enough that “fast travel” has been added, where you can quickly move around the map via the Batwing jet drop-off.  Again however, the city is filled with thugs to beat up, and since Arkham Origins is kind of an RPG (level ups and skill points) you may want to just glide through the city looking for fights to level up.+With the 8 “master” assassins who took up Black Mask’s bounty hunt, there are a lot of boss fights, each with different ways to take down your foes. My favorite is probably the Firefly boss fight.+There’s a pretty comprehensive multiplayer system, where you can level up and play as either a hero or villain, though there wasn’t as many players online as I’d like. The game is really better as single player.Cons:-This may not affect a lot of people, but for the first week or so, I couldn’t even get the game to start properly. I could get to the “click to start” splash screen but once I clicked, the game would crash out. The WB support was no help, they didn’t even respond to my message for about 2 weeks (and then it was an unhelpful reply). Fortunately, I found the answer online buried in some forums. (I had to force the game into Direct X 9). The last time I played the game, there were no game breaking bugs, so most problems seem to have been addressed by the game developers. I only fell through the floor a couple of times.Overall, like many AAA game titles, there were problems that were probably due to releasing the game too early, but it’s been a while now and the big stuff has been taken care of. If you enjoyed Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you should enjoy Arkham Origins. It’s just not much in the way of improvement. "

												Sadly, Arkham Origins can be easily summarized with a couple of words - conveyor belt cash grab. And it really is sad that WB Montreal didn't have the courage to try anything new of their own but instead take the previous game, tack on a surprisingly short story and do a compulsory check list on previous features which are here once against just because it would've been noticed if they weren't. Game itself delivers a tried and true Arkham series' gameplay, although with a healthy helping of bugs which are thankfully being patched out on regular basis, but has a certain degree of trouble when it comes to breakneck pace of the story, perhaps indicating cut content which could've evened out the pacing a bit. Challenge mode is a worthwhile addition that will have you sinking in a few hours for the experience and the addition of multiplayer works out surprisingly well all things considered, although it's probably going to be forgotten very quickly because it's simply not why you bought the game in the first place, unfortunately.

												I have played Asylum and City. Though Origins is by far the best. Huge improvements on characters and dialog. Overall the side missions still feel like chores as they do in any game. The main story though was awesome, you know when the end is coming and I was tempted to put the game down to avoid beating one of the best games this year. Looking forward to any expansion.In regards to the multiplayer, honestly I could do without it. Very cool concept Batman & Robin (2players) vs the world, but not for me. Seemed that there is a huge lack of communication between the two goodies while you gang members just brutalize the duo. Then again sometimes beat downs like that are fun in themselves.If you havent picked up any of these (how you have not is beyond me) I'd say start here. Then again it may kill any expectations of the first two.  "

												I have played Asylum and City. Though Origins is by far the best. Huge improvements on characters and dialog. Overall the side missions still feel like chores as they do in any game. The main story though was awesome, you know when the end is coming and I was tempted to put the game down to avoid beating one of the best games this year. Looking forward to any expansion.In regards to the multiplayer, honestly I could do without it. Very cool concept Batman & Robin (2players) vs the world, but not for me. Seemed that there is a huge lack of communication between the two goodies while you gang members just brutalize the duo. Then again sometimes beat downs like that are fun in themselves.If you havent picked up any of these (how you have not is beyond me) I'd say start here. Then again it may kill any expectations of the first two.  "

												Despite all the bugs we got with the initial launch, and the fact that Rocksteady had nothing to do with this one, I was very impressed with the way it turned out. I actually like the guy that does the voice for Batman better than Kevin Conroy but, I can't say the same for the guy who does the voice for The Joker. He does a very good job mind you, I actually liked him quite a bit in fact, but nobody could ever be as great as  Mark Hammill was for that character. Anyway, badass game, play it, and love it. Can't wait for the next one. Hopefully  they will make the next one an open ended world where we get to actually drive around in some of Batman's vehicles. Hint,Hint.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins puts you in the shoes of a ""rookie"" batman,which seems to rely in brute force over outsmarting his opponents like in the other installments of the series.This is not a bad thing, as you play the game, you can see the evolution of batman from just a ""myth"" to the feared legend he has always been.Gameplay wise, the mechanics of the game have been polished completely, and are now better than ever, however, some of the boss fights, while amazing. tend to become repetitive and lack luster once you are halfway done the bosse's health bar.The series has also recieved a graphic overhaul and looks way better than its brothers do, however, the Physx implementation  is terribly done and leaves a lot of desire, as the papers and strings that use this seem to run at a whole different frame rate and look out of place. Another inclusion of physx is the ""dynamic"" snow in which Batman and his enemies leave footprints/trail in the snow. However,in some part of the game the use of Physx means you are going to take a HUGE impact in perfromance,even if you have a really beefy computer; and I don't mean just a 10-15 fps drop, no, I mean going from smooth as butter, to as jittery as Jell-O;when I reached that point of the game, I had to turn of Physx to continue playing,because leaving it on would have meant playing at around 15 fps.Story wise, the game is marvelous, as it expands the background of the Dark Knight in almost a comic/graphic novel like fashion. There are many references/homages that comic fans will love to see being put in the game.As an Arkham series game, I see why it might not be as well received as the other games,as it bring almost nothing new to the table.  But if you take it as a standalone Batman game, it might be the best one yet, if it makes any sense.9/10Computer used to run the game:i7 4770kGTX 78016 GB RAMetc,etcResolution:1080pMaxed out game settings,had to turn of physx late in the game for reasons explained above.

												<h1> Arkham City  > Arkham origins </h1> Well I liked this Game, but this game has lost touch of Arkham City which is a Master Piece compared to this. I like this Game though, Voice Acting/Graphics/Gameplay/Story was all awesome but Worst Optimization ever. I was Disappointed with Optimization of this game, this game looked like EA's Production. Too many stupid Bugs, later 7 Gb of Patch. Warner Brothers Game studio has dissapointed. Well Rocksteady will come back for the 4th Arkham Game, So I am happy again. I hope they put out another master piece like arkham city.			"

												This is a prequel to the Arkham Series dating back to Year One of Batman. Generally, the developers of this game are not Rocksteady. Because of this, most Arkham fans pondered whether it is worth the money to preorder or not. Some, of course, don't have a brain to think and just preorder, crying with joy and bragging like brats. I bought the game after some videos and confirmations of its upcoming gameplay and dlcs. Season Pass is also bought too. This game has been worth the wait. Although, it reminds me of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" game app on the appstore.The impact sounds are the same and the bridge are from The Dark Knight Rises.The timeline in this game is a ""younger"" Bruce (Batman) who is more inexperienced than the one in Arkham City. This concludes that the Batman in Origins will be a bit slower in combat and has a brutal combat stance (due to his earlier age when he was more enraged at crime after his father and mother's death).This game offers you a chance to play as deathstroke (If you preorder) and a chance to see Batman in his past. Unfortunately, the game seems to have the same textures and buildings as Arkham City. On the bright side, they tweaked (from what I heard) over 300 things such as removing objects and replacing with snow and such to give a better ""Year One"" atmosphere.  Moreover, there are more thugs spawns everywhere and new types of enemies such as the ""Martial Artists"" whom can counter your attacks and strike back at you.Personally, the game has its bugs and the developers have created a multiplayer mode which may inspire Rocksteady, who have hinted on another project which seems to be ""bigger and better"" as told by Kevin Conroy.For anyone feeling the urge to brutally takedown thugs, beat combo scores, and the fluid combat system that Arkham City has excellently provided, play Arkham Origins.This game may be game of the year but there is GTA V. Unfortunately, GTA V may not be GOTY, I assume, since it did not release on PC which is one of the most used possessions gamers have. Batman Arkham Origins have released games for Wii U, PC, Xbox 360, PS VITA, Nintendo DS, and PS3. Batman Arkham Origins: Blackgate is another game players should look at which has been released for PS VITA and Nintendo DS. There is also an app on the appstore for Batman Arkham Origins which has the same game mechanism and gameplay as the Batman Arkham City one (previous game app). I have not reached the half of the game. All I can say is, there is significant amount of tasks to do and it clearly shows how much Batman needs to do AND done for Gotham City. To the developers, congratulations on the game release. Of course, the bugs need to be fixed, but the amount of comments in the forums practically show that the game is incredible and ""epic.""			"

												Origins puts forth the greatest story telling the Arkham series has seen yet, and while it doesn't deviate greatly from the foundation City nearly perfected, it does offer an interesting look into the character's early crime fighting career. The campaign is meaty. I put more than 20 hours into it myself and still left quite a bit of the side missions untouched. On top of that and the challenge maps, you'll find an asymmetric multiplayer mode-a series' first.If you're a fan of the Arkham games, this should be a no brainer. It's more of what you love.			"

												Arkham Origins got a lot of criticism on release for being overly similar to it's predecessors, Asylum and City. Indeed, it isn't recognised as part of the official Arkham trilogy (which was recently concluded with Knight), and was farmed out to a different developer instead of Rocksteady. The criticism centred around this cash-grab mentality, that Warner Bros. wanted to simply make money off the Arkham IP.However, very little of this criticism was levelled at the game itself. Indeed, Origins is a fantastic game. It's definitely fair to say that Origins borrows heavily from its predecessors, and is short on original ideas. However, given how enjoyable the series' earlier titles were, it is difficult to complain at more of the same. The story is arguably better than Asylum or City, with a younger, darker Batman being exceptionally fun to play.It's unlikely to win the series any new fans, but, if you enjoyed Asylum and City, you'll get a lot out of Arkham Origins.

												I'm not sure why everyone seems to think this is the worst of the batman games.  It's just as great as Arkham City, but with better graphics and more features (the bat cave, fast travel, faster grappling, etc).  The only thing I regret about this, is that I didn't play it before the other two games, considering it's the prequel.  One day I plan on playing all 3 (soon to be 4) in order, and it will be glorious!  This game is not simply a regurgitation of the other batman games, it brings it's own innovative aspects to the batman series.  It's story is both unique and entertaining.All in all, this is my favorite Batman: Arkham game yet and I highly recommend it.  10/10			"

												Arkham Origins is the third game in the Arkham series... although serving as a prequel to Arkham Asylum, this game came out in 2013. The voice actors Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker) do not reprise their role in this game, although the alternative do sound acceptable, it is sad to lose their iconic feel. This is my least favorite of the Arkham Game series for good reason that the plot and the gameplay did not live up to its previous games or next to come game, the plot seemed like something just written so they could make another Arkham game and the map felt like we had been there before... for good reason. I constantly had trouble with the counter attack moves not working, and that really bugged me and prevented the smooth fun combat that the original games had. Although the graphics were still amazing, especially in the cut-scenes, it didn't make up for its boring plot and sad mechanics. This game also lacked the intriguing suspense both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City had therefore really making this game feel like a very slow halt in the series that made me question whether I bought another Arkham game or just gave the studio money. Either way this game is not the worst game out there, it is playable... kinda... and sometimes fun, and I would recommend it if it weren't for one thing, and that is that it is not essential to play if you are playing the Arkham game series, which since you are looking at the third game in the franchise I assume you are. It adds nothing to the game series plot other than an unneeded origin for a certain character, and it is highly unnecessary to spend your money and time on this game when you could spend it on Arkham Knight or just put more time into replaying the previous games.

												I love this game a lot. Especially having played all of the arkham series games so far. So why do i not recommend this game? Simply put this game has so many game breaking games it makes it hard to play. You can end up in an endless loop of falling or even just become completely stuck. If your game happens to auto save at the time these things happen then you are just out of luck unless you want to replay through the whole game again and hope you do not encounter it again. The worst part? They are aware these exist in the game and they have stopped all support meaning that there will be no fixes for these problems. What did they choose to do instead? Why release some dlc instead!!!!! Clearly a cash grab and they could care less about the game itself. So i do not suggest buying this game at all. And if the new one comes out i do not recommend buying it either. The first 2 arkham asylum and arkham city yes i do recommend those games. Arkham origins and any game after it? Not so much.			"

												Check the sheer number of reviews that say the game essentially ends for them at the first boss - Deathstroke. I played through Batman Arkham City three times and I've faced some tough bosses with Batman before but Deathstroke in this game is different. I've tried to kill him over 300 times and I've never come close. I gave up and quit the game. If a boss is so hard that you can't get past him after 300 tries it's time to admit you suck and it's never going to be fun for you. I have 90 other games in my library to play that I'm good at and are all better than this game including two other Batman titles. In my opinion making Deathstroke such a difficult boss was a game dev mistake.			"

												After around 44 hours of non-stop gameplay and content, I finally decided to write a review.Batman Arkham Origins is one of the best cinematic batman games ever. Note that I said 'cinematic'. Because the story and plot really makes you feel that you're watching a movie, even quick time events are added mid cinematics for more involvement. Don't hear what others say about the glitches. I rarely even see them, only glitching out while gliding at certain times.Gameplay is as refined as ever, brought over from akrham city. And the boss fights, oh the lovely boss fights. Sure, some of it have rehashed movesets from the previous games, but mostly freaking amazing, far better than that arkham tank game (if you know what i mean). Story is interesting and encourages you to finish it, and there are some very emotional moments that i dont want to spoil. Some skins are made free by completing certain objectives which is really appreciated. I really enjoy the overall game as I play this gritty, violent batman who doesn't even bat an eye to break every bone he sees to get what he wants. In short, if you are looking for a batman game set in winter, has awesome boss fights, amazing story, buy this gameright now during its weekend sale. The DLC is also worth it too, unfortunately there are no sale prices for that.			"

												Origins puts forth the greatest story telling the Arkham series has seen yet, and while it doesn't deviate greatly from the foundation City nearly perfected, it does offer an interesting look into the character's early crime fighting career. The campaign is meaty. I put more than 20 hours into it myself and still left quite a bit of the side missions untouched. On top of that and the challenge maps, you'll find an asymmetric multiplayer mode-a series' first.If you're a fan of the Arkham games, this should be a no brainer. It's more of what you love.			"

												Taking over from Rocksteady for the third game, WB Games Montréal tries to reach the heights of the first two Arkham games with an interestingg origin story of the Dark Knight. But can they live deliver and live up on the expectations? It's around two years after Bruce has put on the mask for the first time, so he still supposed to be a newbie at his outings at night. This Batman, however can act and look like a beginner but his moves tell us otherwise.When it comes to gameplay Origins is almost a clone to Arkham City. The combos, special moves and counters look and feel like the same. There are time when you feel the new team tried to innovate here and there, but those, like countering enemies, aren't decisive enough. On the other hand any game would be delighted to have a combat system like Arkham City, so in the matter of fact the gameplay still works perfectly. It's just that the innovation is missing, which is the game's greatest flaw. There are new gadgets, but even those are sometimes carbon copies of the missing ones, for example the Glue Grenade which has the exact same effect as the Freeze Grenade in Arkham City.One thing you can certainly be hyped for in the game is its story. The game delivers from that perspective putting in front of you a greatly crafted, interesting story which is furthermore amplified by the cast. The Joker, Bane, Black Mask star in the game but others have their important roles as well. It's a tale that is on par with the comic books. And one more word about the cast; even though the Batman's and Joker's voices has been replaced most of the time you won't notice any major difference as Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker both make hard effort to genuinely impersonate those two epic characters.So, yes 8 assassins are after you on Christmas Eve to kill you even though you aren't as big player in Gotham as you'll become. Interestingly not all of them get the same amount of space. One thing the games does very well are the boss fights. In the first two games there weren't any really challenging and grand boss fights as we had hoped for (except Poison Ivy), but in this game almost every boss has its differently paced fight. There is a different strategy to beating every one of them. This keeps the games varied and you'll always look forward to the next boss. While beating up assassins and progressing in the story there is the moment when you suddenly realize that ""this is THE time"". The time when those two will meet...for the first time...and you are about to witness it all. It's a thing the creators weren't allowed to screw up. It had to be epic. And it is. The time when Joker reflects on his first meeting with Batman is just unbelievably awesome.Arkham Origins is a really good looking game but there is very little innovation over Arkham City. It's not the best looking game of 2013, but looks great enough to hold up with the competition. Mainly the character models are those that stand out. Batman, Joker, Bane and all of the major characters look detailed. On the audio front it isn't as strong as City. Simply the prominent melodies aren't there that support you as the predator of the night. It's a bit of a disappointment.After you finish the main campaign, which shouldn't take longer than 8 hours, you can do the side-quests Arkham City style. The overall content here is somewhat less than in the second game, but you can easily squeeze out 20 hours by searching every inch of Gotham for data packs and tags on wall. What is very discouraging that WB Montréal didn't have the balls to bring some innovation where they really could have. And those are the side quests, which are again mostly copies of those in Arkham City. There you had to look for phones by the time the counter hit zero, here you have to race to bombs. Before you had to collect question marks, here you have to pick up data packs. The names and locations are changed, but most of the work you have to do remained the same. If this wasn't a Batman game everybody would call it a rip-off. Crime scene investigations are the one that stands out. Those are really new and fun, but it's not groundbreaking. We appreciate the effort though. When you're finished you can fight in the familiar challenge mode or the new multiplayer.Batman: Arkham Origins is a super game that took everything that made Arkham Origins a stellar title and kept all of them. However, they played it very safe introducing only a handful innovation none of which is strong enough to hold out. The side-quests are a real disappointment. When you are like Arkham City you are great, but after playing that game for 40 hours it's not enough just to be like it. Fans will appreciate the story, but everything else (missions, quests, places, etc.) is something we have seen already. And this is why the game will divide fans and players.Rating: 85/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 8 hours (main campaign), 20+ hours (with collectibles); Played on: normal.			"

												So, the third series of Batman: Arkham. It is a prequel, and the story is not that bad. The good things are there is multiplayer now, you can go to the batcave whenever you want, and new batsuits. The combat system is pretty much the same but with new enemies. And new gadjets, and you can talk to Alfred. Also plenty of challenge maps. The BIGGEST issue with this game is all the game breaking bugs. First you got the bug when you go into a building and everything turns black and you can't go anywhere. The next one is the audio messes up sometimes. And sometimes you will glide under the world with the same thing as the first one, everything goes black and you can't do anything. There are other huge bugs and plenty of little bugs like when you start spinning when you glide (but that is a funny bug). Also with the multiplayer (I don't know if anyone else has this problem) most of the time you get a message saying ""Steam connection has been dropped"" and just brings you back to the menu. And the sad thing is you can't fix these bugs in game. Only the audio one and the multiplayer one (and by fixing the multiplayer you just keep trying to join matches). If you get the forever blackness one you actually have to look up a solution which I did and actually go to your files and type something in the data of the game. For my count, i'm saying no, BUT if you can handle all these bugs and have the solution to the forever blackness bugs, then I guess you can get it. It's pretty fun when it isn't constantly screwing up.			"

												When Arkham Origins came out, it got a lot of bad press for being derivative and buggy. I hit the buggy parts fairly quickly (a crash-to-desktop involving WBID and a graphical glitch involving DX 11 enhancements) and the derivative part never really escapes Arkham Origins. I mean, it's not all that different from Arkham City, but is that a bad thing? Arkham City was pretty great. Arkham Origins is pretty good. I think it revisits too many of the villains from Asylum and City, and some of the gadgets are inexplicably similar to gadgets in City but not Asylum (despite being a prequel), but it's still a fun game. If you liked Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, you're going to like Arkham Origins. If you've never played either of those games, start with Arkham Asylum! It does a great job of making you feel like you're Batman within the frame of a 3D Metroidvania with an excellent combat system. And if you're still into it after you get through Asylum and City, then by all means, get Origins. But I wouldn't recommend making Origins your first Arkham game.			"

												A weird case of a game. It is the weakest entry in the Arkham trilogy, but it is nevertheless a good game in itself.Pros* Good story, maybe the best of the Arkham trilogy. The characters and their motivations are adapted to their situation. Beware that it is not Batman's origin story* Non-inventive but entertaining gameplay, slightly faster than its predecessor. Each boss feels different* Graphics are good and the crumbling snow is a welcome additionCons* Gotham City as an environment is very video-gamey* Bugs, some were game-breaking on launch and were fixed, others are still here and annoying* Visible lack of polish compared to the two other gamesDo as I did, and treat it as an expansion pack for Arkham City. Don't pay full-price for it, but WB Montreal showed some love in their youth enthusiasm and thus you should buy it on sale and enjoy it for what it is.			"

												Origins was solid although not as broad as the previous two Batman games. The story was fun to follow although brief, and I was definitely done with punching people way before it was completed. The side quests added some variety although it wasn't long before I had to punch someone. The casefile recreations were very cool, mainly because I got to recreate someone punching someone else. There were some standout parts, including being the Joker for a bit, and solving the Riddler's many puzzles. The Mad Hatter mission was both unusual and interesting.  The stalking was still great fun- taking out 7 armed guards without any of them seeing you never got old. You also get to play through many of Batman's first encounters with most of the canon's characters. There were some negatives. Some of the missions didn't work, and the boss battles were fun usually until they add a hundred henchmen to it that you have to punch. It was also tough to 'fly' around the map because the grapnel options were more limited. The area seemed bigger here than in Arkham City, but I had to leg much of it. The final plus to note is the art. The buildings and the character visually of the city were simply amazing. It would have been fun to be able to explore some of these striking skyscrapers, but only mission oriented ones were open. The weather effects were also impressive-the snowy, gusty setting was immersive. This is defintely on par with the other games, but the shortest and weakest. The characters were fun to meet as a younger Batman, the missions were engaging and well connected. If you enjoyed the Asylum and City you will get into this. It was just a little tiring by the end, running the streets of a gorgeous landscape in a game that knows how to pull and pull it's punches.			"

7/10This game is great, but not completly worth the full price. If it goes on sale it is a must have. The story is a little repetitive compaired to the last games, but still in my opinion a very good game. Could have a lot of improvments, like having to beat all the assassins insead of skipping out on two of them. By now it may just be better to save you money for the next game.Edit: After playing Arkham City on the PC I've noticed this game has a lot more graphical errors, something that could have been completely avoided.

												The Arkham Legacy burns on! I was very scepticle about the realese of this game. First of all it is not developed by RockSteadythe company that brought us the last 2 arkham games Arkham City and Arkham Asykum. Even though it wasnt developed by the the creators, Warner Brothers Montreal did a fantasic job of making the origins of the bat feel right. I feel the controls are more compatible for my style and the graphics is superb. But I feel carmed in the game 1 night to fight 8 assassins that is a tough task for the bat and i already clocked in about 30 hours in the game (20 if you dont count online)I give this game an 9.5/10. They need to give us better dlc and dlc characters to play as and the storyline is a bit to cramped for just 1 night. Other than that it is a fantasic game as I said and I would Recommend this game for any Batman fan!			"

												I have played Asylum and City. Though Origins is by far the best. Huge improvements on characters and dialog. Overall the side missions still feel like chores as they do in any game. The main story though was awesome, you know when the end is coming and I was tempted to put the game down to avoid beating one of the best games this year. Looking forward to any expansion.In regards to the multiplayer, honestly I could do without it. Very cool concept Batman & Robin (2players) vs the world, but not for me. Seemed that there is a huge lack of communication between the two goodies while you gang members just brutalize the duo. Then again sometimes beat downs like that are fun in themselves.If you havent picked up any of these (how you have not is beyond me) I'd say start here. Then again it may kill any expectations of the first two.  "

												Batman Arkham Origins puts you in the shoes of a ""rookie"" batman,which seems to rely in brute force over outsmarting his opponents like in the other installments of the series.This is not a bad thing, as you play the game, you can see the evolution of batman from just a ""myth"" to the feared legend he has always been.Gameplay wise, the mechanics of the game have been polished completely, and are now better than ever, however, some of the boss fights, while amazing. tend to become repetitive and lack luster once you are halfway done the bosse's health bar.The series has also recieved a graphic overhaul and looks way better than its brothers do, however, the Physx implementation  is terribly done and leaves a lot of desire, as the papers and strings that use this seem to run at a whole different frame rate and look out of place. Another inclusion of physx is the ""dynamic"" snow in which Batman and his enemies leave footprints/trail in the snow. However,in some part of the game the use of Physx means you are going to take a HUGE impact in perfromance,even if you have a really beefy computer; and I don't mean just a 10-15 fps drop, no, I mean going from smooth as butter, to as jittery as Jell-O;when I reached that point of the game, I had to turn of Physx to continue playing,because leaving it on would have meant playing at around 15 fps.Story wise, the game is marvelous, as it expands the background of the Dark Knight in almost a comic/graphic novel like fashion. There are many references/homages that comic fans will love to see being put in the game.As an Arkham series game, I see why it might not be as well received as the other games,as it bring almost nothing new to the table.  But if you take it as a standalone Batman game, it might be the best one yet, if it makes any sense.9/10Computer used to run the game:i7 4770kGTX 78016 GB RAMetc,etcResolution:1080pMaxed out game settings,had to turn of physx late in the game for reasons explained above.

												This game is getting a lot of hate from everyone, and I can't see why! If you are a batman fan, you must play this game. The story in my opinion is leagues ahead of the other two games. Sure the ending of Arkham City was shocking, but the rest was a long drawn out fetch quest. This game has a consistantly engaging story with character development for many characters like Alfred, Barbara, and Jim which creates much more interesting relationships between Batman and his allies. It is on the same level as the writing of Scott Snyder, Frank Miller, and Jeph Loeb. The new developers kept the combat system the same for the most part, with only minor tweaks. I don't understand everyones dislike of this decision. If they would have changed it, they would have gotten just as much hate. If it ain't broke don't fix it, and that method holds up in this game.They did however, greatly improve the boss fights. You feel like Batman fighting famous DC rougues. They are honestly some of the best boss fights I have played in a long time. With the industry moving away from boss fights, it was very refreshing to have such exceptionally epic battles with the assassin's. The city is a little bland, but it's no different than Arkham City. It's just empty streets filled with thugs to fight. The side quests aren't exceptional, but they are fun and make this game well worth the price. In my personal opinion, this is the best game in the arkham series. It may not have completely reinvented the series, but it improves on the previous iterations. If you are a Batman fan, or never have played the arkaham series before, this is a must-play. Don't believe the hate. The improvements the new developers made (fantastic story and epic boss fights) are massive improvements to the series.			"

												Game was buggy upon release, had a lot of it's own problems, suffered from yearly sequel syndrome but it's still loveable, the story is good, the voice acting even without Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil still is well done, the music is great, gameplay is still really enjoyable and on top of that, I love how this batman is inexperienced compared to Asylum or City so he'll strike harder, drop people off buildings to fall down onto a tree and his approach is much more aggressive in general so it kinda adds to the game a lot.Also I like Deathstroke and I got play as him in Challenge mode so that's great			"

												Origins is not a dramatically different game compared to City. The combat is largely the same and features most of the same gadgets with a few new ones such as the shock gloves. The city is similar and there are certainly many familiar elements but there are also new places to see and plenty of new location for fights. The boss fights are great, more fluid and fun than City, particularly the Deathstroke fight. The game is not revolutionary but if you are a fan of the previous games then Origins is a very solid addition and well worth playing. It adds a lot of small things and the seemingly large changes like the difference in voice actors end up not being significant changes after all.			"

												More Arkham is a good deal if you've never played it before, but otherwise there's not a lot here to hold your attention. The city is sprawling and the new enemy types interesting, but the same old back and forth traipsing around after bits and pieces gets tired quickly. Lacks the focus of Asylum and the writing of City			"

(be the BATMAN!!!) - The combat was amazing. I don't need to say more. . . . . . . . . . Cons:- Ehh, well I didn't have any problems with the game whatsoever but I guess the multiplayer wasn't that good.Conclusion: great game and a must-buy for Batman fans (other gamers as well). 11/10 Ign.

Product received for free
												Pros:-Most of what was great about Arkham City returns-Some of your new abilities and gadgets are pretty handy-New voices do a good job and aren't just cheap imitations of the Rocksteady games' cast-Not a complete retread of City, though some things return-Fast travel is a godsendCons:-Not a whole lot of new things in this one (similar gadgets, similar sidequests, the map's just Arkham City long before it was Arkham City - with a new section added on, of course)-Textures can be pretty bad, and I don't know why-More glitches than City, such as gun mooks getting trapped in one place during predator encounters, or Batman flipping out in midair while glidingThis game is often called the weakest of the series, and I'll agree. This doesn't make the game bad, though - I still think it's a good game and will be enjoyable for anyone who played the other games, but it doesn't do a whole lot of new things to differentiate it from City. The technical problems are also surprising, since I had stable experience with Asylum and City. However, like I said, most of the good from City is back, which means fun times are still to be had. So, conclusion? Buy it if you think you'll like it, wait for a sale if you're not sure. "

												I'd also give it a thumb down if possible since I'm happy with the game and also very disappointed. Single player didn't innovate anything in comparison to Arkham city .. which is fine considering how grate it was. Look at it as a glorified expansion of A.City. Looks a bit different, plays the same. Story is fine, characters old and new both. Sound, voice acting as great as ever, and I'm very pleased to see how well they've optimized it for PC. I have a fairly old system and it runs smooth (certainly not maxed out..but still). And then there's online .... Now KEEP IN MIND that I bought the game almost 2 YEARS AFTER its RELEASE. From the first moment you press quick match you'll be hoping that you don't get disconnected during match making, or the game doesn't crash as soon as it may start. You'll still have a hard. Player controlled gangsters can ♥♥♥♥ Batman and Robin up very easy and very fast. Controls may seem the same, yet they work very differently. I had the fortune to get my first two matches after 30 minutes of trying to find a match that wont disconnect. Once I managed to start the match I'm chosen to be Bats which is cool and all ... if not for the fact that I ad no idea where to go, how to get closer than 5 feet of anyone without getting a a barrel of bullets in my face. They can find you ANYWHERE! It also doesn't help that I'm put as a lvl 2 player against lvl 200+ players. Randomly two or three beginners (lvl1-2-3) are put up with and against lvl 200+ (had a 600+ once). And that's about all I could play because ever since then I haven't been able to connect to a proper match.SO Single player thumbs upOnline ... yeah nooooo.....			"

												Despite all the bugs we got with the initial launch, and the fact that Rocksteady had nothing to do with this one, I was very impressed with the way it turned out. I actually like the guy that does the voice for Batman better than Kevin Conroy but, I can't say the same for the guy who does the voice for The Joker. He does a very good job mind you, I actually liked him quite a bit in fact, but nobody could ever be as great as  Mark Hammill was for that character. Anyway, badass game, play it, and love it. Can't wait for the next one. Hopefully  they will make the next one an open ended world where we get to actually drive around in some of Batman's vehicles. Hint,Hint.			"

It adds absolutely nothing to the series universe, save poor dialogue and continuity errors.

Combat is a step back from Arkham City and gets frustrating in comparison. Don't waste your time and money here.			"

												After around 44 hours of non-stop gameplay and content, I finally decided to write a review.Batman Arkham Origins is one of the best cinematic batman games ever. Note that I said 'cinematic'. Because the story and plot really makes you feel that you're watching a movie, even quick time events are added mid cinematics for more involvement. Don't hear what others say about the glitches. I rarely even see them, only glitching out while gliding at certain times.Gameplay is as refined as ever, brought over from akrham city. And the boss fights, oh the lovely boss fights. Sure, some of it have rehashed movesets from the previous games, but mostly freaking amazing, far better than that arkham tank game (if you know what i mean). Story is interesting and encourages you to finish it, and there are some very emotional moments that i dont want to spoil. Some skins are made free by completing certain objectives which is really appreciated. I really enjoy the overall game as I play this gritty, violent batman who doesn't even bat an eye to break every bone he sees to get what he wants. In short, if you are looking for a batman game set in winter, has awesome boss fights, amazing story, buy this gameright now during its weekend sale. The DLC is also worth it too, unfortunately there are no sale prices for that.			"

												It was definitely not as good as the other two Arkham games, and it lacked a lot of polish that the others had. Also I did not think the different voice actors were that big of a deal like some people think, but I will admit I did miss Kevin Conroy's Batman (Roger Craig Smith tried his best). If I am looking at this game from a standalone perspective however without the series bias, I think it is a solid Batman game. Though it had its glitches and bugs, I really liked the new system of solving crimes by piecing together the whole event. I also did not think the story was all that bad, it was nice getting some origins story background. All in all, you will probably like it 7/10			"

I think that they decided to add more of it into dlc, which is really sad, it used to be a good game series. I don't think that it is good to play the whole game in 13 hours including deaths and restarts... I think there is about 10 hours of pure gameplay, what is really poor. Grapling hook: somehow they forgot that in Arkham city, that fast grapling hook was just prototype, but here, even before arkham asylium, we have boosted grapling hook.

Competence 101Arkham Origins is an interesting beast. A game that probably no one asked for, a quick fix for the Fall gaming season upon release and a title that is and always will be foreshadowed by ""big brother"" Rocksteady's Arkham City. It is a case of mapped out goals that are selected just right enough as to not upset what came before. And as a result, it ends up not really having an identity and being a stop-gap before the next big instalment that has now turned out to be Batman: Arkham Knight.The story here isn't particularly bad. It's simply serviceable. It's Christmas Eve and a fledgling vigilante Bat finds himself having to deal with a group of assassin's hired by a certain Roman Sionis (discovering alter egos is part of the fun) who want him rather dead. This motley crew has to kill this particularly grouchy incarnation of the Bat in one night.... Try not to think too much about the logistics of the plan and the hours required to fulfill it. It truly doesn't make sense, but semantics be damned. All this culminates in a twist that fans especially will see coming from MILES away. To add to the main story experience, the Game of the Year (GOTY) edition goes further to include one story DLC that has you revisit the game's locales and challenge map scenarios that are simply battle arenas.Playing Arkham Origins is a clear case of ""...if it ain't broke don't fix it"". It's more of the same old same old with very slight changes in the combat animations. Having come from completing Arkham City myself (review incoming), I feel that the combat rhythm here is slightly ""off"" with the Bat's animations being very slightly sluggish between frames. This is especially apparent when you are maintaining high combo strings and he has to move a tad faster between enemies when surrounded. That aside, all other traversal mechanics are present and correct from the previous installment of City, but if you've been used to the routine before there isn't much new to see here save for one particular tricky class of fighter and some new gadgetry (including the Shock Glove and EX Suit that just lovely cop-outs). The detective work has also been tweaked somewhat to provide a bit more narration. Here WB Montreal did a good job.Technically this game performs really well especially after the raft of patches that came post release. Includes some extra DX11 features with regard to ambient occlusion and tessellation that really helps bring out the best the Art team at WB Montreal had to offer for their game. Only really applicable and apparent when you enable ULTRA settings. It certainly looks and runs really great post GOTY. The sound work is not really memorable in that you probably will not end up latching onto a favorite audio track in your head when done. I suppose all the audio work was meant to do was simply set the tone in certain areas while providing some ambiance to the experience albeit with a very limited track selection.So is this title worth getting? Yes. With a caveat... Wait for a sale. Treat this as a quick romp (if you're an old hand at the series) and if you're a new fan? Probably start here then play all of Rocksteady's work back to back with the proviso that Arkham Origins is not a complete necessity but an appetizer to the main event. Be advised that if you are knowledgeable in your DC Comics lore you'll enjoy your Easter Eggs like a certain ""Queen Industries"" Shipping Container.Parting Shot: ""It's Christmas Eve Sir..."" ~ Alfred Pennyworth.

												It's an ok game, although only worth buying if you're a big fan of the Batman franchise (which I am not). The map is virtually the same as Arkham City and except for a couple gadgets everything else is pretty much the same. It is fun at first, but the story gets boring/annoying really quick and combat becomes frustrating halfway through the game. On a positive note, like the previous games, it's built using the Unreal engine so it looks fantastic and runs pretty well on various hardware.I don't recommend it 100% and I'd rather rate it ""neutral"" or ""not sure"" if I could. Buy it on sale, or else it ain't worth the price.			"

												Review for Batman: Arkam Origins (Played on a GTX 970 OC, an i7 4790 3,6 and 16 gigs of ram)This game is absolutley amazing and I have no clue why people say it's bad. here's some pros and cons:PROS:- The game has amazing graphics (cutscenes look amazing!!! and gameplay too of course..)and it's very optimized. - The story was really good and I felt really invested in the story and all the characters were great, especially Batman and the Joker. (be the BATMAN!!!) - The combat was amazing. I don't need to say more. . . . . . . . . . Cons:- Ehh, well I didn't have any problems with the game whatsoever but I guess the multiplayer wasn't that good.Conclusion: great game and a must-buy for Batman fans (other gamers as well). 11/10 Ign.

												It was definitely not as good as the other two Arkham games, and it lacked a lot of polish that the others had. Also I did not think the different voice actors were that big of a deal like some people think, but I will admit I did miss Kevin Conroy's Batman (Roger Craig Smith tried his best). If I am looking at this game from a standalone perspective however without the series bias, I think it is a solid Batman game. Though it had its glitches and bugs, I really liked the new system of solving crimes by piecing together the whole event. I also did not think the story was all that bad, it was nice getting some origins story background. All in all, you will probably like it 7/10			"

Competence 101Arkham Origins is an interesting beast. A game that probably no one asked for, a quick fix for the Fall gaming season upon release and a title that is and always will be foreshadowed by ""big brother"" Rocksteady's Arkham City. It is a case of mapped out goals that are selected just right enough as to not upset what came before. And as a result, it ends up not really having an identity and being a stop-gap before the next big instalment that has now turned out to be Batman: Arkham Knight.The story here isn't particularly bad. It's simply serviceable. It's Christmas Eve and a fledgling vigilante Bat finds himself having to deal with a group of assassin's hired by a certain Roman Sionis (discovering alter egos is part of the fun) who want him rather dead. This motley crew has to kill this particularly grouchy incarnation of the Bat in one night.... Try not to think too much about the logistics of the plan and the hours required to fulfill it. It truly doesn't make sense, but semantics be damned. All this culminates in a twist that fans especially will see coming from MILES away. To add to the main story experience, the Game of the Year (GOTY) edition goes further to include one story DLC that has you revisit the game's locales and challenge map scenarios that are simply battle arenas.Playing Arkham Origins is a clear case of ""...if it ain't broke don't fix it"". It's more of the same old same old with very slight changes in the combat animations. Having come from completing Arkham City myself (review incoming), I feel that the combat rhythm here is slightly ""off"" with the Bat's animations being very slightly sluggish between frames. This is especially apparent when you are maintaining high combo strings and he has to move a tad faster between enemies when surrounded. That aside, all other traversal mechanics are present and correct from the previous installment of City, but if you've been used to the routine before there isn't much new to see here save for one particular tricky class of fighter and some new gadgetry (including the Shock Glove and EX Suit that just lovely cop-outs). The detective work has also been tweaked somewhat to provide a bit more narration. Here WB Montreal did a good job.Technically this game performs really well especially after the raft of patches that came post release. Includes some extra DX11 features with regard to ambient occlusion and tessellation that really helps bring out the best the Art team at WB Montreal had to offer for their game. Only really applicable and apparent when you enable ULTRA settings. It certainly looks and runs really great post GOTY. The sound work is not really memorable in that you probably will not end up latching onto a favorite audio track in your head when done. I suppose all the audio work was meant to do was simply set the tone in certain areas while providing some ambiance to the experience albeit with a very limited track selection.So is this title worth getting? Yes. With a caveat... Wait for a sale. Treat this as a quick romp (if you're an old hand at the series) and if you're a new fan? Probably start here then play all of Rocksteady's work back to back with the proviso that Arkham Origins is not a complete necessity but an appetizer to the main event. Be advised that if you are knowledgeable in your DC Comics lore you'll enjoy your Easter Eggs like a certain ""Queen Industries"" Shipping Container.Parting Shot: ""It's Christmas Eve Sir..."" ~ Alfred Pennyworth.

												Okay... I am going to start with negativesShort gameplay as hell... Wtf? really, guyswhat is this? I expexted more from it. There is many uncovered questions, game stopped in best part. I think that they decided to add more of it into dlc, which is really sad, it used to be a good game series. I don't think that it is good to play the whole game in 13 hours including deaths and restarts... I think there is about 10 hours of pure gameplay, what is really poor. Grapling hook: somehow they forgot that in Arkham city, that fast grapling hook was just prototype, but here, even before arkham asylium, we have boosted grapling hook. Good things:GraphicsStory line Multiplayer (haven't tried yet)----------------------------------------------------------I think there should be button not only for reccomend or not, but even for buy on your own risk.

												If you see any of the Batman 'Arkham' games in a steam sale, they are all a must-buy. They all look stunning, the stories are rich, and the worlds are moody and beautiful, the combat is smooth, the characters are compelling. Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) does his infamous 'Joker voice', it's a trip right back to the golden age of saturday morning cartoons. The Main story arc takes about 13 horus to finish, the world is relatively big (albeit practically copied & pasted directly from Arkham CIty)If you've played the other Batman games, you'll enjoy this also, if you haven't played the others, this is still worth a purchase, especially if you see it on a Steam Sale.8/10 would be higher with a larger sandbox, longer story.

												(SPOLIERS) The game for an entry into the Arkham series is done well. The story is interesting, the combat flows and the gadgets are great to use. But with all of these perks comes a price. Unfortunate for this game is the short story. It is about 25 percent of the game, the rest is divided among item collection and side missions which introduce other batman villans that have not relation to the current story. I mean why all of a sudden come out on christmas? The multiplayer was okay. It did suffer some issues at launch. But it has been supposedly fixed. This also applies to the world elements. Other things that devs have toted about the detective features are there but seem tacked on. For how awesome the above trailer is, the game is not on par with it. play for yourself of course. i would give this game a 7/10.			"

												Going into the game with the a new developer at the helm of this legendary franchise, I was extremely nervous, as Arkham games captured not only the essence of the Dark Knight himself, but also the dark sinister world in which he casts his shadows. I was expecting the developer will stick to the comfort zone and will follow closely if not completely copy the blueprint of the gameplay and structure perfected by Rocksteady (the developer of the previous two Arkham games) while coming out of the comfort zone with a captivating origin story that drops the first dominoes towards the build up to the next two games in the chronological sense.The good news is they indeed managed to keep the solid gameplay intact, in fact they didn't make any changes to the fight and gadgets, just with different variations of the same gadgets used in Arkham City like Glue Grenade over Freeze Grenade. There was a much greater emphasis on Batman's detective skill-set. As as you found more evidence, the crime scene slowly builds and is illustrated in a hologram. You sometimes had to rewind, pause to a specific spot to find a clue that you might have missed. It was really cool, and perhaps the only new thing this games does that was not done in the previous game. Although, I wish it was much more deeper and instead of just looking at the spot and pressing the 'X' button to scan and tag. Oh well, there is always the next Arkham game right?So I never expected the developer to re-invent the bat wheel for the series, that sort of task is best left to Rocksteady and good thing they didn't as results might have been catastrophic. However, I wished they had done better with the narrative flow of the game as well as the plot. The story felt disjointed and felt like different pieces of awesomeness attached to one another in hopes of making one giant awesomeness instead of melding pieces of narratives that complement each other and make one big awesome narrative like Paul Dini did with the previous two games. I was hoping the Christmas background of the game would add to the atmosphere, but apart from some radio of random christmas songs and some Christmas decorations here and there...it hardly felt like a Christmas Eve, sooner than later it felt just like another long night for Batman. The Another thing that caught my eye was the city itself. The game is supposed to take place in Gotham City, or some part of it. However it hardly feels any different from Arkham City. With virtually no one out in the street instead of hundreds of thugs and random police here and there. This further kills the Christmas vibe, seriously I don't care if it is snowing like crazy, people go out during Christmas Eve, at least some do. At times I felt like I was back to Arkham City, or even worse, considering from the number of thugs out on the streets and rooftops far outnumbering the country's soon-to-be biggest criminally Infested Zone.The story is not at all bad, where Arkham Asylum was a great batman story, Arkham City later became perhaps one of the best (personally the best) Batman story I've witnessed; Arkham Origins comes out short and tends to be a good story. Then again, it is sometimes hard to blame the Warner Brothers Montreal because the legacy left by the first two games were so great that I doubt any developer would succeed leaping over or even matching it.The new voice actors did a solid job and overall the performance of voice actors were on par with the previous games. I thought I would dearly miss the Conroy/Hamill duo of Batman and Joker. I did, but the performance of the actors were amazing, especially Troy Baker's Joker, the way he captured the insanity, the horror and the comedy of Joker only Mark Hamill previously understood.I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, I will post my impressions as soon as  I dive into it. But from what I've heard from people who played it, it is not really worth spending a lot of your time on.So there you have it, its a very good game and a worthy game to add to the Arkhamverse. If the previous two games were masterpieces from a renowned artist. This game comes out as a masterpiece from the artist's best student. The student will only get better as long as he/she comes out of the comfort zone more often.			"

												Batman is back!Some of the charm of the predecessors has been lost, we've lost Mark Hamill. We've also lost the only man to ever really voice Batman great.  That said, the replacement voice actors aren't too shabby and can grow on you once you move past the change.  The real bummer is the change to the combat.  It's not BAD, per se.  Just not the beautiful rhythm and flow that made the previous Arkham games so amazing, as they got rid of that rhythm in favor of difficulty.  Which at times gets very frustrating.   There are also a few issues with it (Such as double counters sometimes not actually stopping the 2nd attacker from just nailing you as you do the animation), but they've been sorting those out with patches.That said, the story is fun.  It's great to be playing Batman during that early story arc, to have an epic duel with Deathstroke.  It's a good game, but it could have been great.			"

												Anyone playing the arkham series for the first time would be best served starting here, for those who have played both asylum and city, then you will know to expect an awsome action packed ride.First off, this is the latest game in the series but set before the others, focusing on showing batman at an early stage of his career, still a vigilante in the eyes of both the gotham citizens and the GCPD (gotham city police department)As far as the story telling goes, this game does it better than the previous 2, the extra focus put into cutscenes and detective mode bring the introduction of characters and events to life in a nolan quality way. Being early career we find batman at a pivotal time in his career, the city has just started to take notice of him as a force to be reckoned with and not just a passing fancy, as such the villains that occupy the batman universe and by extension, the DC universe are now set on taking him down before he foils any more plansand slaps more villains behind bars. The GCPD are also on the case to arrest the batman on site giving a good dynamic to certain missions as you progress.This game shines in showing the inner struggle Bruce Wayne/Batman faces in light of what his intentions have wrought upon the city he is protecting, alfred, his butler and dearest friend gets a great showcasing in this game as the moral compass trying to guide Bruce in the right direction before he becomes lost to his own obsession. Roger Craig Smith (who also voiced gaming favorites such as Ezio and Chris Redfield) provides exceptional voice work for batman and really drives emotional scenes home with his work.Gameplay wise the combat is slick and intuative, a great use of gadgets (most of which will be familiar to those who have played previous arkham games) with some fun new additions that really get their spotlight when you play on the harder difficulties. It feels fairly similar to arkham city but dont let that put you off, when it comes to gaming sequels a few brands could learn a thing or two from origins, it perfects what was already great and add's just enough to make it feel fresh and expanded without loosing the core values of the franchise/character for the sake of having a large budget. The main story moves along at a steady and enjoyable pace with plenty of side missions and random events throughout to keep you occupied inbetween. The only low to this game is the multiplayer which i have only dabbled in briefly. it pits teams of 3 against each other in a 'by the numbers' 3rd person team deathmatch. Think gears of war but without the polish. In the same TDM you also have 2 players as Batman and Robin. Anyone who played the superb MGO (Metal Gear Online) in its day will draw instant reference to the sneaking missions. The round ends when one team reaches a kill limit or Batman and Robin have taken out their set number of targets. Im not personaly a fan of tacked on MP mode's and this does nothing to alter my feelings towards the matter.Overall id recommend this game to any who enjoy a great action/adventure, you certainly get your moneys worth in the single player alone and if you have played the previous arkham games im shocked if you dont own it already!8/10 (Multiplayer was not needed)			"

												There isn't much to say about this game, becasue I am unable to play it any further than Deathstroke boss fight.I can mostly describe technical aspects of the game, isnce this is the only part I got to ""enjoy"".1) Graphics is mediocre (my laptop w/ GeForce GT630M handles solid 50FPS on medium, 30FPS on high with normal PhysX setting), but excessive and unoptimized use of PhysX may drop your framerates by half.2) Game developers were oriented towards consoles the entire time, so KB+Mouse support is awful: key bindings don't work the way they should, quickfire and finishing moves work only 20% of the time.3) Larger world means poorer planning: player gets stuck all the time while using batclaw for movement or if hanging off the cliff of the building4) AI is ridiculously stupid, which gives you the ability to kill opponents almost in the plain sight under certain conditions5) Even small-scale level design is always flawed: some ""how-to-get-to-the-other-side"" puzzless may lead you to a halt in your game progression6) Many people, including me, have encountered numerous progression-stopping bugs in boss fights (Flickering Crock, Dissapearing Deathstroke, doors that are not opening and ambient gadgets that do not appear when they should etc.).7) Still present problems with DLC, which were addressed almost a year ago and were supposedly ""fixed""8) Non-existent customer support, commuinty support or even any sign of presence of anyone in the community!!!I've decided to check out WBGames forum and i was surprised to see that a moderator, which was responsible for Arkham Origins thread left in april and was not replaced, and moderator for the new Arkham Knight logs in about once a week.9) Most of the updates released up until now are mostly related to multiplayer issues and haven't even scratched the surface of single player bugs. Most of the stuff I've listed here was in game since it's initial release in Oct. 2013. This is probably the best indicator of what you have to expect from Arkham Knight and following games in series.My advice: avoid this abomination even if it is on sale. Stop on Arkham City.			"

												I have not played the previous two games in this line, so I cannot make a relative comparison to them, but here's a comparison of Batman: Arkham Origins to all the other games I've known before:  1) It has elements of a fighting game, like Mortal Kombat, but is far more dimensional in many ways.  You actually feel like you're participating as a Batman in his various cartoon or action movie incarnations due to the fighting style of the avatar and his animations and the style in which his opponents are portrayed.  You take on groups of thugs constantly like a typical urban vigilante superhero, and the thugs react just like the comic books thugs should.  You gain more experience for being hit less and fighting with more sophisticated combo techniques, allowing you to upgrade faster if you play smarter.  The fighting learning curve is steep and most boss fights with the major supervillans will require retrys - but the game autosaves for you, so you just restart as much as you feel like, jumping right back in without having to press anything.2) It is also similar to games like Metal Gear and Tenchu: Stealth Assassin in the ability of your game Batman avatar to sneak up on people, giving rewards for being like the bat and taking down a whole encounter without even being seen.  You also get unlocks if you pull off archetypal bat-stunts like knocking a guy out from above or below, or by gliding in on your cape and kicking them.3) The cinematics when certain objectives are achieved include the typical hanging a guy upside-down by his leg as a mode of interrogation as an example of how they keep you interested in the 'quest' of the storyline.The storyline itself is early Batman, which I found a more appealing hook than the ideas behind the other two chapters: Arkham City, where they go all dystopia and exile crooks to a walled in area of Gotham seemed a bit jumping the shark for my taste in narrative integrity.  If you like comics and get off on playing a superhero icon such as Batman, you might like this game.  It's pretty true to form.  WB is a bit greedy with their offers of extra content, like costumes that you have to unlock even though you pay for them.  They don't tell you about the unlocking bit either, you find it out later.  That part is lame, but I bought the expansion material for extra playable content.			"

tl;dr -> I have an old-school (Batman Animated Series), tight Batman costume that I rocked for Halloween 2014. Sometimes I like to take LSD and play this game, living my dream of being the Bat. 11/10 na na na na, na na na na BATMAN!I got this game gifted to me by a very generous friend and was super excited to play it because I thoroughly enjoyed the previous installments (Arkham Asylum and City). I also have been a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed series, which shares overlapping gameplay mechanics with the Arkham series. I absolutely loved my gameplay experience.If you like Batman, gritty/dark themes, being Batman, stealth/stalking, lots of side quests, and plenty of action, then you will love this game.The aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the world and character models is very, very well-done. Details are so fine that there is a (quite popular in superhero games; ex: the later Spider-man games) ""wear-and-tear"" mechanic on Batman's outfit. As you progress through the game (specifically, after boss battles), you will notice different ""battle scars"" adorning Batman's costume. For example, you may see nicks and scratches on his arms, or tears in his cape. I think this simple, but salient feature helps show how much of a toll the events of Origins is taking on the caped crusader. The sounds, music, and voice acting are great and add a lot to the experience of being Batman. I frequently mute gameplay music in favor of my own, however, in Arkham's case, I enjoyed the complete experience until I beat the game (took 18 hours, doing a good number of side missions). The controls are numerous, however, they are fairly easy to learn. I strongly recommend using a controller for this game. The tutorials help immensely, and there are practice/challenge modes that help you hone your skills. During your playthrough, there will always be tooltips (ex: press x during a scene) to assist your progression. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with the Arkham (and even the Assassin's Creed) series - intuitive countering system makes fights pretty easy on normal difficulty. When you play new game + (after completing one playthrough), you will be able to experience a much harder story - the ""counter"" icon will disappear, and enemies will be more aggressive/skilled. Gameplay involves you moving around the city of Gotham, subduing criminals and completing side/main missions. You will frequently encounter enemies in groups, giving you opportunities to build up a combo chain - the higher your combo when you've cleared the immediate area of enemies, the greater your experience gain. When you level up, you can select abilities to do with Batman's more physical calling (combat-related) or his predatory nature (stealth- and stalking-related). The map is fairly large, and you can unlock radio towers to allow for fast travel. To move around, you will most likely be using Batman's grappling hook extensively (faster than running over rooftops). Combat is very fun because the game is set up to make it reasonably easy for you (at least in the beginning). Whenever you land an actual hit, you build +1 to your score combo. As the multiplier increases, it will eventually allow you to execute special moves (one-hit knock outs) - for example, every 6x you get, you will be granted one special move. There are abilities you can select that make your combo requirement lower (I believe mine is at every 4x). Counter indicators pop up over enemies' heads whenever you can trigger a counter move - you can even do this to multiple enemies. The combat animations are very varied, ensuring that combat does not get stale too quickly. There are also a multitude of different enemy types - complete with their own attack patterns and weaknesses - to keep things fresh and interesting.There are predator instances, where you (should) use stealth to beat your opponents - typically because they are all armed and/or have hostages. To complete these scenarios, you will have to use a lot of hiding and stalking techniques - like swinging to and from ledges, moving through vents and underpassages, etc. Batman has a ""detective mode"" that allows you to see enemy heat signatures and objects of interest (like switches, mission objects, etc). Later in the game, you will encounter jammers that impair your detective mode, and must be disabled before you can use it again. One of my favorite parts of the game is the ""detective"" scenarios, where you must rebuild crime scenes. To do this, you will have to scan an area for relevant clues, then usually rewind simulations in order to discover more clues (like a basic version of L.A. Noire's detective mechanics). This component of the Arkham series really adds to the idea and experience of playing as Batman because it isn't just about beating up and stalking bad guys. There are plenty of side missions to complete, and many involve finding x number of items (ex: Riddler packages, Black Mask's weapon caches). Usually, after completing these tedious tasks, you will be allowed to fight/capture the mastermind. A common criticism of this game (the third installment, following Asylum and City) is that it borrows too heavily from its predecessors. While I agree, I still enjoyed this game immensely. If you are interested in this game, then I sincerely hope you will try to begin your experience with a fresh, clean mindset. Yes, you will see, do, and feel things that will remind you of the previous games (if you've played them), but I hope you do not let it subtract from a great playthrough. Something that the Arkham series does very well is slowly adding new elements to keep the game interesting. For example, you will have many predator encounters, but new challenges will be added like jammers on the wall - and, even later - jammers on enemies. Different areas of the game will require further progression to enable access because you unlock more gadgets as you continue the story. This is also a focal point for criticism because people wonder, ""shouldn't Batman already have all his gadgets ready to go?"" Probably better than the first 2 games (since this is the Origins story), this is explained by Batman having certain gadgets still in development; he also sometimes takes gadgets from enemies and fashions them for his own use. Overall, the game is a fabulous experience and I implore you to get it if you enjoy the Batman series even slightly. It is a nice segue into Arkham Asylum (since Origins is a prequel) and even has some nice easter eggs if you take the time to look for them.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Arkham Origins is a slice of greasy pizza after a meal of medium-rare steak and wine. Sure, it's not outright bad, but it leaves the pallet unsatisfied. The combat felt off in Origins and for the longest time I had trouble figuring out why. But during the halfway point, I think I figured it out: The baddie placement. In the previous games, lots of care had been taken in picking which baddies work in what amounts and when special enemies were needed. Here it seems like more of a copy-paste job, carelessly throwing in specials even if their abilities severely hinders the combat. It leads to a lot of frustration and eagerness to get out of combat, something the series hasn't had an issue with until now.In terms of new content, Arkham Origins is kind of bare bones. You have a majority of your old weapons available to you very early and some new ones that, unfortunately, don't mean much in combat. Some of the items feel completely shoehorned in, such as the Sonic Batarang. Not only did it seemingly just appear in my inventory, but there is never any sort of need for it or tactical advantage for using it. So why is it here? The story is fairly muddled. It starts off with Black Mask hiring 8 supervillanous hitmen to take you down on Christmas Eve. Why Christmas Eve? ""Who cares"" is the answer the game gives. The story actually rehashes some villains, such as Bane, the Riddler, the Penguin, and Deadshot. Unfortunately there isn't much to talk about when it comes to the plot without getting into spoilers. It's not exactly clear why Black Mask hired the assassins in the first place and by the end of the game it's even more confusing. Topping that off, the game ends seemingly out of nowhere, in what I thought was the beginning of the third act. It just sort of stops. There are still a handful of graphical errors and strange Not to mention several game-stopping glitches I encountered in-game despite the titles having been out for 5 months.I don't really think fans of the last two Arkham games will get much out of Arkham Origins, it feels like microwave leftovers. The only people I would recommend this to are die-hard fans of the games or Batman in-general, and even then I would recommend getting it at a low price. Also can I mention that the game DOESN'T HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ING MOUSE SENSITIVY SETTING?			"

												Whilst the third entry in the series is not developed by Rocksteady Studios, it's still a good attempt at the franchise. It does however feel incredibly familiar to Arkham City (with very few tweaks to the formula) and some repetitive gameplay elements unfortunately drops this title into the ""good, but not great"" category. The voice acting is great and Troy Baker's take on the Joker is incredibly Hamill~esque.If you played Asylum and City to death, the chances are that Origins will feel quite stale.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Arkham games, and even though this game comes from a different developer, I gotta say that this is a great game and a worthy addition to the Arkham franchise.Story:The story is absolutely fantastic.The game takes place about 5 years before Arkham Asylum.You play as a younger, less refined Batman trying to find and stop Black Mask who put a bounty of 50 million dollars on his head, which automatically attracts 8 of the most talented assassins in the DC universe such as Deathstroke, Deadshot and Bane.Even though the title says ""Arkham Origins"", it doesn't have anything to do with Arkham, and it's definitely not an origin story. In this game, Batman meets his ultimate adversary, The Joker, for the first time, and many other villains and allies as well.Gameplay:Despite the fact that this is not Rocksteady who developed the game, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the the gameplay is exactly the same as in Arkham City, simply because Rocksteady's work is remarkable and irreplaceable, and it should never be changed. There's a few new gadgets, and I have one minor complaint about the new Shock Gloves that I don't like the idea of because it's too overpowered. You are able to clear a room full of guys in matter of seconds with those. Good thing is, you get them pretty late in the game and they need to recharge. Aside from a few new types of enemies and the new gadgets, everything is the same, and that's good. You don't try to fix something if that's not broken.Visuals:The visuals are excellent, and are slightly better than Arkham City's.The game has a lot of bugs though, and some of them are extremely annoying and sometimes they will not let you continue in your mission. For example: I encountered a major frame rate bug near the end of the game, even though my computer was able to run the game on maximum settings smoothly. I eventually managed to fix it.Aside from that, the animations look great and fluid, except for the weird lip movement in dialogue scenes (not cinematic).Multiplayer:The multiplayer can be fun at times, but it's not polished.There are 3 teams, Joker's gang, Bane's gang and Batman and Robin. Both gangs are fighting each other while Batman and Robin need to take both gangs out.It has a lot of potential but it's not well executed.Still, it's always fun to play as Batman and do inverted takedowns on helpless victims.Summary:Definitely a great addition to the Arkham series like I said, WB Games Montreal did a great job with the writing on this game and the new Batman and Joker voices are a great replacement, especially Joker's which is portrayed by the famous Troy Baker.I give this game an 8/10, the things that really bugged me were the multiplayer and the great number of bugs, I wouldn't mind waiting a few more days and get a bug free game instead.

												Arkham Origins is a slice of greasy pizza after a meal of medium-rare steak and wine. Sure, it's not outright bad, but it leaves the pallet unsatisfied. The combat felt off in Origins and for the longest time I had trouble figuring out why. But during the halfway point, I think I figured it out: The baddie placement. In the previous games, lots of care had been taken in picking which baddies work in what amounts and when special enemies were needed. Here it seems like more of a copy-paste job, carelessly throwing in specials even if their abilities severely hinders the combat. It leads to a lot of frustration and eagerness to get out of combat, something the series hasn't had an issue with until now.In terms of new content, Arkham Origins is kind of bare bones. You have a majority of your old weapons available to you very early and some new ones that, unfortunately, don't mean much in combat. Some of the items feel completely shoehorned in, such as the Sonic Batarang. Not only did it seemingly just appear in my inventory, but there is never any sort of need for it or tactical advantage for using it. So why is it here? The story is fairly muddled. It starts off with Black Mask hiring 8 supervillanous hitmen to take you down on Christmas Eve. Why Christmas Eve? ""Who cares"" is the answer the game gives. The story actually rehashes some villains, such as Bane, the Riddler, the Penguin, and Deadshot. Unfortunately there isn't much to talk about when it comes to the plot without getting into spoilers. It's not exactly clear why Black Mask hired the assassins in the first place and by the end of the game it's even more confusing. Topping that off, the game ends seemingly out of nowhere, in what I thought was the beginning of the third act. It just sort of stops. There are still a handful of graphical errors and strange Not to mention several game-stopping glitches I encountered in-game despite the titles having been out for 5 months.I don't really think fans of the last two Arkham games will get much out of Arkham Origins, it feels like microwave leftovers. The only people I would recommend this to are die-hard fans of the games or Batman in-general, and even then I would recommend getting it at a low price. Also can I mention that the game DOESN'T HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ING MOUSE SENSITIVY SETTING?			"

												This game is fanstastic.  If you're wanting to get this, my only reason not to would be if you haven't played the earlier Arkham games first. This game is much faster paced, and if you play Origins first, the earlier Arkham games won't be as fun.I've played every Arkham game and this one and Arkham Knight are my favorite.-Great Story-Great Gameplay-You really feel like batman.Cons-Side missions, like other Arkham games aren't great. Just skip these.			"

												Crappy storyline and the character models look really fake like the makers were too lazy to polish them, the multiplayer stands out in this as the better version of this game. Think of the multiplayer as a Gears of War where batman and robin are constantly harassing you while you fight the other team. The bad problem about the multiplayer however is the amount of time it takes to start up a match due to people coming into the lobby then immediatly leaving for what I believe is because they dont get to be batman or robin. The game selects batman and robin randomly and if they are already selected then people will just leave for some stupid reason. To me the money I bought it for on the steam summer sale was worth the fun multiplayer but at normal price I wouldnt have touched it.			"

												Short Review:The Good: The Main Story is more gripping and intense than Batman Arkham City. But not much better than Arkham Asylum. The Costume is more realistic giving it that Nolan esque feel to the series. Bane is one of the highlights of the series.The Bad: The combat was made faster which led to some problems like the enemy wouldn't give you much room to do your combo. On most fights it devolves into a counter fest. Effective use of gadgets could fix this. The Ugly: The world looks almost the same. It's not as detailed as Batman Arkham City. The side quests are smaller in scope and some felt rehashed from the previous game. The Riddler datapacks are easier and requires less thought than B:AC.			"

												I want to endorse this game, I really do. I've enjoyed the Arkham games and I think the stories told here are a bit closer to what I look for in a Batman story, something closer to home and a bit more grounded. However, the game is buggy. I made it through the main story with few problems, but I hit a game breaking bug while playing the Cold, Cold Heart DLC. I was not able to grapple up to an area I need to get to if I was to continue the story. This was after several times having characters I needed to interrogate not allowing me to do so and other odd bugs in the game. I restarted the game several times, and even rebooted Steam, but it made no difference. I deleted the game and decided that the frustration was no longer worth my time. I look forward to playing the next game in the series, but I cannot endorse this entry in the franchise.			"

												I'll split this up into two sections because this game has a multiplayer mode as well. I'll focus on the single player first. The main story of the game is not as long as Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. It's actually quite short if you just focus on the main objectives but it's at least enjoyable for what it is. There is a lot to visit when exploring Gotham just like you would experience when exploring Arkham City but what is in the city feels kind of trivial as you travel about. The actual story content is a lot of fun.The gameplay and fighting feel more polished to me than Arkham City. Batman seems to react better and combat feels a lot more fun. You still get upgrades and gadgets as you progress so it always feels like you are making your way forward. Batman definitely feels a lot stronger as you come towards the end of the game. Some of the upgrades however are very situational and you'll only use them a few times, an example of this would be some of the takedowns you unlock. While situations for some of these upgraded moves may be few and far between they are still very awesome when you do get the chance to pull them off.The graphics in this game are amazing, much better than Arkham City. There is some noticeable pop in from time to time but that usually happens with sandbox games of this scale and it's mostly forgivable. If you liked Arkham Asylum and Arkham City's graphics then this game won't disappoint you in that department.The sound lends to the atmosphere that in a brilliant way. You definitely get that Christmas feeling as you explore Gotham and you hear certain music or quips from Alfred. The voice actors do a great job portraying Batman and the various characters. It's not the same ones from the previous games but these voice actors made their characters sound exactly just like they should.Overall if you're a fan of Arkham City and Arkham Asylum you'll definitely enjoy the story. This game is worth it if you can find it at $20 or less.The multiplayer is disappointing in a big way. It's broken. Connections to games are rare. The message you will see the most is Connection to Steam has been dropped. This is a big issue for anyone attempting to play the multiplayer and the developer looks like they have no intention on focusing on fixing it. If you are buying this game for multiplayer then pass on it. It's enjoyable when it works but it fails more than it works.My verdict is if you can find this game on sale for $20 or less then pick it up. You'll get a great enjoyable story out of it which feels like an expansion to Arkham city and that's how I take it as. It's a lot shorter than the previous games but if you can find it at a lower price it is worth its fee. Avoid this game if you want it for the multiplayer though as it's broken since launch and continues to have a ton of problems. "

												It's the Batman game we needed, but not the game we deserved.Arhkam Origins is a fun new addition to the arkham line, with a really interesting story. It improves on a lot of areas that didn't quite work with Arkham City, but some of the new features feel incomplete and ill-thought out.Sadly, the most significant part of the game right now is the many bugs plaguing it. I hope that 6 months from now I can recomend the game without asterisks. For now, get it if you're in love with the Arkham games. Otherwise, maybe wait a bit. Bug fixes keep coming down the pipeline.			"

												Big fan of the series but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs are making it unplayable. Things that worked fantastically in the last 2 games are now suddenly huge challenges. first it was the thing where whenever batman needs to do a ground takedown and even though ctrl+click indicator appears youll see batman do a little shoulder dance not attacking and eventually getting punched in the face. Not good for a game with combat dynamics relying solely on combos which makes it fun in thwe first place. Then there's the problem where not once could I do a take down while diving. Which takes a lot of the fun away, And last is when I logged in one day and left clicking the mouse to attack would only throw equipment, Is when I deleted the game with the 40 bucks remaining up my♥♥♥♥♥hole. I barely even got to make progress fix this♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Broken MessIt has been less than a year since I have gotten Batman Arkham Origins, and with around 30 hours with the game I would have easily said that it was worth it. However in light of many performance and game breaking bugs both reported and personally experienced, I easily say that I would not recommend the game. It is evident that the publishers were not skilled enough in porting the damned thing. I was enjoying the game until around 25 hours or so when I began to notice bugs and glitches, notorious glitches on some of the levels. Whether I would be falling through the floor endlessly in an essential fight forcing you to literally make a new game, or charecter models would glitch and distort, It would always be something game breaking and irreversable causing you to roll back your saves just to ensure the game doesn't crash during something important. It is a glitchy broken mess no matter what settings I play on, whether or not Physx is enabled (which has problems in itself), or even when I switch from a very low end laptop to a mid range gaming desktop, the problems are consistent.Overall - The game is broken and there are no signs that the devs will ever come back to fix this broken mess.4/10It would have been a great game if only I was able to finish it.~LordNeonKnight			"

												Arkham Origins seems to get a lot of criticism from reviewers, some of this I agree with but not entirely.    While the story is fairly lackluster compared to the previous Arkham games the focus on the relationship between Batman and the Joker is engaging and interesting. Combat is improved to add challenge and variation which for me is the main reason to play. The new map is more varied than that of Arkham City but not by much, the greater sense of scale is very apparent though. The multiplayer is okay, fairly fun when using the heroes or Super-villains but playing as the elites is just a boring 3rd person shooter.    I don't think I would present this as the one-to-buy out of the series, in my opinion it beats Arkham City which I found bored me in parts. The combat is improved compared to Arkham Asylum but the story falls short and stops it from taking the crown of the Arkham franchise.  In conclusion, if you are new to the series buy the first one, if you know and love the series like I do, buy this one, it is a lot of fun!			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins takes place before Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, so if you've played those two I recommend this. As the title implies the story revolves Bruce Wayne's early involvement as Batman in Arkham, preparing him to meet criminal overlords he was not expecting to fight.The game play remains the same, allowing you to play as Batman by gliding across the map with his cape and taking down enemies one by one in stealth. You can impair the enemies vision with smoke, take their weapons out of commission or maybe confuse them with your Batarang. You're not forced to take out enemies silently of course since you have the freedom to go ""loud"" if you prefer that style of fighting.Unlike the previous games, Arkham Origins is packaged with a Multiplayer mode allowing you to play against others as Batman, Robin or other villains from various gangs (that I won't name since it will spoil the main story). Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to play the multiplayer mode since it always crashes during loading a game - so that's one thumbs down on that.If you're a Batman fan, I don't see why you shouldn't  play this game!Peace.

												It's tough to give a recommendation for Arkham Origins. It has been plagued by bugs and glitches ever since it was released, and to this day a fair amount of these issues remain. About two weeks ago this game stopped working altogether, which had me trouble shooting my computer for a few days. The problem was caused by a few corrupted INI files that didn't happen to get deleted when uninstalling the game in Steam. The game has been running ever since.However, even with the game working, I still find there is a siginificant amount of lag and stutter, especially when exploring the city; a serious flick in the nuts for people who have spent a lot of money on high-end hardware. It is extremely noticeable and distracting. Other than that I haven't encountered anything too aggravating so far when talking about pure bugs and glitches.As for the game itself, Arkham Origins is actually pretty good. In no way is it as groundbreaking as Arkham Aslyum or Arkham City were, though. Arkham Origins feels more like an expansion on Arkham City than an entirely new game. The combat has not been updated or improved, in fact it feels a little more sluggish than in Arkham City, there are no new noteworthy gadgets and some parts of the map are right out of Arkham City. In terms of story, I think this game actually has the best in the series, although I won't get into it to prevent any spoilers. The voice acting isn't bad, either. While I do miss Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil, both Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker are great regardless.The reason why I wouldn't recommend you get this game, is because WB Montreal really doesn't seem to give a f*** about their customers and their game. This company has no plans to fix Arkham Origins, yet has time and money to produce DLC. It is greedyness at its finest and a supreme example of why the game industry is hurting a bit right now. Unless WB Montreal fixes the game, stay away from this one and get Arkham Asylum and/or Arkham City instead, or wait for the recently announced Arkham Knight to be released in October. Although I get my enjoyment from this game, looking back now I wish I had listened to others and didn't fall for this one. It's time to take a stand against the industry and not have them bend us over and f*** us from behind. Out of pure principals, don't purchase anything from developers and publishers like this, as it will only make matters worse and worse. If you do decide to get Arkham Origins anyway, it is still good and worth playing, but I would at least wait for a price drop.			"

												I have played the first two games of Arkham series  by rocksteady and both are amongst my favourite games of all time.Regarding arkham origins,its just same as arkham city with whole Gotham as your playground and a really good story!Don't mind the critics,this game is absolutely worth it if you liked the previous games.Plus their is a decent attempt at multiplayer which is quite fun to play.If you can buy countless sequels of  COD or assassin's creed title every year,then this game definately deserves a chance.3.5/5			"

												It’s hard to believe that it has only been four years since Batman: Arkham Asylum. The title that seemingly broke the curse of non-Spider related super-heroics in gaming has cast a shadow over so many games that have come since. Its masterful combination of Nolan’s dark vision of Gotham with the expanded rogues gallery afforded by decades of comics history brought even the most mainstream of Batman’s fans up to speed on everyone from Calendar Man to Victor Zsasz. Its narrow corridors and expansive tool-set created a tight, linear narrative where players nonetheless felt completely in control. Arkham City introduced open world mechanics to the formula that arguably opened up the world too much, taking away from that tightness that made Asylum such a breath of fresh air. Now, with Arkham Origins, new developer WB Montreal has struck a great balance between the levels of Asylum and the open world of City. It doesn’t quite eclipse the original, but Origins is a much more refined sequel than City was, and it’s one that is well worth your time.Read my full review at http://www.geekenstein.com/batman-arkham-origins-review/ "

												Its a good game, not as good as Arkham City was, but its close enough. I finished up the sidequests and enigma stuff, and will probably give multiplayer a try next. It looks differnet enough to be fun for awhile, but it was not really needed in a single player game like this. Overall, a solid B+ game.			"

												*Notice: I havent tried the multiplayer, so this a singleplayer look only.*So.. This was my first Batman game ive ever played, and it was truly an amazing experience. I dont know why i havent played the Batman series before, all ive heard is that theyre always good, so yeah, i decided to try this since i got it free with my new graphics card. The gameplay and graphics are simply just great, the mechanics are very well made, as well as the animating. The fighting style in this game is some of the best, and its one of the most known fighting styles, it works perfect.The story is good, but im probably missing out on a lot since this is my first Batman game, but i did enjoy it quite a lot. It took me over 10 hours to complete, so im very satisfied with the length, since most games today only seem to last a couple hours, which is sad. But this game is really good, so over 10 hours is just perfect for me.The game also delivered some interesting boss fights and enemies in general, some annoying, but it delivered something different, which i do like. Again, the fighting style and the VERY well made stealth made it so good to play through.Some of the missions were too repetitive though, but it made up for itself in my opinion.Its very well optimized, and i wish that more games ran just as good as this game, because i must say that it runs good compared to a lot of other titles.This game is open world, so it offers a lot of options to what you can do. So more playtime there. Also multiplayer is in there, so you can spend more time on the game than just on the main story.So what would i rate it? Thats a tough one, i want to rate it 10/10 because i really enjoyed it, but some of the repetitive missions, some of the bosses and sometimes just getting lost because of misleading directions frustrated me, so ill rate it 9/10, a close 10/10.Thanks for reading!I hope you will have a look at the Batman series now, if you like me, never tried (until now) the games at all. Definitely worth a try.			"

												If you did not get bored in Arkham City and want to have more very similar action, buy Arkham Origins. If you expect real differences or development from City, then don't buy the game.Game itself is solid but not exceptional. No risks were taken when the game was created. It's still a really fun game to play and I enjoyed it thoroghly.The multiplayer mode is only a plus, but has major flaws at the moment. I can't enjoy it in its current form.Biggest bugs have been fixed, which is good. The game was almost unplayable in the first weeks.			"

												When I first heard Rocksteady wasn't doing Arkham Origins I cried like Vader.  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  My cries seemed justified at launch, as this game was riddled with game breaking bugs and glitches.However, a series of patches have resolved all my issues and since then I'm loving this newest Batman game the most.  It's essentially Batman Arkham City (BAC) again with a few new gadgets, a revamped crime investigation feature, and a multiplayer mode. Here's the new stuff you can look forward to:Gadgets - Shock gloves replace the electron gun from BAC, and they are amazingly fun to use in combat once you upgrade them.  They'll allow you to punch through armored and shielded guards without the need to cape stun.Glue grenades replace freeze nades.  Same functionality, but now it is glue!Stun grenades temporarily confuse and blind enemies causing them to swing blindly.Improved line launcher can now be used offensively by attaching it to enemies and environmental items causing collisions which disorient and take down enemies.The new crime scene investigation allows deeper exploration in Detective Vision.  You can now scan evidence and scrub the scene by rewinding the events to unlock more clues to scan.   If you enjoyed Arkham City you'll also love Orgins, but don't expect anything too much different.			"

												Amazing game. Maybe too similar to the previous Batman Arkham, but it has improved vastly on very important things, like the combat (more demanding and with 2 new basic enemies), boss fights (the best in the series) and lighting (sick of using the detective mode all time just to tell a door from a wall? Not necessary on this game).Unfortunately, the game is a bit too conservative on both combat and stealth systems, and may feel ""more of the same"" to fans of the series.It also has a very interesting and original online mode where you can play as Batman, Robin, or thugs in a power war. It's difficult to summarize, but it surely is a very interesting addition.In case you didn't know previous Batman Arkham, just to mention they are some of the best game series this gen, with a fantastic and easy to grasp combat system, all the possible charismatic enemies and characters from the Batman comics, a very nice concept of adventure with fantastic side-quests, and a very good (though not exceptionally deep) combination of combat and stealth gaming.A very honest recommendation, I was going to ignore it for looking ""too similar"" to the previous games (which I loved) but I'm happy I didn't.

												Don't buy this... Origin is known as the worse between the Batman Arkham, but with Origin I had a progression bug, I cannot finish my game...There is a little room, where you can access with the remote grapple, in the mission to localize Bane,  there is an Enimga dossier there. As the cable is there, you can get out of the room. But soon after that, I died in a combat, and the autosave function makes me appear in the room, but without the cable. And the item 8, the remote grapple gadget, won't work in this way...The least funny and the worst thing: progression  bugs... better replay Asylum or City. What a loss of time...Here a video of the bug

												Rating 8/10Overview: Action/AdventureThe Good:+ The story takes place over the course of Christmas eve. Batman has a contract on his head and has to take down multiple assassins out to kill him. The story is very well written and more cohesive than arkham city. The pacing is also excellent as the story begins to unfold the game gets more interesting. + Crime scene investigations have been improved by adding a holographic video of the crime taking place while you investigate. It is a small addition to an otherwise mundane activity but it does add a lot in terms of the feeling of solving a mystery. + Combat once again remains mostly the same with a few added enemies for good measure. There are however 2 big differences compared to the other games. The first is that more powerful combat techniques are locked behind main/side quests and challenges, making them much harder to get early on (and in some cases missable) and thus making combat more challenging especially in the early parts of the game. The second is the addition of the electric gloves, another item obtained later in the game. These gloves charge up as you punch enemies and once fully charged you can toggle the option to become nearly unstoppable: punching through any enemy regardless of what they are carrying or doing. It is practically a ""win"" button if you find combat too frustrating. The difficulty curve for combat goes from hard to frustrating to ridiculously easy. + Every boss battle is unique and fun to play. Granted some of these bosses are more flash than substance but it still feels epic to take one of these bosses down.  + Once again Riddler collectables are scattered across the map for you to find. You can (once again) find riddler informants to 'interrogate' to reveal the location on your mini map. Although I liked collecting these I also found the puzzles associated with them to be simpler than Arkham City. So long as you had the right item, it wasn't very difficult to collect any of these. I was a bit disappointed with the riddler trophies this time around. + Predator/Combat maps are available for those who want to play some post game content. Both combat and predator maps are MUCH easier than the previous two games. + Although the voice actors are not the same they do an excellent job of representing their characters + Great soundtrackThe Average:The games biggest 'fault' is that from a design standpoint it is almost identical to arkham city. The game doesn't do anything particularly new, if you played arkahm city then this game offers little surprise in terms of its gameplay, you've done it all before. Christmas Eve in Gotham means nobody is outside, no people, no cars, no...anything, just criminals looking to terrorize the city. Arkham city was able to get around this by saying this was a section of the city solely for criminals, it just feels weird in this game gliding around a city with nobody in it. Surprisingly the multiplayer is still active, even more surprisingly the multiplayer is actually fun. There are only 2 game modes and 4 maps and only one game mode is still active, it was still a lot of fun to play and it is definitely worth checking out. The problem is the community is slowly fading away and it is getting harder and harder to get a good game going. A lot of achievements are for multiplayer as well. The Bad:- The game crashed on a few occasions and I experienced a few glitches, nothing a restart couldn't fix however the game clearly lacks polish. -Missable upgrades for combat may frustrate players or completionists. ConclusionThe game starts off slow and it wasn't really doing much for me. It wasn't until the story really starts to pick up that things start getting interesting. Locking important upgrades for combat also soured me a bit in the beginning but does make sense given the story and for gameplay reasons. One problem with Arkham City was that you could obtain some of the best combat upgrades early making combat feel very trivial for the rest of the game. The boss battles are excellent but also the gameplay/build up to the boss battles as well. Every boss battle you face feels climatic. You could argue that this game is a cash grab however its a damn good cash grab. If you loved both Batman games by Rocksteady, especially Arkham City then more likely than not you too will like this game, hopefully you are not burned out by the same gameplay.    "

Originally posted by author:  Overview   Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel to both Arkham Asylum and City, and is good game, but does not live up to the examples set by either of them. It still perfectly portrays the feeling of being The Bat, however flaws in the gameplay and the somewhat derivative narrative hold it back from being another truly excellent Batman title. In order to convey my full perspective on Arkham Origins, I'll be going over its presentation, gameplay, and story, and then end with my overall final thoughts.   Originally posted by author:  Presentation  When compared to the earlier titles in the series, there has been a small but noticeable change in the presentation. The visual design/feel has a slightly weaker ""Batman"" atmosphere than the previous two games, however the sheer graphical fidelity is better than ever. The dynamic lighting is beautiful, textures are sufficiently detailed, the models are as intricate as ever, and all visual effects (other than the fire effect) are gorgeous. The snowy weather (as it is Christmas Eve during the game) fits very well into the open world design of Gotham too, however the architecture of the city itself is not as well designed as it was in Arkham City, despite large chunks of the map being redesigns from that entry in the franchise. Next up is the soundscape, which is probably the biggest positive update to the presentation. All audio whether voice, ambiance, sound effects, or music is handled exceedingly well; especially the music, which always fits the situations Batman finds himself in. With regard to the performance though, I have to say everything is a little iffy. Short frame drops are common, bugs (none game breaking) will make an appearance every now and then too, but luckily I never had any crashes. The original release of Arkham Origins was plagued by performance issues, however most short-comings in this department seem to have been fixed by now, so anyone planning on playing the game shouldn't worry too much about the performance. All in all the presentation of Arkham Origins is above average in relation to most modern games, and is on par with previous games in the series.   Originally posted by author:  Gameplay  Considering the gameplay is the most important aspect of any Batman game, I was a bit disappointed to find that nearly every change made in the gameplay was ill-advised. Starting off with the combat, most everything has been kept the same as it was in the other entries in the series so I won't go into detail on how it works, however there are some important to know overhauls to the system. Most noticeably is how huge combos are now infuriatingly easy to strike up, because Batman will literally break the laws of physics and slide across the ground a full 50 feet to punch an enemy if you're in the middle of a streak and a hostile happens to be that far away. While this was (kind of) an element in Asylum and City, it was kept to a believable distance for Batman, but in Origins it gets a bit ridiculous and comes off as lazy game design and a way to make combat easier. The only other change to the combat are some original gadgets, which do improve the gameplay. New items like the glue grenades, remote grapple, and shock gloves all come in handy throughout the game, adding some new elements to the gameplay that I'll allow you to explore yourself should you choose to play Origins. The freshest addition to the gameplay is by far the renovation of the detective system though, which now allows you to reconstruct the events of any crime scene you come across. While a cool gimmick, it does start to get repetitive at around your dozenth or so time of using the mechanic, but overall I'd say it was a good inclusion for the gameplay loop. Moving on, we now reach my biggest qualm with the gameplay, which is without a doubt the questing. While both Asylum and especially City found a way to make each side story/mission interesting to complete, Origins goes for the standard AAA open world treatment, meaning many versions of the same missions are set in different locations of the city, leading to repetitive and predictable quests. While they didn't go too overboard with copy-paste quests, it's upsetting to see this happen to a game that has done better in the past with this element. The return of the Riddlers’ puzzles also can't go without a quick mention, and this time were almost designed well enough to make me try to complete them all, but did eventually become too much of a hassle for me personally. All of this content tallies up to a slightly longer runtime than that of Arkham City's, offering ~18 hours of gameplay for most people who don't play the challenge maps. While I may have seemed a bit harsh as I talked about the gameplay, know that everything I didn't criticize is likely as good as it has always been, with many of the core mechanics still around the make the game fun to play.   Originally posted by author:  Story  Though not the origin story of Batman, Arkham Origins does, in a round-about fashion, tell the story of how the Arkham Project (i.e. Arkham Asylum and Arkham City) came to be. The plot begins on Christmas Eve around 2 years after Bruce Wayne first became The Bat, and marks an important night in the character development of Batman. Black Mask has just staged a prison break at Black Gate, and is instituting a purge of all the members of the police force and Gotham's elected officials that he had in his pocket due to his rich crime empire. Once you, as Batman, interfere with this prison break, it becomes apparent that Black Mask has it out for you, and sends several assassins, from Deadshot to Deathstroke, out to kill you with the promise of a 50 million dollar reward. This even leads to you being at odds with certain corrupt members of the police force, as Gordon has only just become commissioner, and these unsavory cops want to claim the reward for themselves. All of this climaxes at Batman's first encounter with one of his most evil adversaries, and how he deals with him afterwards. Now that the plot analysis is out of the way, let's get to my opinions. While the many villains and assassins are interesting, they are far less emotive than they have been in previous entries in the series. This is made up for by the increased focus on Bruce's relationship with Alfred though, which is handled brilliantly with some top notch writing, which produces some great moments. The same goes for the relationship between Gordon and Batman too, but to a lesser extent. In congregate the writing itself is decent, and maybe actually better than the writing in Asylum, but is still outmatched by the narrative of Arkham City. The ending is a satisfying one as well, and does a commendable job at setting the tone for the chronologically proceeding events in the series. Altogether the story of Arkham Origins is solid enough to stand up on its own two feet, but does have some perceptible faults.   Originally posted by author:  inal Thoughts  For all its flaws, Batman: Arkham Origins is still a game I'd recommend to any fan of the series. I wouldn’t as readily recommend someone plays Origins before the other Arkham games despite being chronologically first though, as it may start any new comers out on the wrong foot with the franchise. In the end, despite borrowing too much from the previous titles in the Arkham series and not innovating enough in its own right, Arkham Origins is just more of the Batman we all know and love, which isn't too bad a thing if you ask me.

Posted: October 28, 2016
												The plot of Batman: Arkham Origins is a refreshing departure from that of its two predecessors in that it resembles a bad Hollywood movie instead of a bad comic book. The game completely dumps its primary plot point early on for a tangential mess of disjointed, QTE-heavy fights and villain-hopping. There's literally a point in the final act where the main villain is imprisoned and Batman just goes and fights some side villains to kill time before his inevitable escape. There isn't a proper reason for Arkham Origins to have so many seemingly random subplots because not a one of them is any good, and none of the villains are at all as compelling as they were in Arkham City, with formerly interesting takes on comic book tropes replaced with super-fancy death battles between martial artists ending with one of them being defeated and saying something edgy like ""What are you?"" entirely unironically. Between this type of writing and lengthy, misguided attempts at forensic criminology, Arkham Origins is a hot mess of narrative shortcomings and gameplay blunders that amounts to an experience with the equivalent fun factor of Arkham City if it had been marinated in warm vomit instead of being play tested.Truly the cruellest part of Arkham Origins is that it doesn't even have the decency to simply be a bad game. No, this is the evil twin of Arkham City that was accidentally dropped as a child and promptly forgotten, and has spent the subsequent years watching its predecessor flourish in the spotlight of 9/10 ratings from mainstream media outlets and honed its skills for the moment it would release and prove to all that W.B. Games Montréal - a studio renowned for timeless classics like Cartoon Universe and the Wii U port of Arkham City - was as valid a developer as any other, and completely capable of releasing actual games as well. Except while Arkham Origins grasps the very basics of what made the series successful, (it needs combat, stealth and arbitrarily hidden  pickups), the level design, writing and pacing all got lost in translation, winding up with what is essentially a twelve hour trot through a truly diabolical parade of suffering for Arkham fans.Set on Christmas Eve, Arkham Origins depicts a young Batman in a city ravaged by rampant crime and a police force so corrupt that when influential mobster Roman Sionis - called Black Mask after his black mask - puts a $50 million bounty on the head of our brooding vigilante, the Gotham S.W.A.T. team is involved as quickly as the eight assassins privately contracted to do so. These assassins don't cooperate at all with one another, nor do they learn anything from their previous encounters with Batman, exemplified in the Electrocutioner, who is knocked unconscious by Batman in a single punch and then continues to pursue him, apparently believing he has a shot. The Electrocutioner is one of only a couple of these assassins who actually want the money. Bane in particular is established as being interested only in getting revenge on Batman for wronging him in some way. This is mentioned in passing a few times, but it never progresses past being a piece of exposition to squeeze into cool-sounding dialogue about justice. This is the primary motivator for most of the dialogue. In a tense scene between Batman and the Joker, the former demands that the Joker free a hostage now that he has arrived. The Joker responds with ""you're just a distraction, compared with what I've got up my sleeve"". In the end, of course, all the Joker wants is Batman dead, which he could, logically, have accomplished several times over in this story, but he chooses not to. It's the little things that really annoy me about this story. I can look past an overarching plot that's generally meaningless - this is a superhero game after all, but it's hard to tolerate the way Origins repeatedly sacrifices believability and common sense for cool-sounding dialogue. Combined with controls that feel like more of a suggestion than a command and a myriad of game-breaking bugs that are still mostly alive and kicking after three years, the crappy writing drags the whole thing down, providing such a wealth of things to criticise that I won't even go into a detailed analysis of its gameplay shortcomings. It would be fruitless to do so, seeing as the core product is so fundamentally misguided.My review of Batman: Arkham AsylumMy review of Batman: Arkham City "

Every Batman story Talks about Joker until we Reached at Batman arkham city:) Batman AC was the last Joker story! THE FOLLOWING BRAKET CONTAINS SPOILERS DONT READ IT! (Batman AC last mission was to kill joker)Batman AO story is about before Joker story :)  The story is Some rumors came out nobody is called Batman:) Nobody believes there is Batman:) Batman man is trying to find Black mask.GameplayGameplay is same as Batman AC, No changes:( The same game but it level went Very deeply down:(  Every one was excited with Batman AO:) unfortunately The same game! i should call it a DLC not a game:( If you got Batman AC so no need to by this:( Wanna Waste your money? SO BUY IT:) Batman AO wasn't perdicted to be shame on Warner Bros. Interactive:( Nothing to move Forward They just moved deeply very backward.GraphicsThe Graphics is same as Batman AC but with a bit of improvement, Graphics is for Next gen not this gen:( Even my settings was on 1280x720:( it required Very high settings:) This is the best thing on this game! You expect it as a movie not as a game!SoundsHmmmm......this is very Awaful!!!!!!!!! Sounds is the worst thing in this game:( you can't hear it well! technical problems with sounds:( Sometimes The sounds get a bit late on time:( Example: If you kick some guy it must apply the sounds immediately:( But this is late for 1 or 2 secs:( This is not the sounds you were expectin"" it:( Warner Bros.Interactive always get use to use sounds and they always Innovate on sounds:) But I wanna say this is not Batman sounds:(This is the worst thing i've ever seen before:(MusicSounds usually is related to the music in most games. Batman arkham origns sounds doesn't have any relationship with it!!!!!! Like i sed sounds is very awful this is amazing:)This has incredible soundtrack:) Much Better than sounds:) (I love it). This is something Very predictable on Batman series:) That every Batman had incredible sounds:) Nothing is better than Batman Arkham Origins Soundtrack:)The Verdict Unfortunately........The same Game the same gameplay the same graphics....................This should have been a DLC not a game:( This is never never never never never Batman:( This is not the game that we have been waiting for it for long ago DISAPPOINTINGStory: 6.5/10Gameplay: 2/10Graphics: 9/10Sounds: 1.5/10Music: 9.5/10+ Positives+Incredible soundstrack and music+at least Good story from the first quarter- Negatives-Repeating combats-Repeative Puzzles-Empty world-Bad stealth mod-Boring Multiplayer-Inconsistent design as stealthing-Lack on new idea's-Many technical problems-Inconsistent sounds-Bad story after the first quarter-Can't miss Joker elements-Batman at this time is very cold-No changes-Very easy puzzles-Hacking is very repeative-Nothing to move forward-Boring crimes-No Innovate on gameplay-Its very far from realisticDon't call it Batman its evern worst than deadpool beyond and call of duty:( My Batman arkham city rate is 9.7/10 but this3.2/10 Awful

												TLDR; CAVEAT EMPTOR, BUYER BEWARESo, the third outing of Rocksteady Games' Batman: Arkham franchise is upon us. Rather than Rocksteady Games however, new developer Warner Bros. Montreal are at the helm this time, and it shows. Based on an Xbox playthrough, I can safely say WB:M were very wise to make no radical departures from the existing Arkham format, characters and locations feel very familiar, the near legendary combat engine is present in full with only minor adjustments (parry leniency, strike range, shock gloves). Everything feels pretty good, barring the odd input quirk here and there (Silent Takedown? Why not walk the dinosaur instead?). The actual game itself is really good.But there's a problem. There's a laundry list of problems. We are pretty used to half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥PC ports by now, but throw in core system problems including save corruption on consoles next to a staggering list of PC issues (see http://steamcommunity.com/app/209000/discussions/0/792924952554932514/ to get started) and you have a highly questionable release on your hands. While WB:M assure they are ""working on it"", things are looking chilly. I've been unable to complete the game on PC, only on Xbox, due to ranging issues including startup and exit hard system freezes, and ultimately save file corruption 10 hours into the campaign. Given the sheer number of issues the game is having on various platforms, and the lack of resolution to these problems from the recent fixer patch, I probably won't keep trying.All said and done, I am unable to recommend Arkham Origins in any way shape or form at this time. A potentially great game worthy of the Arkham name has been rendered unplayable by a seemingly untested, thoroughly buggy release. Wait for a later edition (GOTY seems unlikely, hurr hurr hurr), or revisit either of the earlier Arkham titles instead.			"

Also it is great how the combined the story telling of asylum with the gritty fighting of city. The only thing that bored me was the Riddler challenges. They were way easy on this one. All in all I say if on sale deff grab it and if not on sale and you have the money deff grab it. gets a 9/10 stars from me!			"

												Dispite much of the criticism this game has recieved for bugs and the like, I found it to be enjoyable and rewarding.  It effectively maintained the Arkham reputation for good story and a true-to-comic depiction of the Dark Knight himself.The multiplayer, dispite early problems, is now functional and highly enjoyable: an effective way to ensure continued gameplay after having concluded the story, always a problem in earlier games.If I were to do my utmost to find a problem which seriously affected my enjoyment of the game over a long period of time, it would be the essential sameness of it to the preceeding two titles.  Very little is exciting and new.  However, if you consider it simply as an expansion of Arkham City, it is a great game.			"

												An incredibly buggy version of Arkham City (the new areas fail to contribute much to the game world) with forgettable characters and a story that went nowhere, perhaps deliberately, to persuade gamers to buy some of what looks to become a Borderlands-2-level of DLC.Nothing gameplay-wise has been improved: same gadgets, same combat and predator system, and, annoyingly, they've changed the perfectly good challenges system present in Arkham City to a sequential one, meaning you have to perform acts in a particular order. Pulled off a very difficult combo but aren't at the right stage of the vigilante challenges? Too bad, you have to do it again at a later stage.WB's appalling complacency and extremely late response to the multitude of often game-breaking bugs on the release of this game also influence my negative review and recommendation.

												What could have been a great game is flawed by some poor design choices: 'fast travel' is lazy and boring. I don't want to instantly arrive at destinations via a cut-scene of the Bat-Plane travelling; I want to fly the Bat-Plane myself and explore an open-world map in real-time. You know, like we can in decent games. I'm supposed to be Batman. Also, what's the point in unlocking cool, alternative costumes if I can't wear them until I've completed the campaign! The experience feels limited, too linear and restrictive compared to popular open-world games today. I can't help but imagine how amazing this game would have been if made with the depth and possibility of Saints Row IV. The atmosphere and story are lacking too. Disappointing. I will complete it though, because I am a long-time Batman fan, not because the game deserves my time.			"

												Excellent gameplay. Excellent graphics. Good story.However, I still DO NOT recommend this game. The reason? Bugs.It's an excellent game, but only when it works. If you get it to work, you might still run into a bug that prevents you from progressing any further. And even if you are lucky enough to never run into such bugs, you might still get save corruptions. This game uses the same autosave system that were used in Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. It will automatically save your progress, but it doesn't keep a backup. So if something should go wrong while it's saving, your save files are ruined. And that, trust me, is not fun.Just like Batman: AA and Batman: AC, the excellent gameplay was completely overshadowed by the bugs. Do not buy this game.			"

												This game tells the story of a rich sad goth and his fight against Snow White Black Mask and the Seven Eight Dwarves Mercenaries. Seriously, there are so many villains in this game that it's like listing all the dwarves from The Hobbit. Can he collect all the Chaos Emeralds in time to save Gotham?SPOILER ALERT:Yes he can, but he's  GOTTA GO FASTFive minutes into the overworld, I'd discovered a glitch where Batman got stuck on a pipe and required a restart. Combat is wounded by the fact that countering no longer cancels all attacks. If I wanted to time my attacks and not button-mash, I'd play Dark Souls. I came here to be the night, not learn to fight.Game is prettier than ads for singles in my area, and runs better than my PC after I click on those ads. Maximum spec requirements: Pentium 486, 64KB RAM (should be enough for anybody), gives you constant 120fps max settings.Alfred Moneypenny is not modelled on or voiced by Michael Caine. This ruins the immersion, I do not feel like the night.Deathstroke does not crack wise or make fourth-wall-breaking jokes, like in the comics. Also, his costume is meant to be red (not orange) and they misspelt his name 'Wade' as 'Slade' for some reason. Probably a Japanese translation error, localisation sucks.Also, Batman's web-slinging sucks, he should get lessons from Spiderman lolIf I saw this game walking down an alley next to the Monarch Theater, I'd shoot it's parents.I give this game Commissioner Gordon out of ten.

												Im a great fan of the Batman Arkham series, but with this entry the before thriving batman universe seen in the two earlier games, just seem hollow and copy-paste like.This time its awkwardly obvious how a great deal of the Batman Arkham series gets its know-how from its developers. Before RockSteady took care of this, but due to fan demand, this game came out. Now with another developer behind the helm.This shows because of much more boring storyline, overused mechanics and above all.....just abit boring and routine...Well, of course the game hold on is graphics and sound, but the most annoying thing is the lost potential....If you can get it cheap....sure....buy it. But for retail price....not a chance in hell. Stay away and wait for Batman: Arkham knight... "

												The Batman Arkham series has been epic!  I was highly anticipating this game before it came out and hyped myself up for it.  I was a bit let down when they changed game studios for production of the game and rightly so.  The first two games were soo well polished that I would play through them multiple times always finding new easter eggs and still enjoying the content.Playing through this game once was enough and I have been let down.  It isn't a terrible game it just lacks the quality that I came to expect from the first two.  I can only recommend you buy this game on sale for say $29.99 or so... I wouldn't want to have spent any more on that and know that you won't like it as much as the others, if you've played them, but it is worth a play through.Pros:-Very Large World like... 4 times the size of Arkham City-Tons of side quests that could keep you busy to add longevity to the game play-More characters to play as in challenge missions-PvP option-Duna nu na nu na nu na nu na na nu na nu na Bat Cave!Cons:-Story isn't that good-Batman never seems to be in ultimate danger like in other games in the series-No real changes to the combat system which was always a bit bland-World is big.. but sometimes too big and travel between zones is time consuming-Not impressed with the design of the map... I never felt compelled to stop and take a look around at the beauty in the design of gotham-Serious bugs on game day launch including multiple game breakers... should be all fixed now though "

Overall the game is meh, decent story even though it has issues. But it plays just like all the other games. id give like a 7-7.5/10, worth it when its on sale but i would just stick to the ones made by rock steady, those are all fantastic.			"

												I've been a fan of the Batman: Arkham series since it's inception. I've eagerly awaited each release, bought each DLC, and played countless hours in the first two games. They were nothing short of spectacular.Where the first (Arkham Assylum) established what playing as the Bat should feel like, the second (Arkham City) created a fantastic story complete with some of the best voice acting done in a game to date.This latest installment, Arkham Origins, undoes both the gameplay of the first (by having frequent glitches and crashes) and the story of the second (in that this one feels rushed, uninspired, and pushes the limits of credibility). Origins represents a large step backwards in the series, and a collasal disappointment.Saddest of all, perhaps, is that this game is meant to mark the last performance of Kevin Conroy (voice of Batman since the pivotal animated series in the 90's).I can only hope that Rocksteady -- the developers of the first two -- will retake the reigns for the next installment and bring a return to form which makes us forget about this mistep.

It also has a bunch of fun side quests lying around here and there. But yeah, this is something i really wouldn't recommend you would buy at Full price.Just pick it up during sale were it drop downs to about 5$.Overall, IMO, this game is a 7/10			"

												AO always manages to polarize the community - some people love it for it's gritty, angry Batman, it's more realistic suit and for referencing past comic tidbits (like Bane being rather cunning and clever). Others don't even want to consider it part of the main trilogy (and if you pay much attention to the Arkham City skyline in Knight you'll notice that Rockteady pretty much deleted WB's work. Adios Diamond District and the bridge.)Story wisel, it's okay. Some of the massive success behind Asylum was that it didn't push the history of the characters on you - it assumed you knew them already. Origins tries hard to introduce some key members of Batman's rogue's gallery but it's a sub par effort. It's esentially the only bit of lore that Rocksteady didn't do themselves. If nothing else it's fun to see Batman be more of a person - there's no cape-and-cowl chill when he's doing the nut, smashing computers and spitting when he growls.Oh - and counters are harder to pull off. I tell myself it's because Bruce is still too ""angry and inexperienced"" like they kept reminding us.Multiplayer mode isn't worth mentioning. I played it on PS3 and it was just broken. If you've got some friends or people who owe you, you can at least get all the achievements in private matches.All that aside, you've got a decent story, a larger Gotham space to play in that City and the Cold, Cold Heart dlc is quite good. Snag it on special.			"

												This game seems to be more about the origin of a certain Batman villain more so then Batman himself. Right from the get go you already have most of the gadgets he had in the other Arkham games with a lot of the same fighting moves as well. So it's hard to call it a really good take on the origins of Batman in any sense besides what they say about him in the cutscenes. However that doesn't mean the game is dislikable. I enjoyed it quite a bit. In fact the game contained some of the best boss fights i've had in the series thus far.It was really cool going toe to toe with some of the deadliest assassins in the DC universe such as Slade (Deathstroke), Shiva, Firefly, Deadshot, and others. They were all different from eachother and always intense. Really I feel like I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the other Arkham games. I know the formula hasn't changed much, but it's still fun and has a decent story to go along with it. Even the voice actors who filled in for Conroy and Hamill did a really good job at portraying younger versions of their characters.I have heard a lot of gruff about glitches and currupt saves and the like from various people. However, my experience has been nothing but smooth. No weird game breaking glitches or currupt saves here. Maybe I was just lucky. But i've seen no evidence of such things during my time with this game.There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that I played for an hour or so and then never touched again. Er... I don't know. I felt like it didn't add much. I guess give it a try and see if you like it.If you buy this game it's because you're a fan of the Batman Arkham series and you want more. Or because you're a huge Batman fan. Either way it's worth it at a decent price.Final Verdict (4 out of 5)			"

												It's like Arkham City but worse. Still alright. It's obviously a quick cash-in, It's nowhere near as polished as AC, and the amount of copy/paste is staggering. But it's not bad.I like games about punching people, and they more or less improved the punching people mechanics from Arkham City. The counter window is smaller, and the people punch you more aggressively. Origins has to be played more defensively, with less button mashing and more gadget use. At least on hard, normal is still easy. They tacked on some new enemy types in Origins too, which kind of work.So punching people is the most functional part of the game. There's a lot of dumb bs in the rest of it though.The story of the game makes no sense for the first half but it picks up once the Joker shows up, because the Joker is easy to write. The hyped up assassin plot is barely even relevant to the story: at no point does it feel like there's assassins trying to hunt you down. 4 out of 8 assassins are reused from they previous games because finding new villains is hard and takes work. Half of the assassins get reduced to sidequests, too, so it's actually Batman who's going after the assassins. The sidequests are kind of nonsensical. Deadshot tries to fight you in a tiny confined space in a sneak mission, even though he has a sniper rifle and could just set up camp somewhere and drop you when you glide by. I mean come on.I liked the Bane fight. The developers probably liked it too because they make you repeat it.The new crime-scene reconstruction thing is brainless and tedious. You don't even have to look for clues anymore, they give you a trail of red triangles to follow. Wow!All the AC sidequests have been copy/pasted here. Origins packs watered-down Riddler trophies (now enigma trophies), Bane Canisters (now black mask canisters) and the Zasz mission where you rush after phones (they're bombs this time). The added sidequests are mostly about punching people on the streets, which is something you'll do anyway, so that too is lazy.Many parts of the game feel like pointless filler, as if it was compulsory to pad out the game with reused assets. For some reason you go after the Penguin again and his boat hideout is laid out suspiciously like his museum from AC. You also♥♥♥♥♥♥around in the Steel Mill for a bit, go figure. Batman also gets poisoned again, presumably because they wanted to reuse his ""poisoned"" walk cycle. Then Batman goes on to have a bunch of lame hallucinations because that is part of the formula.Origins has a neat, dark winter wonderland setting, and gliding around the moody art deco town is all kinds of atmospheric. They did managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the grapnel gun a bit (it doesn't latch on to some buildings for some reason) and the map design is not nearly as tightly structured around gameplay as in AC. There's also no civilians in Gotham apparently, because of excuses. They should have at least put SOME civilians standing around here and there, but no, that's extraneous and all the corners had to be cut.I liked it and will have forgotten all about it by January.

												Although very similar to other Batman games, the core gameplay mechanics and scripting are still top notch. The best things about it are the freedom of movement and the combat. As Batman, you soar through the city skyline and swoop on the baddies and their henchmen who control the city. The array of special skills and technologies at his disposal make Batman the Swiss Army Knife of superheros.			"

												As someone who would call themselves an expert in Arkham Asylum and Akrham City, the combat is ""off"" more or less. It's doesn't feel right, and the timings are off. I was doing a first impression live on my twitch stream, and i was suprised to how many times i was hit and how often i dropped my combos. For me, it was ridiculous!When i finally unlocked some Challenge Maps, i noticed that the combat was different yet again, but this time in a better way. My theory is that the combat seems off because it changes from story to challenge depending on your difficulty (I jumped strait into hard obviously).I was dissapointed when they shifted the dynamic away from Black Mask. I too thought that it was cool to see another villain get some attention on such a grand scale. I'm only up to the twist in the game, and while not bad, i was kind of like...dissapointed. It was such an obvious route to take that i had honeslty rolled my eyes when it all happened.The game is not bad by any means! I love it actually! One thing i have to give this game is the boss fights have been incredible! Each one is different and dynamic, and Deathstroke's boss fight has to be my favorite, i don't care who says it's repetative, it was fairly epic.The online is way more solid than i thought it would be. I am really happy with it, but dissapointed that you can't party up with teams of your friends, or at least i havne't found a way too. Winning as the heroes all comes down to the skill of BOTH players, and considering they are random selects, you can't control it. The ONLY times i win as the heroes are times when my partner disconnects. It has some work to be done, but it could be a very solid point in the game, more than it already stands. (Although my stats DO keep erasing).I wouldn't put this game up there as better than Asylum or City, but if you are a fan of the first one, then give this one a shot for sure. You won't be dissapointed, but if you are worried about bugs, then do wait a bit. I go into every PC game knowing it's going to have some issues, and i have the patience to wait them out for the most part.  :batlogo:			"

												This is a tricky one.  It offers, from what I can tell, a larger world space but suffers from an insane amount of invisible walls.  Even though some can be circumvented by going out of the way a bit.  They did a good job making the city shiny though. The voice-overs aren't bad but not Kevin Conroy or Mark Hammill good.  The character models are as good as the previous games though.  The controls are the same, however the combat is a bit glitchy compared to the Arkham City; which, in my opinion, was the peak of this series.  The gadgets can also be glitchy in some instances and the game kind of lacks the polish that Arkham Asylum or City had.  And  I haven't even bothered with the online mode.  Not sure why developers feel the need to jam such things into single player games like this.  However, I guess Rocksteady is making a prequel to Arkham Asylum... which this game kind of is... and will most likely be of far better quality than this game is.  That all being said, if you really liked the last two games and don't want to wait for the next actual, REAL Arkham game then buy this one... but I would wait until it is $15 or less.  Definitely not worth the asking price or even half the release price.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel storyline occurring several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City. Taking place before the rise of Gotham City’s most dangerous villains and assassins, the game showcases a young, raw, unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight. As the story unfolds, witness identities being formed and key relationships being forged.For me it is the weakest part of Batman games. But still good game. +Multiplayer. Prefer to buy.			"

												I don't know what the problem people have with this game is, but I don't care what those people think.  Batman arkham origins without being made by rocksteady is an amazing game with a great story line.  It's Batman raw, before he was always thinking everything 4 steps ahead, before he knew what he was doing all the time, before he gave a damn about hurting people.  This batman doesn't play about he goes in and kicks♥♥♥♥♥if you want a comparison think of the episode from BTAS back in the 90s when batman didn't have any fear and maneuvered through bullets like he was invincible.  That's how this batman rolls.Mechanics in this game are what you would expect from an Arkham game, the crime mode picking up the clues is quite a nice touch, being able to look for evidence and see how a crime has happened in slow motion looks amazing and adds a nice touch to Bruce Waynes chest of toys to play with you wish you could have.Without spoiling the story Joker in this game is absolutely amazing, even though it's not Mark Hamil voicing him anymore it feels like a great homage to him when you hear his voice and Joker as a character is as great as you would expect him to be.I completed the game but didn't do much of the side missions so I can't say much else for anything apart from the story but if you like all of the other Batman Arkham games you'll like this one.TL;DR Don't listen to idiots hating because it's not rocksteady, GG is a GG and this company did Rocksteady justice along with Batman, buy it if you like the series.

												If you're looking for something different from Arkham City, I suggest running away from this as fast as possible.This is what one might call an ""iterative"" sequel. It adds virtually nothing new. HOWEVER, when you're building on what is near perfection, that's not a bad thing.Combat is slightly more refined to what it should be, story is a lot stronger, missions are a little worse, open world is terrible, multiplayer is interesting, new detective mode is good. Oh, and the game is A LOT HARDER.Call WB Montreal lazy, but it's still a great game.			"

												let me start by saying I'm the type that buys and plays a lot of games, but I don't usually beat them.  I did however beat the first two Arkham games and did so with ease and pure enjoyment, but this one for some reason is missing something. The pros -Graphics are nice although not a huge leap forward and the usual pop in associated with Unreal Engine games is here so one minute it's a muddled mess then next details pop in-Start off with a wide variety of gadgets although you could conceivably find this to be a flaw if you're nitpicky about plot and wonder how an origin story can have gadgets that were developed in the future -combat is nice as usual and challenge maps are also fun and offer a pleasant deviation from the main story -A large number of villians to go up against Cons -The combat timing in this one can be inconsistent whereas in City and Asylum is was consistent and flowing although that could be noob talk -The story isnt as engaging and enthralling as city's or Asylum's and I see myself beating this game eventually, but it wont be like the previous two where It is was like a great ride that came to an end it'll be eh, lets give this another try. -The villains are less compelling and lack personallity -The bugs have been fixed for the most part, but there are still some to be found especially in combat -The environment is dull and traveling can be tedious Summary it's more of the same in a lot of ways which is no surprise, but what is a surprise is that sequels usually are bad and the third one gets it back on track but this one, having not been produced by Rockstar, is an obvious step down in writing, atmosphere, quality assurance, and is clearly fan placation until the true sequel Arkham Knight is released. So should you get it? Well, if you loved the first two you may or might not like this especially if you go in with high expectations, but if you want more of the same then get it on sale. If you haven't played the other two then either one would be a better choice to be honest, my favorite being city although Asylum is a classic.			"

												TL:DR version: Arkham Origins is a not very innovative, but not a complete messup either. The boss fights are greatly improved, with the story and voice keeping the same high quality. The gameplay has no great improvements besides a few tweaks and the Riddler side missions took a hit. But all in all, the game is fun and deserves your money. 8/10Batman Arkham Origins, the game many have anticipated since the day Arkham City release, is in many senses a flop/masterpiece. The gameplay is somewhat stale, but the bosses are greatly improved; the story is almost on par with Arkham City (and definately better than Arkham Asylum), but it's release was buggy. Therefore, I am going to review each part of the game seperately, then give you the final score (a weighted average with more important elements have greater weights). The scores are from 1-10 with a 1 being garbage, a 5 being average, and a 10 being spectacular.1. The Gameplay - Both the greatest strength and weakness of this new endeavor in the Arkham series is it's gameplay. While WB Games Montreal was smart in not trying to rewrite a broken system, they also did not bring much new to the table in terms of gadgets and fighting mechanics. There are some cool new gadgets like Deathstroke's remote zipline, and these are implemented fairly well into the game. Others however, such as electrocutioner's gloves make the game to easy in some aspects by allowing you to bypass the difficulty of the shielded and armor wearing enemies. The puzzles in the campaign are fun and challenging (a couple stumped me for a little bit) but the riddler side of the game has been slightly downgraded (as of this review the Burneley tower bug has been fixed so 100% is now possible).Gameplay - 7/102. The Boss Fights - The boss fights in Arkham Origins are easily the greatest improvement over Arkham City. With all of them being intuitive, imaginative, and creative, they are a joy to play. Most take something from an Arkham City boss and upgrade it e.g. taking the quick countering of Ra's al Ghul and then adding timing, variations, and a higher level of control for the Deathstroke fight (which is tied with the three part masterpiece of Bane's boss fight for best fight). This part is great, and I hope Rocksteady takes notes for the upcoming Arkham game they have been hinting at. The only dissapointing fight was the Electrocutioner, but it more served as comic relief than an actual flaw.Boss Fights - 10/103. The Story - The story of Arkham Origins has its ups and downs, but for the most part is solid. While I would have liked all eight of the Assassins to have gotten their own boss fight each, they are each implemented well in the story (with the exception of Electrocutioner). The game has its share of twists of turns that attempt to reach the glory of the now infamous ending to Arkham City (which I will not spoil, but if you have not played that game, fix that now, before you even think of playing this game. Arkham Asylum is also fun, but in my opinion is not critical to play before Origins. But you should.), but that in the end cannot due to the incredibly high bar. The story at some points feel slightly disjointed and confusing, but does wrap up quite nicely with a solid, though not incredible ending.Story - 8/104. Visuals - Arkham Origins has some slight improvements in the visuals, but overall not too much too offer in terms of newness. The cutscenes however, are beautiful and incredibly fun to watch, but the ingame graphics are only slightly better than Arkham City (which was as a side note, a beautiful game, don't get me wrong). Batman does move a bit smoother, but in the end it feels somewhat stale and halfhearted.Visuals - 7/105. New Features - This is kind of a grab bag of features that caught my attention, for better or for worse. One of the coolest things they added was an amazing new Crime Scene mode. You can recreate what happened during a crime and then look for clues based on where they were and following their trajectory. Another new feature is the Fast Travel System. I'm sure many liked this system, but for me it took away from the experiance. I love the feeling of flying around the city, looking for and stopping crime, and just feeling like an all around beast. But, since the Fast Travel is optional, there is really no fault in it, just personal preferance on whether it should be used or not.New Features - 7/106. Gotham City - While Gotham itself is not as big is many including myself thought it would be, it still is quite large, albeit that half of the city is a reskinned Arkham City with some new features. The other half however is as much a joy to explore as the Arkham City was in in its namesake of a game, the highlight being the ability to sneak in and take out corrupt GCPD officers in their own building. Perfect? No. Fun? Yes.Gotham City - 7.5/107. Online Play - Online Play is a variation of the regular team deathmatch mode with a twist. There are two teams of three henchman, either Bane's or Joker's, fighting each other, and one team of two, Batman and Robin, trying to stop them both. It's fun for a short while, and though I haven't gotten tired of it yet I have not played very much of it yet and could see one getting tired of it quickly down the road. What we really all want (Rocksteady take notes) is the ability to do a co-op campaign. But that isn't what we got and the multiplayer itself isn't bad. Just don't expect this to be the next big third person shooter.Online Play - 7/108. Voice Acting - Another major strength of the game is the voice acting. Many were scared to have Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy relinquishing their respecive roles as the Joker and Batman, but fear no more. Troy Baker as a younger Joker nailed it perfectly and while there are slight differences, none are bad, and I am perfectly ok with him taking up the mantle as the Joker. His pauses, his laugh, his switch from soft to screaming in an instant, it's all perfect and I loved it. Roger Craig Smith took over Batman, and while I still stick with Kevin Conroy as the best, Roger does a good job showing what a younger Batman might have sounded like, not perfect, but still admirable and enjoyable. Other characters are voiced by the same actors as those from Arkham City, such as Tara Strong as the loveable but ever annoying (in a good way) Harley Quinn. The voice acting keeps it's high quality and it is always fun to just sit on a roof and listen to some annoying crook rant about the cold or missing Christmas DinnerVoice Acting - 9/109. Side Missions - Side missions have always been a fun part of the Arkham series, looking around to find as many villians as you can, and this holds true, for the most part, here. All of the side missions are fun and interesting in their own way, whether it be gameplay, puzzles, wierdness (see Mad Hatter), or the conversations that go on while do them. The one exception to this rule, and one of the biggest dissapointments of the game so far has been the Riddler puzzles. These have been made much easier, and there are so many of these ""datapacks it becomes a chore. The radio towers add a little variety, but in the end the Riddler is a flop.Side Missions - 8/10With all that said, what is the game's final score? Arkham Origins is a hard game to review, because it's hard to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with it. In the end though, it falls short of its lofty expectations without being a bad game by itself. Batman: Arkham Origins earns a 7/10 on release (due to bugs) and an 8/10 with patches, but I am going to blame the bugs on WB pushing the game out the Door and give it a Final Score of 8/10. It isn't perfect, but it is well worth your purchase, though I highly recommend picking up the first two, Arkham Asylum and Arkham City first.Have Fun!-Daniel			"

												I love Batman games in general I am going to give my review of the game.So first of all let’s start with the game mechanics, They are really good and super responsive I have to say that, but there are times when it feels like its requesting more commands and does extra punches or use baterangs or sometimes even change gadgets unwillingly. The controls are easy to use and very customizable indeed. You can have more than one button that executes the same control and/or ability. Now let’s talk about the A.I thugs and villains. Thy need MAJOR bug fixes some may just keep running straight into the wall and disappear, there was one time where I lost a missions and I restarted and all the thugs I had to knockout just vanished, NOT COOL! I came here for a challenge I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I'm finding it too easy. I would have to give the mechanics a 7/10.Let’s talk about the music. I really like the music I mean I do. There's just one problem, the soundtrack is just too short only around about three-four hours. Then it can get really annoying and repetitive. I would suggest make a DLC soundtrack like most games do I don't care if it's from the previous Batman Arkham games, I personally think music from Arkham city would be a great addition! Until that happens I give it an 8/10.Onto the story line. The story is absolutely MARVOLOUS! I love it, great acting, great modeling, and the music just fits right in, it really does put you into suspense and makes you want to finish the game just to experience the story. I also love the side missions, how you learn more about Enigma, Anarchy, The Penguins A.K.A Cobble pot, is just fascinating. I give it a 10/10.The upgrade system. This is where it got really disappointing, I thought there would be a bunch more. It's too easy to level up and when I got the last few upgrades I was sad because I couldn't lvl up any higher. I think it would have been better with more customization and at least thirty+ upgrades to unlock. I give this a 6/10.The map. I personally don't think you can get the map wrong and I mean any game shouldn't, this is where it bothers me a lot. There are some times where I am in in area and it shows me somewhere in the middle of the ocean. I have to say there are long periods of time where I have to wait while I use the Batwing for fast travel I had to wait for three minutes one time! I give this a 9/10.Multiplayer. All I have to say is that it sucks! no one is on, you have to wait a good five minutes for a full lobby, but I do have to say the idea was good where two people are randomly selected to be Batman and/or Robin, and the rest gets to choose to be either in Joker's crew or Bane's. I give it a 4/10.The last thing I'm going to talk about are the DLC's, there are some amazing DLC's to get for this game, they are incredible fun and entertaining adds a whole new level of gameplay. I love the challenge maps, skin packs from previous games, different characters to play as all of that. I give it a 10/10.Overall I do think it's a good Batman game to own, but wait till it's on sale next summer because I got it with all the DLC's for 13$ even though normal price is 87$ I did the math. It's not worth all that money. I will give my overall impression the game deserves a 7/10. "

												Batman: Arkham Origins is a game that follows the same formula as the past ones. Beat♥♥♥♥♥♥up with a satisfying combat system and have a damn good time. But it ain't without it's flaws. The prerendered cutscenes look bleddy awful when compared to the game on near-max settings, and I've had far more bugs than in Rocksteady's man-dressed-like-a-bat games. For example, in huge swarm-like fights, one or two enemies will often get stuck in walls, leaving you to have to start the fight again. Furthermore, the final boss battle requires you to perform a beatdown on the enemy. This beatdown is completely nonfunctional with a keyboard and mouse, allowing you to punch only twice without plugging in a controller. That being said, the core gameplay is still great and the story is, in my opinion, far more fleshed out than the previous Batfink games. In conclusion, Bluntman: Harlem Oranges is a pretty decent game, which you should buy from your local Torrent retailer.			"

												I've played all the Arkham games and Origins is  probably my favourite entry in the Arkham series. Set as a precursor to the Arkham series, it tells Batman's beginnings as the Dark Knight and his initial struggles of vigilantism.I often feel a distinct lack of a satisfying boss battle in all the Rocksteady developed Arkham games. Arkham Origins is about Black Mask setting a bounty on Batman's head, it might seem a bit of an overload to cram in 8 villains into this game, that's what I though, but man did Splash Damage pull it off. Its a one-on-one showdown between the Bat and the villains. Each villain plays differently and beautifully. The boss fight with Deathstroke is one of my favourite moments in the Arkham series. Regarding DLC, only the one featuring Mr Freeze is worth a purchase.			"

												Update: It's been 6 months now, and nothing has been done to address any of the below issues. In fact, WB who are the ones responsible for this mess of bad code, have taken the stance that it's far more to release their precious DLC's at the right time, than it is to make the actual game playable for those who bought it. As it stands, this game is still next to completely unplayable, and it's not deserving of oyur time, effort or money. Had I known how broken this game was, and how WB would rather see me spend another 9.99 on some stupid DLC than have me play their game, I'd not even buy this game if it showed up at 75% off. There's nothing that can be done to redeem WB and their disgusting view on what's right and what's wrong. Please, boycot this game and let game-companies all over the world know that we're not going to just gopple down any fresh excrement they release into our gaping mouthes.Original review follows below.- - - - - -Warning: Do not buy this game! In it's current state it is buggy and at some points, completely broken! These issues include random crashes, graphical issues, such as severe screen shaking and flickering images. There are issues with the sound in certain parts, and there are more progression-blocking bugs known that can be looked up online.Do not buy this game for the single player experience before these bugs have been officially fixed, and the game is no longer broken. Releasing a game in this state, when you're such a big company with so many resources is just not okay. To be honest, people would be angry about these kinds of issues in indie games.			"

The voice acting and story reveal are top notch+ Good additions: Score system, I am the night mode- Terrible level design, bad city design- Full of bugs- Fillers, easy riddles and direct copy-pastes- The smoothnes and battle rhythm from AC is goneScore: 70/100			"

												This game had a lot of potential and it's an okay game. But there are a lot of bugs and glitches, especially during the launch. I'm suffering from a major bug where the cutscenes take too long to load, causing it to not be in sync with the game and it even gets cut off at times. It also didn't quite capture the feel of the first two games, which had very beautiful scenery and atmospheres. This game abandoned that and replaced it with very, very gray and dark areas. The first two games had a very smooth combat system, where the game would instantly respond to your inputs, but this game somehow managed to break it, leaving behind very low-accuracy attacks, and counters that sometimes wouldn't even respond (which is especially obvious during the deathstroke fight, which basically is a mashup between counters and quick time events that almost certainly miss, causing a more difficult than it should be fight). The predator system is very different from the last two, pretty much only having one way to clear a room without being detected, unlike the numerous ways to do so before. The game also suffers from having gameplay and story segregated heavily, such as the grapnel boost, which was supposedly in experimental phase during Arkham City, with this being a prequel, it doesn't make that much sense at all. Finally, the story wasn't very engaging either. Hopefully the next installment can be made by Rocksteady again and we can forget this slip as soon as possible.			"

												AO is a solid game despite the vitriol surrounding it. The story itself stands out as the best in the series, taking a page from the Nolan book both in terms of visuals (the bat suit is clearly a carbon copy of Bale’s in the Dark Knight), and in a preference for (relative) realism over mystical ninjas and shapeshifters. Still, the few game play innovations Arkham Origins manages to make are disappointing—namely the ""I-win"" shock gloves that sap all thought from combat and break any RP connection you have with old bats, and the remote claw which, while cool in concept, ends up giving the player three free stealth kills in every predator encounter. Since most stealth sections contain eight thugs max, this majorly undercuts the teeth-grinding challenge they ought to pose in the latter half of the game. The world also feels empty. There are Riddler challenges to tackle but nowhere near as many as in Arkham City. Gone too are the citizens of Gotham, relegated to their homes by a dubious Christmas Eve curfew. This in particular robs the game of a potentially fantastic innovation—the interplay between Batman and the common citizen. Wouldn’t you love hurdle over a rooftop only to land next to an awed/terrified couple canoodling on the fire escape? How would they react? How would YOU react? Part of Batman’s mystique is the image he cuts in the non-criminal mind. In the next game I’d love to see that aspect explored.			"

												Long story short, it's a good game. Not as good as City, also pretty much the same formula, and a massive reuse of assets, but it's still a good and enjoyable game. Singleplayer component is fun, the story is decent, good even, and fighting is as good as always. The new detective analysis scenes are entertaining, even if simple. The game has a great gallery of Batman villains. Compared to console versions the PC version is great. Unlimited FPS, too!However, be warned that there are bugs. I got lucky, I only got one amusing bug,

			One of many bugs in Arkham Origins :D		

but some people were unable to finish the game because of bugs. It's also yet another Joker story. The multiplayer mode is forgettable. The FoV is criminally low even for a 3rd person game, and Batman looks tiny compared to the world he's in - doors are twice as tall as he is, wtf? Cutscenes are 720p unfortunetly. Still, the biggest ""problem"" is that it's just not a huge jump from City, like City was for Asylum.Still, a good game. If you've played City, you don't need more information. If you haven't look up City instead.			"

												I was kinda not sure about this release of the franchise, but as soon as I started to play it, it was clear that it matches the intensity and the realism of the previous 2 games in the trilogy. As this is the prequel to both the games, the starting journey of Batman was very interesting to learn by playing the game as I have read the comics and the game has done justice to it. The gameplay ofcourse matches the previous versions as that was my first doubt when WB Games took over this one. But after completing the game there is still soo many objectives to do that it was amazing and can still play for hours and hours and not get bored. The only thing I felt was not done excellent in my point of view was that the boss fights were kinda easy and not too challenging as I would have hoped, it was the same thing over and over again doing same moves same weaknesses but I think overall this game was great if not amazing.

												Like so many superheroes, Batman as a real life crime fighter would be ludicrous. In comic books, movies and games, Batman works when the darkness is turned all the way up to 11 and the drama is dialled right up. And it's amid this inky blackness and relentless peril that WB Games Montreal has taken the Bat once again, following in the intimidating footsteps of Rocksteady, and the incredibly lofty bar it set with Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.Batman: Arkham Origins takes Bruce Wayne back to his roots with a story set prior to the events of the first two games. On paper it sounds like a foolhardy idea to make a prequel, with a whole new voice cast no less, and it begged the question, could WB Montreal match Rocksteady in the execution? In short, the answer is a resounding yes. Batman: Arkham Origins is more of the same in the Arkham City mould, but in the best way imaginable.""Boom! Power stance, baby!""Origins' narrative is pretty meaty stuff too, set in the heart of a Gotham City that's tearing itself apart as villains rip through its decaying streets on the search for the Dark Knight, in the vain hope that they'll score Black Mask's $50 million bounty. The game could have quite easily been a romp from A to B, dispatching the assassins out to kill Batman in sequence, but instead there's a strong story laden with twists and turns, and the odd unexpected surprise for the fans.Bats himself is relatively new to a life of fighting crime in Arkham Origins, a myth on the streets of Gotham, largely unknown by Captain Jim Gordon and the GCPD, and written off as a freak; a bizarre sideshow, a menace. Chatter among thugs roaming the gloomy alleyways reveals talk of sightings, conjecture and hearsay about the Bat, with most dismissing his existence as ghost stories and spooky hokum. Until you show up on the scene and prove that you are in fact all too real, that is. This particular version of Batman is also one who's self-involved, determined to go it alone and fuelled by anger. He's younger, more brash, raw and reckless.Like Asylum and City before it, Arkham Origins is about instilling fear in your enemies, although essentially the series' core gameplay mechanics remain untouched, with a few tweaked gadgets like the glue grenade, the odd new one like the concussion detonator, and a couple of fresh moves in Bats' repertoire. Though is has to be said, turning the tables on enemies with the shock gloves is an exceptionally empowering thrill.A game still largely comprised of exploration, free flow combat and predator sections, if you've played Rocksteady's previous two Batman games you'll feel right at home with this one. Arkham Origins doesn't set out to break the mould or reinvent the rules, and yet it still seems like a bold game, and one that proves relentlessly entertaining as you breathlessly freewheel from one set-piece to the next.""Get that thing out of my face.""Instead of familiarity breeding contempt, Batman: Arkham Origins somehow feels fresh. Even when you bump into a building you're sure you've seen in Arkham City a million times before, it's from a different Gotham years in the past, indistinguishable enough from its future counterpart. Indeed, the city itself is in an entirely different state, with none of the flooding that claimed a chunk Gotham in the previous game, and some taller and more imposing architecture to scale.Arkham City's locked down Gotham was an urban nightmare caked in rust and decay, ruled by feral gangs running amok. Origins' version is a city on a steep downward spiral, but one where there's still a shred of hope buried beneath its seething cauldron of corruption. Knowing that glimmer of hope amounts to nothing doesn't make the atmosphere and tension any less palpable.If anything there are more criminal gangs and crooked cops on the streets, and when you're not punching their faces to burger, you'll be foiling another one of The Riddler's plots, tracking down Anarky, Shiva, Deadshot and a host of other villains that you could ignore altogether if you chose to. There's a whole raft of optional tasks to complete in addition to what is a solid 10-15 hours of story. Collectibles are just the tip of a very big iceberg.""Shocking.""On top of all of this is an improved and more involving Detective Mode, in which Batman gets to prove his credentials as the great and much-vaunted sleuth that he's supposed to be. You now set about reconstructing a crime, piecing together the components of what transpired, before Bats comes to his own conclusion. It's not exactly LA Noire, but it beats the previous games' efforts.Arkham Origins is not without its frustrations however, and some of the Predator encounters and boss battles can prove trying at certain junctures. Predator areas aren't quite so clearly defined in some cases, and controlling Bats can prove fiddly when there's no obvious place to hide. There's a fight with Deathstroke too where the game attempts to explain that you need to look for an opening to strike and time your counter moves accordingly, but the result is messy and the ultimate outcome – at least in our personal experience – feels arbitrary.On top of a generously proportioned campaign is an entirely separate multiplayer component, assigned to its own disc and outsourced to UK Brink studio Splash Damage. Multiplayer takes nothing away from the fantastic single-player, and has a few neat ideas of its own. Is it a unique enough proposition to stand out? Not really. A rather shoddy Gears of War clone, multiplayer pits two criminal gangs against one another in a straight-up shootout, then throws randomly selected players into the mix who assume control of Batman and Robin. It's playing as the dynamic duo that proves the most fun, filling your Intimidation Meter and swooping down upon unsuspecting enemies.The batarang. Don't leave home without it.Conversely, playing as a bog standard thug is typical tacked-on multiplayer fare with a decent cover system and solid shooter mechanic. It clearly sets out what it aims to do, and Splash Damage has done a fine job in creating a multiplayer mode that slots neatly into the Batman Arkhamverse, but it's hard to imagine it'll have legs amid a slew of better multiplayer options already available and just on the horizon. Multiplayer isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but its long-term appeal is questionable.If you want to complete the entire achievement list, you'll have to put some time in with the multiplayer however. That means reaching Prestige level and achieving maximum rank with both the Bane and Joker gang factions, which will take a good few hours and then some. The story campaign is where it's at of course, and this time there's not only New Game Plus to beat, but there's also the 'I Am The Night' mode. Chuck in achievements attached to the Challenge Rooms, and the wealth of content and replay value on offer is simply staggering.A triumphant third outing for the Dark Knight, Batman: Arkham Origins is proof positive that the series is in safe hands with WB Games Montreal. Building upon the strong foundations of the first two Arkham titles, Origins boasts the same marriage of compelling storytelling, uncompromising gameplay, killer combat and faithfulness to the source material. Batman: Arkham Origins is an empowering rollercoaster ride and a more than worthy successor to the cowl and cape. Another dark heroic fantasy that demands to be played.			"

												I love this game. I think its the worst one in the series but its still a fantastic game. I love the batman arkham franchise and I wish they would make more games but I think arkham knight will be the last in the series. I love it so much I bought the Cold Cold Heart dlc to put 50 minutes for in this game. I 100 percented this game in 16 hours and i had some fantastic side misions to do which is one more hour and this game has some bugs ans glitches. The Riddler data packs and riddler towers are very fun to get. I highly recomend this game. The best side mission though was the one the only mad hatter dream mission i loved it and you should too. It kinda sucked that black mask wasnt the main character and it was the joker again but that was alright. This has fantastic boss battles like the Deathstroke one!!!!			"

												A good extension of the series but not as enjoyable as Arkham Asylum or Arkham City; partially because it doesn't add much new functionality, but also because the combat (a key piece of the Batman series) doesn't feel as smooth. Still plenty to do beyond the main story, which was over with only 30% overall game completion. Play with an Xbox controller.			"

The story, combat and free-roaming aspects of this game were really good and it didn't do anything wrong that the previous two did right in my opinion. I get that some people just decide to hate the game from the start because it has a different developer, but I think they did everything right in this title.

So the city is great and is not in ruins like in Arkham City.controls, graphics and story are awesome. And now you have a training center at the batcave and you can play as Deathstrok on the training center.and you got to play agains new caracters like Deathstroke, Firefly and Bane.Also they added a Multiplayer layer.

												This game seems to be more about the origin of a certain Batman villain more so then Batman himself. Right from the get go you already have most of the gadgets he had in the other Arkham games with a lot of the same fighting moves as well. So it's hard to call it a really good take on the origins of Batman in any sense besides what they say about him in the cutscenes. However that doesn't mean the game is dislikable. I enjoyed it quite a bit. In fact the game contained some of the best boss fights i've had in the series thus far.It was really cool going toe to toe with some of the deadliest assassins in the DC universe such as Slade (Deathstroke), Shiva, Firefly, Deadshot, and others. They were all different from eachother and always intense. Really I feel like I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the other Arkham games. I know the formula hasn't changed much, but it's still fun and has a decent story to go along with it. Even the voice actors who filled in for Conroy and Hamill did a really good job at portraying younger versions of their characters.I have heard a lot of gruff about glitches and currupt saves and the like from various people. However, my experience has been nothing but smooth. No weird game breaking glitches or currupt saves here. Maybe I was just lucky. But i've seen no evidence of such things during my time with this game.There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that I played for an hour or so and then never touched again. Er... I don't know. I felt like it didn't add much. I guess give it a try and see if you like it.If you buy this game it's because you're a fan of the Batman Arkham series and you want more. Or because you're a huge Batman fan. Either way it's worth it at a decent price.Final Verdict (4 out of 5)			"

												The first part of the game was pretty linear compared to Arkham city and it took a bit for the game to get interesting.  The Joker is really well done and there fun to be had.  The thing that killed it for me was a level with dead eye.  The level starts with guys heading toward you, but it immediately switches to a zoom mode and takes away control.  Then the keyboard bindings kept getting reset changing my stealth to zoom and my punch to throwing grenades.  I get that under control and then there's a hostage situation about 10-15 minutes in that just ends the mission.  This mission was so frustrating and poorly designed I wanted to smash things and quit the game right there.			"

												To Whom it may concern: i have never played any of the other batman arkham games.This was the first batman game i ever played and i timed it perfectly. This game is a prequel to the other two batman games although it was technically the third game that was made. I am going to break the game down based on gameplay, story, and batman's costume as well as the look of arkham. Gameplay:1. Easy to learn2. Combat is realistic3. Almost all tools that you gain as the game progresses are used at some time 4. (After doing some reasearch) The game play is relatively the same compared to the other games5.The boss fights are very fun, while also being chalenging Story:1. The story is logical and makes scence 2. The characters rolls are well portrayed3. This game explains(mostly) how the other games came to pass4. The story has unexpected twists and turnsCostume/Graphics:1. The batman costume is updated and more armored2. The Villans are also updated with newer looking costumes and voice actors3. Even the lower graphics setting look very good. My computer can only run medium to low graphics on most games but batman arkham origins looks good even on low settings In conclusion this game is a very good option to buy. It has aspects of the other games while it also updates the graphics and apearance of the characters are updated. This game is worth every penny and if you enjoyed the rest of the batman arkham series. Even if you have never played any of the other batman games this would be a very good option.9/10			"

												The game is awesome . Don't understand why it's all so dislike ? It has an interesting plot , charismatic villains , drama , good gameplay and much more ! The story-first in the story, you just need to find a Black Mask(who knows , it's the villain ) , but then things are much more interesting , but I will not write because it's spoilers . Bosses-they are elegant , every battle with them is interesting and varied , except with the Bane of the battle was a little overexposed , but still , the rest of the bosses at the height of the battle with them look uneven and cool . Drama-in the game it is present and I'm really worried about the main characters of the game.The suit look very cool , but I have no doubt , because it is Batman Arkham .Of the minuses can only say that the moments when you need to get to something , to find something very boring , but then you reach the goal and receive the sea of positive feelings ! As well as bugs - they are there enough . I recommend - 9/10P. S. You'll meet the Joker			"

												This game has its good point and its bad points, but its bad points beat me, here's why.The game failed to update that I'd completed various missions, such as stating that I still needed to collect the second chip in order to find the Penguin when I had in fact already used it to track down the Penguin.Regular goons are much more observant, resulting in very few opportunities to be sneaky batman unless the encounter is specifically designed for it.The ctrl button seems to have a large delay, resulting in it often not activating at all and the insta-kill move against downed enemies is hit and miss.On occasion a boss that had to be killed to progress the game would fall through the floor.Bosses would randomly realise that they could dodge attacks and their ability to dodge would skyrocket effectively negating strategies that worked against them in every reload before and after.The story was good, the graphics were nice, but these issues of gameplay have made it a struggle to play.

												Inherently, everything that is good about this game was in the previous two titles that were made by Rocksteady. This game offers very little new content, with half the assassins ending up being overshadowed side mission that don't do the characters justice.The game itself is still quite good, with most of the core mechanics remaining the same. Movements, expecially grappling and gliding are a little off, and the combat (with the City approach of 'more guys = harder) starts to show it's flaws when surrounded by 20+ enemies.Overall, this game still has a very solid core to it, and should definitely be played. Yes, it is the weakest in the series, but that is because the first two were so strong. Some of the elements of this game are nicely done, just pretend multiplayer doesn't exist though. Writing (although I personally did not like the story) is quite nicely done, and everything about this game still holds it's own.The weakest part of this game is that it is the third in a series, and it is definitely a step backwards. If this was a first up game, we would still highlight the flaws but could see the room for improvment. The sad fact is that there have been two games already that have overall been better. But I do encourage you to play this game, because it is still the same engine and gameplay as the first two - and that is still a damn good thing.			"

												The game we asked for but not the game we wanted.I write this review as a fan of the Arkham series with a huge preference towards Arkham City.  If you believe that makes me biassed I suppose I would be a fool to disagree.However, on with my thoughts on this game.  I was one of the people who experienced delays with getting their game and the issues I experienced with installing it have been well documented on the forum.  So after finally getting it installed I started playing with the mindset ""I really want to like this but I am already hating it"", so I was extremely biassed from the outset.  Then the game started and the intro was not really on par with the previous titles.  With Arkham City, the story was broken relatively slowly.  Origins certainly upped the ante and decided upon a bit of a more ""up tempo"" beginning.  A bit of a video, a quick change, into the action and off to Black Gate Prison we go for the obligatory ""prologue""/""training"" level.  This is something very common in games now.  The prologue not only trains you (if you're not already familiar with the Arkham controls) but gives you a quick intro to the story.  After that you're in the city of Gotham, going about doing the ususal goon punching.  The story develops at a pace that is a bit start/stop.  After you face the first boss (who I was surprised to face so early) you then hit the city (both figuratively and literally) fullfilling quests that at times feel a little hollow.  There has been many comments about the larger city scape being not much more than a cut and paste affair.  Which is true, there are often quite literally parts which show that WB Montreal had access to the assets from the previous games and were explicitly told to use them.  (I even noticed in the end credits that part of the Rocksteady team that worked on the previous titles were drafted in to help with the game build.)  But then, reusing assets is nothing new and has been happening in the animation world for years.  When the developers announced this and did the usual publicity, the adage that was reinforced was ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" and it's fair to say that's almost true.  However I think they also forgot the ""if it's fixed, then don't break it"" which is how I feel the combat is sometimes - that is broken.  There are times that I find myself swearing at the game because I have felt the combat is not as good as it perhaps should have been.  Teleporting enemies, bats that are a foot longer than they're shown in the modelling, counters not working correctly.  It's tough to get the timing of the combat in this game at times with the game breaking the rhythm that you've learned to play to (and that's after adapting my combat technique from the City one to the Origins one).  Yes, I kind of excused that at first, after all we're playing a less refined Batman earlier in his career but when a game breaks the rhythm and timing that it has established, that's a bit off.Yes, there's reused world space assets, yes there's reused goons, (both of these things are how games in a series are made) and no this game did not innovate as much as the others.  The one area they did innovate gets overlooked and that's the crime scene analysis and detective vision.  There's more reason to use detective vision in this game with all the hidden pieces to find but the new Crime Scene Investigation (or CSI:Gotham) part are marred by the fact that they're not used all that often and they are nothing more than interactive cut-scenes with a large portion of hand-holding.  It's not a case of finding the evidence but looking where you're told to look.  Anyone who's been gaming for a reasonable amount of time is quite adept at finding those elements in games on there own - either by deductive reasoning or by understanding video game mechanics.  The whole hand-holding you through those parts just ruined any innovation they had brought in.  Ok, so that's the ""packaging"" of the game - what about the story?  Well, ladies and gents, if you're looking for a really meaty story about the origins of Batman then watch those films with Christian Bale.  This game is about the Origins of the Arkham trilogy (which is only a trilogy due to the fact they bought this a third title out).  While it tries very hard to make it's mark on the series, it just come across to me as a ""tribute"" to the Arkam series rather than a title that deserves to be in the trilogy on it's own merits.  Reused assets aside, there are story elements that are all too annoying to forgive.  (no spoilers but there was one part when I shouted at my computer and turned the game off for all of ten minutes questioning the whole ""did you really pull that?"")There are contrivances to every story in the world, but the contrivances of this game are, not to be melodramatic (unlike this point in the game), plain unforgivable.  This game tries really hard not to be but just ends up being contrived.  Shoe-horning elements in to fit the canon and making a foul up of it along the way.  The plot twists never shocked me and the contrivances annoyed me.  Which is a shame because, by and large, the performaces of the voice actors wasn't wholly terrible.  You could easily forgive and forget that Troy Baker wasn't Mark Hammill.  While trying to put his own ""mark"" on his performance of his part (see what I did there?) he did well in aping Mark Hammill's performance.  The performance of Roger Craig Smith was passable when he could remember that he was playing the Arkham Batman and not the Christian Bale Batman.  (It was funny if I noticed this change mid sentence and even funnier when he did a full Bale/Arkham/Bale conversion in one conversation).  The criticisms of others saying ""oh, but it's nothing new"" either missed the point of buying another game in the same series (which is to get more of what we already knew, so where's the fail?) or completly overlooked what was new and innovative (which didn't always work).  At least this could run in DX11 straight out of the box which left use with a very pretty game.  If you're a fan of the series, you probably already bought it and have made up your mind about it.  If you're not a fan of the series, then consider this Arkham Batman light (all the taste but only half the calories), not a bad contribution if it's the first ever Batman game you played.  Which I suppose is not a bad thing.  If anything could be considered a fail in regards to this game, that is the setting.  Setting a Batman game (or any game for that matter) to a Christmas backdrop and releasing it in October produces two problems.  One, when the game is beaten before christmas and you've played quite a few hours of it, you're sick of Christmas before Advent begins.  Two - it's Batman.  If you're going to send out a lot of people to hunt down a double-hard vigilante who wears a costume resembling a bat then Christmas is not the best time (especially when you release a game in October). The best time (as voiced by my partner) is surely Halloween?  Setting a game at Christmas makes replayability a bit weird.  Afterall who wants to be thinking of Christmas in May?  And replayability of a game is a major selling point to me, personally.  Horror can be done all year round but Christmas Eve defines a very short period of replayability to me. We Batman fans however wanted another Batman game and that's what we got.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the game we expected but it seems foolhardy to be compaining about getting what you asked for.  Rocksteady set the bar so high that it was always going to be tough for this game to be an ""instant classic"" and while it doesn't quite live up to it's predessors it's definitely a good introduction to the series for newcommers.  I have my own theories about this but it's beyond the scope of this review.			"

												Arkham Origins is a mixed bag of the best that the franchise has to offer and the worst that a montreal based company can offer. It's batman thats for sure, and the villians well they are entertaining to fight. The machanics that follow each confrontation have that familiar once you get it its easy feel, and the story or narratvie does a little bit to flesh out this alternate version of the caped crusader however. The question remains is this title nessisary? The previous two and the following arkham knight are a set trilogy, and are confirmed to be apart of the same continuity and story. So making the transition between each title feels seamless. Less like a new installment and more like a continuation. Unfortunatley Arkham Origins while on many levels being very much a ""origins"" story feels a little disconnected. It feels like it should be apart of its own trilogy. The new gameplay mechanics , and side quests feel a little bit tacked on as such. In that sort of Assasins creed collectables kind of way. Overall though its as I had stated before still very much a batman game just doesn't quite feel like an arkham game. Like for example in Arkham City after you find enough riddler trophies not only are you given an alternate task to save hostages, but your also given an opportunity to catch the riddler or in this game Enigma. In this game all that effort really just amounts to getting an acheivement or a trophy. Which I mean its kind of nice but it lacks the closure or menace of completeing, or not completeing a case file. Like when you hunt down hush in Arkham City , and he reveals his identity before vanishing while leaving you trapped inside his lair. You have to accept you couldn't catch him, and your left wondering whats next.I definetly wouldn't give this game a ten maybe a 7.5, and that would be the reason why. These side quests don't feel fleshed out they feel tached on and repetitive. Taking into account the limitations of the hardware other glaring issues i.e where are the gotham citizens? are forgivable.I'd still reccomend playing this game just play it before Arkham Asylum. Not just for story purposes , but because If you play this game after Arkham city you will likley find it a little disappointing.			"

												Batman Arkham Origins is basically an expansion pack to Arkham City. In that way, if you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this, provided you aren't already burnt out on the whole thing.Combat is a bit arcade-y which is kind of nice for people who seek to score high. Additional multipliers for not being hit, varying your attacks, I can see the draw to the challenge modes that further this goal. The shock gauntlets kind of cheese the difficulty by being able to override shields and foes that typically have to be stunned, so it feels like a bit of depth is lost once you have those. Perhaps alieviated when played on a higher difficulty. I just played on normal.The stealth sections or room clears didn't gel with me. Particularly because I guess I was not great at them. Clearly them silently seems to require extensive patience since any stealth take down typically results in the enemies finding the body and them all being near each other until you wait for them to spread out again. Plus it's easy enough to just to knock out who you want and then retreat to the rafters and repeat.Story is forgettable. Joker is bad. Other villians. Yes. Cool.No real interesting variations to the boss fights. Just lots of enemy hoards or sneaking around. For the most part.People who seek collectables and enjoy filling bars will find plenty to do. Clearing optional villian based objectives or performing combat challenges. I'd enjoyed clearing the map and the Most Wanted but Enigma Trophies are too numerous and same-y for me to drop the time required to gather those up. I can see the draw, though.7/10. It's Batman.

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the 3rd installment in the Arkham series and is the prequel to the previous 2 games. It takes place in Old and New Gotham on the night of Christmas Eve, and wouldn't ya know, someone wants to kill Batman. He has been targeted for assassination by multiple assassins, including, but not limited to, Killer Croc, Bane, and Deathstroke. Some people would like to say that this game is the worst in the franchise, but is this correct? Well, it definitely has its moments. In fact, I believe it is much more influential and memorable than Arkham Asylum, the first in the series of these games.Now, do I recommend this game? Oh yes. This game was enough fun for me to return to it multiple times, and it has much more to do even after completing the game, like challenge maps where you can actually play as Deathstroke.The gameplay is pretty much the same as the last 2 games in this series. Nothing fancy here, just some new gadgets, which I will not spoil.Alfred has a much larger role in this game, acting as your go-to guy for info, and your... Well... Advice guy. The story took a big turn for me, and I wasn't expecting it to go where it did.This game truly did not deserve the bad reputations that it got, and in my opinion, is the second best in the series.

												In this game you play as muti-billionaire Tony Stark as he decides to live up to his dead parents legacy by beating up anyone on the streets of New Jersey, and maybe stopping some crime bosses along the way. And Heath Ledger makes an appearance as a gay cowboy as well.In this game you are given tons of gadgets to play with, all of which are incredibly contrived and don't actually make you feel like Bat Iron Man at all. You fight a multitude of bosses, all of which are really boring, especially when you fight Solid Snake Slade. That battle consists of pressing counter for an hour and nothing else, eventually Solid Snake Slade gives up and you have him arrested.When you are beating up random citizens of Gotham, the combat feels fine. Although the fighting style of Bat Iron Man is akin to a very nimble amature boxer and would get him beat up in the real world. GG Bat Iron Man, you dead.The game has some very interesting plot twists, you think you are fighting one big bad guy, then it throws you through a loop when you have to go beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Booker DeWitt, I mean, Heath Ledger the Gay Cowboy.All in All I think Bat Iron Man Tony Stark EA Origin is a game with a contrived plot that feels needlessly long and jumps around worse than this review. 0/10, since there were no female characters and I felt like the game was oppressing me.

												I've been a fan of the Batman: Arkham series since it's inception. I've eagerly awaited each release, bought each DLC, and played countless hours in the first two games. They were nothing short of spectacular.Where the first (Arkham Assylum) established what playing as the Bat should feel like, the second (Arkham City) created a fantastic story complete with some of the best voice acting done in a game to date.This latest installment, Arkham Origins, undoes both the gameplay of the first (by having frequent glitches and crashes) and the story of the second (in that this one feels rushed, uninspired, and pushes the limits of credibility). Origins represents a large step backwards in the series, and a collasal disappointment.Saddest of all, perhaps, is that this game is meant to mark the last performance of Kevin Conroy (voice of Batman since the pivotal animated series in the 90's).I can only hope that Rocksteady -- the developers of the first two -- will retake the reigns for the next installment and bring a return to form which makes us forget about this mistep.

												This game tells the story of a rich sad goth and his fight against Snow White Black Mask and the Seven Eight Dwarves Mercenaries. Seriously, there are so many villains in this game that it's like listing all the dwarves from The Hobbit. Can he collect all the Chaos Emeralds in time to save Gotham?SPOILER ALERT:Yes he can, but he's  GOTTA GO FASTFive minutes into the overworld, I'd discovered a glitch where Batman got stuck on a pipe and required a restart. Combat is wounded by the fact that countering no longer cancels all attacks. If I wanted to time my attacks and not button-mash, I'd play Dark Souls. I came here to be the night, not learn to fight.Game is prettier than ads for singles in my area, and runs better than my PC after I click on those ads. Maximum spec requirements: Pentium 486, 64KB RAM (should be enough for anybody), gives you constant 120fps max settings.Alfred Moneypenny is not modelled on or voiced by Michael Caine. This ruins the immersion, I do not feel like the night.Deathstroke does not crack wise or make fourth-wall-breaking jokes, like in the comics. Also, his costume is meant to be red (not orange) and they misspelt his name 'Wade' as 'Slade' for some reason. Probably a Japanese translation error, localisation sucks.Also, Batman's web-slinging sucks, he should get lessons from Spiderman lolIf I saw this game walking down an alley next to the Monarch Theater, I'd shoot it's parents.I give this game Commissioner Gordon out of ten.

												Warning: Spoilers AheadIf you want to know what I think of the game without spoilers, just know that: It's a great entry point for people starting the series, and still an enjoyable romp for veterans of the series despite the overall uninspired level design and combat. The story and performance of the characters is what sells this entry, and in my opinion is a must play/watch for any Batman fan.This game gets lots of flack, and only some of it is deserved. I agree with people who say the game itself is uninspired, borrowing practically every element of their game from Rocksteady's preceding games. I also agree that when it first released, it was a buggy mess. Thankfully most major issues are all fixed now, and I didn't run into anything game breaking (a far cry from when I played it at launch on the 360).Now, despite Origins' lack of innovation, I still think it's well put together. The actual design of the game, which admittedly lifts much of Arkham City's design, is very well done, and despite some reviews I've seen that say they added nothing of their own, there are TONS of added easter eggs and content that reward Bat-fans. Furthermore, Origins adds one cool new thing that is original and adds a much needed kick into Arkham's aging combat system; the shock gloves. The shock gloves alleviate some of the tedium of combat that veterans of the Arkham series are likely getting a bit tired of, if only because they mastered it two games ago. It is essentially a temporary super powerup, allowing Batman to do even more damage to enemies and therefore ending fights even quicker. They are also incorporated into a few puzzles, but aren't actually that clever despite looking pretty cool.Speaking of puzzles, one thing Origins does better than any of the other Arkham games are the crime-scene reconstructions. They have multiple steps, and are a lot of fun to figure out. Yes, it may be scifi mumbo jumbo, but it's engaging nonetheless.Most importantly, I feel that Origin's story is overlooked completely by most critics. The story of Origins is objectively the best in the series. It isn't overly convoluted, and doesn't contain any out-of-character moments like the Titan-Joker fight in Asylum. While I truly appreciate the comic-book style storytelling in the first two games, and I certainly don't think Batman needs his origin retold ever again, the Arkham games nonetheless are not good entry points to casual Bat-fans. Despite it being common knowledge amongst many comic-readers, most gamers had no idea who Oracle was in Asylum, and the fact that there were many people online legitimately trying to figure out who Azrael was supposed to be in City only cements that most players are casual Batfans. Despite my personal appreciation of Rocksteady's willingness to jump into the deep end of Batman lore, I can't help but think that it hurts various storytelling elements and opportunities.Origins, on the other hand, tells a concise Batman story, where motivations, plot twists, and themes all come together and really impress on a more universal level.It should also be noted that while I don't think Roger Craig Smith did a bad job as Batman, he certainly doesn't have the range nor depth of Conroy. Troy Baker as the Joker, on the other hand, is in some ways even better than Hamil. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Hamil's Joker, but unfortunately for Hamil he was never really given an opportunity to cut loose with the character until much later in his career of voicing him, and his vocal chords at that point simply couldn't take that kind of strain. Baker is in his prime, and takes Hamil's version of the Joker (indeed, it is still Hamil's Joker, and I know Baker wouldn't deny it) to new levels of gritty realism and black humor that Hamil's Joker never got to really experience but a handful of times. It could be argued that Arkham Origins' plot is centrally about Batman and Joker's relationship's Origin. There is a brilliant section in the game that takes the classic Bruce Timm/Paul Dini story Mad Love, and somehow makes it even better by taking Joker's manipulation of Harley to another level completely. After being asked to describe fate by Harley, Joker begins rattling off his origin in typical dramatic fashion. The thing that's brilliant to me is that it's unclear if Joker even realizes that he's manipulating Harely; his romantic description of fate and everything it entails is [from the player's perspective] clearly concerning his relationship with Batman, but to Harley, it sounds like Joker is spilling out his feelings for her. This whole section plays out from a rather dramatic and abstract thought-plane from the Joker's perspective, with the player controlling Joker, maneuvering him through this surreal landscape while he describes how important fate is to him. It's all done so well, and Baker's performance really shines.Another point that shines in the game overall are the new boss encounters. The assassins out to kill Batman are all capable, and in my opinion the real standout is the fight with a female Copperhead. While similar to the R'as fight from City, Copperhead's hard-to-read, snake-like movements make for an intense fight. Certainly, the boss fights overall in Origins are more varied than Asylum by far, and even City in my opinion, although nothing tops the Mr. Freeze fight from City.Speaking of Mr. Freeze, the one extra DLC story mission is concerning Freeze's origins within the Arkhamverse. It starts out in Wayne Manor, and the player gets to control Bruce for a long while, which I always enjoy. It tells more or less the same story as the classic animated series tale, but modernizes it in a few key ways. For one, Batman reconstructs the fateful moment concerning Freeze's tragic origin, and this reconstruction is by far more engaging than the Animated Series original version where Batman simply sneaks into a security room and watches some easily-accessed, surprisingly well edited security tapes. Beyond that, though, there really isn't a substantial departure from the original tale, and like other elements of Origins, simply seems uninspired. It's done well enough, and it's worth playing through just to hear Marice LaMarche's performance as Mr. Freeze.So overall, despite its uninspired gameplay and in certain cases storytelling, Arkham Origins is still quite well made, and certainly worth a playthrough for fans and non-fans of Batman alike. Just because it's uninspired doesn't mean it's bad, and now that it has been patched for a non-glitchy experience, there's no reason not to give it a play. The music is well done, if again, uninspired (it's mostly Gothic renditions of Christmas themes, since the game takes place during Christmas Eve). The voice acting is overall quite great, as well as the digital acting. The story is well put together and stands out as the most accessible and arguably well-written entry in the Arkham series.

												let me start by saying I'm the type that buys and plays a lot of games, but I don't usually beat them.  I did however beat the first two Arkham games and did so with ease and pure enjoyment, but this one for some reason is missing something. The pros -Graphics are nice although not a huge leap forward and the usual pop in associated with Unreal Engine games is here so one minute it's a muddled mess then next details pop in-Start off with a wide variety of gadgets although you could conceivably find this to be a flaw if you're nitpicky about plot and wonder how an origin story can have gadgets that were developed in the future -combat is nice as usual and challenge maps are also fun and offer a pleasant deviation from the main story -A large number of villians to go up against Cons -The combat timing in this one can be inconsistent whereas in City and Asylum is was consistent and flowing although that could be noob talk -The story isnt as engaging and enthralling as city's or Asylum's and I see myself beating this game eventually, but it wont be like the previous two where It is was like a great ride that came to an end it'll be eh, lets give this another try. -The villains are less compelling and lack personallity -The bugs have been fixed for the most part, but there are still some to be found especially in combat -The environment is dull and traveling can be tedious Summary it's more of the same in a lot of ways which is no surprise, but what is a surprise is that sequels usually are bad and the third one gets it back on track but this one, having not been produced by Rockstar, is an obvious step down in writing, atmosphere, quality assurance, and is clearly fan placation until the true sequel Arkham Knight is released. So should you get it? Well, if you loved the first two you may or might not like this especially if you go in with high expectations, but if you want more of the same then get it on sale. If you haven't played the other two then either one would be a better choice to be honest, my favorite being city although Asylum is a classic.			"

												Although not as good as City, Origins is still a pretty good game in it's own right, and it's gameplay style will be very familiar to players of the previous two games. Origins definitely had a huge lot to live up to when it was brought out, as many people felt that City was unbeatable and that the Warner Bros studio would mess up. In my opinion, the gameplay and freedom was much better in this game, as it has a larger world to explore than City. The story, however, wasn't nearly what it should've been, and felt rushed and unfinished in places. As Origins is a prequel to the first games, it could easily be skipped without missing much, but to players who want an extra dose of Arkham before the new game releases next year, it's a worthwile purchase without a doubt.

												The game has a few bugs, but I honestly enjoyed it more than Arkham City. The main and only reason I really say this is because the games story is much better paced than Arkham City. There's a reason why all the villains you run into and fight are in Origins, not just there because they can be or to make a one very brief cameo. Gameplay wise it's the same as City for the most part, even a good amount of gadgets are the same, but I still enjoyed using them and the few new ones. Highly recommended and a great game in an already fun and highly rated series.			"

												Buggy and a pathetic port of a console game. They didn't even try to pretend that this was going to be played on a PC. The menu describing the controls actually shows the XBox controls, not computer controls. (i.e. Use X for this, Y for that, no mention of keyboard at all). This is a massive problem because in the first few minutes, you WILL get stuck because the game doesn't tell you to let go of the batclaw by pressing Left Control. Furthermore, the game glitches out massively and frequently. For example, it is very common to complete an interrogation mission, but the interrogation option doesn't actually appear/work. Your only choice at that point is to exit the game, re-load, and do it all over again. Also, the game will freeze and crash at one point during a cutscene after a mission. It hasn't been patched, and a google search shows that you have to manually modify the config file to fix it. The graphics are nice, but with such broken gameplay, its a total waste. Do yourself a favor and get Arkham City instead, its basically the same gameplay, but its not broken.			"

												Glitches aside, one of my main problems is how the game handles upgrades. The first time that I played this game, I didn't know that you were supposed to do the side missions to unlock critical strikes or gadgets (the game doesn't explain this at all). Especially when doing the worst nightmare challenges which are really easy to miss since you cannot do them inside challenge mode. Otherwise, Arkham Origins  could have been a great Batman game; the story was there including some great voice acting by Roger Graig Smith (who is does a great Batman) and Troy Baker who doesn't sound like himself at all as the Joker. So I find myself unable to recommend this game at full price. Wait for any Steam sale or price reduction.			"

It effectively maintained the Arkham reputation for good story and a true-to-comic depiction of the Dark Knight himself.The multiplayer, dispite early problems, is now functional and highly enjoyable: an effective way to ensure continued gameplay after having concluded the story, always a problem in earlier games.If I were to do my utmost to find a problem which seriously affected my enjoyment of the game over a long period of time, it would be the essential sameness of it to the preceeding two titles.  Very little is exciting and new.  However, if you consider it simply as an expansion of Arkham City, it is a great game.			"

												While Arkham Origins (AO) didn't really revolutionize the Batman gaming franchise it did provide one good thing and that was more Batman. In my mind this game was more of an extended expansion pack of Arkham City with many of the same features with a couple new ones sprinkled in here and there. While some may have been hoping for an all new Batman experience I was content to continue on being the same old badass I had been in the previous games. As with the other games the story is well done and kept me interested. Although I do wish that some of the newer characters that were introduced were explained a bit more. As their stories were a bit lackluster. Overall though I think the story was fun.As for the mechanics there isn't much new here if you've played any of the previous games. The same great free flow combat system is in place with a few new gadgets to play with. Overall though, combat is largely the same. I did enjoy the remake of the detective mode and all of the cool features that now come with that. It made me feel like more of an actual detective than I was in previous games. Finally, for the online portions. I have not put that many hours into the online area yet, although from the short time I've spent there I'm not sure I will. While some what intriguing and posing a particularly interesting gameplay mechanic of having a 3 team match. The fact that that is the only game mode available makes it a lot less interesting. Combine lack of players in with that too and you have a fairly lackluster multiplayer. Overall, the ideas are interesting, but the execution is poor.In closing, I really enjoyed the game. If you liked the previous Batman games, you'll probably like this one too.			"

												As a fan of Rocksteady's previous Arkham games, I too was skeptical - as many others were - of Arkham Origins being handed over to another studio (WB Montreal). However, at least for the most part, they've done a damn fine job. Arkham Origins thankfully stands up as a great third entry into the Batman Arkham franchise.Gameplay remains largely unchanged from Arkham City, but why fix what isn't broken? The excellent Freeflow combat system is back and as good as ever, though enemy attacks are a LOT harder to dodge - this gets very frustrating in larger fights. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but frankly I find it annoying. That being said, I think that's literally my only gripe with the game.The ""predator"" sequences, wherein you sneak around a room, slowly picking off enemies one by one, is as awesome as ever. You still feel like the Dark Knight himself throughout the entire game. And there's a lot of game here - it'll take you over 20 hours to do everything in the game, and then there's New Game Plus and the new permadeath mode: I Am The Night. Odd that a game like this has a permadeath mode, but I guess if you really want a challenge, go for it.The story in Arkham Origins is my favourite in the series, by far. There's a lot of great twists and turns you definitely won't see coming, but it also has a few predictable moments. I really don't want to spoil anything, but every scene that involves The Joker is solid gold. Speaking of Joker, Mark Hamill stepped down from the role after Arkham City, but Troy Baker certainly does a fantastic job of filling the spot, even if he does sound like he's trying to be Hamill.Batman also sounds way too much like Chris Redfield from the Resident Evil series, but that's because they now share the same voice actor (Roger Craig Smith). It's a real shame Kevin Conroy isn't voicing Bats here.Overall, Arkham Origins is a great Batman game, and well worth playing for the incredible story alone. I've just finished off everything in the main game, and now I'm going straight for the challenge maps and New Game Plus.			"

												Let me first start by saying that I am no longer a extreme gamer, meaning my playing time has been significantly cut within the past years. Because of things like work and other responsibilities, but I still love to play games when I can find the time. Luckily I have played through the past 2 Batman games in this current franchise, so I can give you a nice over view. Most website will tell you its the same old Batman from last year and the year before, nothing new here boring. Don't let that hinder you from trying this game. Yeah it may throw you off the what is suppose to be the youngest version of Batman has all the gadgets and moves that the vets have. But those thoughts will quickly dissipate when you get into the game. Like most of you that may take the time to read this, I LOVE BATMAN!! don't wish I was him but wouldn't mind having his money. And this is a Batman fans dream game, and like the Arkham City Game you will find yourself getting immersed in the story. This tale of how it all began is just so well written, that I am currently playing through it again just because I enjoyed it that much! I won't get into it cause I don't want to spoil anything, just trust me and play it. And if you have played the other games in the serious you might wanna start this one on the hard setting. Its just better that way.			"

The combat is flawless, the city if full of details (even though some of the ""love"" is absent), the plot and (quite surprisingly) the voice acting is absolutely superb.

												Origins was nearly guaranteed to be a best selling game judging by the two prior games in the series. It's important to remember, however, that the game is made by a different developer, and worst of all: It shows. While Arkham Origins' storyline and characters are amazing, including the new ""younger"" cast of voices for some characters, the mechanics themselves are querky. For once you are limited to grappeling to certain areas only while soaring through the skies of Gotham, and random glitchy occurences will also have you performing flips in the air, going through objects, or best of all punching someone twenty feet away as the game teleports you to the nearest enemy regardless of distance during your combos. Putting aside these imperfections, however, the storyline is progressively exciting with great twists for any fan of the lore. Surprise appearances by various personalities are also a treat, but nothing beats watching Batman's struggles as he learns to mature over the course of this game with the help of Alfred as he realizes he cannot be the sole savior of a city when its filled with villians he could never have imagined.

												Though it is an unneeded game in the franchise and many will be put off by its visual departure and lack of inventiveness, it is still a good game.Pros-Visually great! I personally like Batman's younger less blocky look. I was always a bit put off with how derpy Bruce looked in the past games. So this was a welcome change in my book.-Atmosphere. Arkham City made me feel cold while i was playing it. It gave me the sensation that i was snug and cozy in my batsuit while all the unlucky thugs were miserabley cold. Arkham Origins makes me feel that if it wasn't for my batsuite I would be suffering from hypothermia. The added christmas vibe gives this the best apmosphere in all of the games in my opinion.-Story. I have to confess I haven't beat the story yet but I honestly don't see it being any better or worse than the previous titles. It is a perfect excuse to suit up as Bats and beat up on a portion of the Rogue's gallery. Will update this after I have completed it.Cons-Multiplayer. A very creative idea and when a match gets going (after waiting anywhere from 5-20 minutes) it CAN be alot of fun. But like many mp games these days it was an after thought and this game is very evident. It's nice to see a different mp idea surface but it needed more time to stew.-Tech. Once again we have an Arkham PC release with poorly used DX11 and Physx tech in it. I found, like Arkham City, when gliding around Gotham and DX11 is enabled the game starts spurting and stuttering so much that it pulled me out of the experience. Thankfully you can disable dx11 features to make the game a much smoother experience. Though still not 100% free of the stutter (thank you unreal engine). I disabled mine from the ini file which seemed to do a better job than simply disabling it from the in game options. And honstely, you're not missing much with these features turned off. If you are a gamer, like me, who prefers fluidity over graphical fidelity then do yourself a favor and TURN DX11 OFF.-COD syndrome. No advancement. Nothing new to see here other than story and some new visuals. If you are expecting a change like we saw in Arkham Asylimg to Arkham City then you will be dissapointed. However don't let that stop you from enjoying a game that is still really good despite it not stepping outside of the box a bit. Here's to hoping the next game doesn't follow suit.Despite some bumps and bruises throughout this game it is still a fantastic title. Especially to Bat fans and those who are jonesing for a bit more Arkham in their gaming library. Give it a whirl!			"

												Naysayers abound for this game and I have no idea why!  This game by far made me feel like Batman than the other two by a wide margin.  Batman in a prison and Batman in a bigger prison  is neat but actually going through Gotham City and interacting with police on the streets was a much awaited experience.  Whoever said the boss battles in Origins are dull must love generic, because in my opinion on Arkham Asylum and Arkham City boss battles was lackluster at best.  The only boss battle I enjoyed at any length was the Mr. Freeze battle where you had to use your wits to defeat him.  In Origins almost every boss battle was clearly thought out and AMAZING (Especially Deadpool).  The weather effects and the music are fantastic.  Some people have said they added snow to hide the draw distance, but I think it looks impressive regardless (Especially if you have a good PC)  Some people have also said the story was nonsensical.  I'm not sure what aspects of the story are so nonsensical but I enjoyed it greatly.  Yes, you meet Joker yet again, but the depth of the characters is really on full display here.Now the negatives:-The Riddler ending - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!  Look it up on You tube and I promise you won't want to see the ending either.  They should have given him a lesser role if they wanted to have that ending. (Aka, not wasting a couple of hours going to every crevice of the city.)-The bridge.  Even with the quick travel system that bridge was exhausting to go through.  And you WILL go back and forth.-The city is alive only when you have events do to. I think this is mostly on the fact of the dev being handed this instead of having two games prior to work within their own merits (small grace, if they do another Arkham this aspect won't be so forgiving)-Upgrades.  They are boring.  Plain and simple boring.  The fact they are connected to different systems in the game is more frustrating than anything else.  I don't know why they chose to go in this direction but it's frustrating.-Audio tapes.  Why can't they take notes from System Shock, Deadspace, and a litany of other games where you can listen WHILE you play.  They might be great tapes but I wouldn't know, sitting on a single non-moving screen seeing the tape play is just plain boring.  No transcripts, either.That being said, I think it's the best of the three.  I hope they fix the problems and really make the next Batman (hopefully give them a couple years to get it perfect, don't annualize it!) what it deserves to be.			"

												What is the definition of a blockbuster game? Well, some would say that either of the games from the Arkham series are exactly that. What Arkham Origins is, however...is not much different from what the other two games were. So much of the story was in the shadows until now, when Origins was made to be a prequel to the other two monumental games. What Arkham Origins isn't however…an overhyped or underwhelming game, in fact...it has much more content than what Arkham Asylum had. I personally always wanted to see what all happened before the first game, because there was quite a bit of backstory between Batman and the villains that lead up to the first game. Here is my experience and thoughts of Batman: Arkham Origins.Gameplay: What some people complain about is that the game is more or less the same than Arkham City. This would seem like it is a little bit of a problem, but Arkham City is an amazing game. Having the same concept for the gameplay is more good than bad. Combat is what Arkham has always been, a beat-em-up system with combos similar to how Devil May Cry is. Every new mechanic added to the game, while not making it counterproductive to what the premise of the game or story is.Sound: Everything seems to be up to par with using the old sounds, with all the new sounds being clean and precise. Not much has been changed or improved, but how can you improve on something that was already perfect? There were little problems with sound cutting out or not triggering, but it was more of with one cutscene that you will see whenever you use the fast travel points that are in the city.Graphics: Arkham Origins is a demanding game, like how Asylum and City were when they came out. I am currently using a GTX 760, and it was running the temp close to 80 C yet still able to run on max at 60+ FPS in 1920x1080. What the game gives is a masterpiece molded together into a beautiful but dark game. PhysX is used to more of an effect than most other games with smaller objects like dollar bills, toilet paper thrown around and even steam that reacts to your movements.Story: Everything that was culminated in the Arkham story is all shown at it's start, with quite a few of the villains that were talked about in the story were actually battled for the first time. It does feel like the general story that Batman does have, but it's a timeless classic and does deserve to be told in the ways that it is done nowadays. Batman has a massive $50 million bounty put onto his head by an unknown person, with every villain and mercenary gunning for your head. It gives you a sense of doubt that you can handle everything that is thrown at you, with many story elements around every corner.Multiplayer: This part of the game I have yet to be able to get into due to poor Steam integration and lack of dedicated servers. In the year 2014, there are and will be games that are going to use Peer-2-Peer as a main source for online server hosting. Though this does make me sad, because from what I have seen in videos of people being able to play the multiplayer with others, it does also make me hope that others will attempt to play it more.Overall, it's an amazing game and well worth buying if you plan on playing the other games. Playing this one first before Asylum and City is a great way to be introduced to the story and characters since it is in fact the beginning of the Batman in the Arkham storyline. The few bugs and glitches that I did encounter were somewhat annoying, but nothing major happened throughout the several hours I spent playing through this game. Definitely worth the money that I spent on the game, and will be willing to play the game again, as it does have quite a bit of extra content both during the story and after it is over.			"

												I just responded to a friend's positive recommendation of this game with the following and realized that I never ""unrecommended"" it officially, so here's my lazy copy and paste:Personally, it was by far the weakest of the three games and was definitively generic as opposed to the stellar work of Rocksteady's creations. It was despicably mediocre and clunky and lazy in design. As much as I like Troy Baker and it may have been the voice direction and not his fault, but Joker was not the Joker. He wasn't scary or funny or remarkable in any way. He was a deranged bad guy like any of the others: boring.Pros:- Batman's replacement voice actor- license and established Rocksteady IP- letting us see how Joker sees things- the new detective casesOther than that, it was a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor Arkham City reboot. I have replayed the first 2 games at least 3 times each and will probably go back for more in the future. I hurried to finish Origins so that I wouldn't have to play it again. I was SUPREMELY disappointed and will only purchase another Arkham game if Rocksteady does it.			"

												First, the bad: The game has some minor bugs I ran into. Nothing game breaking though. The main bug I ran into was that the interrogate mechanic just stopped working on me three different times and I had to reload the last checkpoint to fix it. The game constantly tells you to ctrl+right click to knockout dudes that are on the ground but it almost never does anything when you press it. Also there's one side mission where you get trapped in a dream world and the camera angles are all wonky and it's extremely difficult to get through with the mouse and keyboard. Luckily I have a gamepad but not everyone does. Also there is an entire set of collectibles called ""Gotham intel"" listed in the menu that I somehow made it through the entire game through without even finding out what these are. Would have been nice if the game bothered to explain any of that stuff.The good: Batman is a badass. A rich jerk badass. It's fun zipping around the city, gliding into packs of criminals/cops/criminal cops and just beating the everloving snot out of them all with your ridiculous gadgets. There's lots of side quests to do, major villians to stop, minor villians to stop, crimes to solve, and dumb hidden trophies (""datapacks"" in this one) to collect. The multiplayer: Didn't play it, don't care. The single player is the reason to get this game.			"

So the city is great and is not in ruins like in Arkham City.controls, graphics and story are awesome. And now you have a training center at the batcave and you can play as Deathstrok on the training center.and you got to play agains new caracters like Deathstroke, Firefly and Bane.Also they added a Multiplayer layer. Haven't played a lot but it looks nice.			"

												This game seems to be more about the origin of a certain Batman villain more so then Batman himself. Right from the get go you already have most of the gadgets he had in the other Arkham games with a lot of the same fighting moves as well. So it's hard to call it a really good take on the origins of Batman in any sense besides what they say about him in the cutscenes. However that doesn't mean the game is dislikable. I enjoyed it quite a bit. In fact the game contained some of the best boss fights i've had in the series thus far.It was really cool going toe to toe with some of the deadliest assassins in the DC universe such as Slade (Deathstroke), Shiva, Firefly, Deadshot, and others. They were all different from eachother and always intense. Really I feel like I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the other Arkham games. I know the formula hasn't changed much, but it's still fun and has a decent story to go along with it. Even the voice actors who filled in for Conroy and Hamill did a really good job at portraying younger versions of their characters.I have heard a lot of gruff about glitches and currupt saves and the like from various people. However, my experience has been nothing but smooth. No weird game breaking glitches or currupt saves here. Maybe I was just lucky. But i've seen no evidence of such things during my time with this game.There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that I played for an hour or so and then never touched again. Er... I don't know. I felt like it didn't add much. I guess give it a try and see if you like it.If you buy this game it's because you're a fan of the Batman Arkham series and you want more. Or because you're a huge Batman fan. Either way it's worth it at a decent price.Final Verdict (4 out of 5)			"

												The first part of the game was pretty linear compared to Arkham city and it took a bit for the game to get interesting.  The Joker is really well done and there fun to be had.  The thing that killed it for me was a level with dead eye.  The level starts with guys heading toward you, but it immediately switches to a zoom mode and takes away control.  Then the keyboard bindings kept getting reset changing my stealth to zoom and my punch to throwing grenades.  I get that under control and then there's a hostage situation about 10-15 minutes in that just ends the mission.  This mission was so frustrating and poorly designed I wanted to smash things and quit the game right there.			"

												Batman: Arkham Origins is the 3rd installment in the Arkham series and is the prequel to the previous 2 games. It takes place in Old and New Gotham on the night of Christmas Eve, and wouldn't ya know, someone wants to kill Batman. He has been targeted for assassination by multiple assassins, including, but not limited to, Killer Croc, Bane, and Deathstroke. Some people would like to say that this game is the worst in the franchise, but is this correct? Well, it definitely has its moments. In fact, I believe it is much more influential and memorable than Arkham Asylum, the first in the series of these games.Now, do I recommend this game? Oh yes. This game was enough fun for me to return to it multiple times, and it has much more to do even after completing the game, like challenge maps where you can actually play as Deathstroke.The gameplay is pretty much the same as the last 2 games in this series. Nothing fancy here, just some new gadgets, which I will not spoil.Alfred has a much larger role in this game, acting as your go-to guy for info, and your... Well... Advice guy. The story took a big turn for me, and I wasn't expecting it to go where it did.This game truly did not deserve the bad reputations that it got, and in my opinion, is the second best in the series.

												In this game you play as muti-billionaire Tony Stark as he decides to live up to his dead parents legacy by beating up anyone on the streets of New Jersey, and maybe stopping some crime bosses along the way. And Heath Ledger makes an appearance as a gay cowboy as well.In this game you are given tons of gadgets to play with, all of which are incredibly contrived and don't actually make you feel like Bat Iron Man at all. You fight a multitude of bosses, all of which are really boring, especially when you fight Solid Snake Slade. That battle consists of pressing counter for an hour and nothing else, eventually Solid Snake Slade gives up and you have him arrested.When you are beating up random citizens of Gotham, the combat feels fine. Although the fighting style of Bat Iron Man is akin to a very nimble amature boxer and would get him beat up in the real world. GG Bat Iron Man, you dead.The game has some very interesting plot twists, you think you are fighting one big bad guy, then it throws you through a loop when you have to go beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Booker DeWitt, I mean, Heath Ledger the Gay Cowboy.All in All I think Bat Iron Man Tony Stark EA Origin is a game with a contrived plot that feels needlessly long and jumps around worse than this review. 0/10, since there were no female characters and I felt like the game was oppressing me.

												To Whom it may concern: i have never played any of the other batman arkham games.This was the first batman game i ever played and i timed it perfectly. This game is a prequel to the other two batman games although it was technically the third game that was made. I am going to break the game down based on gameplay, story, and batman's costume as well as the look of arkham. Gameplay:1. Easy to learn2. Combat is realistic3. Almost all tools that you gain as the game progresses are used at some time 4. (After doing some reasearch) The game play is relatively the same compared to the other games5.The boss fights are very fun, while also being chalenging Story:1. The story is logical and makes scence 2. The characters rolls are well portrayed3. This game explains(mostly) how the other games came to pass4. The story has unexpected twists and turnsCostume/Graphics:1. The batman costume is updated and more armored2. The Villans are also updated with newer looking costumes and voice actors3. Even the lower graphics setting look very good. My computer can only run medium to low graphics on most games but batman arkham origins looks good even on low settings In conclusion this game is a very good option to buy. It has aspects of the other games while it also updates the graphics and apearance of the characters are updated. This game is worth every penny and if you enjoyed the rest of the batman arkham series. Even if you have never played any of the other batman games this would be a very good option.9/10			"

												The game is awesome . Don't understand why it's all so dislike ? It has an interesting plot , charismatic villains , drama , good gameplay and much more ! The story-first in the story, you just need to find a Black Mask(who knows , it's the villain ) , but then things are much more interesting , but I will not write because it's spoilers . Bosses-they are elegant , every battle with them is interesting and varied , except with the Bane of the battle was a little overexposed , but still , the rest of the bosses at the height of the battle with them look uneven and cool . Drama-in the game it is present and I'm really worried about the main characters of the game.The suit look very cool , but I have no doubt , because it is Batman Arkham .Of the minuses can only say that the moments when you need to get to something , to find something very boring , but then you reach the goal and receive the sea of positive feelings ! As well as bugs - they are there enough . I recommend - 9/10P. S. You'll meet the Joker			"

												Totally recommended! I found this game to be an evolution of what was already great in the Arkham City game, bigger city, more abilities, nice boss fights and such an amazing story about the relationship of Batman and the Joker!Oww and the Stereoscopic 3D is sooo good, the physx effects, the cape and bats flying out of the screen is really nice.

												Although not as good as City, Origins is still a pretty good game in it's own right, and it's gameplay style will be very familiar to players of the previous two games. Origins definitely had a huge lot to live up to when it was brought out, as many people felt that City was unbeatable and that the Warner Bros studio would mess up. In my opinion, the gameplay and freedom was much better in this game, as it has a larger world to explore than City. The story, however, wasn't nearly what it should've been, and felt rushed and unfinished in places. As Origins is a prequel to the first games, it could easily be skipped without missing much, but to players who want an extra dose of Arkham before the new game releases next year, it's a worthwile purchase without a doubt.

												Disclaimer: I played all the arkham games starting from arkham knight down (backwards)I have to say that after playing all of the batman arkham games including the glide evrywhere arkham knight, this game is the best out of all the rest. There story is actally concrete abd interesting while in the other games it was like either you can guess what was gunna happen or it was generic. ther collectibles where in the rest of the games the developers exploted the hell out of and spammed them like no tomorrow kmaking them a burden to collect and really having no reason to be in the game other than cuz the ridldler placed them there, this one does it perfectly. Also the riddler isnt annoying as in Arkham knight. best use of the batcave and also get to see the batwing as your travel cutscenes.Only negative for me is that you cant glide like in Arkam knight. Lastly the map and lay out of the city is great andbetetr than arkham asylum by far.9.5/10 "

So, not the maximum score. 9/10------------------------------------------------------------------------------Отличный приевел, чуваки из ворнеров все правильно сделали.

												Arkham Origins is a bit controverse for the third game in a row to be such an downfall.In Arkham Assylum you are chasing threw an dark psychotrip and got kind of an straight storyline to follow threw the depths of hell. It plays well and works really god, no mayor bugs even if you think so at first, because you can see all these Riddler-Trophys which you can't get. Turns out that you get these Gadgets that help you getting them later. Clever.Arkham City is even darker when you get thrown into an whole City that was turned into an jail. You actually start as Catwoman and turn the good to bad and bad to good while kicking and punshing the f*****g ♥♥♥♥ out of the real big guys in an combat-system that rocks you socks off. The fight against Mr. Freeze is an nice example for an clever battle where you can not win by just hitting a button like an woodpicker.Than there was Arkham Origins... well..The Storyline is still great. You gotta give the credit that they had cool storylines in all the games and manged to stay as close as possible to the original comics as they could.The game plays before the other two games in timeline (did Star Wars start this? and why is everyone making an copycat out of it?)  and shows some old Supercrimes like Black Mask (when I think about it, they made the time-twist to bring the joker back)The fightsystem changed a bit again. It changed barely enough to make you vomit when there are more than 5 enemies at a time. While always able to stop in attacking enemy in AC - you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked in AO all of the time. It doesn't help that from time to time the input on keyboard and/ormouse seem to be partly ignored and instead of going to the left upper corner of the room, you slam into the wall on your left as hard as you can.This brings me to the worst Part of this game: BUGSI played this game over and over and over.. and if there would be any statistics about starts and/or crashes you could see how many times I only played for about five minutes. I got the game about first day it came out and really thought it might be getting better soon. Now I installed ""Cold Cold Heart"" and mine broke. I am actually writing this Review now, because the game just stopped... no clue why.When I got the game I had the problem with the riddler-tower where the window closes and you can't escape the room, because the way you are suposed to go is blocked by an bug. Thanks to the genius who found and glitch (and also made it public - thanks again) me and many others glitched our way through that and other minor problems.A good thing is that they changed the detective-mode so that you are no longer in an godmode kind of version. Now it is sometimes better to turn the Mode of to see more (for example, sometimes you can not see enemys in an slightly wider range around you and they magicaly apear when you turn detective-mode of) That is good, but why the hack does Batman not see his own Batsignal which you use to mark points on the map? Looking up into the air: batsignal... detective-mode on to avoid bad guys with big guns: Where am i going? the green ""!"" on your navigation helps a lot...  but only until you realise that you just passed your marked spot for the second time.It is sad that they changed the combat and that the bugs drive you insanse. I would have loved to give it an good ranking for the great story and the cool new invention where you can go through the crime by timeshifting and see how things happened in special places, but that doesn't help when the game crushes.6/10(get Arkham City instead if you didn't before)			"

As a big fan of the previous two Arkham releases this was pretty disappointing gameplay-wise.tl;drThere were many bugs such as combos cancelling even after hitting counter (especially on the new martial artists enemy) and some fights not starting until you reload the checkpoint.Including the technical stuff I've got my own personal gripes about this game;For one, the sounds you hear when you beat on baddies don't feel as awesome. They may sound more ""realistic"" (I think that's what they were going for) I guess but they just don't have that cool feeling of hitting someone and knowing when you've knocked 'em out cold.A number of the gadgets are basically just rip-offs of the gadgets from the previous games (glue grenade hah).Despite a bigger map and more enemies standing everywhere Gotham feels shallow.Some areas pull jerk moves by making you only go a certain, specific path to a destination when it seems like you could get there a more obvious way. (tl;dr rant)  Here's an example: a place you had to go inside of was protected. The front door was heavily armed and the game kept suggesting me to find an alternate route. However I decided ""well we'll just see about that"" and kicked every one of their arses to the ground. So I remove the guards from the front door ONLY TO FIND THAT I CAN'T GO THROUGH IT. It wasn't locked either, or better yet it didn't really SAY anything about the door at least when I went to detective mode anyway. In detective mode I saw that the door wasn't even highlighted thus highly suggesting that I was never even supposed to go in the front door in the first place. And when I walk up to it Batman just starts repeating ""I need to find another way in"" or something like that everytime I go up to it. So, I take out every guard protecting the door to my objective only to realize that I wasn't even supposed to be here because the script says ""no you were supposed to go to the alternate route."" That heavy scripting in this sandbox-y game ticked me off the most good golly god. /rant The plot was at least interesting, however I feel that the assassins didn't have enough screentime (especially Slade). Most of the bossfights were at least pretty cool and fun to play too as they felt more like I was actually being challenged (mostly).All-in-all, unrecommended, because I'm too much jerky for what I expect. It's at least very playable until the end for the story though for the actual gameplay, I gave it a chance, despite hearing its negative words said about it, and overall unfortunately I was pretty bummed. Technical problems, fan-ranting, etc.I didn't really try the multiplayer since I didn't care much for that.			"

												More of the same...but that's not necessarily a bad thing.If you're looking for new gameplay, new tactics and a new experience, this isn't the game for you. Arkham Origins (AO) plays very much like Arkham City (AC) and Arkham Asylum (AA).  There are a few new gadgets, different villians and a fast-travel system, but the combat is very much like the other games.One new interesting feature is the ability to re-construct a crime-scene. It's not ground-breaking, but it does add some fresh air to the gameplay. As with the other games, you are tasked with stopping the bad guys while taking names and cracking heads. Along the way, you'll also run into numerous collecibles scattered around the snowy city.  Getting around is a bit easier as the city is now divided in several districts, each with a Batwing Drop point.  If you enjoyed AA and AC, you will enjoy this. But as it's more of the same, hold out for a sale.  As of December 19th 2013, the lowest price I've seen for this is about $23.			"

												This game is amazing for those who like Batman games. It has a great story, one which is different from the other 3 Batman games but similar to each other in combat and voice actors. It has a story where Batman doesn't even know the Joker up until the near end. Some parts of it can be difficult, but it took me 6.6 hours to finish the whole game. I enjoyed every minute of this game and I will surely start a new game or even play the online mode. Once, I got stuck in my room because the lock got broken(not stating why :P) and I was stuck in my room for an hour. I didn't even care since I was playing this game the whole time. The only part of the game that was really scary was the last boss fight against Bane when he was Hulk 2.0. That part itself was so scary and the music was just making it worse. Everytime Bane saw me and ran towards me with his huge body, I literally couldn't think of doing anything. Took me 20-30 mins to man up and beat him thought. The other boss fights weren't as scary or difficult, but I hated the parts that were like: defuse 4 bombs, rescue hostages, defeat Firefly. Those parts were just annoying, but not bad.10/10 Would totally get stuck in a room again to play this game.			"

												For reference, this review is primarily concerning the DLC, Cold Cold Heart (as well as some of the Season Pass content).  My review for the original game is at http://gamersglance.com/2013/11/11/batman-arkham-origins-review/.  In my review for Arkham Origins, I noted a number of game-breaking bugs.  I am sorry to say that WB Montreal patched only a few of these, and actually made the Burnley Tower issue worse by making some of the buildings surrounding it physically intangible (as in, you literally fly straight through them).  They coupled their poor attitude towards releasing a very broken game with an announcement some months later that they would no longer be patching the main game and were focused on DLC.  I remember thinking, ""So your plan is to build DLC on top of a broken game?  What could POSSIBLY go wrong?""Oy vey.As you might have guessed from the DLC title, the storyline DLC Cold Cold Heart (which is a lame lame title) is the origin story of Mister Freeze.  Minor spoilers ahead, but here's the short list of what I liked.-Getting to navigate Wayne Manor is cool and those levels aren't poorly designed.  Plus Alfred regualrly smarms the goons who are holding him hostage.-Thermal batarangs look pretty kickass and are actually used in a neat way.Yep, that list was short.  Here's the bad stuff.-The story is completely predicatable for anyone who is even remotely familiar with Mr. Freeze, even if your only familiarity comes from his appearance in Arkham City.-The main story arc takes place in an artifically limited version of Gotham (two disctricts) and features new buildings and girders which happen to be installed over outdoor stealth sections.  For reference, this story also takes place EXACTLY one week after Arkham Origins... so in the week between Christmas and New Year's, which as we all know is the high point of activitiy for construction crews, Gotham City construction workers managed to put up (or at best, relabel) a new skyscraper for GothCorp, AND install girders that support no structural purpose over bad guy hangouts.  This is what happens when the DLC is concepted and sketched out AFTER Gotham City is designed and modeled.-The first two guards you encounter (the ones with the codes) use the same model and skin.  This is especially sloppy considering there are other, uninteractable guards with different models later in the level.-Whoever made the decision to zoom in during the initial dialogue sequence between Alfred and Bruce should be fired.  Both Alfred and Bruce's lips appear to come a good inch away from their faces while speaking, something which is not noticible in later dialogue sequences because they are further zoomed out.  It genuinely looks like a goofy Garry's Mod face.-The DLC is noticibly padded in multiple places - first, with Anarky's ""riots"" (yes this is the same Anarky you appreheneded a week before in the main game).  By ""riots,"" I mean five or six Anarky guys standing around chatting.  Then breaking up the parts of the Cryo Drill, which are very large but apparently fit well within his utility belt pouches, because why not?  There are another couple of instances, but I'm too bored to point them out.Oh word, remember the part at the beginning of the review where I mentioned bugs?-Don't land too near any frozen guard, or you will be caught in an infinite loop of hovering and attempting to land.-Don't attempt to leave the game before completing a mission objective (especially clearing a room) unless you like having to start the DLC over from scratch - this causes the DLC to clear the room of baddies, and if you were required to interrogate any of them in order to progress, well eff you.-Grappeling is just as buggy and weird as in the main game - you're going to say to yourself ""Why can't I grappel there?"" A LOT.  I particularly liked it when I grappel to a point just below an armed guard to perform a ledge takedown, only to have Batman hop the ledge and stand in front of the bad guy.  Nice stealth, bro.-Especially on stairs, performing a stealth or ground takedown is buggy, will cause the body to glitch partially through the stairs, and occassionally bounce up wildly into the ceiling.-You will still randomly drop combos, especially when most of the enemies are down but not unconscious.  I know someone will say this so let me go ahead and ask the question - ""But y don't u use ground takdown!!1!""  Uh, because the animation is so long that by the time you are finished performing it, anyone else who was on the ground is up and already hitting you or about to.-Using alternate suits in the main game can and will crash the game under random conditions.  This was particularly a problem with the Brightest Day suit.The worst part of this, though, (read the latest patch note comments for reference) is that people are actively swearing off Batman video games because of how broken this game is.  A lot of them don't realize that this is the only Arkham game WB Montreal ever made, and the two previous (and upcoming Arkham Knight) were made by Rocksteady.  I mean, if I were Rocksteady, I would actually draft a press release concerning their disappointment with Arkham Origins, and clarifying that they didn't make it.  If Arkham Kinght underperforms because of this glitchy mess, that would be a real shame.At the end of the day, I got the Season Pass on sale at Amazon for $8.  And I still feel like I got ripped off.  Don't buy either the DLC or the main game unless you don't have enough frustration in your life.  I wouldn't even recommend this to diehard Batman fans.			"

												I just responded to a friend's positive recommendation of this game with the following and realized that I never ""unrecommended"" it officially, so here's my lazy copy and paste:Personally, it was by far the weakest of the three games and was definitively generic as opposed to the stellar work of Rocksteady's creations. It was despicably mediocre and clunky and lazy in design. As much as I like Troy Baker and it may have been the voice direction and not his fault, but Joker was not the Joker. He wasn't scary or funny or remarkable in any way. He was a deranged bad guy like any of the others: boring.Pros:- Batman's replacement voice actor- license and established Rocksteady IP- letting us see how Joker sees things- the new detective casesOther than that, it was a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor Arkham City reboot. I have replayed the first 2 games at least 3 times each and will probably go back for more in the future. I hurried to finish Origins so that I wouldn't have to play it again. I was SUPREMELY disappointed and will only purchase another Arkham game if Rocksteady does it.			"

												First, the bad: The game has some minor bugs I ran into. Nothing game breaking though. The main bug I ran into was that the interrogate mechanic just stopped working on me three different times and I had to reload the last checkpoint to fix it. The game constantly tells you to ctrl+right click to knockout dudes that are on the ground but it almost never does anything when you press it. Also there's one side mission where you get trapped in a dream world and the camera angles are all wonky and it's extremely difficult to get through with the mouse and keyboard. Luckily I have a gamepad but not everyone does. Also there is an entire set of collectibles called ""Gotham intel"" listed in the menu that I somehow made it through the entire game through without even finding out what these are. Would have been nice if the game bothered to explain any of that stuff.The good: Batman is a badass. A rich jerk badass. It's fun zipping around the city, gliding into packs of criminals/cops/criminal cops and just beating the everloving snot out of them all with your ridiculous gadgets. There's lots of side quests to do, major villians to stop, minor villians to stop, crimes to solve, and dumb hidden trophies (""datapacks"" in this one) to collect. The multiplayer: Didn't play it, don't care. The single player is the reason to get this game.			"

												The first part of the game was pretty linear compared to Arkham city and it took a bit for the game to get interesting.  The Joker is really well done and there fun to be had.  The thing that killed it for me was a level with dead eye.  The level starts with guys heading toward you, but it immediately switches to a zoom mode and takes away control.  Then the keyboard bindings kept getting reset changing my stealth to zoom and my punch to throwing grenades.  I get that under control and then there's a hostage situation about 10-15 minutes in that just ends the mission.  This mission was so frustrating and poorly designed I wanted to smash things and quit the game right there.			"

												I mean there's nothing.... wrong with it per se. But it is just one disapointment after another. Nothing works quite as well as it should, as it did in previous games, the open world feels like a place where they keep single track events. I don't know if it /is/ more linear than previous games but it certainly feels it. That's it over all, I adored the previous games and was super set to give this a chance but it just feels simpler, less interesting and I know this sounds dumb with the much larger open world but the game feels smaller.

Batman: Arkham Origins: 9/10 - RECOMMENDED (post patch)UPDATE: After second playthrough I raise to 9/10... definetly a great story and a great game... The relationship with Joker is masterfully explored and this is a worthy addition in this flawed but awesome franchise!Batman: Arkham Origins Impressions:I was not hyped for this game. I believed Arkham City was an outstanding game, but still overhyped. This game is basically the same game that Arkham City was with a diffrent story line. Are there some tweeks? Yes, for sure, but in the end, the bad press Origins recieves is not earned, the diffrent voice cast does not dissappoint either.The game is not only NOT as bad as they say... it is a very good game, that ought to be played by everyone who loved the previous games, and/or likes Batman.I deffinetly recommend this.(Knowing what Initiation DLC would be before buying it - simple maps forced into a non-existing story line - it did not dissappoint either)Batman Arkham Origins - Cold, Cold Heart: 9/10 - Strongly Recommended for fans of Arkham OriginsCold, Cold Heart Impressions:Arkham games have earned their bad rep with DLC, so it is always refreshing to see such an impressive post game add on with pre-rendered cut scenes, in-engine cut-scenes, new locations, new enemy types and two suits (one for Bruce and one for Bats) and a change of light for the open city sections of South Gotham. I think there should be industry standards, what is called DLC, what is an Expansion and in this case a mini-Expansion.Clocking in at barely 3 hours, it does not deserve to be called ""Expansion"", but it includes more, than all other Season Pass content together for this game! So it also does not deserve to be called merely a DLC...On the downside, the pre-rendered cut scenes seem not to be full HD, and the Anarky tags are a pain... but otherwise this is all that makes the Arkham Games so beloved compressed into very entertaining 3 hours...

												I'll start off by saying, This game gets -far- too much flak. Is it as good as City or Asylum? No. Is it a step down for the series? Yes. Is it a step back? No. It's not, but it's not a step forward either. The game is essentially Arkham City all over again, the same combat mechanics, and a few gadgets that can make things insanely simple. Notably, the Remote Claw, which allows you to hang thugs up from the rafters, at range. Did it have a horribly glitchy release? Definitely. And there's no excuse for that, patches or not. The bugs should've been ironed out. I myself, was lucky enough to not encounter any on my first playthrough. The mechanics are much the same as City, though it's a common complaint that thugs can hit you, even if you're countering someone else. As I would politely put it, ""Well... yeah?"" It's not a new thing. It happens in City. You try countering someone, and expecting it to stop the path of a giant hammer in City, see what happens. Takedowns are a different story in both games, but it leads me to my greatest issue with Origins. The Dark Knight System. As you play the game, you will be continually graded on your performace, complete with marks, and awarded EXP accordingly. However, the Dark Knight System seems to reward grandstanding more than efficentcy. The Combat -is- somewhat harder, enemies are faster, and will corner you, and attempt to dogpile you with a flurry of hits, if you don't think tactically. Origins is the first Arkham Game where i've actively started using Gadgets in combat, from a few quick batarangs to a glue grenade or my standard Batclaw. The new Batman voice seems.. fitting, though it's jarring to not have Conroy at the helm. This younger Batman is meant to be more aggressive, and he definitely sounds it. On the other end of the spectrum, Joker is -close- to hamill's voice, but it's different enough to seem -very- off. Joker always seems like he's rehearsed his lines, and while it's true for the voice actor, it's something Hamill never dealt with. Joker's voice and actions, always seemed to be completely in tune.The boss battles are an improvement over City, a couple of them can be nightmarishly hard on Hard New Game +, for example, Copperhead. A common complaint is that the boss Deathstroke is too difficult. After careful examination of the fight, i've managed to deduce why people claim this. They're too busy looking for a Win button. Deathstroke is -insanely- simple, on any and every difficulty. I got the achievement for beating him without a scratch on Hard New Game +, and i'd of gotten it on hard, if I hadn't been having a conversation while I played.The game is harder, slightly. The story however... for me, is a disappointment. It felt as though they were -afraid- to change anything up, and after a particular point in the game, to do with a bank, I was left annoyed at the story. The Deathstroke DLC is quite fun, Deathstroke himself handles well, and hits hard. It's fun to play, and makes me wish for a Deathstroke game.This game isn't City, or Asylum. It's the worst of the franchise. But when a franchise is -this- good overall, even the least of it, is pretty damn good. If you beat City, and wished it was longer, or just wanted another story with the same general mechanics, this is for you. It's not big on innovation, but not all games need to be. We'll get that from Rocksteady. If you're not a fan, i'd either go back to Asylum and City, or wait for Rocksteady to release their next.  "

												I do recommend this game but I think overall it's pretty meh. I did have fun playing it but it's more of the same compared to the last game. I think I mostly like it because of the combat but I did feel it was more frustrating than last time. The moves were not as telegraphed and it was definitely harder to counter this time around. I would say that the gadgets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because they were the same as the previous game even though this was supposed to be a prequel. It doesn't make any sense that he was creating the gadgets in the last game when he could have just summoned them. The inconsistency can agitate you, it would have been nice to have more original gadgets.For me I got into it because the story was good and I liked the idea of playing a prequel. The combat was enough for me to keep playing the game. I figure pick this up when it's on sale and you'll have an OK time. I didn't play any of the online modes so I cannot speak about that. I also didn't experience any bugs that ruined my experience.			"

												Do not misunderstand me: compared to most games today, Arkham Origins is a GREAT game, so by all means, buy it!

That is what truly killed it for me, because there are so many things that is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to Arkahm Asylum and City. The one thing that was the most annoying, was the revamped character models and (partly) background story.

Combat system is much more refined, with new moves, better mechanics, with every punch feeling more satisfying than before. The main storyline is fantastic and shows us the beginning of Batman's career and how he deals with meeting many of his enemies for the first time. Overall, Batman: Arkham Origins was full of glitches and bugs and simply was not polished like the previous Arkham games.As a huge Arkham fan I can honestly tell you that now all of those bugs and glitches are fixed and that you should get this game.8/10			"

												Очень переживал за данный проект, так как за разработку взялась другая команда и как выяснилось зря! Разработчикам все таки удалось грамотно использовать базу, созданную когда-то Rocksteady и при этом добавить что-то свое! Да, в игре практически ничего изменилось со времен Arkham City, что в приницпе было ожидаемо, т.к. игра является приквелом к серии, но это не делает игру хуже предыдущих! Сюжет как всегда на высоте! Очень рад был увидеть отсылку на свой любимый комикс ""Killing Joke"", а также развитие сюжета, сделанное по мотивам события вселенной Бэтмена ""Knightfall"" (одно из самых важных). Очень понравился Альфред, а также был в восторге от режима детектива! Вердикт: однозначный ""Must have!"" И все критики, которые ставят игре 7.5 и просто хотели новых фишек от ПРИКВЕЛА - глупцы! Пусть засунут свое мнение куда подальше! Да... она не побила рекорд Arkham Asylum, но оценку отлично она отработала полностью! (9,5/10)			"

												I was totally disapointed in the game as it feels nothing like the first two in the Arkham series but this has sometime to do with the fact that Rocksteady isn't behind it and for this reason its lacking in almost every area. When you first step into the shoes of Batman there are way to many toys to play with and they soon become a boring as you don't earn them through boss battles only upgrades to the toys you already have. the only saving grace in the whole game in the batcave but even this gets dull quickly as there are clues to Batmans past and future hidden away on almost every surface.The game play is the same as Arkham and City almost like they cut and pasted it with no improvements made, The boss fights go from stuiply hard (Bane you have to fight twice on the fight top) to no effort to obtain the electro gloves which only serve to take out armoured goons.So please dont buy this and wait for Arkham Knights			"

SummaryIt's easily the weakest of the Arkham series, but it's still a decent game in its own right.ReviewDeveloper Warner Bros Games Montréal must have been both excited and trepidatious about playing in Rocksteady's Arkham sandbox.  How do you follow in the footsteps of two of the greatest games (Arkham Asylum and Arkham City) released in the past decade?  Well, predictably, they played it safe and low-key.  This is a by-the-numbers Arkham game that feels surprisingly unrefined despite the fact that it's the third game in the series.Warner Bros Games Montréal got the basics right, at least.  The combat is as engaging and addictive as ever, but the developers did change things up slightly.  Unlike the previous two games, you can only counter enemies who display the ""I'm gonna hit you!"" lightning bolt indicators above their heads with Batman's counter move (default is Y on the Xbox 360 controller) whereas Asylum and City let you use your basic attack to disrupt a thug who was getting ready to punch; furthermore, you can't cancel an attack in progress to perform a counter move.  There are also moments when Batman can be hit during uninterruptable animations -- such as a special takedown -- where in previous games, the attackers would politely wait until Batman had finished before continuing their assault.  The upshot of these changes is that you have to be more aware during combat and know when it's safe to use certain attacks.  This is what people are complaining about when they say that Warner Bros Games Montréal ""messed"" with the combat timing, because the fisticuffs feel slightly more stilted and less free-form than the earlier games.  Some people actually enjoy the increased challenge this brings to the table, and while the combat is still fun at a core level, I can see why some folks are disappointed.  This is one of those “individual mileage will vary” sort of things.  Predator challenges, on the other hand, are identical to the previous games, so there's really not much to say about them (that's a good thing).Moving Batman around his environment is still basically entertaining as you glide and grapple and swoop your way across Gotham City -- although I can't figure out why Warner Bros Games Montréal changed how the grapple launcher works.  In Arkham City, it would propel Batman above buildings making it easy to get around; in Origins, it gives Batman a little extra momentum but doesn't launch him into the air, so you spend most of your time flying between buildings instead of over them.  It's one of those little things that changes the overall feel of the game for the worse.And there is a lot of ground to cover in this game, so you'll be gliding and grappling and swooping a lot, which brings up one of the game's weaknesses.  This is a massive game world, but there's so little to see and do that the size feels like a waste.  Criminals, and only criminals (where are all of Gotham's law-abiding citizens?), cluster in small, infrequent groups.  There are Enigma packets (this game's Riddler trophies) scattered here and there but certainly not with the same density as Arkham City, and there are no Riddler puzzles to solve, where you have to decipher the Riddler's clues and scan the appropriate pieces of scenery.  As the game progresses, you do get a variety of objectives which essentially boil down to finding something and destroying it (Batman apparently doesn't have a lot of finesse), but there's little reason not to make a beeline from one objective to the next since there are so few distractions along the way. Basically, it's just a big, empty game world that's darker and more drab than Rocksteady's games.  Let me summarize it this way: the game world is twice the size of Arkham City, but it feels like there's only half as much content.The one new innovation in Arkham Origins is the crime scene feature which has Batman donning his detective cap and analyzing a scene to find clues and piece the evidence together.  This probably sounds familiar, but unlike previous games, it's a less passive affair and requires the player to scroll backwards and forwards through a holographic reconstruction of the crime in order to find evidence, such as where a briefcase might have landed when a victim was thrown off a roof.  The reconstruction is created in the 3D space inhabited by Batman, so the player can walk around and view it from different angles, which is pretty cool.  It works well, and it's actually a lot of fun.  It would have been great if Warner Bros Games Montréal could have done more interesting things like this in order to make their game stand out from the crowd.  Warner Bros Games Montréal's other big addition to the franchise are the numerous centerpiece boss battles, and it does seem they put more care and attention into them than Rocksteady, but the end result is, unfortunately, more tedious than exciting with each encounter wearing out its welcome long before the villain is subdued.  I really didn't mind the boss battles in the earlier Arkham games because even though they were simpler in comparison, they were over quickly and didn't drag down the overall pace of the game.The voice acting is strong despite the absence of veterans Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hamill (Joker).  Roger Craig Smith does such an outstanding job imitating Conroy that most people probably won't even know the difference, and Troy Baker's Joker, while not a spot-on Hamill impersonation, is still pretty darn good -- I suppose the internal logic here is that it's a younger Joker, so he's not as grizzled and weathered as the older version played by Hamill.  The rest of the cast turns in topnotch performances as well, so no complaints there.The story, well, what can I say, it's a video game story (as I always say, if I want a good story then I'll read a book).  It's a lot more focused than Arkham City but not necessarily more engaging or interesting.  It features a younger Batman only two-years into his nocturnal career, distrusted by police but on a first-name basis with every major criminal in Gotham.  I forgot about the chronology and was surprised early on when the caped crusader was attacked by police officers who still consider him an outlaw.  In the end, the story serves its purpose and gives some context and motivation for Batman's actions in the game world, and that's all I really expect from a video game story.  (The most hilarious moment for me was when Batman had to ""sneak"" into Gotham Police HQ, telling Alfred, ""I have to get in and get out without being seen.""  He then proceeds to beat the crap out of every police officer in the building.  Like I said, Batman doesn't have a lot of finesse.)So is the game worth playing?  I'm giving it a thumbs up only because Steam doesn't allow a neutral rating.  It's fun for the same reasons that Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are fun, but it has so little content and adds so little to the Arkham formula (apart from the crime scene analysis) that you really won't miss out on much if you skip Origins and jump straight to Arkham Knight.  If you're contemplating this as your first foray into the Arkham universe then I strongly recommend you start with Asylum since it's a much better game. If you're a completionist or just can't get enough of Batman then buy this when it's on sale.  It's not a bad game, all things considered, it's just an average one in a series of exceptional games.
