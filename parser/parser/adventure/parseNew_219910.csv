												Ok after finishing the game, I'm ready to give it the thumbs up.  There are some things that potential players of the game should be aware of before purchasing however, as they may dramatically effect enjoyment of the game:1. The art style of the game, it really worked in some respects (Such as the Harveys/demons) but in other respects it was kind of lacking, such as the mouth animations of the characters.2. Some of the puzzles in the game require a large amount of discrete math, so I hope you took a class in it in your undergraduate.  Break out the truth tables! You can skip all of these puzzles though.  I recommend trying your hand at them though if you have a familiarity with these sort of logic puzzles.3.  Acheivements straight up arn't working as of 11/28/13.  If you're an acheivement ♥♥♥♥♥ like myself, this will disappoint you, and reduce your game completion % if you're keeping track of that.4.  Not so much a problem, but a warning.  Art style notwithstanding, this ain't a kid's game.  Were this game a movie, I'd rate it R.  I wouldn't even recommend playing this in the same house as a kid.That said, even with those caviats, the game is worth playing because:1.  The dark humor of the game is done well.2.  Solid endings3.  Most of the use thing on thing puzzles are fairly straightforward.Anyway all told, I enjoyed it, you might too.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Dark; Charming My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-12 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers REVIEWEdna & Harvey: Harvey’s New Eyes is a casual point-and-click adventure/puzzler by Deadalic Entertainment. It’s light in style, yet dark in humor.  It is silly, funny, doesn't frustrate, and has some fun and challenging puzzles.  It is the kind of game that true fans of the genre will adore, casual fans of the genre should enjoy, and indifferent fans of the genre may welcome.I find myself saying the following about many of Deadalic’s adventure games: what really gives the game a quality above the par is the atmosphere of the game.  The music, the art style, the characters, the dialogue, the humor, the game mechanics... it all blends together into a charming, unique, and very enjoyable experience.The game plays with classic point-and-click mechanics.  It is a strongly story-driven experience with a lot of dialogue.  There are inventory based puzzles, dialogue based puzzles, and minigame style puzzles that must be solved to progress the game.  Some of the puzzles are pretty challenging because the solutions don't really make sense logically— but they make sense within the confines of the twisted reality of the game.  While a feature like that can be frustrating at times for adventure gamers, I think it fits in perfectly with this game.As I alluded to, there's a real lot of dark humor in this game and it fits the atmosphere perfectly. It isn't a kid's adventure game.  Even as someone who truly enjoys adventure games, I sometimes find myself bored with their trivial, childish storylines; with Edna & Harvey: Harvey’s New Eyes though, I truly enjoyed the hilarious story from beginning to end.Simply put: what makes this game great is the way it perfectly blends classic, nostalgia-inducing, childish adventure gameplay with adult themes and dry, dark humor.  If you are an adult that enjoys adventure games, and are craving a good experience, then you should check this game out.  And if you have been on the fence about trying an adventure game, this is a pretty good one to play to get a taste of what the genre can offer.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Very twisted, funny and original. 10/10 would decimate catholic school population again.I disagree with some reviews in one key point: this game is DEFINITELY NOT FOR CHILDREN. At first the violent scenes are somewhat ""censored"" (you'll see what I mean) but gore is still strongly suggested and even censored some scenes can be deeply disturbing, even if presented in a humorous way. Later on the violence gets more graphic. So IMHO, ---definitely--- not intended for kids.Although the story and script are great and the game's biggest strength, I feel like the ending(s) were a little rushed. They should have extended them more, explain some stuff and make each of them longer and more unique. It was kind of disappointing, but I still recommend it since it's only the last 5 minutes of the game that I didn't love.It actually lasted me around 8 - 10 hours of real game time.			"

												Wonderful but flawed.The actual game itself, I can't fault. For a graphic adventure it has a good story, humour...creepiness... It uses the mechanics offered by the storyline well. Really it's so fun I don't want to say more for fear of adding in too many spoilers. I would love to recommend it without reserve.But...It suffers from some technical issues, inventory items that float in mid air while the inventory is closed, screen juddering and of course a couple of times where the game actually lapses into German (I was playing in English), and weirdly I would have forgiven all of that except that somewhere along the line (apparently in a patch a couple of months back) they broke all the achievements.It's still well worth the price they are asking - none of the in game glitches are game breaking or anything more than an occasional annoyance, but if you're expecting a completely smooth experience with a bunch of achievements to collect you will be disappointed.Edit: I went back to this after it had been updated a couple of times and reportedly fixed the achievements and some of them worked... but not all. Checked in on the forums and found I'm far from the only person still having issues with the achievements. Oh well...			"

												Beautiful game I would say. Just get it, it's worth the time and money.Bought this game during the summer sale without knowing it's the sequel. Decided to buy The Breakout after playing.Harvey's New Eyes is deep, dark and twisted. My kind of game :)It's witty and with a wink and nod to the limitations of a point and click kind of adventure game genre, it gives gamers an an adult experience while providing necessary coverage to give a teen rating. Awesome plot really.The game has a pretty good sense of dark humour and sarcasm, cool mix of puzzles, logic and dialogues. Conversations are funny and Lily is just so cute with just her ""mmhmm"" and her nods. There were achievement problems though, but simply turn off the cloud sync in settings and it'd work. Cheers!~			"

												This game is lots of fun. It starts slow and turns out to be great fun. Early on you already know something is not quite right and as the game progresses you see how twisted it is. Great fun. My first contact with a Deadalic Game and a very good one.			"

												I'm not fan of point & click, but this game got me for real. Voice acting and hand-drawn graphics are top quality. Missions (chapters) are enjoyable and very long. You would be surprised what it takes to feed the cat in this game. And it's just an ordinary cat. Another thing that got me on the first is soundtrack. That opening song is amazing and in-game background music is enjoyable too. I won this game on a giveaway and I probably would never buy it (before). But now, I can say it's worth the money because it's so much fun. Definitely recommend.			"

												An interesting and very well done point-and-click game.  Apparently, it's a sequel to ""Edna & Harvey: The Breakout.""  But, it's independent enough to be played stand-alone.  Because of the age of the main character and some implications from the narrator right at the start, you might be tempted to consider this to be a child's game.  It's not.  It's an adult's game hiding slightly behind a childlike irony.  I bought it on sale for about $4 and that's a no-brainer of a purchase.  Absolutely worth that. I'd say it would still be well worth it at around $10.  It's current list price of about $20 might be a bit high, though.I do have some issue with the game, too.  First, it's slow to play.  But, that's endemic to these point-and-clicks since you've got to watch the character walk around, interact with the world, and converse.  Mitigating that is the saving grace that a lot of that kind of thing can be ESCaped out of or clicked through.  Second, some of the puzzles are not exactly obvious in what they want you to do.  This is especially true with the mini-games embedded in it.  Heck, the ""solutions"" from two of those mini-games were still obtuse enough to be of no use to me in the game proper.  And, finally, a lot of the achievements are royal pains.  They're not achievements that enhance gameplay.  Instead, they're of the form of ""do some pointless activity enough times for me to say ""you win.""  But, all-in-all, it's a very good game.			"

												English version (polska wersja niżej)I bought Edna and Harvey’s New Eyes by mistake. It was bundled with another Daedalic game that I wanted, but I decided to give it a try and 1 hour into gameplay I concluded that if this game manages to keep similar brilliant mood and humor to the final credits, I will madly fall in love with it. In the end it didn’t, but still it is my favorite game from this studio so far. Now, that you know my opinion on the subject, let me tell you that you really should not read this mini-review since perhaps this game is best approached like a typical Daedalic point and click ……still reading this? ……you’ve been warned……because  it is not the studio’s most typical game.  Sure it retains all the mechanisms this genre is known for, still it seems to be bad at what most Daedalic games are good (2d art) and brilliant at everything else . The game’s story, narration and voice acting are among the strongest I’ve seen in a point and click during the last few years.  I won’t describe the plot here (not to tell too much, and you’ve got it covered on the game’s Store Page). Instead let me focus on the narration. While Lilly ( the protagonist) does not say a single word throughout the entire game (or does she … ?) the narrator does an OUTSTANDING job constantly commenting on her actions and motives, brilliantly combining the innocence of child’s perspective with the games quite sadistic sense of humor. Regrettably, the game’s 2nd and 3rd chapters feel slightly weaker than the beginning and conclusion.  As far as I know the game has three endings (two of them good, while the third one … truly awesome). A very strong 8 out of 10.   PL Ednę i Harvey’a kupiłem przez przypadek. Był w paczce z inną grą z Daedalic w którą chciałem zagrać, zdecydowałem się jednak dać jej szansę i po pierwszej godzinie miałem wrażenie że jeżeli gra utrzyma atmosferę i humor do napisów końcowych, zakocham się w niej bez pamięci. Nie udało się, ale mimo to stała się moją ulubioną pozycją ze studia Daedalic (a ukończyłem już kilka…). A teraz, skoro już znasz moją opinię najlepiej zrobisz nie czytając dalej tej mini-recki bo w Harvey’s New Eyes gra się  najlepiej kiedy spodziewasz się typowo Daedalicowej przygodówki …..dalej to czytasz?.....ostrzegałem…… bo Edna and Harvey nie jest do końca typowym dla tego studia point and clickiem. Zachowuje wszystkie mechanizmy właściwe tego typu grom, ale grafika odstaje od tego do czego przyzwyczaili graczy ludzie z Daedalic’a. Za to voice acting (zazwyczaj tragiczny w grach tych twórców) jest jednym z najlepszych jakie słyszałem od lat, muzyka idealnie pasuje do klimatu gry (rewelacyjny temat z napisów końcowych!) zagadki są ciekawe, pomysłowe … i bywają trudne (niektóre zwyczajnie przekombinowane, inne po prostu rewelacyjne). Fabuły nie będę zdradzał (a co, jest opisana na stronie gry) powiem tylko że razem z narracją stanowią największą zaletę tej gry. Lilly (postać sterowana przez gracza) nie wypowiada nawet słowa  (chociaż … nie, nic nie powiem! ), za to narrator ciągle komentuje jej poczynania i intencje. I trzeba powiedzieć że robi to w sposób naprawdę GENIALNY. Narracja zgrabnie łączy niewinność perspektywy z jakiej patrzy dziecko z (BARDZO) morderczym humorem jakim ocieka gra. Szkoda że rodział drugi i trzeci są odrobinę słabsze od pierwszego i rewelacyjnego finału gry (z tego co udało mi się odkryć są trzy zakończenia: dwa solidne i jedno … doskonałe). Podsumowując: bardzo solidne 8/10.			"

												It was inevitable that I'd play (and 100%) this game. I loved Deponia and The Breakout (the prequel to this) was pretty good too. However, this disappointed me. A lot.In this game is the distinct Daedalic charm; when you laugh at a joke in the tutorial, it bodes well. But the charm didn't carry as far as it did in Deponia or even The Breakout. Maybe it's because Lilli isn't as interesting as Rufus and Edna are, maybe it's because she never says a word, maybe it's because the tone takes a hairpin turn at Dark Street. I'll explain.Deponia and The Breakout (to be exact it's Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, but I'll just shorten that) have amazing protagonists. Rufus is consistently funny and engaging and is genuinely relatable, while Edna is just loony enough to keep attention. Lilli, on the other hand, never says a word.Yeah, she emotes a bit with her grunts and gestures, but silent protagonists are fundamentally character-less. Her thoughts are narrated throughout by an amazingly voice-acted male voice, but as she never communicates anything to other characters, they come up with flimsier and flimsier ways to say 'I know what you're gonna say'. It was clever at first, but it wore thin.This brings me onto another big flaw over Breakout... The voice acting is overall pretty bad. Breakout had one of the best performances I've ever heard for Edna, but even she comes across poorly in this sequel. All the other voices sound silly, faked or are generally hard to listen to. That's pretty damning for a dialogue-heavy adventure game.Then there's the tone. Jesus. I read that this game comes across as child-friendly. This is barely adult-friendly. Just some of the events that take place which get passed off as background gags are horrific at BEST. I barely laughed throughout the second half of the game because the tone had dropped so dark that it didn't feel right. Child suicide. That's all I'll say.Another point I should stress is that the puzzles range between discount Sudoku and actually impossible. Seriously. There was a logic puzzle that could not be solved with the information they gave me. Even the walkthrough I had to follow to progress couldn't explain HOW the information it gave was right; just that it was. And then another puzzle kept doing things different to how it said it did...but that one's hard to explain, so I'll just leave at that.My issue with the achievements in this game may not be relevant to some people, but I thoroughly enjoy 100%ing Steam games. That said, this one was a chore. The non-story achieves are dull as anything; here's a little comparison to Deponia (which came out before this)...Deponia has you break physics by playing with electronics, meeting a past/future version of yourself and a special one for replaying the entire game with every word (spoken and written) replaced with Droggeljug.Harvey's New Eyes has you do a slow, drawn-out task 10 times, a different one 15 times, a different one 20+ times and one even 99 times. It has perhaps one or two references that don't feel like a brutal slog, but the rest...Again, that might not matter to some people, but it contributes to my conclusion:This doesn't feel like a Daedalic game. This feels like a fan-made game based on a Daedalic game. The underlying sense of humour is definitely there, but the tone is too dark, the characters too flat and the story too...bad. I don't want to spoil it, but it makes the previous game's story feel like it was a waste of time and boils the 'antagonist' down to a generic evil plot. Complete with a maniacal laugh.It could also be a cheap shot (and a heavily biased one given my great love of the Deponia art style), but the art in this game felt budget. Perhaps they were emulating the art from The Breakout (the first game done by the studio), but I didn't like it.Along with that there were numerous graphical glitches like the inventory not opening, the protagonist appearing in two places at once and the camera panning to the wrong place or just jumping about.There were a few more bugs, but the bottom line is this didn't feel like it was done by the same masters of adventure games that made the Deponia Trilogy. Play them instead as they're some of the best of the genre. This is probably one of the worst. And that pains me to say.			"

												A great continuation to the first game.Despite the line above giving you a bit of a hint, I thought it worth mentioning that despite Steam saying that “Edna & Harvey: The Breakout” was released after “Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes”, this is infact wrong and resulted in me playing the two in the wrong order. This game is the sequel. They follow each other very loosely in terms of story but I think playing them in order would be more enjoyable.First of all, compared to the previous game, there was a big improvement between the two. You can really tell that Daedalic Entertainment had the means to step their game up. There was a bit of a time gap between the two and it shows.Better resolution, nicer and more detailed graphics, a more intuitive point and click system and a generally more polished and bug-free game are just a few things that have gotten better with the sequel.I played through both of these games recently and I have to admit that this was one of those games that I just didn’t mesh with the best. As people who play point and click games often will know, they can vary in terms of how logical the item combinations/puzzles will be. The best case scenarios for point and clicks is that all the puzzles and combinations just make sense to you, you don’t get stuck and sail through the game with no problems. Unfortunately I got a teeny tiny bit majorly stuck on this game at one point. It was a bit frustrating because the game then suddenly came to a grinding holt. Fortunately for me, my boyfriend ended up sitting with me for the rest of the game and we managed to figure it all out together. In that sense, point and click games can be quite good for a single player game that you can playthrough with someone. But on my own, it was a bit annoying.With that aside though, I enjoyed the story. It was longer (at least it felt like it) than “The Breakout”, with several different chapters and settings for you to explore. The game even takes on an interesting mechanic after the first chapter that really peeked my interest and opened up new puzzle ideas within the game. You face “restrictions”, which are put in place so that you can not do certain things, and are forced to overcome these restrictions by entering an alternate reality, a manifestation of our shy school girl Lilli’s mind. You have to work your way around these in order to progress and it’s an interesting puzzle mechanic to work with.The puzzles are interesting and fun, although difficult at times. There was a few that I was quite impressed with the creativity of. It’s always nice to see fresh ideas in point and click games, rather than the usual old puzzles. This game tends to have a dark theme, they include subjects such as mental illness, murder and questionable therapies yet the vibrant, cartoon-ish graphics and upbeat narrator mask those themes. Instead you get this slightly twisted comedy which makes for quite a unique point and click game.Lastly, the achievements. Unlike the previous, I encountered no bugs in this game and did not have any real trouble with any of the achievements. There are a lot of missable ones, but I would advise that you keep different saves as you go along. It makes it a lot easier to go back for any achievements that you missed. It’s an easy 100% overall I would say.All in all, I enjoyed this game and I think I enjoyed it a lot more than it’s predecessor. It’s a great add on to the franchise and another great Daedalic game. I would definitely recommend that you play them in their proper order but both are worth adding to any point and click collection.TL;DR : Despite what Steam says, “Edna & Harvey: The Breakout” is the first game and “Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes” is the second. A big improvement from “The Breakout” as there’s better resolution, nicer and more detailed graphics, a more intuitive point and click system and it generally being a more polished and bug-free game. There is an interesting story, a unique mechanic after chapter 1, fun puzzles and a dark comedic theme which makes it a little more unique to other point and clicks. Easy 100% worth adding to any point and click collection.For anyone interested, My Review for Edna & Harvey: The Breakout:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/255320 "

												The game is truly amazing, the plot is well told, perfectly led and utterly amusing. I would recommend that to anyone who likes dark humor, little bit of creepiness and doesn't mind basic drawing style. The riddles are easy, nevertheless they aren't main part of the game - perfectly led story and funny jokes are. To fully enjoy the tale and listen to all the lines you will need nothing more than 8 hours, but it's worth its price, especially on the sale. However, it might happen that you will get used to heroes much too quickly as I did, and 8 hours won't be enough.Pros:-Hilarious, sometimes ironic jokes-Colorful characters-Nice voice of the narrator-Soothing music-Good way to practice English for non-native speakers-Three endings (my favourite is the ""Contradict ending"", I loved to hear the voice of Lilly)Cons:-Basic drawing style (but you will get used to it very quickly)-Might seem too short-Low difficultyNow I am waiting for the first game to get discounted. Ps. Sorry for my bad English, I am non-native speaker.			"

												The first thing that I liked about this game was the particular extremely dark humor, since the opening speech, where a narrator welcomes you and invites you to take the tutorial. At least in German, it’s absolutely delicious. It made me think of giving a ghastly report on a horrific accident with the voice a dad would read a bedtime story to his 4 year-old little girl.The beginning was like any other point-and-click game. I was this sweet shy little girl in a convent-school, doing this and that and the other… and suddenly I was staring at my screen with eyes opened like two fried eggs, jaw dropped, my mind blown, exclaiming “WTF! Did that just actually happen? WTF!” (My partner, who had been watching me play, laughed his a** off exclaiming “holy sh*t!”). That sent me to one of the most surreal, fantastic, incredible adventure games that I’ve played. I’m glad it was a rainy Sunday, because I just couldn’t stop playing until it was over. I loved every minute of it.Most “puzzles” are actually “collect stuff, combine/use”, but it has a couple of pretty cool mini-games. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure or point-and-click games, but most of all, to anyone who’d like something out of the ordinary.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video    The Review Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is the sequel of Edna and Harvey: The Breakout and it's a great adventure game as well. The art of this game has greatly improved from the first game. The narrator's dialogue is so clever and funny that it reminds me of LucasArts's old adventure games. The characters are very memorable and the voices are well done. We need more adventure games like this. A word of warning though, the ending will leave you with a lot of questions that may never get answered and this game is far darker than the first game.  "

GameplayEdna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a point & click adventure game released in 2012. It's a sequel to Edna & Harvey: The Breakout from 2008. If you haven't played that game, you'll miss a lot of references and background so I strongly advise to......and play that one first.Edna & Harvey: The Breakout only had the classic point & click adventure gameplay of collecting items and using them on objects in the game world or combining them in your inventory first. Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes adds a few real puzzles to the mix, making the gameplay feel a bit more varied compared to its predecessor.The storyThe way the sequel is set up is both refreshing and disappointing. Unfortunately, the game doesn't revolve around Edna this time but we get a whole new protagonist instead: Lilli, a friend of Edna's. The girls are in a convent that's run by a very harsh Mother Superior. When this hag of a woman decides to bring doctor Marcel to the convent to help her discipline the children, Edna knows it's time to get out of there. First, she needs to erase all traces of her stay at the convent but she's afraid to be spotted by Marcel, so it's up to Lilli to peform the series of tasks for her. This turns out to be just the beginning of a wacky adventure for Lilli that will take her to places far beyond the convent's walls...Harvey's role stays about the same: he takes you into an alternate world where you learn things that will help you in the 'real' world. But since you don't carry Harvey around with you this time, he plays a smaller role than he did in Edna & Harvey: The Breakout. The story of Edna & Harvey: The Breakout makes no sense whatsoever. Ok, so Lilli doesn't see everything as it is (no spoiler, you find that out during the first scene after the tutorial) and her mind changes blood and gore to something cute and pretty. But why does nobody else see those horrible things, neither? The ending of the story makes even less sense and in retrospect it creates many plot holes the size of Jupiter.But ah well, it doesn't matter much, really. The fun of the game is in the adventure itself: advancing the story by exploring the vibrant game world and interacting with its colourful inhabitants. And Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is a lot of fun to play.Graphics and soundThe graphics are still basic and cartoonish, but they're a lot less crude and more detailed than Edna & Harvey: The Breakout's graphics. The music is nice but it sounds a lot more melancholic this time. The snappy, jazzy theme music of Edna & Harvey: The Breakout for piano and drums is replaced with a slow, sad tune for the harmonica in Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes. Most of the other music is slow and broody, too. This may seem a bit depressing, but it complements the sad overall mood of the game perfectly. Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is not a happy story, after all.The quality of the supporting cast's voice acting ranges between good and very good. With one exception: it's great to hear Jocasta Gottlieb reprise her role as Edna. Which only rubs salt in the wound of not having Edna as the main character in this game.Lilli's voice acting is... non-existent, really. Lilli doesn't talk. Well, the game tries to have you believe she never gets the chance to talk. You see, she makes sounds like 'uh-huh' or starts a conversation with ""I..."" or ""Do..."" and people immediately interrupt her, saying things like ""Let me guess, you want to..."", ""Don't tell me, you need..."" or ""You're probably wondering..."". As this happens every time, for the entire game, it gets old quickly. And that made me miss Edna even more as a protagonist: fully voiced, she would spew wacky comments on everything the game threw at her.Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes compensates Lilli's virtual muteness by having a narrator talk about everything that happens on the screen. Although this mechanic allows the developers to have the 'grown-up' narrator make humorous comments about things that poor, naive Lilli doesn't understand, it creates a bit of a distance between the player and the game's protagonist. DifficultyEdna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is challenging but not very difficult. Only twice did I come close to looking up a walkthrough, when trying the most absurd solution turned out to be the solution for both problems. An example: you need to use a balloon shaped like a wrench... as a wrench. This makes no sense but before resulting to a walkthrough, you will try it out of desperation. In that particular case, the developers even underline that the solution doesn't really make sense as the narrator says: ""What Lili now did was actually void of all logic and she could already hear uproar of the online reviewers but she did it anyway"".I did look up a guide for the 'pizza puzzle', a puzzle revolving around colour blindness. Turns out the instructions you're given to solve the puzzle are completely wrong. The game tells you that each of the people involved ""mixes up two colours"" when it should have been ""they can't see any item in either of those two colours"". Huge difference, of course. I can only assume this is a problem that results from the game's translation from German to English.So besides that one instance, I never had to use a walkthrough, which means the logical problems and the puzzles presented in Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes are not frustratingly hard and  -with only one or two exceptions- pretty logical, while always presenting a challenge. Well, that's the recipe for a fun point & click adventure game, so Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes passes as far as I'm concerned.On Steam's extra featuresEdna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes has 8 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 4 while running the game.Now, about the Steam Achievements... oh boy! If there were an equivalent of the Raspberry Awards for games, Daedalic Entertainment should get the award for 'least fun achievements in a game ever'. The achievements scream ""We can't be bothered!"": they are boring and uninspired, and they are just copypasted from one game to the next. There are 12 unmissable achievements that are either story-bound or awarded for solving the puzzles. Those are fine. But most of the remaining 17 achievements, which are missable, require you to perform a number of actions 10 or more times. This means skipping through the same conversation each time or sitting through some animations each time. And then, the icing on the achievements cake: perform an action 99 times by clicking a button! Each of those 99 times, you need to skip through some conversation and wait for some animations to finish. Now, that's an improvement, really. In The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, you have to click some buttons 400 times to get two achievements and in The Whispered World it takes 500 mouse clicks for one achievement. But the animation takes longer this time, so in the end you'll waste about as much time getting this mind-numbingly boring 'achievement' done.Also, exactly like in The Whispered World, there's an achievement for skipping all the puzzles again. How can that be called an achievement? That's the equivalent of giving a medal to wartime deserters!Adding some missable Steam Achievements to your game can be a great thing when they add optional extra 'quests', challenges and depth to the game, and at least a bit of extra fun for the player. If they add neither of those things, it shows you can't be bothered. Well, then DON'T! Stick to the unmissable achievements, which is fine for a point & click adventure game. It's certainly preferable to adding chores instead of achievements, and to rewarding players for not playing.			"

So. Much. Fun.At first glance I thought this was going to be some kiddy game, based on the cartoon-like graphics. But rest assured that it's not! There's a fair bit of humorous (censored) violence in this title, with interesting puzzles to boot, and even a turn-based strategy mini-game. The story is also pretty entertaining, with 3 different endings. The first chapter had excellent dark humour. After that, the story took a major turn and things slowed down a bit, but the game still managed to successfully hold my interest. All in all this game is of good length, ranks high on enjoyment + originality, and is pretty immersive. Both kids and adults will enjoy it.But be warned, bugs are aplenty.Here are those I encountered: The first save game I made would not load & I had to start over. In the turn-based strategy mini-game, sometimes characters can only move once, despite already successfully having chosen the option to let them move twice; there are various other bugs in this mini-game. Pressing ""Esc"" does not work sometimes, causing you to be unable to skip cutscenes and access the menu to save your game - make sure you save frequently in case this happens! When you enter the Wild West hypno scene, sometimes the ""restrictions"" menu does not appear, and you have to ""unhypnotise"" yourself, then ""rehypnotise"" yourself again, before the menu will show up. Tons more - these are only those I can remember.Puzzles also need better instructions.Save before you attempt them, because on first try you'll have to figure out what the hell you're supposed to do, since the in-game instructions are useless. They need to give more specific instructions like for example, once you've finished steps 1 and 2, exit this screen and make your selection in the game itself, or something like that. When you play it, you'll know what I mean - puzzle intros were not intuitive in the least.Still worth a play though.I got this game at $1, when there was a Daedalic games bundle sale (5 for $5). Considering the number of gameplay hours and the amount of positive utility I derived from it, this was a great buy.			"

Short version: 87%A new engine (Deponia’s), a new protagonist, and a lot more serious tone with pitch black humour: this is Harvey’s New Eyes in a nutshell. The sequel of Edna & Harvey is still a lot of fun to play for any casual and hardcore adventure game fan, but only if you are not the type who gets disturbed easily.Long version:Edna & Harvey: Harvey’s New Eyes is more of a spiritual successor to ‘The Breakout’ than an actual sequel, even though you will see many familiar faces and places throughout the story.From a technical standpoint, it is closer to Deponia: same engine, same user interface, similar multi-chapter story structure and difficulty. This also carries the advantage of using more refined point ‘n’ click mechanics for the small price of sacrificing the charm of a well-made indie game that made ‘The Breakout’ so charismatic.One of the most defining features of this game is the humour– humour darker than the core of a black hole. Seriously. If you get disturbed about children dying gruesome, horrible deaths, don’t ever buy this one. It may look cartoonish, but that is just one of the clever tools to make the player feel uncomfortable. Another is the narrator who does a perfect job of telling a seemingly innocent tale about a little girl in a way that sends shivers down your spine.The writing is excellent. Yes, it is disturbing in many places and it is disturbingly cruel with most of the cast, but the characters also fit in their role in the plot perfectly.It’s the small things though that shows the brilliance. Things like not letting the protagonist say even a single word in any dialogue yet still being able to carry meaningful conversations with everyone. Sure, it sounds insane to essentially cripple your dialogues, one of the main aspects of an adventure game, but sometimes being crazy works. And aren’t we all a little cuckoo in our own ways anyway?			"

												Really good point-and-click adventure with a dark humor twist. I mean, there is a moment where you believe the game is quite dark and then it becomes even darker.You play as Lilly, a polite and well behaved child living at the convent school with a tough Mother Superior. Her only friend is Edna, who needs some help.PROS:- Decent cartoon graphics.- Brilliant voice acting.- Narrator is the best and funniest narrator I've ever encountered in point'n'click games.- Difficulty is quite balanced (there was one place I needed to consult walkthrough, because I didn't realize the location was wider and the screen could move to the right).- Variety of fun locations and many puzzles are not too cliche.- The last minigame is really fun, it's like a mini RPG game inside this game.- Amazingly executed dark story with some twists.MEH:- Animation might be somewhat better.- Some location graphics might be a little better too.CONS:- One of the mini games was a bit annoying for me (the Old Man's memories). You can skip the mini games, though.The game is not very long, 8 hours was enough for me, but it's entertaining and pleasantly dark. Warning: if you don't like depressing themes containing bullying, abuse, torture and mental disorder, you may not want to play this. I loved it!GAMEPLAY 8/10GRAPHICS 7/10AUDIO 9/10STORY 9/10			"

												Point-and-click with a slightly dark and twisted humor. This game took me by surprise. I was very sceptical at first, my main game is counter-strike, but wanted something new. I played point-and-click games as a child in the 90's and early 2000's. This game has that same feelling of mystery and the satisfying feeling of accomplishment. I recommend it*Pros*-hours of gameplay (I actually thought it was finished after the first chapter)-3 chapters-good puzzles-You play a little girl that kills people-No quest log/task list. (I find it more challenging)*Cons*-The ""restrictions"" menu dissappears very often, atleast for me. (cant find any buttons to bring it back, but if I went to main menu and back into the game and it solves the problem for a limited time.)-No achievements (I'm no achivementhunter but still...)			"

												Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a mildly dark and twisted point & click adventure that feels a lot like Sam & Max style adventure games. Interestingly enough, you don't play as either Edna or Harvey, instead playing the role of the young innocent schoolgirl, Lilli. But Lilli doesn't speak too much, and most of her dialog is filled by a narrator that loves to hear himself talk. Even though his voice acting is good, he all too often comes off as being melodramatic when it usually isn't necessary. The result is a game that tries to be funny all of the time, but only succeeds some of the time. The narrator makes every effort to lighten the mood, but his delivery is often dry and humorless and the intended humor often can't compete with the game's dark themes.The puzzles were pretty straightforward. There were only a handful of places where it wasn't obvious what the next move was. Graphical drawings are nicely done and the story is well written.Steam achievements are broken. I finished the entire game without a single achievement unlocking.Overall, Harvey's New Eyes is a reasonably well done point & click adventure that doesn't leave any lasting impressions.			"

												The cute, almost childish image of the game is all a lie, a lie glazed by pink gooey icing. This game explores various psychological themes while having the player draw implications from Lilli's actions. As of February's patch achievements work again, though there's some tweaking you might have to do on your end if you purchased the game before the patch.Be warned: the game is also slightly buggy, with the biggest bug completely breaking one of my save files and had me stuck at an Oooooogiiiiiieeee dialogue right before the final encounter, forcing me to start the game over from scratch; thank goodness dialogues could be skipped with the Esc key. Smaller bugs include rapidly self-skipping dialogues and perspectively-wrong-sized characters (really, Mother Superior should not be as tall as the stair railings).This is not a game you should take at face value - you really need to delve into the story and its implications and twist your brain around the sanity of the main character. Or, the game can do that for you, your choice.d(^-^d) Obtain at your convenience.			"

												Despite the technical issues I had with this, I love point and click games and it is well made. I'm recomending it because as far as this genre goes, it's great for those who enjoy that. If you loved monkey island, grim fandango, etc, you'll have fun with this as well. I don't see why kids can't play it, but people do die off screen and the character is responsible for killing them. That could be bad for some kids.As for the technical issues, myself and a lot of people can't get the achievements. Theres a fix for it in the forums, that involves deleting your save files and replaying the whole thing. Also, it froze at the very last battle for me. The forums also had people say that it worked when they reloaded it days later, so far it hasn't worked for me. I can't get an achievement for it so I'm not too bothered by it. But these are issues people have been having for two or more years so it does irk me a bit that it isn't going to be fixed.			"

												I'll be honest, I bought this game because it was cheap & I liked the art style.  I wasn't expecting much considering the price was very low but I must say I was plesently surprised!Pros;:: I love point & click adventure games & this fits the bill:: It's got a cute, hand drawn art style:: It's sarcastic, funny, slightly evil & very silly.:: It's surprisingly lengthy too - {took me about 7 hours to fully complete it}:: You have these ""mini game"" sections throughout the main game & it's handy that they do give you a ""skip"" button, so if it's too hard of a puzzle or you just can't be bothered doing it - you can skip it & it doesn't prevent you progressing further.:: The game has 3 possible endings - so it's cool you get to choose how your story ends {helpful tip - save when you're in the loony bin cell with Edna, this is a decent place to reload to if you're wanting to check out the alternate endings}Cons;:: At times I did find myself clicking random stuff because it wasn't 100% obvious on what to do next {a lot of time was wasted & I did have to resort to a walkthrough for about 40% of it - for shame...}:: During cutscenes, although the animation is somewhat smooth - the audio is bad.  You can hear it juddering & skipping - plus this happens during gameplay too so it can get fairly tedious after a while.:: The end credits seemed to go on forever & having the main theme tune on a constant repeat was dire, even though you could click your mouse to speed up the credits - for me, this just resulted in crashing the game.  No disrespect to those who made it, they all deserve recognition in the credits but it would have been nice to have a skip option for those who didn't want to sit through them.:: The achievements for the game are broke, you're able to unlock the ""fast learner"" achievement if you skip the tutorial {recommended for second play through} but after that you earn no more achievements - so if you're wanting to play this game just for the achievements, i'd give it a miss.  After a bit of digging through community discussions, this issue has been broke for quite some time - so far there's still no resolve.Other than that I can't pick much fault with the game.It's worth the money, it's silly, it's something worth wasting your time on.I only hope the developers finally get round to patching the achievements issue - otherwise they're going to have a lot of unhappy players on their hands asking for refunds, as something like that can really ruin the game for you.

												So the 2nd part for me. I play this 1st part now after 2nd part Break Out . Its a bit long ago but i was directly back in the game, even if the parts are 2 differents in second you play Edna to Escape and now you see the beginning with Lilly. The story is curious and with many funny parts again. I love the style of Daedaldic Games and the strange art they bring in games. Enjoy this game if you like point and click adventurs or a high mid class story. You dont need to play Break out first but i find it would be better. So i give this game for the fun i had 92 % because i love Point and Click games, for others its mabe to high points, but watch trailer and decide yourself if you want play the game and how much you think its worth and than buy it when the price is fine (50% better 66-75% discount). Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoy the puzzles, characters and tale parts.			"

Lili is an high potential actress and student at the catholic school of the damned where she happens to play an ""normal"" girl. Her role includes playing hide and seek, searching for clues, practicing self-hypnosis and blowing up stuff.Harvey plays in this game too. He happens to be the sad and almost forgotten sidekick in this one and has only one thing to do in this game: Showing his bright blue red eyes, and tell you NO!The psychotic puerile person-possessed psychologist Doctor Martel Doctor Marcel has his comeback in this episode to stop Lili from growing into an beautiful flower. He is trying to suppress her childish nature with hypnosis and wants her to obey all his evil rules.We all know that rules are there to be broken and so... Lili is breaking bad.

												Really amazing humor in the game, there are some unique mechanics that work really well and are well explained. First game where I screamed ""hell yes"" at ""Do you want to play the tutorial?"". I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed the humor in a new point & click adventure game this much, and I'd definitely rank it among the best I've ever played, and I've played quite a few.There are some puzzles that offer the option to skip if you don't like those parts, and I find it a great idea .. some adventure games have had awful puzzles and being forced to play through them has really brought down the experience as a whole, though I've not yet had similar experiences with this game's puzzles.I've not yet finished the game and had to really struggle to be able to stop and go to bed, a couple of hours later than I originally planned to. I can't see how the game could possibly be ruined in whatever remains of it as everything I've seen so far has been great.There are a couple of cases where the controls and hitboxes for interactable things have felt a bit off, but overall they're still among the best I've seen in similar games. There is a well done ""highlight things I can interact with"" -key, so no need to do pixel hunting either.			"

												I'm a huge fan of point and click style games and this was one that surprised me with how dark it was but also it was very complelling to play. The narration was funny and a nice dry tone that added to the charm, the enviorments I went to were drawn and created with such detail and looked amazing. The story itself is also very interesting (No spoilers here), its a squeal to the original Edna and Harvey The Breakout, which I also really enjoyed despite that the way the inventory works was more annoying then anything else in the original, here at times it can be but I looked at both and here it was improved a bit to be less of a hassel. Also the animation and overall quailty of the envoriments was very much improved from the orginial and is now much more polished with richer colors and detail.I will say that the ending was a let down (in my own opinion) but overall if your a fan of point and click games and a interesting narrative with dark humor and a unusual premise that seems to warp reailty as you continue to play, then this is the game for you. I felt myself guessing the wholeway through about who my character, Lilli, truly was, I mean right from the start (around 10 to 20 minutes in) you something was VERY wrong with her, mentally anyway. Just from the trailers I had the feeling she was not a normal person and I like stories that are interesting and suprizing and this is one of those games.It does suffer from the normal flaws of point and clicks. Trying to figure out what to do next at some points, having to backtrack alot, you know the usual annoyances.Still I do recommened it as a cool story and also the original as well.I would give this game a 8.4/10			"

												TL;DR: Point & click adventure of seemingly innocent looks but containing dark humour and a grim yet wacky storyline.DISCLAIMER: This review is spoiler-free.Who the heck are Edna and Harvey? That was our (me and my wife) first question since we didn't initially know Harvey's New Eyes is actually the sequel to Edna & Harvey: The Breakout, despite having a release date preceding the latter on Steam. Fortunately it can be played well without knowing about the first game. It's definitely a nice game but like the main character, it's got issues.Who's who?Instead of Edna (who is your friend) you play as Lilli, a little girl being schooled at a convent school. She's depicted as a shy, clumsy girl who ""always does as she's told"". She's effectively a silent protagonist since she never gets to finish a word before she's interrupted.Usually in adventure games the protagonist thinks or comments on stuff that they see. Here this role has been reserved for the narrator. He makes snarky comments, describes what Lilli thinks and comments on every ridiculous thing Lilli tries. It's not possible to say more without spoiling it so suffice it to say his comments are masked by innocence but often tainted by the dark reality that Lilli seems oblivious to. We found the narrator hilarious, albeit repetitive at times.The other characters are generally well developed, wacky caricatures of stereotypes. Some are batshit crazy - others are even likeable. The roster is large though often there's little need to interact with them more than a few times.""Why are you playing a kids' game?""It soon becomes apparent that Lilli has some mental issues. Mental illness was the theme in the first game and thus it's appropriate to use here as well. The story plot starts out as a blend of a mystery and mundane chores, both of which lead to hilarious yet grim consequences, before developing into a kind of an escape and rescue adventure.Art style is simple yet colourful. Despite that don't go thinking this was a children's game just because of the bright graphics. They are in sharp contrast to the themes explored within. The themes are very adult and they involve mental disease, death, violence, alcohol, smoking and some other actions of dubious morale, more so than adventure games in general. This is not a bad thing per se, just not necessarily suitable for children.Clickety clickWhile playing we were menaced by a frustrating bug: when going to menu or alt+tabbing out of the game, the mouse cursor would stop registering either left or right clicks and oftentimes it would not open the inventory. This would be fixed only by revisiting menu a few times and trying again. It was mostly an annoyance though.Otherwise the interface works splendidly and it's a traditional point & click adventure game: left-click interacts, right-click looks at stuff. It's possible to see every interactable by pressing spacebar, which reveals that this is actually fairly casual adventure game: there are only a few interactables per every scene so it's fairly easy to progress even with the universal brute force strategy of trying everything with everything. Regrettably there's no dialogue for trying to interact with every object, so it may feel the game is unresponsive since one's expecting to get at least some response.Exploring the game this way is prone to find all kinds of bugs if they exist. We encountered German dialogue once. Couple of times a cutscene would be skipped fast through like I had skipped it myself, and this repeated even if I reloaded the same scene. These were annoying but not game-breaking flaws.Solid game with some issuesFor us the game lasted 15 hours containing completion, all endings and achievements. Contrary to many reviews, the achievements worked fine for us. Some of them are grindy and because of that hard to discover on your own. When you have to do some trivial interaction over ten times it really doesn't work well as an achievement in a point & click adventure game, especially since there is no indication or dialogue reward that you were doing it correctly.While the story is good, characters are quirky and interesting and we generally liked the game, I wouldn't recomend it at full price: I'd wait until at least 50% or 75% sale if you are not particularly into point & click adventure games.

												I bought this game in as part of a bundle working out at about £1.10 per game. For the price I paid this was an enjoyable game with some fun characters, creepy narrative and nice artwork. However, I would not recommend it at full price of about £15 because I had a number of issues with the gameplay itself. The 'puzzles' are not so much logical things to be worked out but more guessing at a specific but very random series of events/items/clicking that the devs have decided on. The solutions to puzzles often involve unnecessary prerequisites and other times just make no sense at all- I defy anyone to complete this game without at least being tempted to look at a walkthrough at some point!!

												A proper follow up to Edna & Harvey: The Breakout! I enjoyed this game more than I enjoyed its predecessor. For one, this game was way more fair on the player! I didn't find myself looking up an online walkthrough every other puzzle. I absolutely still used one, but far less. The black humor was way stronger in this game! Oh my. And I thought The Breakout was messed up. It was almost too dark. One downside is Edna's role in the game is very small. She plays a minor character. I really got attached to Edna and way disappointed that this is really Lilli's game (and she doesn't speak which I didn't care for). Harvey however plays a major role in an interesting way. The good(?) thing about this game is that it could be easily picked up by someone who did not play through The Breakout.I finished this game in about 10 hours. It ended up being longer than the Breakout for me, which was very surprising because I thought The Breakout was quite long. After I'd finish a chapter in this game I'd be like, wow there's more?I had occasional problems with the restrictions menu not showing up, but other than that the game ran well.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a point and click adventure game and likes dark humor.Also, there are no jump scares that I can recall.

												You play as Lilly, a small girl that doesn't seem so bright in the head. She meets different kind of people, and it only gets funnier as the story goes on!Funniest moment: ""Kids shouldn't be having items like that....take this instead!"" O_OYou just end up sitting there gaping in shock, then burst out in laughter.A short very hilarious game, with challenges and tons of fun! Spent exactly 15 hours to complete the game twice including all achievements. First round probably took the whole 10-12 hours, a few hours for some single achievements and then maybe less than 1.5 hours to complete the game over again to get 100% achievements.Recommend it!

												Surprisingly hilarious adventure game with narrator who marks your every action. Graphics and art work is quite good. Only thing is that, game is really short with 3 chapters in it and if you know what to do and how to solve everything, and do not care about story then it is possible to complete game within 2 hours. In my last playthrough i did speed run and completed it in 1:40 hours.I really recommend this adventure game.Score: 9/10.			"

												If you're a big fan of Point and Click adventure games, this is a must play. It starts off looking like an innocent game about an orphan girl and soon enough you'll learn that it is much darker than that. With an entertaining story, funny dialogues and narration plus some interesting puzzles, this will keep you entertained for hours! There are also multiple endings to get(although all 3 are pretty easy to get).			"

												Well.. after picking up and finishing this game in one day the first thing that crossed my mind is:This game was worth every second playing. Actually, I wouldn't mind playing it a couple times more. The graphics are .. something to adjust to in the first couple of minutes, but still quite enjoyable.The humor of this game is .. incredible. I sat hear laughing tears at some points. The music get's a little repetitive after staying quite a while on the same screen, but that's alright - just think a little quicker, eh. So .. all in all, I'd rate this game a definite 9/10.Why 9/10? Well damn it, I really didn't want to ♥♥♥♥ing kill Capu. I liked Capu, for ♥♥♥♥s sake. Hmpf. "

												I watched the trailer which contains spoilers, so don't watch the trailer.This game is frequently on sale and the price can reach $1~$2. I usually don't write reviews until I beat the game, but this game is so good that I can't wait.I'm hardly a fan for Point & Click because 1. I prefer more complex gameplay 2. I prefer more complex plot. This game is good on both, and more. I strongly recommend it.Gameplay:The gameplay is still P&C here, so you just click your mouse around, but personally the difficulty is really good - nothing insane, but hard enough that you actually need to think and explore. The simple gameplay also makes the plot more ironic - all this dark plot only requires some clicks.Plot:As many have suggested the game is really dark. REAL dark. There's no ""normal"" character so far and the relation between people is really fked up. It is very unique.Atmosphere:This is the best part. The cartoon graphics, the cheerful music, the simple control... EVERYTHING adds up to the dark atmosphere. I feel very emphatic with the main character because of the way the story is told and, like said, the casual setup of the game just makes it even more ironic. I'm so impressed with the things one can do in P&C.Achievement:Now many people say that the achievements are breaking their mouse and they are not wrong. However I appreciate the role these achievements play in character building a lot. How do you know that a girl is diligent and a bit eerie? Well, she rakes the leaves back and forth for nothing for 50 times! (Of course, you are gonna be the one actually clicking on the leaves for 50 times...) Most of the achievements don't contribute to the gameplay in any way - like, you really don't have to talk to this character 10 times to proceed - but they are NOT random. They are beautifully designed.			"

												I had always avoided point and click games due to my problems with the pacing but this game is a masterpiece. I haven't played the original but I didn't have problems following the story or the characters. When you start the game it fools you with a childlike artstyle and cheery music, yet, a little while after it takes a really dark turn. I found myself gasping and laughing nervously while the messed up events unfolded. I found the puzzles to be quite clever and interesting and I admit some of them were too clever for me... Nothing the wiki page couldn't help solve. I highly recommend this to any fan of the point and click genre or anyone who just wants a change from the norm.I give it a solid 8/10			"

												10/10Perfect Game for Point & Click Adventure lovers.It will help if you play the prequel.I love Daedalic for making this game.I bought this game back in 2012 and I raged about the fact, that it wasn't on Steam.I played through it several times and it reserved a place in my heart.After some time, I wanted to play it again, but since Daedalic put a needed Code-Wheel inside the box, which I lost I couldn't play it anymore.So I was sad and didn't know what to do.In April 2014 I contacted the support of Daedalic and I asked, if they'd give me a new Code-Wheel.But Sadly, they didn't have any of them left. They asked if I could make a Picutre of the game, the box of the game and my sign.So I did that and they gave me a code for the game on Steam!!I love Daedalic and I am a big fan of this series.I would REALLY recommend this game for everybody.

												Ignore the cute artwork - in the first act, you KILL all of your classmates! This game is DARK! It's morbid humor and I love it! The narrator has that peachy GLaDOS-style negative-spin on everything. The voice acting is great with the dialog as funny as Monkey Island. The art isn't amazing, but passable. I was never confused by any of the visuals. Having interactable objects 'glow' helps so you're not searching for every little pixel. Like the other reviews, the mouth motions really distract from the clean art. The animations are bad, but that's the only fault I can really find.The puzzles aren't abstract, and the narrator gives you a lot of tips in solving problems. Some puzzles have you filling out grids, which flew over my head. Luckily, there's a skip button for them. I found myself able to figure out most of the puzzles if I really put my mind on it. I'm not the smartest person, so expert adventure gamers might find the puzzles too easy.			"

												First time i openned this game I had no idea what to expect, since I didn't know the original game. Thus I was not expecting that such a colorful and seemingly childish game, would have such dark sense of humor. I had a lot of fun with the narrator and with Lily's clumsiness. The story and gameplay is extremely well thought, the puzzles challenging to understand as they are not exactly ""logical"". In fact, I felt as if the whole idea and concept was to be random and irrealistic, forcing you to think outside the box. I would not recommend the game for its starting price, but in a sale its worth it. ""Woooooogie""			"

Following around the main character Lilli (who I'm convinced is insane) throughout the story line of Edna & Harvey has proven to be an entertaining adventure with humorous narration and an erratic story line. Simple gameplay and not for everyone but I enjoyed it.			"

												Done... Honestly I have to recommend this game, but I have to put this point'n'click behind Day Of The Tentacle remastered, the Deponia series and Clockwork tales of glass and ink (artifex mundi), since some aspects of the game did not click with me.Pros: - gfx art - sound/music and voice actors - dark and disturbing which let us escape the nice/gentle and politically correct atmospheres of other similar gamesCons: - first part is really nice, but in the second part, I got the feeling of a ""corporate chief forced us to finish quickly to write the story"": I found the ""absurd"" of this second part kind of ""cheap"". It means that I got the feeling, sometimes, that the  absurd was used more as an escape to fill a lack of imagination to go faster to the end of the story. I get the same feeling when I have been working on a topic for quite a long time, and after a while, I tend to used ""cheap"" tricks to end it more quickly, coze I'm bored. This is exactly the feeling I got on the 2nd part of the game. Maybe daedalic should make shorter games, but more polished and homogenous in the quality of the story telling. When working on an absurd world, the elements of absurd must be elegant, powerfull and sophisticated. Moreover the absurd world has still to be coherent regarding its absurd rules (c.f. Terry Pratchet's disc world | Harry Potter | Day Of The Tentacle). - I did hit 3-4 annoying bugs (hangs and stuck camera).			"

												""The moral of the story is:You can do whatever you want. As long as you keep your free will. Even if it means stabbing an old man in a wheelchair to death. The end.""My favorite ending is when Lilli contradicts Dr. Marcel. The first time (and not the last i bet) when Lilli actually says what's on her mind, she finally stands up for herlself. When she becomes furious at Dr. Marcel and everyone else in this damned world, it's such a beautiful sight to watch. You go girl! Finally, some attitude. The final battle with Mother Superior was cool, enough combos to try 'em out. Fun puzzles, too. Monkey Island reference when you get the Deja Vu achievement (""I think I've been here before...""). I got into the game when I were at least 3.5 hours in it, it gets really interesting farther so I'm glad i didn't drop it. Great credits song, you can see Bee-man enjoying his freedom flying. Finally, a character that isn't dead. Goblins didn't get to paint his corpse in pink. Sweet artwork. This game isn't as crazy as the previous one (less good old Harvey, less Edna, more Lilli). Nevertheless, I enjoyed playing it and I don't regret it.			"

												An old-school point'n'click adventure game, reminiscent in style of some latter-day LucasArts games, including the amazing Day of the Tentacle. This is actually a sequel to another Edna & Harvey game (also available on Steam), but I played this without first playing the first game, and I can safely say you don't need to play the first game to enjoy this adventure. It has many of the shortcomings of traditional point'n'click games, including illogical ""use item X on Y"" problems and an annoying lack of an in-game hint system (EVERY adventure game should have one like Broken Sword 5 recently did!).No, it doesn't try to be ""modern"" in any way, but at a time when Telltale has redefined adventure games and turned them into interactive movies, it is refreshing to play something honestly retro and honestly old-school.Some of the dialogue and humour is not quite as good as it tries to be, and some of the puzzles are a bit illogical, but overall this is a very good retro with gorgeous graphics and some pretty funny, dark scenarios. The best part about it is the overall flow of the game, the inventive dream scenarios and surprisingly touchy adult content. Edna & Harvey does not reinvent the genre, nor cure the inherent mechanical shortcomings in it, but it made me feel good inside, because it feels like a modern day reimagining of Day of the Tentacle, from which it obviously draws a lot of inspiration. Fun stuff.Rating: 8/10			"

												I have not played the previous Edna and Harvey game, but I still really enjoyed this one! It doesn't run at a modern 16:9 resolution, and visually it looks kind of dated and crude, but the writing, characters, and the voice actors who portray them are top notch. Each character is unique and absolutely interesting. I ran through every dialogue option and never regretted it. The puzzles do get challenging, and I did have to use a walkthrough on multiple occasions, but the overall experience is one that I will never forget.			"

												Usually in point-and-click games you can guess the plot already at the start, but this game is a bit different from that. I was quite surprised when I got to the end of the game. (Not revealing any information.) What I don't like about this game is that the main character (Lilly) is so stupid. It has to be that way in order for the game to be the game it is, but it's soooo annoying. The game is very creative from my view, especially the restrainments she has to endure and overcome. Harvey's New Eyes has more complicated puzzles compared to Deponia's first game (as an example). Definitely play this in one go or in a few days! ...or you will forget all the leads and hints (which I of course did not do!!! :< )The game is basically constructed on humor (not the funny-type). The narrator constantly makes ""hilarious"" remarks when Lilly kills somebody, and yes she kills people often. If you like that kind of humor, go ahead and play Harvey's New Eyes! I finished the game and got all the achievements in 13 hours, and yes I had to play it twice. I recommend saving quite often to get all the achievements or to follow a guide and save at the right points. Have fun playing this!			"

												I cannot stress enough how wonderful this game is.I've never been a fan of point-and-click (with the exception of PuttPutt, Pajama Sam, etc), but the game really kept me on my toes to figure out the eccentric puzzles and constantly get to the next cutscene and stage. One great thing was the ability to check what you can interact with. You know, in the case you can't see it right away and don't want to break your mouse trying. It definitely saved me a few times. Not only was the story immersive, but it definitely was funny! I kept admiring the protagonist's innocence towards the events occuring until later. Dark humour at its finest.The best part about all this is: it also just is great for replay in the sense of how you would be going through the story again and again because you just REALLY want to. Not for any other reason. Just to experience it.If it looks like it's good to you, get it. Don't look back.			"

												I love the humour of this game. I skipped some of the minigames, because they were boring, others where quit okay. I bought this game on sale, and let's be honest, it's worth more than 0.99 cent.There is only one negative thing. I'm talking about the achievements. I got none. I read in the forums about it, and it looks like it's never going to be fixed, so no achievements for me.But if you don't care much about the achievements and would like to play a great point and click game, go on and buy this game.

												A humourous game, though relatively short (unless you're looking to get all those multiple clickety achievements).Pros:- The narrator is absolutely hilarious- Tackles morbidity in a light-hearted way- Storyline is very straightforward, as are the puzzles and minigames- Bonus for players of the original Edna & Harvey game: References galore (although I don't fall into this category so I couldn't fully appreciate the nods)Cons:- Art style is rather simplistic, though I attribute that to the game's age- Sometimes the puzzles are a bit too easy, especially comparing them with Daedalic's other point-and-click titles- A bit too many achievements that require you to click on things 200000 timesI wouldn't recommend this game at full price, but if it's on sale it's definitely worth it!

												Η τελική αποτίμηση για το Harvey’s New Eyes έχει αναμφίβολα θετικό παρονομαστή. Ερχόμενο σε μία περίοδο δημιουργικού οργασμού από μέρους της Daedalic Entertainment και μπαίνοντας σφήνα μεταξύ άλλων σπουδαίων τίτλων της, όπως τα Deponia, Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav και Chaos on Deponia, επιτυγχάνει να μας προσφέρει μία ανάλαφρη αλλά ενδιαφέρουσα ιστορία, αποφεύγοντας τα λάθη του πρώτου μέρους και με αρκετές στιγμές μαύρου χιούμορ να αποτελούν το ιδιαίτερο χαρακτηριστικό του γνώρισμα. Στον αντίποδα, υστερεί στον (πολύ χαμηλό) δείκτη δυσκολίας και στη μικρή συνολικά διάρκειά του. Μπορεί να μην φτάνει τα επίπεδα των προαναφερθέντων τίτλων, αξίζει όμως να ασχοληθείτε μαζί του, μια και πρόκειται για ποιοτικό παιχνίδι, στα γνωστά επίπεδα των δημιουργιών που μας δίνουν οι Γερμανοί σχεδιαστές adventure games.http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/edna-and-harvey-harvey-s-new-eyes "

												I played this game before the first one cause I thought this was the first one when I bought it, though I could still understand everything. I really enjoyed playing the game, and it's probably my most favorite point and click game so far.Things I liked:- It has a very cynical humor, which is the best humor.- It has a dark story covered with a happy drawing style, which is really my thing (childish design but an horror story).- The main character actually makes you like her.- There is a cool twist at the end.- The english talking voices were very clear and easy to understand (it isn't my native language).Things I disliked:- English isn't my first language, and I usually need people to talk slow in order to understand them. However, the talking on this game was too slow even for someone like me, which means it must have been REALLY slow.- There are a lot of animations that you can't skip (unlike the talking lines that you can skip by clicking), and this is very annoying when you click on things more than once and you have to watch the whole slow story part all over again.- In order the get most of the achivements you just have to repeat the same action tons of times, which is not only boring, but also annoying due to the above thing about the animations ^.- The tutorials for the puzzles were very unclear and I had to guess the directions for most of them.- There were a few points in the game where I tried everything with no luck, and I had to google the next step, only to find out it was some hidden click that I could never figure out without to randomly click there.Over all it was a great and fun game, and I ended up buying the first game after playing it, which means the bad sides were not too bad.

												Recently, I picked this game up in a Humble Weekly Sale, and I greatly enjoyed it.  It should be noted that it is a sequel; as a result, many parts of it will make little to no sense without playing the previous game: ""Edna and Harvey: the Breakout.""  I, being cheap, chose to watch a playthrough on youtube rather than buy the twenty dollar game, so that I might have context for this game.  I also have a few warnings about this game.  For starters, do not be fooled by the innocent exterior, this game is dark, extremely dark.  It may also screw with your mind to some degree or another, especially the ending.  The ending can be a no-win situation, unless you count the somewhat secret ending.  I'll leave it to you to figure out how to get to that ending.  This game differs from its predecessor in as much as there is a secret ending which can be considered somewhat good.  Despite the darkness and tendency to mess with the head, or perhaps because of it, the story is very good and well written.  This game is more than just a game, it is a story (in fact ""Edna and Harvey: the Breakout"" was originally a German university project on the topic of ""The Computer Game as a Non-Linear Narrative Form.""  In my opinion, both games accomplish the goal of proving the computer game as a storytelling medium very well.)  I know that most games need a story of some sort, but point-and-click adventure games depend heavily on the story, bringing it to the forefront, as opposed to FPS games, for example, where story can and often does take a backseat to the gameplay of shooting things.  As a result, this genre of games must be judged on storytelling more so than others.  Also, being a point-and-click adventure game, it requires the usual application of combined genius and madness to figure out the circuitous solutions to the puzzles.  While it is very good for what it is, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who dislikes the genre.  If your prior experiences with point-and-clicks range from ""meh"" to bad, I doubt this will change your opinion of them.  All of the above also goes for this game's predecessor, which I also recommend.  Finally, I would like to bring up price.  I have seven hours logged on this game by Steam, and I've beaten it.  So I would say 20 dollars is a tad bit steep, and would suggest waiting for this game to go on sale, if it ever does.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think 20 dollars is worth it, especially since point-and-click adventure games have almost no replay value.  There are other games for the same price or less that you could probably get more playtime out of.  So, to sum up the pros and cons of this game, it is a very solid point-and-click with a good, if dark and confusing, story, generally clever, if contrived and circuitous, puzzles, that, while generally fun, probably isn't worth 20 dollars.

												Very good adventure for the old school adventurers.It's enough hard BUT NOT hardcore. It has some good riddles instead.The graphics are good , comics. But modern.The game has plenty of Black Humour, from the very first time. I wouldn't propose that for children, but you shouldn't wait to see something BAD. Everything that you see is covered with humour. But the messages it passes for a kid are a bit hot.I would say in comparison with the fisrt Harvey: The Breakout that this one is a real masterpiece from Daedalic. The first one... let's NOT talk about it!			"

												A very cute cartoony point and click with a slight morbid undertone and weird psychological associations. Despite the bright and colorful overtone, the concepts and development of minor characters may be disuading to some. That being said, it was a simplistic point and click with some struggles, an easy going OST and uncommon writing style that may not appeal to all styles of humor. Pleasantly short, finished in about 2-3 short sittings, and satisfied with my game time. That being said, it's currently priced for $19.99, I don't recall how much I purchased it for but wouldn't recommend at full price. Definitely purchase on a heavy discount. $5-10 dollars seems to be a good price range for this type of game.			"

 Dark Humor for everyone  I suggest playing Edna and Harvey: The Breakout first since this is the sequel to it, plus it make the story much more understandable. This game is much darker than the first game and it doesn't shy away from sending chills up your spine. In this game you play as Lilli a nearly mute orphan trying to figure out what is the right way to act with so many people giving her orders.Unlike the first game, the story is told through the narrator instead of the protagonist and they will always have something funny to say even in the darkest moments of the game. So if you're a fan of point and click games, like a good story with humor and can stand some chilling scenes then I suggest getting this game!			"

I mean, apart from it that your main character is constantly bullied by everyone and anyone and it is just very painful that during this point and click adventure you just have to stand there and watch how everybody is so mean to you, but at the same time, seems like everybody is also getting what they deserve. It´s filled with humour and amazing graphic style. I love it, it´s really cute. I am excited to play more and eventually finish it.Finished. Game is really excellent. Totally worth the time.

												An enjoyable sequel to the first. It's nice to see a game where they've kept in mind all the problems of the first and made honest attempts to fix those failings and make a better game. I think they have. You should still play the first game before this one though. It's also important to have a few save files just incase there is a problem.I'm not to fussed on the fact that I've been unable to unlock any of the achievements in the time I've invested but that's just a bug, not the fault of the game, Other than that I think it's an enjoyable game that builds off the first.

												Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is an enjoyable adventure game, but all up I don't think it's as good as its prequel (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout).As with the first game, there are a number of bugs -- including game breaking save game bugs -- and again, as with the first game, it apparently works better in German. With perseverance and the help of the game's Steam Discussions I did manage to finish the game, though I had to play through three times to get some of the glitchy Steam achievements.In Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, Edna is only a very secondary character, and Harvey doesn't even appear at all until a good portion into the game, although after that point he is very important to the story. His quippy remarks are largely missing, though, and there's nothing of the long-term relationship between Edna and Harvey from the first game. It's a big shame, too.Instead, we are given Lilly as the main character: a mostly silent 'good girl' who seems to spend most of her time doing what she's told, either by the grumpy Mother Superior of the convent where Lilly lives and learns, or by her friend, Edna. Lilly is a great character, charming and innocent, but I was a bit disappointed by the lack of involvement with Edna and Harvey, given that the game is ostensibly about them. That said, the tie-in with the characters from the first game was very well done.The graphics are improved from the first game and are very well done. Sounds are adequate, and all text is spoken, some well, some not so well. I found the narrator's voice grating and unpleasant, which wasn't much fun given that it was the voice most heard throughout the game, and Mother Superior was terrible. But Edna and Harvey are both back and excellently spoken -- although quite limited -- and I also thought Lilly was superb. Most of the others were adequate, but forgettable.The story is very different to that of the first game. Parts are very silly, while others are very serious, often hiding under a layer of silly. I think overall it was very well done. Puzzles are mostly simple, and there is a much smaller range of objects with which you can interact than in the first game. I didn't enjoy some of the minigames very much, but you can skip them all if you want (as long as you're not bothered about missing the achievements).I really liked Harvey's New Eyes. I think I probably liked The Breakout more, but this is still a great game. Recommended for adventure game fans, most definitely.Wooooooogie. "

												I've never played the first one, so I have no thoughts on this game as a sequel. However, I will say it's a fun and humorous (very dark humor at that) short play. Graphics: Edna and Harvey has a very simplistic art style, and at first may feel a bit too simplistic for a point and click adventure game. However the art style does fit in and I found myself quickly getting used to it in a few minutes. But compared to most Daedalic games, this one is still down on graphics.Voice Acting: The voice acting is great and really brings out the characters in fitting ways. But while the characters are colorfully brought to life, don't expect much for emotional voice acting, as that's not really part of this game's theme to begin with.Gameplay: Pretty much what you'll expect from a point and click adventure game. Functions work fine, not too many bugs, and it does have skippable tutorials and puzzles (if you're just playing for story). And the rules list ends up being an excuse to click stuff more rather than play as a full feature, but the idea is entertaining.Music: The soundtrack in this game is... ok. The main theme song is definetly great, but the dragged on opening sequence and the credits playing it twice overwelcome it's stay. And if you take a long time finishing the first chapter, the instrumental theme will ring in your head for days. The soundtrack itself isn't bad, but the direction could use some work.Length: Very short. If you have a guide or just catch on to all the objectives fast, you'll easily be done within 4 or 5 hours. But I will say those hours are filled well, and nothing feels like it drags on too long (unless you get stuck or lost). When you do finish it, it won't feel like it was only 5 hours, but it won't feel long either. Story: The story isn't very deep, and whenever the plot tries to throw in a twist, it feels it's parodying itself. I won't spoil the twists or anything, but the laughs and unexpected moments are pretty much what you'll be expecting from it. It's cute, funny, colorful, but not deep.Price: My advice is to buy this one when a bundle is on sale. Anywhere around 5$ is well worth it, or higher if you really enjoy Daedalic games. I just really advise the bundle sales as they'll give you other titles to play as well for less money than any of them alone.Overall, I do reccomend this game if it's your cup of tea. It'll brighten your day, but not be one your games of the year. "

												This was an improvement from the previous game but not by much. At least there were some parts I could do on my own but I still used the walkthrough a bunch. Then again I'm not good at point and click adventure games due to my lack of patience. Still, its a good game although I wasn't crazy about the narrator or the fact I had a voiceless protagonist. Still, the story was good and they added some good elements even if you did go around murdering a lot of people for no reason. A decent game though I wouldn't pay much for it. I would say Deponia is a much better series. I wouldn't buy this game unless you love this genre or buy the daedelic bundle for all the games together.			"

												A very funny and kind of ghoulish game. It deals with a girl and she needs to solve problems that come her way. I find the game to be very refreshing and unique. Not to many games go in this direction and get the funny results that happen in this game. I did enjoy the story and the graphics are very colorful and have a very nice style to them. The music is also another plus for this game as its very unique and it sounds good. The game also has a narrator who gives you tips on what is going on. This is a breath of fresh air from a genre that I had thought had gotten very stale and dull. Bravo to this company for making a great game. I have not yet finished the game. The game is solid. Loads of fun so far.So I have finished the game.. When your getting close to the end.  Around the 4 hour mark or so. Save your game. The game has 3 different endings. The endings were ok. However I feel like the game lets itself down a little towards the end. The game has chapters in it. Chapter 3 was kind of weak compared to the first chapter that had me laughing and shaking my head. Riot Girl for the win... Haha.. Its a line one of the 2 popular girls says in the school. I still think its a good game let down by the writing towards the end. I am still glad I played it. I just with the other chapters in the story were are as strong as the first chapter.Just a heads up the achievments for this game are broken. I didnt know it had them till I looked them up. SO busted achivements.  I have finished the game.Their is a way to get the achievments to work. Via this steam link.

												After the cluttered, nonsensical, and unlikeable mess that was Deponia, I wouldn't have ever touched another game from this studio if it weren't for being in a Humble Bundle.  It would have been my loss, because this was everything Deponia wasn't: puzzles that made sense and had a logical progression, likeable characters, and a deep interesting story.  Of course, it suffers from a buggy UI, once that was so game-breaking I had to reload an earlier game because loading at that point didn't fix it.  And it had several localization oversights, reverting to German in the middle of conversations.  The mental-block mechanic could have had some potential, but ended up being simply annoying.  If you were ever halted by a mental block, you'd simply switch modes and try again.  Those are relatively minor issues, though.  My only real gripe is the rather abrubt and unsatisfying ending to what was otherwise a very well done story.  I reloaded and tried the other endings with no improvement.  It was still a worthwhile play for the price I paid, and about 10 hours (making it comparitively lengthy) time well spent.			"

I´d also pay more than 2€.I would highly recommend to play  edna´s breakout   before, otherwise you won´t understand some jokes about the past and won´t have all of the memories. Harvey´s new eyes  is in my *totally normal and not red glowing* eyes way easier than  edna´s breakout the first play-through took me approximately 10h and it wasn´t my intention to do it fast, while it took me days to play  edna´s breakout  (where you also have a lot more possibilities to interact with items, talk to potted plants and chairs, eat radioactive liquid with the taste of pineapple...)But i know that some of you prefer it to know what to do and finish the game fast.You still have to do some thinking and it even includes quick time events.I do highly recommend  both  games So buy them, start them, play them, ♥♥♥♥ing love them and begin to question yourself why you don´t have merchadise items and where to get an originally shaped HARVEY PLUSHIE ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  "

												I don't believe that the game is worth the full price, as I bought it on sale for only a dollar, but the game will provide you about 6-12 hours of good gameplay, I enjoyed this game and at first thought it was meant to be a child's game with the drawing style. About a couple minutes in I saw Mother Superior and realized it wasn't. I would recommend this game to those who are fine with dark humor. Loved the plot, but at times you might not know where to go since its not obvious. The achievements are extremely tedious though.Rate 8/10			"

												Pretty straightforward adventure. The solutions are mostly not too outlandish. But for my taste there is a little too much running around, so you can easily get lost and lose track of what you are supposed to be doing. But then again, I'm really no adventure pro, so if you like adventures you probably shouldn't be intimidated by that. For my personal taste there was just a tad too much talking. I know this sounds crazy, but I like my dialogues actually going somewhere, however, this game is mostly monologues. This has a reason, but it gets a bit annoying after a while when you know what a character has to say after 1 or 2 sentences, but then he continues for another 5 sentences, repeating useless garbage with different words.The story itself is pretty neat, the ending in particular. Overall I'd recommend it. Maybe 8 hours of play time at most, unless you are hopelessly stuck with some puzzle or other problem. The inventory combinations at least are pretty logical.			"

												Harvey's New Eyes was a really great game.Altough it took me very long to get started with the game, because I´m not really into point´n´click adventures, but this game surprised me a lot.The way the story is told and how Lilly, the main character, fits in it is just amazing. Very great humor and a lot of moments which made me smile.Don´t be tricked by the childish look of the game! It is quite simple, even though some of the puzzles are a bit challenging but you always get the option to skip it. But in my opinion the story is quite interesting and kept me playing so i finished this game in less sessions.gameplay 9/10 - since sometimes it wasn´t really obvious for me what I had to do next music 10/10 - I really enjoyed the music in the game. Its fits very well and felt athmosperic!atmosphere 10/10 - the voices of the character and the different art styles and personalities totally got me! This was one of           the main point for me why I enjoyed this game so muchprice 5/10 - I got lucky that I got this game in a bundle, otherwise I wouln´t have played it at all since 20€ are way to expensive in my opinion "

												The game it self is amazing and mindblowing although if you are the type who wants to get as many achievements as possible to make ur steam profile better then I don´t recommend this for you because the achievements for this game doesnt still work. Even though I have deleted my steam cloud for it and uninstalled. Then played through the entire game 6 times. It still didn´t work, but if you are just here for the game and not the achievements then you should get the game because of it´s humour and our daily language fits the game also the design looks innocent and childlike although it actually is deeper and has a darker meaning. I rate this game 8/10  and have a terrific day :)			"

Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is an interesting game with a few endemic flaws.Pros: Story, Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Performance, ValueHarvey's New Eyes follows the adventures of Lilli who must try and stop the evil Dr. Marcel's plans.  Despite Lilli's squeaks and the cutesy graphics, the game is not for children.  Controls are fairly crisp, but they should be for a point-and-click game.  Sometimes the cursor detection seems off, this may be related to the issues below.Performance is awful.  Downloading the demo is highly recommended to see whether your computer will run into the frequent freezes and slow load times.  A 2D point-and-click game is one step away from being a visual novel, so there are NO excuses.  Achievements took over a year to be patched and they still may or may not work for you.Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes has all the endemic qualities of a Daedalic game, whether or not that is good is up to you.6/10			"

Harvey's New Eyes is easily the best Daedalic title I've played.  Yes, it suffers from the usual problem of there occasionally being times when it's not at all clear what you're supposed to do to proceed, but who plays point-and-clicks for the gameplay?  The narration is top-notch, and the dark humor and juxtaposition of a macabre story with an inanely cartoonish presentation are sublime.			"

												I really liked the point & click game Fran Bow, however this one I could barely make it through the opening credits. First off, opening credits? Because I soo love minutes on end of unskippable credits at the beginning of a game. The dialogues are truly cringy, and the same tune plays in the background on an unending loop. I finally had to turn it on mute... that is when the game became somewhat enjoyable. Unfortunately, that didn't last long and after trying to like this game for an hour, I just can't. I actually fell asleep at one point because of how badly this game lacks exciting elements. That said, it is a point & click, and only the second point & click I've ever tried.This is just not my kind of game. Cringy dialogue and boring tune aside, its not all bad. Just doesn't bring much to the table for me. It's a laid back, mellow point and click that is dialogue-driven. Decent art style, decent puzzles, and overall a decent point and click. Like I said, just not for me.			"

												I got stuck in a coding wall at the end of the game. You're supposed to add truth serum to a teacup, but if you fill it with tea before you add the serum to the tea, you're screwed. You can't drop the cup, or get another, there is no way to beat the game. You have to start over from a previous save, of which I had none because I played the game in one sitting.Honestly, while the puzzles are decent, and even cerebral in a few cases, the overall plot is impossible to take at all seriously, even as a joke. No-one notices the horrible murders the main character commits, they happen to everyone, and the cartoony filter over it all would be neat if only the other characters would react to all the blood and guts THEY should be able to see. Oh, and the narrator is INSUFFERABLE. Truly, the dialog is a clunky mess.			"

												By the time of the third act (and, arguably, the second) the great concept has fallen to the wayside and even the very charming art and sound design are starting to wear thin. Worse, it starts to gain things that are death knells for any good adventure game - bizarre, tedious puzzles and characters that are boring if not completely unlikable.The game's great sense of humor in its genuinely clever first act means that it's still worth your time, so this is still a recommendation - but it's a tentative one, and it's flaws are enough that you should consider them before you make a purchase.

												This is a 2D Point & Click adventure game developed by Daedelic who also did the well-known Deponia series.You play as Lilli, a sweet young convent school girl with a best friend called Edna and a stuffed toy rabbit called Harvey. The game follows Lilli's adventures on her many quests to help (and rescue) Edna. Alas, despite her best intentions, she leaves a swathe of violent death and destruction in her wake which is doused in neon pink paint by potato-shaped gnomes and described in a running commentary by a relaxed, cheerful narrator. Many a chuckle is had at Lilli's unfortunate incidents.Overall GameplayDaedelic titles are undoubtedly the Gold Standard of Point & Clickers and this is no exception. It's like experiencing a full-length interactive Hollywood blockbuster in cartoon form. Everything about it oozes professional quality from every pore.Graphics: the cartoons are beautifully drawn, as good if not better than the ones on TV although they don't have full movement, not even in the cutscenes. This didn't bother me at all and doesn't take anything away from the immersion. The only minor complaint I have is that the screen resolution only goes to 1920x1080 so I had black bars on my 1920x1200 screen.Music: an accordion plays a fantastic, melancholy theme tune in the background often but not constantly. Individual scenes have their own tunes and sounds to fit the mood and storyline. All sounds are highly polished and a treat to the ears. I never once considered switching to my own music.Voice acting: there are so many characters in the game - I counted 20 voice actors in the credits!! - and every one of them has something interesting to say. It's possible to skip all dialogs with a mouse click but I never once felt tempted to do that, unless I'd already heard it before. I can't say that about any other game I've ever played. Lilli herself never utters a word (except in one of the endings!) she just makes little squeaks and sighs in response to the characters she's talking to, which all adds to her naive, innocent appearance.Storyline: the dark humour and exciting chain of events really captivated me and the character development rivals most of the real movies I've seen lately. Citing a Rolf Harris concert as a safe place for young girls to go is an example of the near-the-knuckle humour that has resulted in some of the negative reviews, so you need to be aware of what you're getting into before buying. This is definitely not a game for kids despite its friendly-looking cartoon graphics.Mini GamesThere are puzzles throughout the game. Puzzlers are my favourite genre. I've played many and consider myself quite good at them. The puzzles in this game are HARD logic and riddle tasks. Thankfully you're not forced to play any of them, they all have Skip options and I'm not ashamed to admit that I skipped half of them. I'll probably go back later and do them for the achievements though.The Menace Of The GuideMost of the time I generally had a good idea what to do next by following the characters' dialogs, but there were so many areas and items to click that I inevitably found myself at a dead end sometimes, unable to find a new thing to click to progress the story. Some of the required actions are just bizarre, for example who would think to use a credit card on a tin opener? It's also easy to find yourself trying to complete a particular task blissfully unaware that it's impossible if you've failed to properly complete a previous one. At the time I often thought I'd run into a glitch but it always turned out to be my own stupidity.At these junctures, with the narrator's sarcastic comments about my ineptitude ringing in my ears, I had to consult a guide to get through the blockage. The trouble is, once I'd sampled the guide I found it quite ""more-ish"". Here's a demonstration of my relationship with the guide for this game:

While in the grip of The Guide I found myself blindly following the instructions without paying enough attention to the blossoming storyline and cutscenes, depriving myself of the very reason I was playing.If you buy this game I urge you not to fall into the same trap that I did.PerformanceSeveral months earlier I tried the demo version. It was full of glitches and I soon ended up permanently trapped inside the cellar stove, unable to play any further. I was worried that the full version might be the same since it starts with exactly the same content as the demo, but I'm happy to report that it runs smoothly and I found not a single glitch throughout the entire game - including the stove glitch which I double-checked! I played it mostly on Linux but copied my save file over to play on Windows a couple of times.ValueYou might be thinking twice about spending so much on a Point & Click game but rest assured it's well worth it, even at full price, as long as you enjoy dark humour. It took me only 14 hours due to my horrific Guide addiction but would have taken longer under normal circumstances. There's also replay value to chase achievements.Don't make the mistake of comparing the price of this against other P&C games, this is the Rolls Royce of Clickers.Steam8 trading cards. 29 achievements, most of which need to be specifically chased and don't drop during normal gameplay. It uses the Steam cloud but strangely doesn't sync between different platforms so you have to manually copy save files over in those cases. Makes the cloud support a bit pointless if you ask me, but never mind.VerdictFabulous. Loved every minute.Shibuya is cool!This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												First of all, I have to admit that I bought the entire Daedalic bundle when it was on sale, which contained The Night Of The Rabbit, Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, Deponia and The Whispered World, but all of these almost just for The Night Of The Rabbit which normally costs 20 euros and on sale the bundle was only 5, so i got The Night Of The Rabbit on a very good price and a few other games ""free of charge"". Furthermore, I informed myself about the games contained in the bundle and they seemed to be quite good on the first sight.But ""Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes"" wasn't as good as I expected...When I first saw the game's trailer, the character's strange faces (i mean mouth less faces) gave me a feeling that something was wrong about the game.So I launched the game. The first task didn't look hard to complete (gathering leaves) but Mother Superior appeared to be a very creepy person. In fact, all the characters were built in a ghoulish way. Indeed, their mouth didn't appear just when they were speaking and their clothes had dark colours.The soundtrack was good, but sometimes the sound of a grimly gothic organ burst into the air which scared the sh*t out of me… so brutal.The game isn't funny to play because, to reach her objectives, Lilli transforms into a walking disaster meaning she doesn't care about the collateral damage she does.Well, I passed over all these things. I played the game hoping the end would be a happy one, but it wasn't like that.  At the end of the game I had to choose between three actions: Set the knife aside and begin the therapy, so Dr. Marcel wins, Stab Dr. Marcel, so congratulations, you are a maniac who killed a man in a wheelchair or To Contradict so Lilli will scream like Mother Superior and all the happy feelings disappear. All these three different endings are quite disappointing because whatever you should choose you should still have a chance of a happy ending. Maybe I didn't understand the whole game… but i know it left me with awful memories.4/10			"

												I've played quite a few point and click adventure games over the years, so I thought I'd give this one a try; being as it was a little different than those I had played before. The overall point and click mechanics were pretty good, and the overall appearance of the game seemed to create an atomosphere that fit well with how the developers wanted to drive the story. However, the longer I played the game, the more tiresome I grew with some of the crude humor and the irritating rabbit. Not to mention that I did encounter some technical gliches along the way that were frustrating, including one that prevented Steam achievements from being recorded. This game just didn't live up to my expectations.			"

												This is #2 so if you havent played the first one look into it. Fun to figure out what works with what. Sometimes things that you are trying or doing make no sense, however if they did, this game would be very short. If you like looking for a balloon wrench that you use to remove a real metal bolt, then this game is for you! The story is one of the major strengths of this game. Its interesting and fun. Characters from the first game make return appearances. Mini games abound in this sequel. Thumbs up for this point and click puzzle adventure.			"

Harvey's New Eyes is a refreshingly unconventional but disappointingly uneven puzzle adventure that oscillates between strikingly creative and simply boring.Drenched in irony, its absurd and dark humour is often spot on and easily one of the game's best feature, if only also at times too obvious. A properly cast narrator delivers most lines and almost feels like the main character in lieu of a fully detailed protagonist.It touches on slightly disturbing subjects in a facetious manner, jovially poking fun at anything and everything. However, the overall story and tone are a lot more sinister than the kiddy graphics would let you believe, with a lot of implied but not graphic violence.Unfortunately, the game is off to a slow start during most of the first chapter, beginning with a very long intro where absolutely nothing happens. For the first few hours, the player must endure some completely detestable characters, a few with insupportable voices (Doris!), and mundane puzzles with inexplicably cheap UI.An important game changer occurs about halfway through and only then does the game really get interesting, with the addition of an innovative concept that enforces restrictions on Lilli's behaviour. The player must then visit alternate realities to banish demons and regain free will over these mental blocks.A very good soundtrack is wasted by the repetitiveness of the one song replaying constantly within each major area, accompanied by poor sound effects and improper timing in between dialogues that cause some lines to feel delivered in a rush.Minimal animations do little to add life to the washed out hand-drawn backgrounds. Despite some good scenes, it's difficult to fully appreciate this unaccomplished art direction.""It was hard to tell, but Lilli was actually speechless.""Strangely, the game is not chiefly about Edna or Harvey and is clearly not meant as a direct sequel to The Breakout*, although it does make innumerable references to it and is set in the same world. Edna is at best a recurring secondary character, while Harvey plays an increasingly significant role later on.Instead, the game centers around Lilli, a peculiarly mute schoolgirl with a comically growing list of issues. She never speaks a word, which is sort of endearing initially and is key to the overall narrative, but also gets repetitive.The game does have a few interesting puzzles of varying levels of difficulty. I especially appreciated how dialogues give the player exactly the right guidance, sometimes outright laying out solutions in a subtle and funny way.I finally began to warm up to the game during chapter 2 (out of 3), which brings a lot more diversity with its dream-like variations of the real world, but there were too many things I disliked to fully recommend it.*Note that I haven't played the first game in the series.

												Excellent writing, great art, and a lot of fun, but for the love of all things pixellated: TEST YOUR DAMN GAME! So many bugs, including random german dialogue. Ended up chucking it out when it got permanently (incurably) stuck on the loading screen for the final boss battle, a bug which has existed since the first version. *slow clap* It went from being a game I absolutely loved to one of life's greatest frustrations in seconds.

												I really wanted to like this game.  After all, it was made by Deadelic, the makers of Anna's Quest!It's gotta be good ... right?The artistic style is good.The voice acting is OK.The story is, um, what?The ... wait, who am I?  What is my motivation?The characters are ... Gah, these people are all annoying, and not even funny, or even loveable to hate.Now I didn't even progress to the mystery (or whatever) of the convent.As soon as I talked to the old history guy hanging from his suspender straps, I grumbled.WTF?!?Coconuts and hamsters and memories and SAT puzzles bla bla bla.Why bother continuing - the characters are already set in place, you've just got to jugglesome items around and bla bla bla until the things are happy.  It's classic point andclick adventure grinding at its worst.I hope & assume the characters & story develop from here, but this beginning is so bad, I don't care.Let me compare this game (EHHNE) to the last two point & click adventure games I played(and finished, very happily) : Day of the Tentacle (DOTT, 1993) and Anna's Quest (AQ).Voices:EHHNE: Your character says ""uh uh"" or ""umm hmm"".  Cute.  The voices of other charactersare fine.  The standard response to actions is from a narrator, who gets annoying reallyquickly, not because the voice acting is bad, but because it's wholly inappropriate toexpect a narrator to work in every situation.Say I want to interact with a tree, and instead of your character saying ""heck, I dunnowhat to do with this tree"", you get the narrator saying something like ""Your characterwanted to interact with the tree, but the tree didn't need to be interacted with, becausebla bla bla"".  It just serves to constantly remind you that you're playing a game, asopposed to immersing you in the game by hearing _your_ character's voice in _their_situation.AQ: Amazing voice acting.  Even if Anna can sound a little nasal sometimes, you can alwaysrelate.DOTT: Amazing voice acting.  Even if they all sound constipated.Story:EHHNE: You're in a convent.... There are some other people.  You're socially awkward.You've got to do some stuff, cuz hopefully doing stuff will make stuff more interesting.Oh, some stuff happens, you're kind of dark behind your cute facade, wow, that's so novel ...yawn.  Stuff.AQ: You're trapped in a witches house.  The witch has plans for you.  You havesuperpowers.  You must save your grandpa.  You meet a teddy bear.  You must help the teddybear.  You've got ____ to do!DOTT: An evil tentacle makes a move to take over the world.  Three friends mustcollaborate in the past, present and future to thwart the evil tentacles plans of worlddomination.  Hell yea!Art/graphics:EHHNE: hi-res cell shading / small characters / cute-centric/ lots of irrelevantforeground / background graphics / minimal animationAQ: hi-res cell shading / character dominated / beautiful detailed backgrounds clearlydistinguished from foreground & navigable spaceDOTT: cartoony, pixel animation / distorted scale / perspective / saturated colors / mostof the screen is at the scale of the character (not too much foreground / background)			"

												Before reading further into this review, I'm just going to point out that I'm not a big fan of point and click games for the most part so this review is going to be a bit biased against point and clicks. Without further delay, Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a point and click game that focuses on telling a story (as most point and clicks do). The game itself is simple but sometimes it was annoying to get genuinely stuck without knowing what to do next. Through brute force, I was always able to find the next thing to do but sometimes it really took some time. In my honest opinion, the story was rather lame and I think this was meant for a much younger audience (5-10 year olds perhaps?). However, the voice acting was done very well and that is something that the game exceeded most other point and clicks on. Overall, I'm not a fan of point and clicks so I cannot recommend this game; but if you are a fan of point and clicks, this game should be on your watch list.Rating: 6.3/10Recommend: Under $2.49			"

												[Deutsch unter]This was a big disappointment. Edna & Harvey: The Breakout is one of the best and funniest adventures i have ever played, and i played the Deponia trilogy soon afterwards on the strength of it, saving this one for last because i assumed it would hit the same heights as the original Edna. Instead it's a fairly boring adventure that has one joke centered around a main character whose whole life is narrated to her, and after the first punchline it already gets old. The puzzles are relatively straightforward, which was a nice change, but the story just doesn't measure up. It starts to pick up when Harvey makes a reappearance, but overall it just doesn't have the same soul or humor of either Edna or Deponia, nor the great pacing of A New Beginning. Not worth the time.Echt ne Entäuschung. Ich fand ""Edna bricht aus"" einer der tollste und lustigste Abenteurn aller Zeiten, und Deponia war ja auch geil, aber dieses ist voll langweilig. Es gibt viele Scheißminigames, die glücklicherweise du überspringen kannst, aber pff. Es gibt tatsächlich nur einen guten Witz, und das ist die Spaltung zwischen Erzähler und Hauptcharakter, aber sonst noch wenig zu empfehlen. Schön ist das du Harvey wieder sehen kannst, und auch die Locations aus dem alten Spiel, aber leider insgesamt find ich es nicht wirklich die Zeit wert. Auch Entwicklerkommentar fehlt :-(			"

												I usually like point-and-click games. This one is annoying for a number of reasons:- the No Action For This Combo dialogues are way too long.- some actions are required a number of times before desired effect - for example I needed to activate the pump at least twice before filling the well. - it is somewhat buggy and a number of dialogue lines flicker past, for example when Mother Superior left the cafeteria or when Garret asked Lilly to follow him. - achievements aren't working.- I undestand comedy value of killing hated characters, but was leaving a hanged body necessary?I got this as part of the Humble Bundle, but it definitely is NOT worth paying the full 16 quid!EDIT: after having completed the game, I have few more bugbears to add- when I press Escape, I expect to be transported to game's main menu. I found that if I want to exit the game I need to Alt+F4 or Alt-Tab- the game glitched on the rabit with spinny background when trying to hypnotise Mother Superior. TWICE. It needed Alt+Tab and quitting the game from the Start Menu to reset!- I waited throughout the credits. You have at least 40 minions employed to do Quality Assurance. Whatever currency you paid them in, they didn't do their job very well!			"

												I've played ""Edna & Harvey: The Breakout"" shortly before this part and both are really funny. The story is great, the puzzles/minigames are very good and not too hard.The whole story starts with ""Breakout"" where you play as Edna and you are in a nuthouse with no memory what happens and why you are here. You only friend is your plush bunny Harvey with whom you can talk.In this part ""Harvey new eyes"" you play as Lilli, a young girl living in a orphanage with her best friend Edna. Almost the whole game you try to do everything right but everything ends up in a desaster with innocent victims. But don't think this game is bloody and brutal.. nope, sweet little gnomes will paint bloody textures with nice pink color so your child's welfare will not compromised. :') And Lilli will not even notice accidents anyway...The whole game is told by a storyteller which sometimes can help you and sometimes just disturbing your actions with his comments.Great P&C Adventure with many good jokes, eastereggs and more.For both parts: 9/10			"

												The achievements did not unlock for me while I played through the whole game. In the game forum there are tons of tweaks to do so that it will work properly. It is not my job to tweak my pc for a game to work correctly. It is the devs job to tweak their game so their game works properly on my pc. Just like diablo 3 and guild wars 2 work fine without me tweaking anything.Some of the things my character said like she thinks the cross should be hung upside down upset me. If you want to worship the devil and have upside down crosses that is you, not me so don't put your devil worship crap in a game. The only reason I got this game is because it was on sell. If I knew then what I know now, I would not have bought the game. Who would have thought a kiddie game would have a girl saying she wants the cross hung upside down, not me?And then on the cool this game clowns on the last supper by saying everybody is fighting for the last cookie. Come on man really. Excuse me, but Jesus died for us and went through hell for us literally. The thanks HE gets for that is you want to clown on the last supper.			"

												**Please scroll down for UPDATE EDIT 26.06.2015**I would've loved to have given this a thumb's up, but I can't and I won't...I really like the oddity of the story, as much as I got into it (a couple hours gameplay on 1st and 2nd install before I realised the achievements were broken)...the artwork is whimsical, the music is nice. There's a kind of twistedness to it, to Lilly's character that makes it disturbingly sweet. And unlike some others who have played this, I like the puzzles and the narrator's babble.However, as this is a review for the game bought on Steam, it fails. I scoured the internet and countless forums for help on fixing the 'broken' achievement problem, tiny bugs - I've tried everything that I found, but all to no avail. Some of the fixes, well, the game simply wouldn't let me even try them out...Some have said disable Steam Cloud, I did.. some have said delete save games and uninstall, reinstall, I did - nothing. One poster even said turning off Subtitles and exiting/ restarting did the trick for them - must be nice for them because when I try this, the main menu freezes forcing me to hard shut the game down every time - and guess what? The **** Subtitles option is always checked (even the ONE time I managed to exit the game properly and come back in, the Subtitles were activated). After vainly trying this, my 3rd time, I have decided to shelve it indefinitely on my Steam shelf and let it collect dust. Some may think it silly to not play a game simply because the achievements aren't working, but we all have our quirks. Not to mention, the main menu settings have some serious issues with being touched, freezing up the game in protest - this alone is severely annoying for me. But the main reason I will not recommend E&H:HNE is because during my fruitless search for solutions, I discovered that Deadalic are not very catering to their paying public. Many places claimed the devs had stopped supporting some of their games on Steam altogether - I dunno, whatever that drama may be doesn't interest me so much. What I do know is that the achievement issue spans back more than two years. I received this game as a gift not even a month ago, and the problems are still present - despite some Spring-ish update only this year they claimed fixed this problem.Regardless, I will not buy Deponia now because of this experience, and probably nothing else Daedalic spins out. I have Journey of a Roach due to Koboldgames being on board - as things are going all right with that game, I suspect Daedalic mainly stuck to the publishing side of things - yay...It is an exceedingly rare thing for me to have a bad experience with a game - when it happens, I'm unforgiving...-1/10**UPDATE EDIT 26.06.2015**So, I got a new pc and have been in the process of re-downloading many games to try it out. Scanning my library, my eyes were caught by Edna & Harvey - this game has always been a bit of a constant fingernail scratch on the back of my neck... annoying and teasing. I was attracted to the story, art and gameplay from the start - but the hoop-jumping to find answers and the devs', largely, disinterest in taking part in Steam forums for their games and their standoffish attitude toward their playerbase was a turn-off. I did some searching again and found 


How to Get the achievements after the new patch (14/02/2014) 
A Guide for Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes
By: LeNyn

			Hello people, this is a simple guide about how to get the achievements after the new fix patch , (14/02/2014), for those who don't know yet, many players have been like a year with this game having broken achievements,...		


 which cures the Steam achievement issues. I would like to add that I did try something along these lines the last time I gave it a chance but it did not work (perhaps there were some remnants of the game left after numerous uninstall-/ re-installments to try to fix the problem and as this is a new pc...). So, I installed it, made sure Steam Cloud was off, ran it, chose English language, saw my version was 1.3.4.390, exited the game, rechecked to verify that Steam Cloud was still unselected, restarted the game, saw my version was now showing v. 2.0.4.0395, began a game and the achievements have been rolling in.The game on its own has always been about a 9/10 for me, but I won't alter my recommendation because my feelings about Daedalic haven't changed. The jury's still out on if I'll ever purchase another game developed by them - it's the principal of a thing, it's principalities ;-)Look at the Edna & Harvey Steam forum... there are numerous broken achievement posts on the first page alone, THIS MONTH - why can't the devs sticky the link above and be done with it? It's crazy. And for any gamers who think other gamers throwing a stink about broken achievements are silly or whiney: Steam is an app for gamers with incentives to thoroughly explore most games and obtain rewards for doing so via achievements and perfect game stats - this is a game in and of itself. This review was and remains for Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes, the STEAM version.			"

												I hated the art style, the puzzles, the characters and the awful attempts at humour. The game tries too hard at every single dialogue line to make a joke and that gets very embarrassing.Until now I liked most of Deadalic games, but this one just doesn’t cut it. It made me stop playing point and click adventures for a while. "

												Better than the first Edna & Harvey, but still not worth playing. Graphics, story and voice narration are okay. Puzzle solutions are odd in some cases. I did finish it, so I guess it wasn't that bad. I would recommend the Deponia series and the Dark Eye over either of the Edna & Harvey games.			"

												this has to be the BEST point-and-click adventure game i have played thus far.  despite it's childish presentation, Harvey's New Eyes manages to create an expirience of pure comedy and tragedy.  Despite being a sequel to the first game, its able to keep everything in order, meaning even if you don't get the relation or references to the first game it doesn't truly damage the experience.  And no matter what happens, you will find you can never hate your character, Lilli, because she seems so lovable and innocent, even when she does thing that make her seem...dislikable.  The narrarator's voice perfectly fits anything the game offers and retains a comedy style that is simple but amused me on many levels,  all the while showing small bits of just how dark the story really is.  How dark IS the story, you ask?  Play it and find out.			"

												Harvey's New Eyes was a casual (almost hesitant) purchase. However, it proved to be a pleasant surprise.The narration at first draws you into a storybook tale about the protagonist, Lilli, and sets the mood for what seems to be a rather childish and cliché story. As you continue, the dialog and narration slowly become darker, yet the game never loses its humourous touch. It's entertaining and engaging in the most unexpected way possible. The dark humour, in my opinion, is what sets this point-and-click apart from others. On occasion, the game has potential for glitching (for example, my inventory items would sometimes appear to be 'floating' when I opened the tab), and the game starts out slow and pleasant at first, but the story progresses almost a little too quickly for my taste toward the end.Overall, though, I'd recommend this to any point-and-click fanatic who's looking for something a little different. The mature/immature atmospheric blend may be bewildering at first, but in the end, it's entertainment that's well worth your time.			"

												Very few sequels are better than their original game.  But frankly I found this game an improvement on the original. The features are more refined and simplified.  I also enjoy the option of reading english subtitles while listening to the original language audio.  This game is more stable than the previous game and has very few game breaking glitches.  I enjoyed the puzzles they were reasonably challenging but not frustrating.  The Dark Humor was shocking, and made more disturbing with the ""censoring"" which let your imagination run wild as to the gruesome nature of the consequences of your actions or inactions.  The ending/? ..... was enjoyable.  I have had difficulty with  activating acheivements.  If your into point and click adventure games this one is worth your time to play.			"

												A serviceable game, but sometimes the writers thought that their writing was way wittier than it actually was.Maybe I'm just tainted by the shiny new episodic adventure games that have been rolling out, but the game felt like it could easily have been broken into three, and been much better for it. While I listened to all of the vocals in the first chapter, I really started clicking through it quickly as I realized that this was a 6-7 hour game... not a 2-3 hour game like I was expecting.Overall the puzzles were pretty good, although there were a few dumb ones, and a couple of logic puzzles that I just wasn't in the mood for. And the setting was fun, as was the premise of the whole game. Also - I'm glad that I stuck around for the ending.... really neat choice there.			"

												Harvey's new Eyes is a game, that isn't good because of it's gameplay, but rather it's feeling.It's just a point-and-click adventure, so there isn't much to say about that. You just walk through different rooms and solve a whole bunch of Puzzles.The more interesting thing is it's unique humor and Story. The whole story seemed like a standard kid story first, but the more i played it, the more I was wondering about why this game was rated that low. The humor is very funny (at least in my opinion) and the only parts which are not funny in this game are when you are in progress of solving things.Without making to much spoilers, I recommend it for everyone who likes puzzle games or point-and-click adventures.

												Well this is a perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover. Usually I'm a huge graphic/visual snob, but when I saw that Daedalic had put forth this quirky and let's be honest, cheap looking game, I did a double take. I bought the game on sale and ladies and gentleman... This game is kickass. The story, the characters, the plot, and the unique game play was all FREAKIN AMAZING, FUNNY, AND ORIGINAL. The whole game embodies the term ""dark comedy"". Yes it's a point and click, but a point and click where you playfully murder bad children? The best part is halfway through the game, you think it's just going to continue being a point and click + murders + a few puzzles, but then it changes! Bottom line: if you can look past the bad graphics and occasional game glitch (they speak german for like 2 seconds), Edna and Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a game that you will love to death. (Side note: there is a prequel that I haven't even played yet, but I still loved and understood the plot in this game)			"

												An overall enjoyable game and one I would recommend.The animations can be a bit simple at times but it is easy to overlook. The visual style is nice and fits in with the cartoonish humour and story although it does get quite dark at several points throughout, so whilst it looks like it would be child friendly you probably wouldn't want a young child to play the game.The puzzles are pretty good compared to other adventure games, they aren't randomly cryptic but aren't always simple either; and the minigames are refreshing but you can skip them if you can't be bothered and just want to progress.

												Beautiful point and click game. Wonderful story and great characters ride along on fun mechanics. The voice acting is superb and ending is wonderful. I have very few complaints about this game, mostly conserning progress. It can be hard to know what to do next. That being said, the game isn't very hard, you'll know what you need to do, just not how to do it. Sometimes things aren't quite clear enough. Other than that, this game is worth more than one playthrough just so you can catch things you may have missed the first time round. I highly recommend this game if you like point and click or puzzle games.			"

												As a fan of the original Edna And Harvey: The Breakout, I was really looking forward to playing the new game. I can tell you that I was not disappointed. The humour, quirky characters, vibrant art style and catchy music that made the first game such a delight are all back in spades.If you've played the Deponia series, you have probably already played this game. If not, I don't know what's stopping you! Also, if you're a fan of games like Monkey Island, I recommend this game. If you get frustrated easily, this may not be the game for you, as there were a few times where I had to explore and experiment before I could continue. But the objectives from section to section were usually well sign posted, and I hardly ever felt lost and unsure about what I was supposed to do, which leaves the emphasis on the puzzles.If you're wondering where this fits in with the original game (something I was unsure about when I started playing), it does indeed take place after The Breakout. However, Edna is really a support character in this game, which focusses on a new character, Edna's friend Lili. While it's fun to see these new characters interacting with old favourites (Droggeljug!), it's also good to see new locations added. I would definitely recommend playing the first game before picking this one up, however this game can easily be played without the knowledge of the first game - some of the characters make references to the actions of the first game, and it just makes these references easier to get if you've played the first game. This game feels like it's a bit longer than the first game. There are three sections to the game, with the first taking up about half the game. In fact, I thought the first section was the entirety of the game, and was pleasantly surprised when the second chapter started!My main gripe about that game would be that it's a bit disappointing that you can't get it on iPad. I played the original on my iPad and the point and click adventure genre is a great way to pass the time on the way to work. Also the controls are quite good, and I find myself pressing the Spacebar in other adventure games hoping to see all the hotspots I can click before having to remind myself that not all adventure games are built this intuitively!All in all, I enjoyed this game a lot. Not perhaps a classic that will live throughout the ages like the Money Island series, it's still interesting and quirky enough to bring a smile to my face. If you consider yourself a point and click adventure game connoisseur, you need to give the Edna and Harvey series a try. I really hope there's an Edna And Harvey 3!			"

The first Edna & Harvey game was in my opinion one of the best recent point & click adventure games. Harvey's new eyes unfortunately doesn't share all of the best aspects of the first game. In particular puzzles are much easier and less creative and too easy for my taste and it doesn't have unique responses to almost every action you might attempt as the first game did.What it does share with the first game is the dark humour and the appealing and very apropriate cartoon visuals. This is the main strength of the game, the darkly humorous story. Lily is a great main character, at the same time adorable and scary. The appeal of the story comes to a large part from the contrast between Lily's innocent appearance and the disastrous consequences of her actions. The general crazyness inherent in the details of the game world, e.g. there is a meat-eating plant in mother superiors office and there is a hamster equipped with night vision goggles who appears more than once to steal Lily's things, also helps keep the game entertaining as does the sarcastic narration. The unique style of the graphics are entirely appropriate and I don't think the game would have worked nearly as well with more ""serious"" graphics.Sound effects are adequate but no more than that and voice acting is average. The music is fairly good but not exceptional.All in all this is a very entertaining adventure game, although too easy for experience players and lacking the extreme attention to detail of the first Edna & Harvey game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure games and dark humour.			"

												Tons of bugs and broken mechanics, bad attempt at humour, too long pointless lines that provide no help whatsoever. On the positive note, you play as an adorable little Satan's spawn that murders people. Sadly, not even that can make up for all the bad stuff.			"

												It’s morbid, dark, and cynical. Nearly anything you do will be downplayed and rendered meaningless, again and again and again. Everyone is despicable. You murder kids, while feigning ignornace. Whether that’s a pro or a con is up to you, but it’s not really my thing.This game has a slow start, but gets better with each chapter. It becomes interesting once you start chasing your demons and really gets going once you enter the final chapter. Too bad the end comes out of nowhere and just pulls the plug.The puzzles and problem solving is for the most part straightforward, if you’re a bit flexible in how you associate things. The only nonsensical problem - to me - was the colorblind pizza thing. The clue here is to forget the whole colorblindness nonsense and see it as a color matching puzzle.			"

												Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a point and click adventure by German adventure game powerhouse Daedalic Entertainment and is by far one of their best. The art style and plot ooze atmposphere which is complemented by excellent music and narration, especially in the original German language.  The puzzles are all of excellent difficulty and should appeal to fans of traditional point and click games. This is no Telltale game, that's for sure. The plot is an excellent meld of sarcasm and the macabre and will have you lauhging throughout. If you like adventure games it gets a fullhearted reccomendation and even if you haven't played that many this is probably one of the better ones to get started with.			"

												A pretty sick and twisted adventure game that's only palatable due to the cartoony graphics and characters/narrator.

												I REALLY enjoyed this game. Even though i hadn't played 'edna and harvey: the breakout', it was still easy to follow the storyline. The game takes you to a monastry where you meet a little girl called Lilly, who despite wanting to do everything right, has no friends and mother superior absolutely hates her.. She seems to have only one friend, called Edna. But one day a man called dr. Marcel comes to take her away and you have to protect her. But not before finishing al the chores you have to do for mother superior. But grave mistakes can be made with the best intentions. The game has a dark humour to it that you just have to love. If you are the type that can't handle that, you won't enjoy it, but if you like weird/sarcastic/cynical humour, you definitely have the right game!The characters in the game are sometimes a little one-dimensional, but some are just so weird that you quickly focus on them instead. The gameplay is simple and the story is quite straight-forward, though you can explore a lot and I advise you to do so. Especially some conversations are hilarious and worth listening to. The narrator of your story is quite the sarcastic basterd at times, which is a lot of fun!The only thing that bothered me was the ending, though I won't tell you anything about it. And there are a lot of: ''what the hell am i supposed to do now!?'' moments in the game. You really have to keep exploring all the options. Though it gave me a lot of frustration. So in short: a challenging game with a lot of dark humour and funny characters. I definitely recommend it!  "

												Lily is without a doubt one of the most awesome characters ever. She looks innocent, she barely speaks, sports a cute bow on her head and is a raging psychopath on the inside. What's there not to love about her? The innocently evil style about the character plays out so brilliantly throughout the story.I thought the story of the game was interesting as it has such a weird concept. It's not really something you can predict along the way and it also has multiple endings depending on what you choose. There are many moments where things are totally whack, but still in a good way. Especially in the second part of the game where you have to unlock certains traits for Lily, doing so by making her face some really weird situations. Most of the characters throughout the game, even those that don't have a lot of screentime, have very good and detailed personalities. It makes it fun to interact with them as they all treat Lily individually. It also adds to making Lilys character feel real. I didn't like the the artstyle of the game. I guess it's a matter of personal taste. Everything looks sloppily drawn and some characters just look weird when they talk. I am glad there was an option to skip out on the mini game puzzles in the game. I don't think I had the patience to sit through a single one of them. Most of them relied on being able to remember things and it's difficult for me having high functioning autism. I thought the voice acting was quite good (especially for a Deadelic game). I can't recall any actor that was outstanding, but there also wasn't anyone that was terrible. The only problem with the voice-acting is the narrator that just has too much dialogue when Lily uses items. As these kind of games require a lot of trial and error, hearing 4 lines of dialogue for one single click gets tedious. Sometimes when you do things wrong, other characters will also provide a lenghty dialogue due to it. There are some bugs in the games, such as the achievements are at the time not working at all. Sometimes the inventory would lock and refuse to open, but simply walking to another room or reloading helped fix the problem.Overall I enjoyed this game. It has a good sense of humor, great character interaction and there is also a sense of deep character development depending on how you chose to end the game.			"

The visual style is nice and fits in with the cartoonish humour and story although it does get quite dark at several points throughout, so whilst it looks like it would be child friendly you probably wouldn't want a young child to play the game.The puzzles are pretty good compared to other adventure games, they aren't randomly cryptic but aren't always simple either; and the minigames are refreshing but you can skip them if you can't be bothered and just want to progress.

The first Edna & Harvey game was in my opinion one of the best recent point & click adventure games. Harvey's new eyes unfortunately doesn't share all of the best aspects of the first game. In particular puzzles are much easier and less creative and too easy for my taste and it doesn't have unique responses to almost every action you might attempt as the first game did.What it does share with the first game is the dark humour and the appealing and very apropriate cartoon visuals. This is the main strength of the game, the darkly humorous story. Lily is a great main character, at the same time adorable and scary. The appeal of the story comes to a large part from the contrast between Lily's innocent appearance and the disastrous consequences of her actions. The general crazyness inherent in the details of the game world, e.g. there is a meat-eating plant in mother superiors office and there is a hamster equipped with night vision goggles who appears more than once to steal Lily's things, also helps keep the game entertaining as does the sarcastic narration. The unique style of the graphics are entirely appropriate and I don't think the game would have worked nearly as well with more ""serious"" graphics.Sound effects are adequate but no more than that and voice acting is average. The music is fairly good but not exceptional.All in all this is a very entertaining adventure game, although too easy for experience players and lacking the extreme attention to detail of the first Edna & Harvey game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure games and dark humour.			"

												Beautiful point and click game. Wonderful story and great characters ride along on fun mechanics. The voice acting is superb and ending is wonderful. I have very few complaints about this game, mostly conserning progress. It can be hard to know what to do next. That being said, the game isn't very hard, you'll know what you need to do, just not how to do it. Sometimes things aren't quite clear enough. Other than that, this game is worth more than one playthrough just so you can catch things you may have missed the first time round. I highly recommend this game if you like point and click or puzzle games.			"

												This game may look like a children's cartoon: it's certainly not.  The sense of humour is quite dark, at least the colour of lye already used to dissolve a few bodies.  However, if you do have a sense of humour that does tend towards the darker, twisted end of things, this game is pretty hilarious.  Also, I found the puzzles quite enjoyable.  I also particularly enjoyed one of the endings of this game.  I'd love to play this game again with a German friend to know if the jokes work even better in that language.			"

												Harvey's New Eyes is a point and click game with an assortment of minigames and puzzles. You play as a little girl named Lilli at a convent school who has to complete tasks given to her by the cruel Mother Superior and attempt to help her best friend Edna. The story is good, the characters are interesting, and the voices are well recorded by good actors and actresses. The music is cool and sets a great atmosphere. The jokes are very dark most of the time, but if you can appreciate dark humor its a great game. The game lasts about 8 hours from start to finish. The only problems I've had with Harvey's New Eyes is a single German translation in the English version (also found occasionally in the Deponia games) and the fact that achievements are bugged and can't be earned even after reaching the requirement, which apparently is a very common problem.Still, Harvey's New Eyes is a great game and I highly recommend it. The few issues I've had with it don't make a huge impact on the experience given, earning this game 10 Woogies out of 10.			"

												An excellent point-n-click adventure game. It’s got a simplistic art style that I like a lot. The game just has action/look and never gives you too many objects, so you never get hopelessly stuck trying random things for hours. The game has a kind of cartoon/fun style combined with dark humour, which works very well. The protagonist only speaks a tiny little amount, which cleverly makes the conversations focussed on the person you are talking to.I played this game before playing The Breakout, so I sometimes felt that I wasn't quite understanding the story. For that reason I'd recommend playing the original game first, then this.			"

												As far as dark humor and gameplay goes, I love this game. Although if you have a mac (I know... I know...) or atleast I think it's because I'm playing on a mac, you will tend to get crashes every 2 minutes or so. Please keep this in mind when buying the game. If you have a PC, I think you will fully enjoy this cartoony dark adventure. It's funny and unquie. Mini-games and a large game of mail man and scavenger hunt.			"

												Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a 2D point-and-click adventure that is a lot better than the first Edna & Harvey game. The story wasn't all that interesting, but it was still quite nice. There were some funny-ish moments that made me smile and I found it quite amusing that the main character was completely oblivious about the results of her actions for a long time.I've played the first Edna & Harvey game a bit and I never finished due to it being just awful in my opinion. It had unfair puzzles, boring dialog that just went on and on and a bad UI. This game on the other hand managed to fix almost all of those problems. The UI still wasn't that great but an improvement nonetheless. The puzzles were mostly easy and logical, but occasionally I had to roam around the areas looking for the missing items. I had to resort to a walkthrough on one occassion when I couldn't find an item anywhere and I thought I had tried everything. I thought I had already done what I was supposed to do and that the game had told me, that I couldn't do that. After that part it was smooth sailing again.The game also had a few mini-games, of which some were just logic puzzles. They weren't all that interactive and if you had troubles solving them, you could skip them. I didn't find them that hard, but two of them were a bit more challenging.For me the main problem with this game was the achievements. There were lots of stupid achievements that made absolutely no sense, like doing something completely pointless several (usually 15) times. Of course the achievements are completely optional, but I don't really see the point in having achievements in point-and-click games in the first place. If they require you to do something completely useless, they just distract you from the story and for story-driven games that's not a good thing.It took me about 7 hours to complete and I thought it was a good game.

												An overall enjoyable game and one I would recommend.The animations can be a bit simple at times but it is easy to overlook. The visual style is nice and fits in with the cartoonish humour and story although it does get quite dark at several points throughout, so whilst it looks like it would be child friendly you probably wouldn't want a young child to play the game.The puzzles are pretty good compared to other adventure games, they aren't randomly cryptic but aren't always simple either; and the minigames are refreshing but you can skip them if you can't be bothered and just want to progress.

You know how it's usually that you don't even get to see yourself and it's all just ""click this, click that"". I mean yes, this one's also just clicking around but you get to see yourself and since the graphics are made to look like you'd be watching some childs' TV series it all plays together really well!And the storyteller is just great. xDThis is one of the best games I've ever ran into!

												Pros: This is a well written point and click.  The humor is very dark, periodically irreverent, and with an seductively immersive.  I meant to play for a quick hour while laundry was drying, and find myself up at 3am, only able to pull away because I hit a chapter break.  The game is very clever, the voice talent is great, the soundscape is well done for the most part, and the music is well integrated and helps tell the story.  I've not finished it yet...ya know, cause...3 in the morning, but I can't wait for the next chance to find out what happens next.  Cons:  Dedicated puzzle solvers will probably find the puzzles very simple.  The puzzles, at least for chapters one and two, have been quickly solved.  That said, I like the fact that the solutions make sense, in an amusing way. I got this when it came out, and it ended up in my Unplayed Pile of Shame.  I'm glad it found it's way to the top of the pile, I'm enjoying it very much.			"

												Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is a point and click adventure by German adventure game powerhouse Daedalic Entertainment and is by far one of their best. The art style and plot ooze atmposphere which is complemented by excellent music and narration, especially in the original German language.  The puzzles are all of excellent difficulty and should appeal to fans of traditional point and click games. This is no Telltale game, that's for sure. The plot is an excellent meld of sarcasm and the macabre and will have you lauhging throughout. If you like adventure games it gets a fullhearted reccomendation and even if you haven't played that many this is probably one of the better ones to get started with.			"

												Harveys New Eyes is the first adventure i have ever played, so I will not (be able to) compare it with other games of this genre. Instead, I will talk about my overall experience with this game.First of all, a friend showed me this game some time ago and I stored it in my backmind. When it was on sale some weeks ago, I could not resist - and I never regretted this decision!It is a lovely made, 10 hours long/short adventure with a very...morbid and deep-black sense of humor, hidden behind the eyes of an ""innocent"", cute little girl. The narrator does its best to keep every mature-only-situation as child-friendly as possible (I can and do only talk about the GERMAN narrator!) which leads to awkward moments...and I really enjoyed them!There are three VERY different chapters in ""Harvey´s New Eyes"" and each of them had its unforgettable highlights. For example, in chapter three you become part of a pen-and-paper rpg, which is a small but brand-new, very entertaining situation...The puzzles - at least for me - are neither too difficult, nor too easy. Some puzzles took me some minutes, but overall I had no moments where I thought that I´d need help or had no more ideas. All puzzles make - kind of - sense and none of them are too far-fetched.Sadly, this game has some graphical problems, i.e. the items sometimes popped up without the background, when i entered a new screen. In addition, there was a moment when the game broke and I had to load my last savegame.Overall I highly recommend this game to all people who love this-kind-of-humor!But what do I really mean with this sentence? Well..just play the demo!!! If you like the demo - buy the game!!! (Maybeee...not for 20 bucks...but thats, of course, up to you)If you dislike the demo - don´t buy it. The demo is veeery close to the kind-of-humor. And the reason to (dis-)like this game...just IS the humor!Overall I give it a 9/10. And I really hope for a successor.			"

That being said, the game isn't very hard, you'll know what you need to do, just not how to do it. Sometimes things aren't quite clear enough. Other than that, this game is worth more than one playthrough just so you can catch things you may have missed the first time round.

												Harvey's new Eyes is a game, that isn't good because of it's gameplay, but rather it's feeling.It's just a point-and-click adventure, so there isn't much to say about that. You just walk through different rooms and solve a whole bunch of Puzzles.The more interesting thing is it's unique humor and Story. The whole story seemed like a standard kid story first, but the more i played it, the more I was wondering about why this game was rated that low. The humor is very funny (at least in my opinion) and the only parts which are not funny in this game are when you are in progress of solving things.Without making to much spoilers, I recommend it for everyone who likes puzzle games or point-and-click adventures.

												  This game is amazing. The narrator made me laugh throughout the game with the ever so slightly dark humor. The game itself is pretty and very enjoyable to play with a great storyline; I sat down expecting to play it for a few hours but enjoyed it so much I played it in one sitting. The game lasts around 6-7 hours to play through but I honestly think it's worth the money. The one foible I had was that there was a problem with the achievements so you may want to consider that.  I think it is one of the best games daedalic have produced to date and if you enjoy it, may I point out that it is a sequel to ""Edna and Harvey- The Breakout"" (this too is a good game, but I preferredHarvey's new eyes); the story is not ruined by not having played the first game so don't worry about that and play this amazing game!

												I originally passed this game over when it came out, even though I was intruiged by the art style. A year or so later, I thought about it again for some reason. I glanced at the reviews and saw some mixed/negative things, but figured hey, if I'm interested, I should just ignore the reviews and buy it.Anyway, I was hooked instantly. I love this game a lot, despite its occasional flaws and bugs, which are nothing to worry about. I love the dark humour, and the slightly moody, grotesque art. I can't say much about the story without spoiling it.A lot of my enjoyment came from the way this game felt like it had been made for me, so it may come down to personal taste, but I recommend it anyway! Especially if you like adventure games and are looking for something new.It's also hilarious, and not too obtuse or difficult, once you get used to its logic.While it's the sequel to another game (Edna and Harvey: The Breakout) they're different enough that you don't need to play that one first, but y'know, it's up to you.(One last thing, there's a game-breaking bug right at the very end, so save backups frequently.)

												I haven't played the first Edna and Harvey game so was somewhat skeptical of picking this up as other Deadilic titles while excellent storywise really put me off with the voice acting, however I'm really pleased I grabbed this in a sale as it's one of the best point and clicks I've played in a long time. While not overly hard, it's enough to make you think on how to proceed without ever having to refer to a walkthrough, and the story is pretty damn good, although I was a little disappointed at the ending which seemed rather abrupt. You could probably complete this in a single sitting if you wanted however expect to spend a good couple of hours straight at it. I completed it over a weekend just playing a couple of hours at a time each day.There were a couple of bugs that kept popping up now and again, mainly with the interface, but nothing that crashed the game or stopped you proceeding.There is an intelligent story here hidden behind the cute fluffyness, I urge you to give this a go if you like a good story and a good point and click adventure game... They are so rare nowadays!			"

												A solid entry in the Edna & Harvey series.  I would love to see more.  The series for me strikes the right balance of dark humor and fun.  The puzzles are challenging and I did need to work a few out on paper, but I love that! The puzzles were logical for the most part and I didn't need much walkthrough help.  Hint cigar doesn't need to be lit, I was trying to light it for a very long time so I could use.			"

												Hmmmmm, what can I say about this? Well, I do like it, but I like the first game a little more, the reasons you ask? Well this one is very polished and well written, good puzzles and some funny and sometimes dark humor, but....I was a little disappointed not playing as Edna or Harvey, annnnnd it's told mostly as a narrative rather than the first person. Don't get me wrong I do like the game, and it was very enjoyable, I just prefer the first game a little more :) it may grow on me more in time and as I play it again, it's a very good point and click game from the makers of Deponia.

												This E&H game is miles better than the original, I think. The art that was somewhat crude in the original is much better defined in this game (even though it's still very cartoony), as is the game engine itself. This makes the entire experience much more enjoyable to play.One of the really strong points in this game is the narration. It's a point and click adventure, so you need a good medium to tell the story, and the narrator is exactly that. In some games you find yourself trying to figure out what you need to solve a puzzle and are met with the players character making benign remarks about various objects and places that doesn’t move the story forwards and can be kind of boring. But this game has a very funny narrator that describes your actions, while the other characters deal with the story. This means that there's never a point where you can be bored in this game.The story itself is very different, but still maintains a lot of the same charm that the original E&H had, what with the absurd situations and crazy characters you are faced with. Great stuff.			"

												The begining of the story is pretty interesting, as while you do things the protagonist seems to not acknowledge what is happening inside the game. Chapters two and three are simple in comparison. Particulary on chapter three you don't have access to the whole assylum. Seems most of the work went to the first chapter.Sandly the end is abrupt, you don't get to know what happens to the protagonist, her friends or the antagonist. Even a page for a newspaper would have done it.Graphics are simple but ok. There is a glitch where the items in the inventory pop up over the screen when you enter an area, and you have to open and close the inventory for them to go away. The clicking area for many objects is displaced or too small, so sometimes you will miss them.Also, I had to tweak in order to get the achievements: deactivate Steam Cloud (which activates another version of the game!) and delete all savegames. And one of the achievements makes you go again over the game, but skipping the puzzles.I more less had a good time.			"

												Amusing little game.  Animation isn't the greatest, and the game pretty much well sets you up for the dark humour at the very start.  Not  difficult; my 8 hr time includes sitting through the initial song, quickly advancing dialogue (I'm a quick reader and too impaitient to listen to the voice acting unless something really special is going on) and trying out 2 of 3 endings.  Unlike TV Tropes, the ending really didn't catch me off guard and I felt there was sufficient foreshadowing (I had my suspicions before Chapter 1 finished). Adventure game veterns will have an easy time and appreciate the features that we basically had to do with note paper before are now included within the game.  There's nothing Monkey Island II Hard Mode difficult; it's on par with Monkey Island III ""Full Puzzle"" mode.			"

												If you like funny point and click adventures like the Monkey Island series or The Book Of Unwritten Tales series, this game should be right up your alley. The humor is a bit darker, but there are varying types of humor for all tastes. A lot of the puzzles are just difficult enough and it wasn't too hard to figure out when or where to use an object to continue in the quest. There were unfortunately some parts that didn't make any sense; an area in Chapter 2 where you can exit to that the game doesn't let you go, a few puzzles that make too much sense in several ways forcing you to try to figure out what they're trying to get  you to do rather than just use your intelligence. (For an unused example, which of these doesn't match: Apple Apricot Plum Asparagus. One's a vegetable but one starts with P. Okay, so did you mean which one isn't a fruit or which one doesn't match alphabetically?) I didn't care for the fact that you could accidentally skip the text, either. Most games I've played display the full text when you click so you can read it instead of listen and then a second click will go to the next text so it prevents you from accidentally hitting your mouse and having to reload your game to figure out what's going on. And then on top of all of that the achievements don't work in this game and I contacted the company and they have no plans to fix it anytime soon.Now, even with a few gripes like that, I still enjoyed the game. The characters were very relatable, I laughed quite a bit, the gameplay was smooth and easy to adapt to, the graphics were exceptional, the sound didn't drown out anyone's voice (which is a huge pet peeve of mine), the music was amazing, and it was just so quirky and eccentric that I couldn't help but love it.All in all, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10.This is definitely something to add to your wishlist, but I'd say read up on it some before you make the decision to buy it.

												This game was fun but I have to give it a rating of 90/100 mainly for the ending. It felt like a cliffhanger regardless of whichever action you choose for the doctor which gives more questions like *SPOILERS* ""if Edna was all just your imagination then where is the real Edna then?"" and ""will there be another Edna and Harvey game to explain more"" etc. The game of coarse did have its pluses like the humor in the game for both fourth wall breaking humor and its dark humor, the graphics were good to me and the puzzles made me have to think (A LOT.) Overall I think the game was fun and if their would be another Edna and Harvey game for a little filler in the cliffhanger (and more Harvey moments) then that would be great.			"

												I can't say I'm a huge fan of Point and Click games but this game...this game went beyond expectations. I went into this game, thinking that I was prepared (I've read reviews about how this is full of dark humour, sarcasm, puzzles and whatnot) but this game had rendered me speechless right from the beginning. This definitely isn't for the faint-hearted  and those who aren't comfortable with dark humour, and I find myself intrigued and unable to stop playing for the dark and twisted plot. And there are 3 chapters in total.I liked how Lilli (the MC) could only say a syllable word like ""Um..."" ""We..."" before she trails off and someone interrupts her. It's an interesting and unique way of characterising the MC and it also allows for certain implications and insights to be drawn from what kind of character Lilli is. The puzzles were alright, but you have to pay attention to details and what was told to you. Some of the things were quite roundabout - you have to do a lot of things just for one purpose that I ended up forgetting what my goalwas supposed to be in the first place. That's just chapter 2 though. This is definitely worth a buy, especially during a sale. Note: This is the second game, sort of a sequel to the first game (Breakout) but playing the first game isn't really important to understand this game. (PS. I didn't buy the first game)Edit: Although... I still can't unlock the achievements despite having completed them (e.g. completion of chapter 1, 2, 3)			"

												There are probably better adventure games to be playing (hint: Edna and Harvey: The Breakout). If you played the first game and need to sate your thirst for more of Edna's adventures (like me) this game is barely passable.Edna does play a role in this game, but only as a sidelined, watered down version of the wickedly clever and funny girl from the first game. Our main character in this game is Lilly, whose only vocalisations are monosyllabic grunts and moans. The game and item interaction narrations are done by a generic, movie-trailer type voice.The humor in this game was a huge step down from The Breakout. Most quips follow the formula of ""[Violent, disturbed, or psychotic action/thought here]... But GOOD little girls wouldn't think/do that, right?"" Gone are the unique lines for combining random items, or trying to use items on the environment here. Instead, the same lines are repeated over and over. Even the characters in Harvey's New Eyes are a huge disappointment. I will always remember the great interactions I had with the NPCs in The Breakout. The hilarious conversations, and all the personality that shone through (Edna's water impressions vs. Bladder, the iron bladdered security guard is a conversation that may never be topped). In Harvey's New Eyes, NPCs are reduced to item recepticles. You interact with characters only to give/take something from them, then they fade into the background.Even the puzzles in Harvey's New Eyes were a downgrade from The Breakout. New Eyes feels a lot like the last portion of the Breakout, which in my opinion was the weakest part. Very linear progression through the levels and barriers that prevent you from backtracking. The logic puzzles were interesting, but simple and unrewarding.I played this game out of a sense of duty, to follow the tale of Edna and Harvey as far as it would take me. But I probably would have had fun playing through The Breakout a second time. This is a very average adventure game that looks even worse next to its predecessor.			"

												I played a lot of old LucasArts games as a kid and fell out of point and click adventures by and large after that. I found a lot of them were either lacking a functionality I wanted, or the soul and humor I craved. This game has both. The game lays out its general type of humor and narrative style pretty early on, so if you find it's irritating you you'll know quickly and can back out easily. That's one of the great parts about it - this game plays its cards early on and manages to keep up the momentum throughout. Two of the best functionalities for me were that I could click through dialogue and also skip puzzles if I wanted. I don't really want to listen to the weeaboo girls yell ""shing"" back and for twenty seconds, nor did all the puzzles seem to be explained adequately. While that in and of itself is a con, the fact that I can skip with no problem helps to not take the wind out of your sails completely at any one point. I played this game before The Breakout and in short, I can say it's doable. There's a lot of character and location cameos, but I never really felt 100% in the dark. This game has the ability to stand alone (although I did go and play the first one which helped to explain a lot of easter eggs). It's relatively short for the full price tag, but I don't think point and click fans would really regret their choice nor do I think anyone would be too disappointed by it for a sale price. It's worth it.			"

												I really enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is into puzzle, humour, or a bit of rpg. The game lures you in with it's child-ish graphics, but quickly drags you into a world of censored death scenes and lots of pink paint. My only regret was not playing The Breakout beforehand.Pros: - The game's humour isn't repetitive but had a nice dark twist- After the recent update, switching between screens was much faster (the double click method works in the beginning too)- The puzzles weren't too difficult, I only needed the walkthrough for the glyphs - Storyline was good, the ending (no spoilers) was a nice twist :)- The art style and color pallette was a nice reminder of Lilli's 'innocent' mindset- The voice overs were well done- speedthroughs were easy as long as you can click very fastCons: There were a LOT of bugs in this game before the recent update, I'm not sure how many were fixed but here's what I noticed:- The menus and save files sometimes took a long time to load, it also took me a while to figure out which keys were for settings and saves- The esc, 5, and 7 button didn't always work, sometimes you had to repeatedly press the button to trigger it- There was another bug where if you had the inventory open and moved to another room, the items would still appear, but the inventory background would be invisible- If you had the brush with honey and moved from the leaf raking room to the swing tree, you couldn't double click into the next room- Sometimes the inventory/restrictions page didn't show, I had to move back and forth between rooms to be able to trigger itNon Bug related:- The instructions for the puzzles could be a bit confusing- There was minimal characterization for Lilli, even though we follow allong with her through the whole story, we only know her as a quiet and obedient child. This might be a pro if this is what the creater wanted her to be portrayed as.Even though it's a bit buggy, it's definitely a hidden gem you should play :)			"

												Played this and holy cow. Really good story. And not until I finished the game I realised this was in fact a sequel so you can bet I'll check the first game. With no knowledge of the last game I can fully say this is a stand alone title, in that you can play it and you won't be too confused. Overall great humor and great story. This is such an out of the box game and I really enjoyed it through and through. The characters are good (and of course I just loved Lilli although I would of preferred she talked more). Regardless of any cons (and trust me they're very few even if you're nitpicking) this game really stands out among the other click games. I highly recommend this, although I'm not sure if playing the first title makes this game an even better experience but I'll probably go check that out as well. Not necessarily a masterpiece but in terms of overall enjoyment I give this a 10/10			"

												There is some great, dark humor in this game. It’s unexpected from a point & click game but it does it very well. The main character you play as, Lilli, is a seemingly mute kind of character. Only uttering a few sounds and/or the first syllable of a sentence. I enjoyed it a lot as it lets you relate to the character more in my opinion. Speaking of voices, the voice over quality is great. The narrator is especially good at delivering his lines. I always enjoyed listening to him. The other characters are equally good and have their own personality. Considering point & click games are usually a lot of dialog…this is a point worth noting. Besides going through the main story, there are a handful of mini-puzzles that you must complete to continue on. Keep in mind, the developers were nice enough to put a “skip” option on these in case you get stuck or choose not to do them. It’s a nice addition, although I didn’t use it as the puzzles were generally not too bad. Except the one with the old man, I just couldn’t wrap my head around that one and ended up having to brute force the answer.Otherwise, the story progresses nicely and does have you stop and think about what to do next. I did resort a few times to “trying everything with everything” because I ran out of ideas. I would also wander around from time to time wondering what to do next or if I missed a clue or something to click on. It was definitely not an issue though. I pretty much expect that in any point & click game I play.A downside is that achievements were not working for me. It didn’t bother me but would have been nice if they worked. There were a few very minor graphical and sound glitches. Most notably the church cross was shown standing and in its fallen state at the same time. The inventory would sometimes pull up the items but not the inventory background squares to go along with it. A rare few instances the subtitles would fly by and the speech was never said out loud. But again, these were minor and I won’t mark it against the game.Pros+Dark, witty humor is fantastic+Great voice overs+Smooth 60 fps+Nice storyline, art style and music+Skippable puzzles if needed+Skippable dialog+Save your game anywhere at anytime+Want to keep playing “just a little more”Cons+Achievements didn’t work at allA great addition to any point and click game collection. Somewhat challenging with dark humor that will have you laughing multiple times.8/10 Very good			"

												I'm delightfully taken aback by how much better harvey's new eyes is compared to the breakout. Compared to the pequel this game reeks of polish and really shows that the developers are stepping forward. Even with all the improvements the sequel still maintains everything that I liked about the first and even uses it in creative ways, manipulting what you thought about the ending in The Breakout to keep you on your toes. The biggest downside I can name is that the plot is quite dependant on events of the first game which had it's flaws.			"

												This game is awesome, simply put. I loved the art and the story. The last mini-game is so fun. All the puzzles are easy to get through, but you may get stumped a few times. Don't look up the answers; just take your time and you'll figure it out. Really, one of my favorite point and click games.			"

												First of all, the ending was really bad, It was an interesting and funny game, but it can get tiring. Sometimes I really love playing it, sometimes I get bored. The puzzles are pretty hard. I had fun times with this game that`s why I can`t click the no button. It might not be the kind of point-and-click game where you can`t stop playing, But I don`t regret spending my time on it. To sum it up, I only recommend buying it ON SALE.			"

												This game was fun but I have to give it a rating of 90/100 mainly for the ending. It felt like a cliffhanger regardless of whichever action you choose for the doctor which gives more questions like *SPOILERS* ""if Edna was all just your imagination then where is the real Edna then?"" and ""will there be another Edna and Harvey game to explain more"" etc. The game of coarse did have its pluses like the humor in the game for both fourth wall breaking humor and its dark humor, the graphics were good to me and the puzzles made me have to think (A LOT.) Overall I think the game was fun and if their would be another Edna and Harvey game for a little filler in the cliffhanger (and more Harvey moments) then that would be great.			"

												The begining of the story is pretty interesting, as while you do things the protagonist seems to not acknowledge what is happening inside the game. Chapters two and three are simple in comparison. Particulary on chapter three you don't have access to the whole assylum. Seems most of the work went to the first chapter.Sandly the end is abrupt, you don't get to know what happens to the protagonist, her friends or the antagonist. Even a page for a newspaper would have done it.Graphics are simple but ok. There is a glitch where the items in the inventory pop up over the screen when you enter an area, and you have to open and close the inventory for them to go away. The clicking area for many objects is displaced or too small, so sometimes you will miss them.Also, I had to tweak in order to get the achievements: deactivate Steam Cloud (which activates another version of the game!) and delete all savegames. And one of the achievements makes you go again over the game, but skipping the puzzles.I more less had a good time.			"

												If you like funny point and click adventures like the Monkey Island series or The Book Of Unwritten Tales series, this game should be right up your alley. The humor is a bit darker, but there are varying types of humor for all tastes. A lot of the puzzles are just difficult enough and it wasn't too hard to figure out when or where to use an object to continue in the quest. There were unfortunately some parts that didn't make any sense; an area in Chapter 2 where you can exit to that the game doesn't let you go, a few puzzles that make too much sense in several ways forcing you to try to figure out what they're trying to get  you to do rather than just use your intelligence. (For an unused example, which of these doesn't match: Apple Apricot Plum Asparagus. One's a vegetable but one starts with P. Okay, so did you mean which one isn't a fruit or which one doesn't match alphabetically?) I didn't care for the fact that you could accidentally skip the text, either. Most games I've played display the full text when you click so you can read it instead of listen and then a second click will go to the next text so it prevents you from accidentally hitting your mouse and having to reload your game to figure out what's going on. And then on top of all of that the achievements don't work in this game and I contacted the company and they have no plans to fix it anytime soon.Now, even with a few gripes like that, I still enjoyed the game. The characters were very relatable, I laughed quite a bit, the gameplay was smooth and easy to adapt to, the graphics were exceptional, the sound didn't drown out anyone's voice (which is a huge pet peeve of mine), the music was amazing, and it was just so quirky and eccentric that I couldn't help but love it.All in all, I'd give this game an 8 out of 10.This is definitely something to add to your wishlist, but I'd say read up on it some before you make the decision to buy it.

												While Harvey's New Eyes certainly can be considered a humorous game you should expect to find yourself smirking quite a lot, but rarely laughing heartily. The humor, as in the first game, is quirky, dry and rather dark, the atmosphere somewhere between bitter-sweet and melancholic. Lilly, the new main character, is endearing and the new narrator with his cynic remarks makes you almost forget that the lovely Edna-and-Harvey-banter from the first game is gone. Following her on her misadventures is great fun, even though the story is quite predictable. It's one of those ""The journey is the reward"" kind of things.The gameplay has improved from the first game, replacing the ""look"" ""pick up"" ""talk to"" and ""use"" commands with contextualized cursors. It takes away some of the old school feeling, true, but in this particular case I don't mind at all. The long transition times between scenes that could be experienced in the first game are gone. The art style has greatly improved while retaining the soul of the first game. It's nice to look at and fits Harvey's New Eyes as the nihilistic art style befitted The Breakout. As for the puzzles, they are rather simple, but fun enough to keep you entertained trough out the story. Don't expect a great challenge, though, but play the thing for the story. Finally, an advice to the German players: the English voice actors are by far better than the German ones, especially the narrator. The difference, in fact, is so huge that I don't even want to speak about the subjectivity of taste. It's like the English voice actors are professionals while the German voice actors (and I know that we have a couple of great ones!) are friends of the game designers.   "

												This game is full of the charm I have come to associate with Daedalic Entertainment.  The controls are excellent, and handle much better than those of the original game.  The best part relative to the original game (Edna & Harvey: The Breakout) is how a lot of the characters (asylum patients) from the first game are in this one.  The story ends a bit abruptly, and I would have liked to have more puzzles involving the restrictions and whatnot, since that was the best part.  I found I really liked the characters (I'm still sad that Capu died), but I think that Lilli (the main character) could have had a little more development...  and the name of the game is a little decieving, too.  It's called ""Edna & Harvey"", but it's more about Lilli, and the ""Harvey's New Eyes"" bit isn't as apparent nor interesting if you hadn't played the original.I don't know if this is the case for all users, or if this is just a bug in my game/steam/computer, but I didn't recieve any of the Steam Achievements for this game, even after completing the whole game and meeting some of the objectives I know were required to unlock the achievement.As a part of the Daedalic Adventure Bundle (if I remember my transaction history correctly), this game has been pleasing, to say the least.  I recommend this game, but save often there are multiple endings! "

												I can't say I'm a huge fan of Point and Click games but this game...this game went beyond expectations. I went into this game, thinking that I was prepared (I've read reviews about how this is full of dark humour, sarcasm, puzzles and whatnot) but this game had rendered me speechless right from the beginning. This definitely isn't for the faint-hearted  and those who aren't comfortable with dark humour, and I find myself intrigued and unable to stop playing for the dark and twisted plot. And there are 3 chapters in total.I liked how Lilli (the MC) could only say a syllable word like ""Um..."" ""We..."" before she trails off and someone interrupts her. It's an interesting and unique way of characterising the MC and it also allows for certain implications and insights to be drawn from what kind of character Lilli is. The puzzles were alright, but you have to pay attention to details and what was told to you. Some of the things were quite roundabout - you have to do a lot of things just for one purpose that I ended up forgetting what my goalwas supposed to be in the first place. That's just chapter 2 though. This is definitely worth a buy, especially during a sale. Note: This is the second game, sort of a sequel to the first game (Breakout) but playing the first game isn't really important to understand this game. (PS. I didn't buy the first game)Edit: Although... I still can't unlock the achievements despite having completed them (e.g. completion of chapter 1, 2, 3)			"

												I really enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is into puzzle, humour, or a bit of rpg. The game lures you in with it's child-ish graphics, but quickly drags you into a world of censored death scenes and lots of pink paint. My only regret was not playing The Breakout beforehand.Pros: - The game's humour isn't repetitive but had a nice dark twist- After the recent update, switching between screens was much faster (the double click method works in the beginning too)- The puzzles weren't too difficult, I only needed the walkthrough for the glyphs - Storyline was good, the ending (no spoilers) was a nice twist :)- The art style and color pallette was a nice reminder of Lilli's 'innocent' mindset- The voice overs were well done- speedthroughs were easy as long as you can click very fastCons: There were a LOT of bugs in this game before the recent update, I'm not sure how many were fixed but here's what I noticed:- The menus and save files sometimes took a long time to load, it also took me a while to figure out which keys were for settings and saves- The esc, 5, and 7 button didn't always work, sometimes you had to repeatedly press the button to trigger it- There was another bug where if you had the inventory open and moved to another room, the items would still appear, but the inventory background would be invisible- If you had the brush with honey and moved from the leaf raking room to the swing tree, you couldn't double click into the next room- Sometimes the inventory/restrictions page didn't show, I had to move back and forth between rooms to be able to trigger itNon Bug related:- The instructions for the puzzles could be a bit confusing- There was minimal characterization for Lilli, even though we follow allong with her through the whole story, we only know her as a quiet and obedient child. This might be a pro if this is what the creater wanted her to be portrayed as.Even though it's a bit buggy, it's definitely a hidden gem you should play :)			"

												I played a lot of old LucasArts games as a kid and fell out of point and click adventures by and large after that. I found a lot of them were either lacking a functionality I wanted, or the soul and humor I craved. This game has both. The game lays out its general type of humor and narrative style pretty early on, so if you find it's irritating you you'll know quickly and can back out easily. That's one of the great parts about it - this game plays its cards early on and manages to keep up the momentum throughout. Two of the best functionalities for me were that I could click through dialogue and also skip puzzles if I wanted. I don't really want to listen to the weeaboo girls yell ""shing"" back and for twenty seconds, nor did all the puzzles seem to be explained adequately. While that in and of itself is a con, the fact that I can skip with no problem helps to not take the wind out of your sails completely at any one point. I played this game before The Breakout and in short, I can say it's doable. There's a lot of character and location cameos, but I never really felt 100% in the dark. This game has the ability to stand alone (although I did go and play the first one which helped to explain a lot of easter eggs). It's relatively short for the full price tag, but I don't think point and click fans would really regret their choice nor do I think anyone would be too disappointed by it for a sale price. It's worth it.			"

												Played this and holy cow. Really good story. And not until I finished the game I realised this was in fact a sequel so you can bet I'll check the first game. With no knowledge of the last game I can fully say this is a stand alone title, in that you can play it and you won't be too confused. Overall great humor and great story. This is such an out of the box game and I really enjoyed it through and through. The characters are good (and of course I just loved Lilli although I would of preferred she talked more). Regardless of any cons (and trust me they're very few even if you're nitpicking) this game really stands out among the other click games. I highly recommend this, although I'm not sure if playing the first title makes this game an even better experience but I'll probably go check that out as well. Not necessarily a masterpiece but in terms of overall enjoyment I give this a 10/10			"

												I REALLY enjoyed this game. Even though i hadn't played 'edna and harvey: the breakout', it was still easy to follow the storyline. The game takes you to a monastry where you meet a little girl called Lilly, who despite wanting to do everything right, has no friends and mother superior absolutely hates her.. She seems to have only one friend, called Edna. But one day a man called dr. Marcel comes to take her away and you have to protect her. But not before finishing al the chores you have to do for mother superior. But grave mistakes can be made with the best intentions. The game has a dark humour to it that you just have to love. If you are the type that can't handle that, you won't enjoy it, but if you like weird/sarcastic/cynical humour, you definitely have the right game!The characters in the game are sometimes a little one-dimensional, but some are just so weird that you quickly focus on them instead. The gameplay is simple and the story is quite straight-forward, though you can explore a lot and I advise you to do so. Especially some conversations are hilarious and worth listening to. The narrator of your story is quite the sarcastic basterd at times, which is a lot of fun!The only thing that bothered me was the ending, though I won't tell you anything about it. And there are a lot of: ''what the hell am i supposed to do now!?'' moments in the game. You really have to keep exploring all the options. Though it gave me a lot of frustration. So in short: a challenging game with a lot of dark humour and funny characters. I definitely recommend it!  "

												One of the best Adventure games I have ever played. It's as good as the Deponia games and really funny. For some reason the steam achievements don't work...but whatever. I recomend it.			"

												Great point and click game. The graphics may look a bit childish, but the game is nothing like that. There are a lot of challenging puzzles and the story is really mature and funny. Maybe it's not worth the full prize, but if you find it on sale give it a try.			"

												Edna & Harvey New eyes is the sequel to the Breakout game, this time around following the story of sweet lilly in the orphanage and all sort of random events going around her.This game is really good and must have for point and click players , comes with very well written dialogues, good humor and decent plot twists to keep you interested in the game the whole play through.

												An excellent point-n-click adventure game. It’s got a simplistic art style that I like a lot. The game just has action/look and never gives you too many objects, so you never get hopelessly stuck trying random things for hours. The game has a kind of cartoon/fun style combined with dark humour, which works very well. The protagonist only speaks a tiny little amount, which cleverly makes the conversations focussed on the person you are talking to.I played this game before playing The Breakout, so I sometimes felt that I wasn't quite understanding the story. For that reason I'd recommend playing the original game first, then this.			"

												A point and click game with charming graphics hiding challenging (if not completely unfair) puzzles. I really liked the goofy animations, character design and the black humour coming from the sarcastic narrator. The puzzles are surprisingly difficult and sometimes don't seem to make any sense, but they are most of the time well narrated so you should be able to do about 90% of the game on your own. I still had to go on to google to find the answer to one enigma that didn't make any sense and was badly introduced, and thus almost impossible to guess on my own. The music is charming and the dark/childish athmosphere is well done. For a lifespan of about 6 to 15 hours, I'd definitely recommand this game.Pros:- Goofy cartoon graphics and amusing character deisgn- Black humour that is relevant most of the time- Good voice actors that bring life to the character- Astonishingly difficult puzzles that are still doable because they are well anticipated and introduced- Athompheric music that creates a dark, yet funny moodCons:- Astonishingly difficult puzzles that, when badly introduced, are just a pain in the *ss.

												I absolutely loved this game. The humour is fantastic, and the puzzles require just the right level of thinking. There are also some really cool little mini-game kinda bits which offer a different play style to the rest of the game without feeling out of place. Don't be fooled by the cutesy start, though. It quickly descends into a much darker but still funny style. Will also say that you don't need to play the first game before this one, though I'd recommend it if you want to play both, as I think this one is, by far, the better of the two and you might get frustrated by the clunkiness of The Breakout in comparison.All in all, great game. Would definitely recommend.			"

												I am currently playing middle of the chapter 1. So far, I think it is recommendable adventure game.Pros+ English version's voice acting is quite good. The breakout's voice acting was crude, but not this one. Most of them are good, and some aare really great. My favorite so far is the Mother superior. You must hear her acting when she confess her childhood.+ Reasonable Level Design. Remember how the breakout was? No more Inventory full of items that even looking at it is smothering and the puzzles creepily designed (That monitor TV signal thing with bladder guy...)  + Graphics and musics also got way better from the last game.+ The air. The moment when the first lilly's friend died from Lilly's action and every classmates except him gathered around the covent I immediately realized that she would kill them all one by one by accident, and I LIKED IT. I had played wondering who'd die next. Cons- Bugs. I can't play it right now because my save file is corrupted. - If you mind children and animals dying...- Interface can use more improved. Something like swapping items by scrolling down or something like that.			"

												A wonderful mix of charm, dark humor, and psychological themes. The rather simplistic art style might seem off-putting but it actually works quite well. As far as adventure games go, I found it on the easy side (which is not a bad thing when it comes to point-and-clicks). There's a handful of moments that require a bit of thought but they're relatively straightforward. At no point did I get stuck to the point of frustration, which is a problem in many adventure games.If you're a fan of seemingly-cutesy-but-actually-really-♥♥♥♥ed-up games with great music, this is for you.

												A deceptively cute and simple game that you soon realize isn't as kid-friendly as you originally thought.The game has great writing, features many funny moments, and contains a plethora of unexpected happenings. The game's characters are very unique, and the main character makes an incredibly strong impression for all the wrong reasons. Of course, this doesn't mean the other characters were any less memorable. There's plenty of miscellaneous dialogue to get lost in, and the narration is great.The game length is decent, and I finished it in eight hours, although it is worth mentioning that I did it in one sitting simply because I found the game so damn compelling. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that chapter one was not the entire game, as I'd been assuming ever since I forgot the game actually had chapters. At this point the game introduced a new mechanic that in my opinion sadly wasn't used to its full extent (though it was still rather good). That's not saying the game was dragged out too long for them to actually use it enough, it's just that some abilities were one-time use.Throughout the game you're presented with different interactive puzzles, which serve as nice breaks from the running back and forth. For every puzzle, you have the option to skip them if you so desire, but I personally never did, because they were genuinely good. However, it's worth to mention that one of these puzzles was more of a trial and error game. This is something I realized very early on in the puzzle and it instantly sucked the fun out of it. Still, it was a really small part of the game and is honestly neglectable.The voice acting is pretty good (especially the narrator's), although the rest of the game's audio is nothing noteworthy. That's okay, though, because the game's focus is its narrative, which it really delivers well on.In short it's a story full of twists and funny turns, and occasional morbid curiosity. The writing is solid and the game mechanics work well, though there's still some to be desired. Top it off with some good voice acting and you can bunch this together with some of the better point & click adventure games out there. Definitely recommended!			"

												WARNING: I am not a huge fan of point and click adventures and this game is very much part of that genre. Also, if there was a previous game, I did not play that either.Too bad there is no inbetween rating. My thoughts about this game were more like ""meh"" and I don't think I would recommend it to any of my friends. It is not a bad game, mind you. It just didn't really impress me that much. And sometimes I found myself rather bored while playing it.The puzzles were creative and I really like the minigames, so I was always looking forward to those. And I liked the messed up story and world in it as well as the lighthearted way it was told. But as I said, it just really didn't have the ""oomph"" that it started out with and it got dull after a while.I guess if I had to rate it, I would give it a 6.5/10, slightly above average. But for me it didn't hold any replay value. Would recommend it only to people who are big fans of these types of games and who like this franchise if there is any.			"

												This was not what I expected.I played this game maybe a year ago. It was on sale, and I went for it. It decieved me in the best way possible. It is an adult point and click game, in the vain of Humongous and Monkey Island. The game introduced my to Daedelic Games, which also makes games such as Deponia and Night of the Rabbit. The story is dark, it is suprising, and it was intresting. The use of more childlike graphics really adds in contrast to the story, which I do not want to spoil. I had not played the first game before this one, but I did go back to it, but wasn't really intrested in it as much as this one. The charecters are all extremes. There is a genuine meaning behind this game, and I just loved it. From what I've been told, the gameplay can be a difficult. The puzzles are harder than many point-and-clicks, so a warning. There are guides for this game if you get stuck, and you can skip mini-games if you really don't want to play them. Also, as an added bonus, all the dialogue is spoken. 9/10, I don't know much that would improve this game. There is a good song that the game opens with that was extremely good and I have on my spotify. But the rest of the game's background music isn't memorable at all.			"

												Wunderful not-only-black humour! Great english voices acting! I love this Narrator's irony! Almost like Stanley Parable thing! Ah, this intonations and dialects...Cutiest timidly stumbling Lillegrimm!Too sad, I play this before Breakout. Thank's Devil, I don't play the trailer.Some of logical errors in sequences of combinations, when you take and use things so fast (board in chapel, for example). Most often you may not understand, what's this all grabbed for.Some mix with languages in voice files.Almost useless option for change psychoblocks.Painful achievements.I add this in same category with Lucius, Postal and Hotline Miami...Why drunker is not pinky?

												Don't be misled by its bright colorful artwork, happy tunes and upbeat narrator; Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes is dark.  It's also very funny, too, and a great example of dark humour done right.  If you've played any of the games in the Deponia series, then Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes will feel very familiar -- right down to an opening song from Jan Muller Michaelis.I got Harvey's New Eyes as part of a bundle, and wasn't aware it was a sequel when I started playing.  Luckily, the game stands on its own merits and (although I'm sure there are some throwbacks for fans of the first game) I didn't feel like I missed anything.			"

												Hilarious and fun to play game. First half of it is just superb. Really fun to play while stoned. Bizzare, twisted humour and setting. The second half of the game seemed a little bit weaker. But still very nice. If you like classic style adventure games and Daedalic, this one is a clear YES.			"
