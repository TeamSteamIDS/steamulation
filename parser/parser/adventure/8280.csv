Short version:Get ready for an absurd amount of trial-and-error puzzles and a truckload of dark humour in this horror-themed episode, which is possibly also the high point of this season.Long version:Humour that comes out of absolutely nowhere and seemingly leads nowhere: this is the main principle most Sam & Max stories were based on, especially during their early comic book years. This kind of humour we get plentifully in the Night of the Raving Dead, where things happen not because they have any reason or logic, but because they can be funny.I mean, just look at the basic premise we see before the title credits: New York’s streets are flooded with dancing zombies, so our heroes set out to investigate the problem at its roots, which is naturally Stuttgart.From here, the story evolves into a series of parodies, subtly or obviously mocking things like the stereotype about Germans lacking any sense of humour, or classic stories like Frankenstein. This is where Sam & Max are in their natural element, and it shows here.If something negative can be said about the episode, then it’s that most of the writing went into dialogues and little to the puzzles; there are too many trial-and-error ones littered all over the place, often halting progression. They payoff is always great—if a bit dark sometimes—but the road to the next hilarious joke can be a little more bumpy than needed.			"

												Sam and Max, Freelance Police! ... are back in season two.(You can never have enough Sam and Max!!) - and yes, they are just as good in Season2. And if you thought they couldn't go further than season 1... you will be surprised.Note: You really need to play these games in order. The story builds, characters are introduced, and if you haven't played previous games, you won't understand the backstory.Hilariously imaginative, well-written, and adorable. Recommended! 9.5/10			"

												  i have finished season 2,  somehow steam didn't record my playing time i don't  think  this is immersive enough. Sam and  Max travelled all the way to Stutgart in Germany, why  can't they  just stay there  and interact with locals? this  will  inject freshness into the game.  backtracking to the town is boring , repetitive and ruin the sense of adventure.  Sam and Max's neighbors have no business being in this game. "
