												Overall, I thought this was a fun point and click adventure. It doesn't compare to classics of the genre such as Full Throttle or The Longest Journey, but I still found it entertaining.Pros: Beautiful artwork. Plenty of challenging and rewarding puzzles. One play-through took me about 11 hours. Fairly stable product (only locked up once).Cons: The story is so-so, and I found a couple of the jokes offensive. A few early puzzles were far too easy, and a couple puzzles later in the game made no sense at all; I beat them only by trying things totally at random. Also, the main character is kind of a jerk and not particularly likeable.Overall, though, a fine game at full price ($10) and a steal if it's on sale for less.			"

												I adore this game.  Yes, it's a recycled Indiana Jones knock off--but frankly, I wish there were a few more games like it.  Lost Horizon is not complicated or complex gameplay, and the puzzles are kinda crazy at times, but it's just so much fun.   The voice acting for Fenton Paddock was perfect--he had a lot of personality and was consistent through the game.  One of my favorite lines toward the end of the game when you try to get him  to fight someone is, ""When have you ever seen me fight anyone??""It's a classic point and click adventure, so if you're used to that kind of gameplay there will be few surprises.  It's all about how engaged you are by the story and the voice acting.  My advice would be to try the demo, and if you find it fun, this will be worth the buy.			"

												Lost Horizon is a traditional point and click adventure game inspired heavily by Indiana Jones and the pulp action adventures of the 1930s. The game isn't ground breaking and there is nothing in it that anyone who grew up playing Sierra and Lucasarts adventures games won't have seen before, but the charm of the game makes it something worth playing. Many adventure games fall flat on their puzzles, but Lost Horizon manages to make them both logical and easy to understand. More seasoned adventure game players might find them a little bit too easy, but they always make sense and leaving the player wondering how they hell they were ever supposed to think of that. I recommend this game to anyone who has ever wanted to be a globe trotting 1930s adventurer. Also you get to shoot down a Nazi plane using a bag of flour.			"

												You can tell a lot about the game by its ending, or - more precisely - by the feeling you get when you've reached it. If you feel like ""at last! my suffering is over"", or ""and that's it?!"", or ""wtf was that?!"", it means the game probably did not deserve to be finished at all. If you forgot where you are or who you are and it was you who was that guy who kissed the girl in the end - that is the sign of a great game. But when it comes to _good_ games, one can always be recognised when you feel sad that it's over. And that's exactly how I felt when I finished Lost Horizon.The game is safe from anything edgy or grandious to be an outstanding title, and that's probably why I have completely missed it when it came out. But with its beautiful art, solid feel, enjoyable puzzles, super easy mechanics and pretty good voice acting, it's far from being a waste of time. I'm sad it's over not because I'm disappointed, but because I enjoyed the process of playing it. It was not an epic rollercoaster ride, but a journey equally pleasant all way through. With this game you get the kick in playing it, not in getting it finished.Influenced heavily by adventure films and games of the past, but not making a direct adaptation of the Lost Horizon novel, developers played safe to avoid a disappointment. It feels as if they are saying: ""We are not making revolutions here, we are just following the great tradition"". Lost Horizon will not shock you, will not turn your world upside down, will not break the grounds, but if you like the classic feel of adventure titles, you will enjoy it. It will not insult your intellect, or upset your ear with speech impedimented voice actors. It will please your eye with the striking beauty of its backgrounds and sometimes will give you a chuckle or two with a clever joke. The idea of hand-drawn backgrounds and 3D-animated characters seems to be the perfect approach. The only thing that stops this game from being great is that developers did not have a megalomaniac urge to make the best game in the world. They just did a good game, and that's what it is. And I think, it is better to make a good game and succeed at that, than try making a great game and fail to deliver.So, if you like old Indiana Jones games, or the Broken Sword series, you will most likely enjoy this one. Just don't expect much - and you'll be pleasantly surprised on every corner. I was!			"

This game was great. Pure and simple.This is my first review, so i'll keep it short(ish).I struggle to find anything wrong with this game, but if I were to point at one thing it would be that some of the cinema-scenes were a bit long. Sometimes it felt as if you were watching the game rather than playing it.That said I really enjoyed this. The puzzles were good (and I have played alot of point and click) and they did not feel to repetitive. They were also challenging but not over hard. Every time I got stuck I just had to rethink the situation, and usually the solution would present itself. I'm not proud to say this but I have a tendensy to use walkthroughs whenever I get stuck for too long. I only did that once here and that turned out to be a puzzle that used color. I'm colorblind so that does'nt really count....I thought it was a good story to, and unlike some of the other reviewers I rather liked Fenton as the hero. He's a bit cheeky and a bit of an anti hero, but after playing many of these games I find that usually is the case. I did not find it laugh out loud funny, but I found his coments rather amusing. I also liked all the different places one got to travel to. It made it feel like you really were on a quest, unraveling an ancient secret, unlike many games that just puts you right near the goal at the start.The graphics were also very well done. They made the atmosphere complete and added to the story in a great way.All in all this game really sucked me in from the get-go. It had a movie quality about it that really made me feel like I was there. It never felt boring and I was rather sad when it ended. (Thats a good thing.) I spent 17 hours on this game and thats not half-bad considering it cost me only about Â£8.I never replay games, but I'm really considering doing it with Lost Horizon.I give it a solid  9/10.If you like adventure and ancient mysteries this is a no brainer.

												Enjoyed it. It's on par with old Indiana Jones quests by Lucas Arts and Broken Sword series, well-known classics.The setting includes 1930s, Nazis, ancient knowledge, romance and so on. The entire game feels like a good Indiana Jones movie, even the main menu is a movie theater front.Game mechanics are well done, for example, to save you time and frustration you can tell if an item can be combined with anoother or applied to something else just by hovering it on a target, no need to try and click everything and listen to same and same responses from main character that this 'doesn't work'. In addition, you can highlight all active areas in a location, so no more 'pixel hunting' like in classic quests. Puzzles are mostly logical, no idiotic ones like infamous 'make a fake mustache by applying a scotch reel to cat' in Gabriel Knight 3.Story and gameplay possibilities it offers are also great, for example there is unique experience in one part of the game (spoiler!): you can switch berween two characters, one in present and another 10000 years ago, and actions one makes in the past make changes in present, you can leave items in the past so they could be found in present in aged form, etc. Terrific!A nice bonus unlocks when you complete the game (prototype version) and there is one nice in-game achievement :)All in all, its a great adventure to be played without haste, enjoy it. It would be even better to play together with your kids or wife/husband.			"

Lost Horizon is not innovative, but what it does, it does really well: It provides a 12 hour long, action-rich and not complex point and click adventure game with a captivating cinematic style. My new favorite adventure movie game!Even though the game took just shy of 12 hours to complete, the gameplay itself is not very complex. The game itself plays in a very cinematic way, with quite a few cutscenes with the ingame engine, a movie-like story and lots of dialogue. Luckily, all the dialogue and the cutscenes are skippable, if you wish to do so. I really enjoyed the very linear story and also linear puzzles, which make this game feel like an interactive Indiana Jones movie. Just be aware that there are absolutely no choices to make which send the game in a different direction.The gameplay consists mostly of the typical point and click one, which boils down to inspecting items, storing some in your inventory and combining them when necessary. During the whole game, there were only two exceptions which did not involve those âtake a look at A and combine with Bâ puzzles. Occasionally you take control of two characters to solve some puzzles. I really liked how, despite the cinematic direction, you could take as much time as you wanted for each puzzle. There is no dexterity or speed required. Even in a car-chasing scene! This helped with not getting frustrated, if you couldnât figure out which items apply to which ones. Generally, there is no way to die in this game, which I really appreciated. Instead of letting you do actions that would get you killed and thus waste your time, were simply not allowed and instead just commented by the main actor in a humorous way. In general, the logic behind the puzzles was quite solid and generally solvable on its own. I extremely appreciated that all interactable items in a game scene can be highlighted with the click of a button! So there is absolutely no âpixel huntingâ in this games. More devs should have this in their adventure games! Without this highlighting, I might have not completed the game.However, I had to resort to a walkthrough a few times, because I missed an item. As all the puzzles are extremely linear, every item has to be applied to the others in a certain order. So, missing just one item would make the whole puzzle unsolvable. I think this is my biggest grip with the game. I didnât mind having linear puzzles. I felt they were very fitting considering the whole style of the game. I wish there were some hint system, as the only thing coming close to a hint would be vague comments by the character, which were not enough for me. I often ended up just randomly trying and clicking on things when stuck. What I liked is that the game at least showed if items could be interacted with just by hovering with the mouse or with another item over them, so they would spare me at least the clicking part. However, the items you need are often only a screen away and almost all things you can interact with will be needed to progress. There are no false trails. If you try any solution that does not work, it will simply not be carried out and dismissed by a short comment, which minimizes the wrong solutions you could be misled by. Occasionally backtracking was needed and I really appreciated that the transitions from screen to screen were short and that the walking times were even shorter! The wasted time is very minimal, good job devs!A few technical things: the game runs extremely well, however there are a few bugs. What threw me really off was not that many small items would not be rendered at all, which would lead to characters exchanging or looking at invisible items. No, it was the occasional graphical glitch, where characters would clip behind pieces of the background and suddenly become invisible. The game runs in a letterbox, so it does not utilize the full width of the widescreen. Slightly annoyingly the cursor is not constraint to one monitor in a multi monitor setup. The quality of animations is quite good, overall.I loved the setting of this game! It is heavily Indiana Jones inspired and takes you to all kind of exotic and exciting locations all over the world in hunt for a secret artifact. These range from the scorching hot Morocco to the ice-cold glaciers of Tibet. A game scene usually consists of an absolutely stunning, hand-drawn backdrop, with added 3D interactable items, which were a bit crudely drawn. The unbelievably gorgeous, detailed and very historically accurate backgrounds were supported by unobtrusive, atmospheric and fitting background music. The humor in this game is amusing in the typical action hero manner. I often smirked about the humor and did not grow tired of it over the whole 12 hours of the game. Lighthearted jokes and snarky comments will be heard very often. Although I liked how the logical inconsistencies of the game were sometimes joked about in a self-aware manner. Like obviously too large items such as a whole ladder simply disappearing into the characterâs pocket.The story has many, many twists. I found it helped me being captivated by the game, despite the simple and linear gameplay. If you like short and concise stories, you should stay clear of this game. The game ending was done in a typical Hollywood-like manner, which boded well with the overall feel of this game being more a movie than a decision-rich game.			"

												If you're a fan of the classical point-and-click adventure games like Broken Swords, the Longest Journey or Secret Files then this is a game for you.This game will give you around 10 hours of entertainment.Bear in mind that it does have a LOT of stereotypes for the point-and-click adventure genre. Almost by the book with everything. So don't expect anything new.But I'd still say it's most definitly worth your time and money.The story is amazing and the puzzles aren't too hard or too easy. And one of the greatest thing with this game is that you can always see what is clickable and don't have to search pixel by pixel to find interactible items.			"

												About story and gameplay, one of the best graphic adventures available on Steam.I really enjoyed the travel around the world and some tricky puzzles, with the innovative ""collaborative single playing"", where you must use a combination of two characters' actions to solve the puzzles. In any case, it wasn't too difficult to reach the end.Maybe some of the dialogues have been too long, but necessary to explain the story in detail, so I was happy to follow them.I will have a look at the ending extras with interest, maybe adding something to this feedback.One negative point is coming from grapichs issues. Environment is always really colorful and enjoyable, BUT characters sometimes look too ""cartoony"" and their motion is unreal. This should have required more attention by the developers, even if luckily this is not affecting the gameplay at all, but just video scenes.Anyhow, highly recommended to everyone who is passionate about this kind of games! :)			"

												PuzzlesThe puzzles are logical, there are no Gnomes named IFNKOVHGROGHPRM in this game (google it, Kings Quest - 1984). This combined with the fact that any point of interest/item is something you need to use (unless they dismiss it outright) makes this a game a bit on the easy side.In addition they ""remove"" a point of interest/item from the game (that is making so you cant interact with it) when you have used it and its no longer needed.First time I play the games from this developer/publisher, and don't know if they tend to make the puzzles fairly straightforward or if this game is the odd one out.StoryThe story is entertaining and while it will never win any oscars its easy enought to see what franchise that serves as insipiation, and they are solidly within that ""tradition""GameplayCharacter autoruns, and you can dobble-click to move another scene/map. This removes some tediousness. Can also skip dialog (its both text and speech)To make the combining of items smoother you dont need to try every combination and listen to the hero say ""thats not quite right""  a million times. Pick up item, and if the ""work mouse button"" is green you can combine. This works in the scene with points of interest too. (This can make the puzzles seem easier, but I dont care)TL:DROverall its a fun game, and all though I could wish for a bit more complicated puzzles I found the experience a positive one.			"

Heavily inspired by Indiana Jones, the 1930s setting is a little different than most adventure games out there at the minute.The graphics and backgrounds are beautifully drawn, and the voice acting is decent enough that you're not left cringing.  Unfortunately, like the other games made by the publisher, the cutscenes can often drag on a little longer than necessary.However, if you're a Indiana Jones/point-and-click fan, then I definitely recommend it.

												The story of this game is... well... It starts out somewhat interesting and then just kinda go downhill from there. Like the Secret Files games, you get to travel to a lot of different locations around the world. In this game, it feels a bit farfetched at times and it seems the enemy always has you on their radar, no matter where you are. There were way too many scenarios where characters are involved in lethal accidents which they survived unscratched. If you see someone in a lethal accident, your normal reaction is probably if the person survived at all. These characters don't react that way. So they don't even act mildly concerned even when they watch such things happen. I actually anticipated a character would die in an accident, but it's like nothing really happened. The people watching the accident doesn't even rejoice in seeing them again, as if just expecting them to survive such a thing. As for the main characters, I honestly didn't like that Fenton was the main character and not Kim. He is quite a jerk and especially towards Kim. Kim was in my oppinion the one who should have had the focus. She has a good sense of morale, she is caring, brave and really kicks someâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Without her, Fenton wouldn't really manage. It really sucks that the characters are so obviously forced together and she is deliberately put in situation to make her the damsel in distress, to allow him to save her and make him a hero. It's a common thing you see in a lot of games and movies, the main character is so unlikeable, the only way you can force the love interest to like him is by ending up in some accident he saves her from. The game is unfortunately a bit short. It ends quite abruptly and in a bit of silly way. It kinda feels like when they've finally put all the pieces together, even the game gets bored of itself. You get a really over-the-top ending and then the rest of the story feels very forced.I do like that the game tried some new things involving the puzzle solving, where one character is driving a car and you have to respond to things with the other, while the car is in motion. It's done in a way where you don't get your character constantly leaving the scene/room in a short time limit, you get apply amount of time to figure out how to solve this incident. (Thankfully the streets of China are endless and there's no traffic when you need to escape from bad guys.)There's also some creative ways to solve puzzles, a bit over-the-top, bit it was still funny to watch. The way Fenton deals with an enemy pilot is so silly it's awesome.They also have theâcontrol two characters at onceâ which is one of my favorite concepts. At one point, you get a rather tricky problem solving where you control two characters in two different times, affecting the other person depending on what time they are in. I thought this was brilliant. It's unfortunately a bit short though.I am a bit so-so as if I wish to recommend this game or not. It's not a fantastic game, but it's not dreadful either. The controls are responsive, the graphics are nice and the voice work is acceptable. (compared to A new Beginning - Final Cut) There's some good humor and the game will last about 6 hours. I did like it much more than ""Secret Files 3"". I'd recommend buying it when it is on sale.			"

												Lost Horizon was a very enjoyable experience. This game has it all, nazi's, evil scientists, Tibetan monks, henchmen with weapons, and beautiful women. The main protagonist is Fenton Paddock, a down and out pilot who finds himself trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is quick witted and often hilarious. One of the main drawbacks of my recent adventure game purchases has been the quality of the voice acting has been very low. This was not the case with Lost Horizon. The accents of the different characters are convincing and the delivery is very smooth. Nothing can kill my immersion faster than a character speaking who sounds like an actor reading a line. As far as the puzzles go, I did not come across any that required a guide, as they all seemed very rational. Overall, if you enjoy point & click adventures with puzzles that aren't illogical, voice acting that is top notch, and en exciting story, you need to pick this up! "

												Lost Horizon was a entertaining point and click adventure game that didn't disappoint. I do have a few cons for this game, but I think they are relatively minor.Pros:- Multiple settings throughout the game. You're in so many different environments, and they are all drawn beautifully. The game is broken up into chapters, and each chapter has a different look and feel to it.- The story was interesting enough to keep me amused. Shambhala isn't exactly a new concept in video games, but I never got that bored feeling while playing.- The voice acting, while cheesy often, was well done.- I appreciated the length. I completed the story in a little under 12 hours, which for a point and click game is long in my opinion.Cons:- The protagonist wasn't likeable.- There were cutscenes that I enjoyed, but there were also parts of the games where the dialogue would kind of just run on and on and on. I'd be sitting there like, okay we get it get to the point!- It falls into the 'point and click games with solutions that aren't logical' category. Some of the solutions to move forward with the game were a result of randomly combining items or clicking on things. I'm learning to get used to this in the genre though.I would recommend Lost Horizon to anyone a fan of the genre. You get exactly what is being sold to you in the trailer.There are no jump scares.

												Highly enjoyable point & click adventure game in the vein of Indiana Jones and Flight of the Amazon.The artwork in this game is magnificent and every scene you step into looks astonishing and highly detailed. This is backed up with, for the most part, good animations as well.As with similar games you get to travel around the world to interesting places to solve puzzles and clues to get to your final destination for a showdown. The puzzles are well thought out, creative and logical (to a certain extent). Apart from what seems a bit silly back and forth movement through scenes I found the puzzles and collecting quite entertaining. It is not very hard, but it's not a breeze either.I found the game to be fairly long considering the lengths of other adventure games I've played. It is filled with a lot of storytelling and dialogue that might throw some people off, but for fans of the genre I would consider this game a must. I found the story iself both interesting and engaging for the most part, but it dwindled a little towards the latter part of the game. The story is mostly mature with a healthy dosage of cheeky humor which gave me a few laughs and nods along the way. I thought it suited the main protagonist, but some might find him a bit unlikeable. However, the voice acting in this game could be a lot better. It's not all bad, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I feel that better voice acting would have levitated the game to make it even more engaging and become more mainstream, though I can totally sympatize with development budgets for games like these at the time of release. Luckily we are entering a new era for adventure games that will hopefully raise the budgets of similar projects.Not only is this game a must for fans of adventure games, but it should also be a good candidate for people wanting to test out the genre. I highly recommend it. I also look forward to the sequel that seems to be scheduled for sometime in 2014.I rate this game 8/10Remember that reviews are individual opinions set according to individual standards.

As much fun adventure as an Indiana Jones movie, complete with Nazi evil. Sometimes, though, the situational puzzles can be a little far-fetched, making you think, ""Who would have ever thought of that??"" At times, the dialogue in the cutscenes can drag on a little long but I think the developers were rewarding you with storytelling from all that puzzle solving. Fun game!			"

												This game is more interesting than it seems at first glance. It's a classic point&click game with an Indiana Jones vibe.The ending was great in my opinion. I would recommend it to you if you like games like Secret Files and Broken Sword.			"

												I've been meaning to make a review of this gem for some time, though I must make it clear that my Steam play time bears no indication as to the amount of time Iâve actually spent on it; my experience deriving from the physical copy of the game.Insofar as the WWII era and the Tibetan locations upon which the game is set, Lost Horizon is roughly based on James Hilton's novel of the same name though here represented by Fenton Paddock - a former British military officer who's been tasked with investigating the disappearance of a British detachment originally posted within the Tibetan wilderness as a means of repelling the Nazi German advance.Very soon thereafter the journey takes the player around the globe, admiring the sights of such locations as Hong Kong, Morocco and even the heart of Germany itself.Graphics: By today's standards the graphics are nothing special, though I should point out that they have a certain charm and vibrancy about them that adds to the uniqueness as well as the âbuoyancyâ of the game (something Iâll extrapolate on later).Sound: The ambient sounds and music are adequate while the voice acting is for the most part acceptable. There's nothing that really makes the game stand out in this department however.Gameplay: While Lost Horizon uses typical point and click mechanics, the puzzles can be said to lean more toward the âmainstreamâ player in that they are not very taxing and are generally very easy. This is further compounded by a distinct lack of depth with regards to the playerâs ability (or rather inability in this case) to interact with many things throughout the various scenes.Narrative: This is where the game really excels, in that it has created its very own take based upon James Hilton's original narrative template. What initially appears to be a clichÃ©d WWII adventure offering, eventually culminates with an adventure game whose ending is worthy enough that even James Hilton himself would have been proud to have been associated. Indeed it's this clichÃ©d setting that enables Animation Arts to flash their own creative muscle via personal artistic license, that seals the deal for me personally.In conclusion then, Lost Horizon is a fun little gem of a game that uses established clichÃ©s in an intelligent way, by creating its very own story upon which Tibetan mysticism (which exists even today) runs central. This together with the buoyancy of its aesthetic offering makes it, much like a flower in bloom, an experience to truly savour.			"

												LucasArts perfected the point-and-click, so tells us gaming history and is right. After Grim Fandango in 1998 their golden age came to a close and all was quiet for adventure fans for a good long while. Germans eventually decided to save the world and have held the cursor torch for years. Lost Horizon is an almost forgotten title from 2010 that strengthens the Teutonic monopoly on adventuring.The games lead, Fanton Peddock, is the best possible company: smart yet goofy and serious about things that matter. He is voiced to perfection by Adam Howden (Anders from Dragon Age) and rest of the cast shines as well. Peddocks commitment to nonviolence prevents him from harming man or beast: even a troublesome alley cat is distracted in a way that any feline certainly appreciates.The same attitude is spread throughout the entire game, which is filled by harmless old world charm. A hulking Nazi trooper tortures a poor helpless prisoner with German march music, Peddock gets to rig the 1936 Olympic decathlon and outwit Hong Kong triads. There is refreshing innocence in all this, which is not pandering in any way.The puzzles are logical, meaning adventure-game logics and not the real-world kind. Writing is supremely clear and economical with only the periodical exposition marring the classicist perfection. All the scenes fit together and the plot twists are both surprising and logical. The game has a feature that highlights all the things you can interact with but the puzzles themselves are very clever indeed and beating them felt like victory every single time. Peddocks story is split into seven chapters and took me nine hours to finish which I felt to be completely satisfying.It is rare to finish a game feeling rejuvenated like this. I would not want to change a single thing in this little gem and recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in adventures.			"

												To start off I loved this game! and it's a worth a try for sure. Someone said this is like an Indiana Jones rip-off, and to be honest that's what I liked about it. It feels like you ARE watching an adventure movie where you get to do some of the directing, and it does feels like an Indiana Jones movie. The main character Fenton is quirky, full of himself, and sometimes an ar$e but that what made interacting with objects and people much more fun -I couldn't wait to hear what stupid and pompous things he has to say. The story is interesting. The puzzles are simple at times and they mostly do follow common sense. Two things I had been a bit disappointed about: I would've liked to see more of Kim, and a more climatic ending -having an epilogue would've been nice.			"

												This is a fun point and click adventure game which is a nice break from FPS (First Person Shooters). Most of the scenes are puzzle related as the story progresses and speaking of which the setting is 1936 from Hong Kong to Tibet and then on to several other exotic places. Third Reich soldiers are seeking occult items in their future war against the world and as you can guess it's up to the main character and his allies to stop them.The tale in itself focuses upon one Fenton Paddock (rogue much?) who was dishonorably charged from the British Army and you get the idea he took the fall for somebody. He's your typical British âdo gooderâ with dry wit and a self-deprecating nature. His allies come and go but mostly stay with Kim, who is his love interest and the daughter of Fenton's mentor friend. Sometimes you will get to play Kim and Fenton at the same time. You will also get various scene cuts when you complete missions or when the story needs to jump to other characters, including those of the Third Reich.Note that a good deal of the puzzles are related to combining items or elements in your surroundings. If you get stuck the answers are online.They evoked the era very well. There's music from the 1930s and the clothing and buildings felt authentic. Hardcore historians may take issue. SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; GRAPHICS: B to B plus;  GAMEPLAY: A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.			"

												A genre game, it plods on and on with its assortment of cliches, railroading the main character from one 'exotic' (but all too familiar) location to another. The puzzles are either easy, or trial-and-error, and the characters are made of genre cardboard. Sometimes you have to comb the screen to find something you have missed or you're stuck. The graphics are reasonably pretty but uninspired. The main redeeming quality of the game is that it has a lot of subtitled dialogue in French (possibly other languages too), so it can be used for a little language practice.			"

												Really enjoyable adventure game with fun sloppy accents and silly situations - an adventure film with interaction. Some of the puzzles can get annoying - like seriously what the hell!? (and it will annoy you if you lose the flow and get stuck on one puzzle - but that's what GameFAQ's is for right :p) For the most part it's a very enjoyable game with great visuals, and a really nice soundtrack. There's no branching paths or anything whacky happening with the dialogue but just a good old fashioned adventure narrative traversing parts of Britain, The Himalayas, and Germany. One major annoyance was the completely different look in-game of the main characters as opposed to that used on the promotional posters/advertising - it makes absolutely no sense - but that's a superficial thing spurred by the evils of the marketing department, so we can disregard their input :p			"

Somewhat boring to play through, and the English voices are a bit off. Writing's okay: it often tries to be funny or witty but falls flat on its face in the process. All in all, a decent adventure game that'll last you a good 11 or so hours. You'd be better off getting a Telltale Games adventure, a title from LucasArts, or Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. 6/10.

												This is a real hidden gem of a traditional point and click adventure. On seeing the title screen it becomes obvious how much care has gone into every aspect of this game. The plot and cinematic style of Lost Horizon  are a homage to adventure films of an 'Indiana Jones' type. It's all about a reluctant hero saving the world from Nazis who are after powerful mystical secrets and has everything you'd expect: biplane fights, secret mystical locations all over the world, ridiculous car chases and cutscenes of implausible fights on Nazi trucks.  Oh, of course, the spunky irritating sidekick/love interest - I suppose nothing's perfect.If you have played the LucasArts classic  'Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis,' you'd probably find this is really similar in writing, plot depth and gameplay style and there are other things that will make you think the writers were trying to bring back the old Lucas Arts classics. For those who haven't...The best bits -The plot is daft but fun and interesting with lots of mystery, pseudoscience and silly cutscene action. - This is a properly long game. Really good value for money.  12-15 hours gameplay I'd say.-The puzzles are mostly combining inventory items together or with objects in the environment. These are (with a few glaring exceptions) very logical. - The visuals are gorgeous.-The voice acting is excellent.-The music was good though not hugely memorable.-The interface was easy to use with one exception (see below)Bad points-Some of the puzzles cannot be solved until you've examined an object to death because your player character is a fool that needs everything spleed out to him.-There seems to be a minor bug where when you try to solve a puzzle correctly  with an object, the game doesn't recognise which object you're trying to use. It always works by the third attempt.- The two cursor interface can make some puzzles a bit easy. Highly recommended, particularly if you like inventory based point and clicks with engaging plots. "

												About me: I love adventures, especially the old Lucas Arts games.About the game: I've got mixed feelings.The good: Beautifully painted backgrounds. Puzzles never frustratingly difficult, usually somewhat logical; solving usually is satisfying. Some areas (especially the last chapter, think Day of the Tentacle) have really nice ones too. No dead ends, no click to loose. The major story arc is interesting and, at least in parts, even gripping. Voice acting is decent.The bad: Some puzzles are just too easy or instead require pixel hunting for the item you didn't even know you need. Story often feels like an Indiana Jones rip-off and bounces between serious and goofy. Main character is a self-absorbed show-off, but instead of poking fun at him, the game actually wants you to like him for this. The female side kick would have been a much better choice, but gets hardly any play time at all. Dialogue and remarks are full of one-liners that are so unfunny, it's sad.The ugly:  The 3D rendered characters don''t live up to the backgrounds, are often terribly animated (one scene had flailing arms worthy of a gmod skit, and the main antagonists face looks like that of a puppets, except her lidless eyes  never  move) and a lot of animations just are a generic arm movement. The last 30 seconds of the ending. Do yourself a favor, and just pull the plug when you hear Fenton say ""Naaah, overrated"".Conclusion: I enjoyed most of it, but really hated some of it.			"

												Indiana Jones changed my life so I really tried to be excited about this game.But I'm not a huge fan of point and click adventures, with the exception of Another World and Flashback.  So I'm torn between really wanting to like this and thinking I have better games in the pile of shame to be spending my time on.  Don't get me wrong, this is an effective piece of entertainment on a budget.  Not exceptional, but delivered in a fun and occasionally logical manner.  The high amount of dialogue and varied scenes are good enough quality for the game style but I felt that getting through the game was more of a slog than being driven by enjoyment.Recommended as a workman like point and click with suitably B movie plot.  But you aren't going to be talking about it round the watercooler.			"

The story they tried to make it too deep with history and all that, but the way they introduced it is too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring, a lot of moments the main charater talk to you (to the palyer) to explain the story with his boring voice. They also tried too hard to be fuuny but most of the jokes make you cring.The puzzles basillcly just collect different stuffs and combine it, there is no challenge or smart one, some of them simply too stupid, do you belive there is a puzzle for how to clean a mirror? SERIOUSLY? I played too many point & click games, and maybe this one the worst.			"

												Pretty good adventure game, but all it did throughout the story was make me want to put on Indiana Jones.			"

												Because of the poor voice acting and painstakingly long cutscenes I lost interest in wanting to complete the game.This is not a game I would recommend to others who are wanting to play a enjoyable point- and click adventure game. I think too much of the story is driven through watching cutscenes instead of actually playing the game.			"

												A slightly paranormal adventure game from the Secret Files team, though this time the story - or the localisation at least - is far better. No irritating puzzles, either.			"

												Funny point and click game. The puzzles are mostly straight forward but at times can be a little absurd.The ingame facts are interesting and enlightening.			"

												descent point and click adventure with more than one Indiana Jones inspiratioen+large variety of placesstory is intriguing in the first hourspuzzles are not too hard, so the gameplay is more fluid-in the last third of the game (the end of the morocco sequence), it is hard to follow the story. Too complicated, too much detailed.			"

												A great game and artwork, the engine is later used in The Secret Files 3, but its a great story and fun game if you give it a chance.			"

												It is a rather decent point&click, and the graphics are awesome. Don't expect much in the story department, as it is not very original, but it is well made, and it is definately not bad. Some of the puzzles are try-all-combos. The characters are rather bland, but all in all, Lost Horizon is well made on all accounts. It is not superb, but it is good. Good graphics, excellent animation, decent voice-acting, and decent puzzles for the most parts.			"
