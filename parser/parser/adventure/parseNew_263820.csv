												The developer is clearly a fan of the great classic ""Crystalis"" as can be seen by the gameplay, soundtrack, and system.I really admire the retro-throwback feel. As for the plot, it is amusing and it is nice to play as the villain for a change. It does get overly repeditive to always play the heroes in this sort of genre so I consider it a breath of fresh air overall. For a mere 2 bucks, this game is one of the best deals for fans of the classic action/rpg's from the days of old.Well done, well done. "

												Awesome game!Pros:1. $2.00, this is a bargain for what you get.2. If you like retro, you will like this, it stays true to the classics of old.3. Interesting story: you play as a ruthless, evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It has some funny moments but also some engagingly bleak ones, do not expect to be a good guy for one second.4. A final boss the way a final boss should be... beware.Cons: 1. Combat can sometimes feel repetitive, you may also feel like the only real challenge comes from bosses unless you are reckless.2. Game sometimes feels 'barebones' in respect to itemisation and some areas are repeated with different textures.Tip: I recommend playing on hard from the start, I never tried normal but hard seemed just right.In summary:Buy this game. It was a blast, it gave me a solid 7 hours of entertainment, and will probably give you more if you want to collect all the achievements. "

												Great game!It reminds of the 1st generation SNES/Genesis Action RPGs.There is a lot of dark humor in this game and the main character is a villain out to enslave the world? Nice! :DNow the gameplay and AI is a little clumsy so you will see some odd movement and action response from your attackers but it does not ruin the game experience.This game really is a lot of fun if you are into retro Action RPGs. :) A game like this I would have easily thought would be $4.99 USD but for the price offered for $1.99 USD, it's a steal for the quality and great story offered in this game.Go and buy yourself a copy. You won't be dissappointed. :)			"

												Evil Quest is more or less a homage to the classic NES game Crystalis. I'm sure this little nugget of info has been mentioned by many other reviewers, all the same it's worth mentioning.Homages are a mixed bag. This is how they usually end up: ""Wow! This reminds me of my favorite game...except worse."" Evil Quest isn't as good a game as Crystalis, but it's still okay. Evil Quest is about Galvis. What does he want to do tonight? He wants to destroy the world. He kills everyone that stands in his way, and even murders anyone that annoys him. Like any other villain, this guy also talks too dang much. While I can't imagine a mute evil-protagonist working out, by the end of the game I was sick to death of Galvis and his speeches.As with most action-RPGs, Galvis starts with a pitiful knife and dirty rags, and his enemies are mere rats and low-ranking grunts. By the end of the game he's wielding the legendary chaos axe and slaying dragons & demons with no trouble. Getting to that point involves the typical town -> overworld -> dungeon progression. The dungeons are standard stuff, lots of respawning enemies, some treasure, sometimes a puzzle or two. It's nothing really involving, but I guess that's to be expected from a game that harkens back to simpler times.The only bothersome aspect is that with every level-up, you're given points to distribute. Having stats for HP and DEF seems a bit superfluous, especially on hard difficulty where everyone hits like a truck. Boosting STR and MAG is more effective, mainly because the faster you can kill something, the less chance they have of damaging you. Plus if you want all the achievements you have to focus on two attributes (this will take two play-throughs), because the level-cap will keep you from maxing out all four. This game can be really easy, with much of the difficulty being player-imposed. By this I mean you have things on harder on yourself (don't buy healing spells, don't use potions, etc) to remain challenged. However, the final bosses have some cheap attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge, so it's probably not the best idea. A sequel is in the works so the issues involving difficulty should get ironed out.What I'd really like to see out of the sequel to Evil Quest is A) better art-direction B) better plot C) a more involving quest. An old-school bum like myself probably shouldn't care about A or B but they along with C are why I consider Crystalis the better game (well, all that and better difficulty balance). Evil Quest was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game and it shows. The sprite-work is serviceable but not in any way unique, and just looks really banal.C gets it's own paragraph because it's the most important of the three. A good quest isn't just finding powerful weapons and killing massive enemies. Crystalis gets a lot of credit for changing things up beyond ""kill monsters & get money"". In one area you could ride around on a dolphin, there was a town run entirely by women, and you had to use a metamorphis spell to talk to their queen, there was also a zombie-infested town, and so on. In a lot of ways Evil Quest is too similar to traditional action-RPGs, which results in missed opportunities. There aren't many games where you play somebody who is actually evil. It seems like there would be a lot of cool methods to progress the plot, like using sabotage, threats, murder, etc. Take Kefka from FF6 for example, imagine playing as him. At one point you poison the kingdom of Doma, later on you assist the emperor in fooling the resistance, then not long after that stab the Emperor in the back and take all of the god-like power for yourself. The rest of the game could be spent trying to stay one step ahead of the heroes, slowly picking them off one by one (or in parties). All that said, it's not really a huge deal. As a homage throwback whateveryoucallit title, Evil Quest is solid. It has the basics down, and a sequel could turn out to be pretty spectacular with enough creativity injected into it.			"

												Trying to figure out where to start on this review, well lets just say that i would never have found and played this game on my own, it was chosen by a friend on a random cheap game challenge.The challenge was to play the said chosen game for 10 hours, we all moaned and groaned at the idea of these random games possibly being fun for 10 hours, little did i know i was actually to have a goddam good time. Now to the game, ill drop it in sections to make it easier.Gameplay:I was very surprised, im normally not a fan of these kinds of games but the combat was very precise and quick, a easy to do hard to master kind of deal. The RPG side of it i was confronted was oddly simple yet deep enough for me to quickly realise the difference in how i could build a character, it allowed me from the start to know what i wanted to build and how to play with next to no hand holding, i was impressed. Just to squeeze in something i also enjoyed, the boss battles, they actually had mechanics to them that wasnt just walking around and dodging, it added a little more difficulty to the battles and made them more interesting.Story:The story was quite intriguing, you play the opposite side of the way these storys would normally go, from the evil perspective and how overwhelming that evil is, i actually had alot of fun playing from this side. The story itself is nothing to special but interesting enough to carry you along the path of becoming stronger and beating bosses.Sound:Its sound was not terrible but i admit i kinda got sick of it half way through the game, but it is fitting with the game and i enjoyed it up to that point, its kinda a mix of dark upbeat, very much suits the mood of the game.Conclusion:Im very happy with this purchase, even at this price point, it delivered on everything i expected and didnt expect, this is a gem for the price that it is set for, and if your into these kinds of games and looking to kill a little bit of time, definantly dont skip over this.

												I really enjoyed this game. It felt very much like a Crystalis throwback (which I've actually played through). I only did one play through and it was on Hard mode.  It was fairly challenging and didn't require too much grinding.  My in game timer was around 4.5 hours when I completed it.The game runs really great.  I never had any crashes or encountered obvious bugs.    It's a great value and I can't wait for the sequel.			"

												Ok, I have to admit for $1.99 I was skeptical as I have played a lot of crappy indie games lately.  However, I am several hours into this game and it is actually quite enjoyable!  Highly recommended especially at only $1.99.  It is very reminiscant of Zelda on the NES, with an interesting plot and good controls especially when using a 360 controller.			"

												Instead of playing as the good guy, in this game, your the evil villian. Not many games let you play as the evil villian in the rpg setting. I can think of Disgaia as one of the games you can play as Laharl , but that is about it. Quite a fun game with cards and achievements in it. Actually, they put the cards and achievements in it after i actually beat the game.I recommend it because you can play as the bad guy in it.			"

												Just finished my first play through of EvilQuest and had a blast. The story was humorous with just enough length to leave you wanting a bit more but not feeling burned once you've reached the end. The graphics and mechanics were beautifully done and respond nicely. Was really happy to see how easily it worked with the Xbox 360 wired controller on PC. Simple plug and play with matching graphics on the UI when using controller. The retro feeling captured in the game was great. Everything from the graphics to the sounds and score. If you're a fan of the older action rpgs for nes/snes then you'll easily find your money's worth in this game. Speaking of money's worth the pricing was excellent in my opinion. Anywho, try the game out - it's good.			"

												Evil Quest was a purchase I made not expecting too much from it, however after just completing it, it was well worth the ride. It's a nice change to play as the bad guy and want to take over and destroy the world for once. This classic SNES type RPG game did everything right for me. It doesn't take itself too seriously, I mean, c'mon,  you have to kill God....Towards the end of the game, I pretty much ripped through any enemies in one shot, you can collect some pretty overpowered spells, and if you are like me, and stacked Intellect to get a higher mana pool, you could simply AOE through most zones, mopping up the experiance as you went. The game is actually pretty simple. As long as you read the story, you won't find yourself wondering where to go next as it is quite clearly set out for you. There isn't any side quests to complete, however there are a number of achivements you work towards. I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something a little different and only want to spend £1,60, you can't go wrong with this five hour long title.			"

												Classic Zelda-like platformer.After a 3-hour playthrough, I came to the conclusion that the game was okay.Its biggest downfall is how imbalanced the magic system is. Cure-3 makes every boss fight completely trivial in that you don't have to dodge all that many things, which should be the whole point of the battle. Personal discipline in not abusing overpowered mechanics can net a lot more enjoyment out of this game.The level up system was also fairly lackluster in that it really feels like an unnecessary feature - the HP stat is statistically garbage, the magic stat can be abused to be overpowered.Those complaints aside, it's a solidly assembled title that works, for its price of $2. If the price were much higher, I'd have probably marked this as a negative review, but $2 is enough to let some non-game-destroying flaws slide, for a game that can offer a decent challenge with mostly working mechanics.

												Now EvilQuest is a game that on the surface, people would love.Why?It's cheap, looks nice for a pixel game and has some decent evil humour in it.Annnnd thats where the good points for me end.I booted up the game and first of all realized you're stuck with 1280x720 or 640x480, not really an issue for me but I thought I would mention it on here. Good news is that controls are rebindable! I would highly recommend this because the default controls are a bit clunky and take some getting used to.My main issue with this game is mostly the combat. The combat in this game feels very... clunky - enemies will hit you and damage you before they've finished their swinging animation, they will instantly change direction mid animation to hit you so don't think that because that big brute is swinging left he won't hit you instantly if you run right! You have 2 basic forms of attack, a melee weapon and magic.Ok, I lied, you have 3 forms of attack, because if you hold Enter (Default attack button) whilst facing an enemy you can charge up a beamlike ranged attack, only issue with this is that it only charges when you're DIRECTLY facing enemies, and with the erratic enemy movement in this game its quite hard to use this, so I mostly stuck with magic and sword.Ok, I lied twice there, I mostly did magic with a side of sword as a playthrough (or majority of a playthrough, still need to finish it) because... well magic (bar the high mana cost, low MP pool even with max int and slow mana regen) was straight up BETTER than hitting people because most magic you get is AoE, and did I mention how enemies loved being ultra tanky and grouping up on you? This along with the aformentioned enemy attack animation make the combat hard AND not satisfying. Another thing is the bosses - none of them have Health Bars which I can see meaning I don't know if I am 20% way through the fight or 80% of the way through the fight.Now this is a game I want to like, it has loads of little nice quirks which I like but the combat, which is a large portion of this game, is so flawed and janky that I can only play this for one level at a time, grinding each area for a couple of level ups ontop of that.All in all, 4/10 - cheap fun flawed by bad combat			"

 EvilQuest  Story The story is about an evil man by the name of ""Galvis"" who wishes to take over the world and crush everyone in his path.in the beginning of the game you see a cutscene where Galvis and his little army of bad soldiers are fighting against the King. He was to weak so he got captured, in his jail he met an old-thief who tells him there is a place where he can find the ultimate wapon named ""the secret power of the four legendary seals (The Astral Realm)"".The goal of the game is for Galvis to take revenge on his captors as well as unlock the secret power of four legendary seals.You start the game in the jail where you kill a soldier wo wants to kill you, because you murderd his family, you have to explore the map, have to go trough sewers to get your ancient weapon named ""the Chaos Axe"" back and then you must fight against a little army of soldiers to get your armor back, now your objective is to kill the King who captured you, but on your way to his room, you must fight his right hand, a huge and strong soldier. after you defeatde him, he blocks the way so you have to go trough the sewers, when you get out of the sewers you traveld to a little village and that's where it al starts. Overview EvilQuest features a wide variety of environments, enemies, and boss creatures – all created in retro style with relax music, good animation and music. In addition to fighting monsters, Galvis will also terrorize the residents of several towns and must avoid imperial agents seeking to re-capture him. In my opinion I really like this game, it's a really good indie game.The gameplay is very fun and the finale is very well made.I would recommend this game for a retro indie game fan, you can loot, discover, and fight many enemies, each enviremont has its own enemies. Pros & Cons  +  Pros + Many enemies.+ You got a level-up system.+ You can play on almost every computer, you don't need a 2k beast game pc to play it.+ It's clear how to play the game, because you get hints.+ Many different attacks.+ It's a cheap game. Cons - a short game, you get quickly through the story (what also could be a good thing) Rating	a  8.5  - you should really played this game, it's only 2,- in the steam store. (now only 0,99,-)If you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow here!  "

												EvilQuest is a satisfying revival of action-adventure RPGs of the 8- and 16-bit. This game reminded me most of Crystalis on the NES, though it also has some similarities to Lagoon on the SNES. The map designs are similar as are some mechanics (jump boots.) Early on, the combat is fairly easy, though you may fail if you attack recklessly. Positioning and timing are most important for success, but, unlike the earlier action-adventure RPGs, enemies appear to have predictable cooldowns on their projectiles and abilities, making it far less likely you'll get surprised. The controls are responsive, however you can perform only one action at a time like in the older games previously mentioned. The one thing that sets it apart is that you can move and turn your character while attacking, allowing you to control quarter- or half-circle sweeps with your weapon; otherwise, every attack is a forward jab. Opponents can do this also, which can catch you off-guard when flanking a foe.While formulaic, it's a tried-and-true recipe. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre and art style.			"

												In short, it's a good game for it's price. But it's just too easy.Story:Not great, it's just the same as a hero saving the world - In reverse! It's about a villain destroying the world. It's predictable, but it's not bad.Graphics and Music:Aren't great either. The graphics represent all they should, but I feel like it's too plain. The designs are good, though, the bosses look awesome. The music is your usual MIDI medieval track. Nothing too shiny.Gameplay:Super simple. I've finished the game in the Hard difficulty in the exact registered play time that I have. In the boss battle, I've only died once, and that was in his first form, just because of a little fumble...There aren't many secrets, and that is a bad thing for me. Just make sure you explore everything and you'll get all the equipment and spells. I've only used the heal spell through the entire game, also.Game Entertainment:The hours that I put into this game didn't feel empty. It's a fun game, but sometimes you feel like an area could have been shorter. But the final boss battle is going to counterbalance any bad things in the game - It's great.Overall:I rate it 9/10. It's not like you can ask more for this price! Just needs more secrets, filling some empty areas, a better looking grass, and it would have been perfect!			"

												A top-down 2D Action-RPG.  The main draw of the game is how over-the-top the protagonist is.  It's not uncommon for you to learn spells and get equipment by threatening some NPC and then after getting said upgrade, to kill them.  The entire game is played out in this tongue-in-cheek manner and I found it amusing enough, though some will no doubt find it to be a bit try hard.The artstyle is crude and bland at times and dungeons are a bit long and boring to traverse, but the dungeons have save points so replaying long stretches of them shouldn't be much of a factor.  Puzzles are rare and quite simple when they show up.  The best aspect of Evil Quest gameplay-wise is how easy it is to become a walking flamethrower.  Magic regenerates over time, so if you level-up and make it a point to pump intelligence, by the halfway point of the game you can constantly spam spells as you walk around and it trivializes most enemies.  I don't find this a downpoint since combat is rather simplistic and mowing down enemies with various spells is fun enough.The game is pretty short, you probably won't end up with more than a half-dozen hours at most on a playthrough, though that's about right and it ended just as I was tiring of it a bit.  I had fun with this and the price point puts you in position of not having much to lose by taking a chance on it.			"

												This is an interesting action RPG its at best, and an annoying Crystalis rip-off with cringe-worthy humor at its worst. A short adventure worth the cheap price. This game is extremely cheap and the premise of playing as a villan is intresting enough, but it's not executed well. The story is a revenge plot about a Dark Knight who is bent on taking over the country, and eventually the world. The dialouge is basic, but you'll probably laugh at how hard the writers tried to make your character ""BADASS and RUTHLESS"" As far as story is concerned, the game isn't too gripping. It's all about the gameplay here, which was a rollercoaster of good and bad core mechanics. You run around the world killing monsters to level up and collect eqipment and spells. The freedom to be more spell or melee focused is satisfying and well appreciated. Your melee attacks can be enhanced with a charge that turns it into a projectile that deals much more damage. Spells are split up into magical categories and the rate at which they are required is steady and unlocking the next magicical ability is genuinely exciting. The combat is engaging and the bosses are designed to accomodate your large arsenal of skills. On the other hand, the normal enemies are laughable and can easily be killed with continous shots from your sword. The pixelated graphics have moderate details, matching 16-bit era games, but the illustrations used for the cutscenes are unsettling to look at. there is something about the style that I just don't find appealing. The music usually fits the mood with a couple of stand-out tracks(The field theme). If you like action RPG's or the game crystalis go ahead and buy the game. it provides a decent 6-9 hours of gameplay and is fairly harmless when you consider it's EXTEREMELY cheap price.			"

												As other reviewers mentioned, EvilQuest has a lot in common with the old NES game Crystalis; plot items are themed after the four elements, mostly linear equipment progression, combat is fast and involves a lot of dodging.EvilQuest is pretty short. I played on Normal, and won the game in only a few hours, and only died once. I'm an RPG veteran, though, so it may provide a greater challenge and maybe an extra hour or two if you aren't as familiar with this type of game.Playing the bad guy is... kinda corny, honestly. The main difference is that you fight a bunch of ""good"" guys and that you backstab almost everyone after they help you. The story is eh, but it doesn't get in the way of the action, so it could be worse.Overall, EvilQuest is a great buy. At such a low price, it's hard not to recommend it.			"

												A fun little game where YOU ARE THE BAD GUY!Graphics:The graphics are colorful, but simple looking.  All look handdrawn in a paint program, but the detail is good.  All of the sprites, special attacks and certain backgrounds are well animated.  But the bright colors do get hard on the eys after a while.Sound:The sound is decent, but the music kinda bland and reused in some parts.  Not really memorable.Control:The controls were decent enough and I had no problems with it.Gameplay:Despite it's look, the gameplay is good.  You get MANY different attacks to use, from charging your wapon for a LoZ-style ranged attack to screen-wide magic attacks.  You can also set certain  items for a quick slot of easy use during heated battles.  Also, most battles are a challenge without being cheap.  Never do you feel the need to grind to beat the boss because if you just kill the enemies you see on the way, you will be fine.  But money will be an issue when you want (and need) certain spells and armor.  The Cure spells are a MUST!  But most of the important attack spells are given to you.  The story of this game is, despite it's premise, very hilarious and the writing had me smiling.This game made me enjoy being an evil♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  I like that.			"

												I really enjoyed playing Evil Quest. It sort of reminded me of some of the older Zelda games in the sense that you charge up your attack, and release like you do in say Link to the Past.It has some minor rpg elements implemented too. You more or less go through each dungeon killing mobs, and then fight a boss to move on to the next area. I had so much fun on my first play through I actually did a second one to get the rest of the achievements I was missing. It's not an overly difficult game, but it is a fun casual game to play in between longer games. It took me about 10-12 hours for my first play through exploring, and grinding. My second took less than 8 on the hardest difficulty as magic, and health as my main stats. It's worth playing through at least once.			"

												EvilQuest is a fun Action RPG in a 16 bit SNES style, similar to games like Zelda.  Story wise the big difference is this time rather than trying to stop the generic EVIL bad guy bent on world domination you play as the EVIL bad guy bent on world domination.  The story is fine and the EVIL twist makes it all feel fresh even though its about as simple as a RPG story gets. The gameplay consists of attacking enemies with swords and such, holding down the attack button for a projectile attack, and some different magic attacks that you can find while exploring, or buy if you save up enough gold.  There are plenty of armor pieces to find to make you stronger, and accessories that make you more powerful in various ways, even a cape that makes you invisible.  The graphics look good for a 16 bit style, some of the enemies are merely reskined as you progress in the game, but others like dragons and ghost make for a nice visual treat as you make your way thru the game.  The levels are all based on elements like fire and water and look and play nice enough with just enough exploration to give the game some meat.  My only complaint is enemies respawn after you slightly move away from an area, so you can't clear a level per say, the enemies are always respawning.  This dose give you plenty of opportunity to gain exp points and level up, but as the game wares on it all gets a bit repetitive, but at about 5 hrs for a diligent explorer EvilQuest isn’t long enough for this to become a problem.Overall EvilQuest is a very fun ARPG that lets you experience the generic RPG story of those 90ies RPG's from the eyes of the bad guy and plays like a dream.  For the cost of less than a gallon of gas (in the US at least) this game is an absolute steel and should be played by anyone who likes Zelda like ARPG's or wants to be EVIL.			"

												I love this game. Truly for the price of a cup of coffee, you cannot go wrong. this is a great game that I one day deiced to buy just for the heck of it. I love it! my two VERY MINOR complaints and these aren't even deal breakers or game breakers. One: The hit boxes can sometimes seem a bit jankey/ or weird. Two... at times there seems to be a bit of a lag in between spells/ Basic attacks. but even then. Devs. keep em in. it kind of really adds to the charm and reminds me of the days sitting in my basement playing on my NES. get this game you will not be disappointed. yes it can seem a bit repetitive at times. but still it is just a really fun game and it's kind of a hidden gem here on steam. It also doesn't hurt that you are the bad guy. not bad guy turned good, but you PLAY the bad guy, your job is to destory the world and have them all kneel before you.			"

A lot of games claim to be retro, but that one could definitely be in a NES cart... It sure has a few drawbacks, but don't every game from that golden era has?The only ""real"" miss for me is the music, it's too stock.It's on sale now with a few other games on Flying Bundle for a minimum of $2.50.

												EvilQuest is an action adventure RPG in a retro style. It comes off as something like a late NES or early SNES/Genesis title... if that perspective helps. You are a very powerful, evil dude that gets betrayed by his army and locked up. However, you escape captivity and go on a quest to regain your mighty power and ultimately seek to destroy God himself. Sounds pretty cool, right?You basically go around overworlds seeking towns and dungeons. You can do some generally mean things along the way, but you're focus is to find four elemental things and then go to the final area once the barrier is broken. It's some standard, by the books stuff. But it works. Along the way, you fight through monsters and bosses in a Zelda-esque fashion. Defeating them will net you gold, which can be used to purchase equipment to make yourself stronger and items to recover from loss of health, loss of magic, or status ailments. As you progress, you'll find stronger weapons and different spells to help you tackle your foes. Also gained from defeated enemies are experience points. Getting enough of these will allow you to level up. Upon gaining a level, you have the option to distribute a number of points into whichever stats you see fit. This can be fun for building a specific way for different playthroughs. Want to beef up your magic skills? Maybe you want to deal mighty blows with your weapons. Or perhaps you just want to be a well rounded warrior. It's nice for some customization and replay value, yet not too complicated as to overwhelm the player. I also would like to point out that I thought the music was alright, but I do enjoy the art style quite a bit. Guess I'm a softy for that kind of thing. However, every game has its faults, as does EvilQuest. I can't complain too much with the main character being bad, as it is not often done still and keeps things a bit interesting. I guess I just wish they had maybe gone a little further with that idea. Maybe that's just me. My biggest complain comes from some expectations that were built up a bit and never capitalized on. Near the start of the game you get the charge ability, letting you shoot a projectile from your weapon at no cost to magic. You then use this to hit a switch through a wall and open a gate. A little while later is a switch puzzle, where some need to be up and some need to be down. Ithought this would mean there would be cool puzzle elements throughout the game like in Zelda games. However, there weren't much more like that to be found. I guess I was hoping it'd break up some of the grinding and killing, but I guess I didn't need to grind so that part was my own fault. My most minor and rather meaningless complaint is that, in order to get all the achievements, you have to play the game twice. Yet there seems to be only one achievement that absolutely forces you to do it. The one based on difficulty. If you play on normal, you have to beat it again on hard. Also, if you play it on easy, you'll get no achievement, which doesn't make much sense. But it's all in the achievements so it's really not even an issue with the game itself. Hardly worth mentioning but... I did. So... sorry.It's a cool retro-inspired action adventure RPG. If you like Zelda games and the RPG leveling stuff, give it a look. The game is only two bucks normally, and even less when it goes on sale. It's very much worth the price. This could possibly have passed for a ten dollar game, five at the least. But the fact that it's only two bucks makes it hard to pass up. Sure, it could use some more stuff in it, but the things included are good, especially for that asking price. So go ahead and get your copy. Forget the hesitation and go for it.EvilQuest gets a 6/10. Everything is solid. It may not be the longest, most fleshed out, or most impressive, but what it does offer is quite a good experience and well worth the price.			"

TBH ive thought for a while now games where you get to play the bad guy are quite rare, and its a style id like to see done more often. While this game is not the most polished or perfect game, it is very fun to play through, it gives nice chalanges, has an art style while not amazing is quite pleasent to look at, and the gameplay works well for what it has, and has no real glitchs that ive seen.  It is made to be remincent of old school JRPGs from the snes era and it does a good job invoking that. its a very fun game thats well worth your time :)			"

												In most games you play as a wonderful hero slaying villains and saving princesses.If you go into this game with that line of thought, prepare for the biggest disappointment of your life.EvilQuest has you playing as Galvis (or The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to some, I kid you not), a fiendish man trying to dominate the world. He's stopped by men in the beginning but since when has a villain ever been fully stopped by someone exactly once? Gameplay is incredibly similar to the NES/GBC game Crystalis, which was lauded in its time as one of the best games made. The reason I was drawn to it is playing as the villain for once in my life. The game is very tropetastic, but in an elegant, dastardly way worthy of your best evil laugh.I'd give it a 9.5/10 personally, the only points off being that it does become predictable, but hey, I'd wager the 2$ cost it's worth that value many times over.

												I never played Crystalis on the original NES, but after playing through this title, I wish I had.  This game is your classic retro RPG that harkens back to the NES or Super NES era.  This game won't blow you away with a deep story, insightful dialogue, or an inventive combat system, but if you want something simple to get into and is easy to play, you could spend your money on much worse games.You play the role of the bad guy for once on a quest to ultimately destroy the world.  The game can be beaten in under 10 hours if you aim to race through, and offers enough content for that time for a worthwhile experience IF you are into this genre (I am).  If you dig the 8 and 16 bit RPG titles of old, this is recommended.Best of all, this game is GREAT value for the money ($1.99).  I am eager to see what the developers come up with next.			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/evilquest-first-impressions/EvilQuest is a fantastic retro RPG, reminiscent of the early SNES RPGs.EvilQuest takes a different approach on story, with you being the villain instead of the hero, with your objective being to enslave the world (heh). The game plays like any other from the genre, with nothing really special to it. I did notice some rather clunky movement, especially from the enemies. They were a bit difficult to actually hit without taking damage yourself. You'll need to back up after every attack if you wish to kill an enemy. Some sort of knock back would have been appreciated.Although it may be generic, it's not to the point where I don't recommend it.			"

Is this a quality game? Yes. 2. Is it lengthy? For this type of game, yeah. 3. Does the game/development seem amateurish? Not at all. 4. Is this Crystalis 2? No. It shares some menus, graphics, and gameplay features, but this has it's own thing going on. With that said, if you were ever wanting a Crystalis sequel, well, this filled that need for me.5. Why is it only $2? I don't know, but don't let that throw you off. It's not cheap because it's bad, ""too indy"", or plain not good enough to charge a higher price. Don't question it. We got lucky. If this is your type of game, I highly recommend EvilQuest. The price makes this one an easy choice.			"

												It feels repetative when playing. You can get bored over the course of a 20 minute play session, but something keeps bringing me back. Play style is NOT zelda-esque. Other than camera and combat, there are very few similarities. EvilQuest is incredibly linear, you need to do the temples in a specific order, it won't even let you in to the temple before you have the required items. The temples are also linear, you keep going through a specific path until you get the item that lets you into the next dungeon. It is however, strangely addicting and the price is hard to argue with.			"

												This game is a little entertaining, and short. But not good. Without going out of my way to look up the creators' bios, I'm going to say that this is an early effort from a couple of guys who wanted to create a whole game by themselves--design, programming, art, and music--but who weren't experts at any of the above. This is the kind of game you'd expect to find as a curiosity in the ""early portfolio"" section of someone's website while they keep working to develop more mature work. I'm kind of surprised it's up for sale.The art is dull. You'll see every enemy type in the first couple of dungeons, and then it's palette swaps for the rest of the game. Environments, level designs, all forgettable. Bosses are a little bit interesting to look at, but not much.The music is poorly produced and forgettable.The writing is simply miserable. There is no reason to care about the plot or any of the characters. There are no funny or clever lines.The gameplay is tolerable. Controls are generally responsive. But there's nothing to keep you interested. Enemies either rush you or rush you and shoot at you. You respond by whacking them with a sword or axe that doesn't feel all that satisfying to swing, and occasionally with long-cooldown spells. You get periodic armor upgrades that are strictly numbers-up, no gameplay changes or new character art, and a handful of weapons that all do the same thing. I never got frustrated playing, but I never got excited either.I suggest passing on this one.			"

												A really nice top-down 2D ARPG that is reminiscent of Sword of Mana and Legend of Zelda games. This is an indie game developed by maybe 5 people judging by end credits scroll. Pros:+ Nostalgic-feeling callback to early-90's games+ Full controller support and audio options+ Replayability through harder difficulty mode and different stat builds*+ Save states*In order to reach an achievement:  You have to level up one of your 4 level up stats to 35, for each achievement  which is impossible to achieve in one playthrough, where having save states helps.Cons:- Skill level in art/design of the game leaves some weird choices in full display (Cutscene eyes, character model's feet)- One or two songs on the soundrtack that are a bit too manic- Game balance falls off toward the end when you have become a walking apocalypse, though that's not to say it isn't enjoyable.I feel like this is one of the better options available for people that want a nostalgic-feeling game to play for a few hours. There may not be as many secrets or as much replay value as Shovel Knight, but that was developed by a much larger team, as well as having more inside. I feel like Evil Quest has about 4 hours of content for the main game, but it is easily worth 20+ hours of your time if you are a completionist, or just want to experience the game over again.Final Verdict:7.8/10 - Occasional cringy-looking art and crazed fast-paced music are the only complaints to be found with this title.

												First of all, I had to think long and hard about whether to give this an overall thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  I finally concluded that since I put in the time to not only finish it but get all achievements, and for all its faults it was only made by two guys it seems so it's somewhat forgivable, that it had *just slimly* earned a thumbs-up.  That being said...WHAT THIS GAME IS:An action-RPG straight from the NES era, very specifically based heavily on Crystalis to the point at which it's basically a poor man's copycat of that game in every way.  I would suggest skipping this and going to play Crystalis if you like the basic gameplay but want to waste as little time as possible, but if you love Crystalis and want more just like that you might as well give this game a try.  When all's said and done, the gameplay itself is actually quite fun with some fairly well-designed boss battles.WHAT THIS GAME IS NOT:Deep in any way, shape or form.  The artwork is laughable, the music is horrendous (some of the worst I've ever heard in any game, indie or not; do your ears a favor and turn it down on the main options screen before you even start your game) and the story is nonexistant.  Oh, sure, it has the barest-bones skeleton of what could have been a unique story, taking the role of a villain rather than a hero on a quest to destroy the world rather than save it, but the entire thing is presented in such a paltry manner it would be considered mind-numbingly boring and predictable even by 80s video game writing standards.  And if you're looking for some kind of character depth or heel-face turn or the actions of your character to mean anything beyond basic evil instincts, look elsewhere.  This game's all about being utterly and remorselessly evil, your character starts out as a more twisted take on a Saturday morning cartoon villain and only gets more evil from there.Aside from the fact that I feel the art, music and writing are all inadequate even for an indie game made by two dudes, the attempts at humor fall short and there's a bit much killing and implied♥♥♥♥♥♥for a game that's meant to be a throwback to the simple, charming early era of Japanese RPGs.  Again, it teeters ever-so-closely to the edge of getting a thumbs-down; however, that basic element of gameplay is fun enough, especially for an action-RPG junkie like me, that it's the game's saving grace.There are myriad ways in which this could have been done better, even with such a small team and null-budget; the most fitting comparison I can think of is Breath of Death VII, which is a similar type of NES RPG throwback that had a bit more competence put in the art, MUCH more care and attention put into the music, and writing that doesn't nearly mar the experience with the mentality of a 14-year-old boy who draws dudes getting disemboweled in his spare time; in fact, the follow-up to BoD, Cthulhu Saves the World, displays a much less clashingly unpleasant idea of a villain bent on world-destruction being the hero; it's played up in a much more over-the-top and cartoonish way that fits this style of game much more than the weirdly grisly and depressing 'evil guy' outlook deployed here.  But I'm getting off-track.Basically, its quality is sub-bargain-bin in almost every way, it's as deep as a dried-up puddle and it's quite short at that (over half my 'gameplay time' here is leaving the game on AFK, and that's with going through it twice for all achievements) but the basic elements of gameplay are so fun in a simple and straightforward kind of way that if you're into this kind of thing you'll probably find it worth the asking price, ideally if it's on sale.  The main point to take from this review is ""these guys can and should do better next time, but they're on the right track"".			"

												It feels repetative when playing. You can get bored over the course of a 20 minute play session, but something keeps bringing me back. Play style is NOT zelda-esque. Other than camera and combat, there are very few similarities. EvilQuest is incredibly linear, you need to do the temples in a specific order, it won't even let you in to the temple before you have the required items. The temples are also linear, you keep going through a specific path until you get the item that lets you into the next dungeon. It is however, strangely addicting and the price is hard to argue with.			"

												In most games you play as a wonderful hero slaying villains and saving princesses.If you go into this game with that line of thought, prepare for the biggest disappointment of your life.EvilQuest has you playing as Galvis (or The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to some, I kid you not), a fiendish man trying to dominate the world. He's stopped by men in the beginning but since when has a villain ever been fully stopped by someone exactly once? Gameplay is incredibly similar to the NES/GBC game Crystalis, which was lauded in its time as one of the best games made. The reason I was drawn to it is playing as the villain for once in my life. The game is very tropetastic, but in an elegant, dastardly way worthy of your best evil laugh.I'd give it a 9.5/10 personally, the only points off being that it does become predictable, but hey, I'd wager the 2$ cost it's worth that value many times over.

												EvilQuest is a serious tribute to that great NES classic, Crystalis (known as ""God Slayer"" in its native Japan).  In fact, it is modeled so closely upon that game in terms of both graphical style and mechanics that it can almost be taken for a late sequel . . . almost.  For you see, instead of a cryogenically frozen, pink-clad Hero of Legend, you play as Galvis, a sadistic purple b*stard who gut stabs anyone who slightly annoys him as he pursues his dream of killing God and destroying the world.  I thought playing a nasty dude to be refreshing initially, but when all was said and done, I found being an evil d*** to be a bit unsatisfying.  Don't imagine from my whining that the creators are out to make a serious statement or anything; EvilQuest's tone is rather airy on purpose, with the game itself being a humorously literal take-off on Crystalis' Japanese title.  I guess I just really like good guys (flawed good guys being the best).I recommend the game heartily though, since it is cheap, neat-looking and packed with terrific boss fights.  I'll probably play the sequel.  Oh, and you should definitely play the game on hard if you have beaten Crystalis.			"

												EvilQuest is an amazing trip down memory lane and something new at the same time.  Sure, the anti-hero thing has been done before, but this game just makes it fit the time period it's paying homage to.  The gameplay is perfect:  Basic systems and ideas, like the originals back in the day, with responsiveness and ease of use not seen back then.  EvilQuest is, in my mind, what a retro game should be.			"

												For those looking for a game similar to Crystalis on the NES then you've found that game, as it is throwback to that game and those similar to it. Being able to charge up your weapon to release stronger blasts of pure energy (depending on the type of the weapon) which can be used to damage enemies from afar, though the gameplay feels a bit sort of like Legend of Zelda, as well as you'll be trying to dodge various spells or other projectiles to make sure you don't die. While the game is fairly short, it is overall really fun and there are many Steam achivements to be earned (even for beating both Normal and Hard mode). I can recommend this game, but probably only if you see a Steam sale going out for it.			"

												EvilQuest - you're probably thinking: an RPG about a dude, who is evil and maybe wants to rule the world. Well, you couldn't be more right. The main character, who is this ""bad guy"" is actually an interesting character to play as and the story does a good job at making you feel sorry for him, along with other emotions, based on how he responds to certain situations. Some are flat-out hillarious and some moments are emotional to observe. What you won't feel sorry for, is your keyboard, when you try and attack with it's specific controls/abilities. That being said, the humour which follows is definitely one of a kind. Well written and the artwork isn't so bad. 60/100.			"

And it will be great. If any one has heard of the retro classic Crystalis, and if you have ever liked it, or any of the numerious action RPGs like it. Then EvilQuest is a no brainer. Controlls that work perfectly every time (even on the lack luster XBox 360 controller). And retro graphics that feel right at home with the game play they give you. This is a must buy for any RPG loving Anti-Hero.			"

												This game is a little entertaining, and short. But not good. Without going out of my way to look up the creators' bios, I'm going to say that this is an early effort from a couple of guys who wanted to create a whole game by themselves--design, programming, art, and music--but who weren't experts at any of the above. This is the kind of game you'd expect to find as a curiosity in the ""early portfolio"" section of someone's website while they keep working to develop more mature work. I'm kind of surprised it's up for sale.The art is dull. You'll see every enemy type in the first couple of dungeons, and then it's palette swaps for the rest of the game.

												I thought it would be more humorous in it's take on you playing a villain, like Overlord or at least have it be justified. It's not, it's a mirthless quest of a complete psychopath. It's basically a 16 bit version of Hatred but fantasy based. I felt no drive to continue the story as it wasn't a grey and grey scenario with you playing the villain fighting against an equally villainous regime, you're the bad guy. Your character states it cleanly several times he just wants to kill everyone and make as many people suffer as possible. And that just rubs me the wrong way really. Then again I'm the kind of guy who can't play Dark Side in the Knights of the Old Republic games. It feels like a mean-spirited reskin of Crystalis now that I really think about it. Nah, I wouldn't say this is a bad game or even badly made but it's definitely not for me. Grab if you don't mind being a virtual omnicidal maniac however.			"

												Decent little indie game. Not bad for two bucks. It reminds of that NES game Crystalis... even the overworld music pays a small homage by remixing it a bit... they didn't think I'd notice. :P It's a bit of a twist on the old cliche tale of good vs. evil as you're basically playing as the bad guy in this game and everything and everyone is trying to stop you from taking over the world... but you're the hero so that's not going to happen. :)Veteren's of the genre won't have much trouble completing it as it's a fairly straight forward, casual romp with a quest log to keep track of events as you progress. As long as you have some what of a decent memory for things, you shouldn't need any help... and trust me you're not going to get any... it's not the most popular game in the world atm. :PIt's a bit on the casual side for me though. I played it on the hard setting and used a caster build of straight magic / defense and that seemed to dominate the game quite easily. I guess if you're looking for more of a challenge, play a melee build instead. The game also allows for potion spamming so as long as you're stocked up, you really can't be defeated.

												I can appreciate what the creator was going for here, but it misses the mark.  This feels, looks, and plays like a sophmoric classroom game project rather than a real project.  I really wanted to like this after hearing recommendations that it's similar to Crystalis (one of my top 10 games of all time).  The animations and controls are far from many ARPGs on even the NES (like Crystalis).I'd love to see more games along this vein though.  Hopefully Chaosoft Games has more talent working on these very rough edges for their next entry.			"

												If you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons with a person who insisted on playing a Chaotic Evil character you'll understand how frustrating the choices the main character makes. You'll threaten to kill people unless they give you things then kill them anyway. I understand that's what the game is about, playing a very evil man, but that brand of unfettered evil get's very boring and one-dimentional very quickly. The animation is another thing all together but it's only $1.99. Even though it's very inexpensive, I can't honestly recomend it.			"

												The ""It's $2!!"" excuse doesn't work if the game would only be considered mediocre at best if it was free....The first thing you notice right off the bat is the music. They are MIDIs. Oh wait, sorry. They're MP3s of MIDIs recorded using the default Windows soundfont. So you can't even use something like TiMIDIty++ or BassMidi to make them sound at least somewhat decent.The next issue is the main character. The whole gimmick of the game is ""play the villain"". By villian, it means ""horrible psychopathic murderer"". Seriously, there is no depth to the character at all. No tragic backstory, just ""let's destroy the world because why not"". There is no motivation for playing as him. You don't root for the guy at all. He literally kills people for no reason.The graphics are nothing special. Just your usual ""retro 8-bit"" fare. What you see is what you get.The controls are horribly inconsistant, especially in the menus. Sometimes escape exits the menu, sometimes it doesn't. You press 'e' to open your equipment, but can't press 'e' again to close it. The in-game controls are also slightly unresponsive. It does mess you up slightly, but it isn't god awfully unplayable. Also, the best part about the controls is that you can see an enlarged view of the map by pressing 'm'. Except, you can't pause the game with the map up at the same time, making it almost useless.The biggest flaw by far is the linearity of the game. There are no sidequests (I don't count achievements because they don't give you anything special in-game). There are also no real ""transitions"" to the different areas. You just wander around and beat dungeon after dungeon. This is probably why the game takes only around 2 or so hours to beat. There is next to zero real backtracking (which would be good if the game wasn't horrifically short). The only other real thing to go do is to get some hidden treasures (which really aren't that hidden).The last thing of note is the uselessness of 90% of your items. Your charge shots can hit switches from far away. How many switches do you need to hit? One. The charge shot itself is also useless 90% of the time as well because you have to charge while standing still. The damage output isn't great either. The only real use is when you have to because the enemy is far away and you're waiting for your MP to regenerate. You later get the ability to jump. How many times do you need to jump? About twice. You later get running shoes, except you have to hold down alt of all things to use them. The uselessness expands to the towns as well. There are inns, but I have no idea what they do because I've never once needed to use one. The only thing you need from towns are potions. The armor you can get there you can usually get a few minutes of play later from a chest. Spells are next to useless to buy. You get most of them in game, and the ones you don't are obsolete or never really used. The major exception are the cure spells.Avoid forever			"

												The game plays a lot like Crystalis for the NES except not as polished.  The artwork looks like it was done in MSPaint and the gameplay isn't very engaging.  The game isn't very challenging as long as you keep your distance and learn to use the heal spell.  Your magic constantly regenerates and is a bit overpowered.  The game was done in XNA, but it looks like it could have been accomplished in RPG Maker.  I would skip this unless you really are craving a NES styled Action RPG and you don't have anything else you could put $2 towards.			"

												EvilQuest's plot is exactly the contrary of most of these types of 16-bit RPG's. Instead of being the classic hero that saves the day and everybody's lifes, you are Galvis, an evil being that aims to devoir the world and everybody's existence in it. The gameplay is pretty much hack and slash, with the ability of casting spells and charging your melee attack, making it a  powerful ranged shot. Trading cards are available and achievements are not hard to obtain, but may require a bit of grinding. All and all, if you don't mind the 16-bit graphics, EvilQuest will entertain you for some 6-8 hours, depending on how many playthroughs you'll end up doing. Recommend it!			"

Defeated in combat after sudden but inevitable betrayal the dark lord Galvis is captured and thought defeated.  No prison can hold this much evil and he soons breaks free to seek his revenge.A top down action RPG tasks the player with scouring the land looking for ways to regain his lost power at all costs.  The story is a dreary sluggish affair that takes itself way to serious for the visual style of the game.Gameplay is serviceable but analog movement with attacks only on the cardinal directions leads to many awkward misses.  Progression is marred by a heavy requirement of grinding which drains much of the joy from the game.			"

												Evil Quest isn't terrible. But that's really all there is to say. It's playable if you like top-down action RPGs. The combat isn't inspired, and the hitboxes take some getting used to (it's bigger than it looks on your sprite). Attacking is a bit tedious, and magic, especially early on, consumes so much of your meter and takes so long to recharge that you'll find yourself using the first spell, Ice 1, through most of the game, just because it's cheaper to cast. Heal 3 makes the game trivially easy. Once you get that (you can get it just before the ice dungeon), you can almost instantly heal up from any attacks, and unless you get overwhelmed by a rapid assault, nothing will kill you. The final boss can be defeated by standing still and spamming projectiles and healing, even in the hardest difficulty. Hard difficulty is barely that. The only difference is that enemies have tons more health and do a little more damage, meaning fights take longer and you have to heal more often.The characters are one-note and repetative. Your main character has only one mood, angry, and he will resort to murder for virtually every situation. Even some potential allies wind up being killed for essentially no reason. The main character's motivation is nothing more complex than ""destroy the world"". So yes, in that it features a quest of an evil character, this is an evil quest. However, that is all it is. The other NPCs come in two types: ""I will kill you, you monster!"" and ""Please don't murder me, Mr. Bad Guy!"". You will always kill the first type, and usually kill the second type. That's it. There is nothing more interesting to the plot.If you can get this game on some crazy sale, you may as well, if you wanna kill a few hours. I got it for about a dollar. If you can't get it for less than 3 bucks, don't bother, because you won't get much back.			"

												Ehhhh...For the price, sure, pick it up, but Evil Quest isn't a game I'm really thrilled over.  It scratched my Crystalis itch, but it's...pretty weak.  Galvis, the 'hero"" is pure evil.  Not even funny evil.  Just jerky evil.  And I find it kinda boring, honestly.  Kudos to them for being so committed to it, but it's a stock 2-3 hour quest of one guy to destroy the whole damn world.  Like Crystalis, only nowhere near as polished, fun, or interesting.Gameplay is shallow, graphics are below the standards of flash, story is unfun and unenjoyable...Music is awesome though.  The music in this game blows me away with how close to real retro fun it gets.Evil Quest isn't a good game by any means.  The music is great, everything else is pretty weak, and you are literally pure, unironic, un fun evil.  But for the price...?  Yeah, sure, there are worse ways to spend that money.  Get a small fries instead of a large and use that extra money to buy Evil Quest.			"

The pre generated SFXR sound effects, and mp3 versions of midi music that aren't even composed by someone that has a ear for music. sounds like they took some random midi song and ran it thru GXSCC. Which would be fine for alpha testing. Animations are crap, but not expecting it to be amazing. It just feels unfinished really.

												An old-school Action-RPG, top-down view, and you get to play the badguy.Suggested for:-Those who live and breath nostalgia for the NES/SNES days.-Those who wants to be a villainous protagonist.My Favorite Pros:-...My Annoyed-At Cons:-Controls are not tight at all.-Dialogue is poorly written, with overuse of exclamation points!-Makes me miss actually good SNES games.-The best evil characters believe themselves to be the hero, like Magneto from X-Men or Light from Death Note.  This game is not the case.  It uses 'Evil for the sake of evil' logic that I find annoying to where... well, I could not play long enough through the game to find out if anything different would come out of it.-I doubt any good story would come out of this, considering the immature style of dialogue with too many exclamation points!

												The Good: It's not a terrible retro RPG. If you want it to be EXACTLY like it used to be, you'll probably be happy.The Bad: The default control scheme for pure keyboard is made for someone with more than two hands. Instead of using WASD or Directional keys and clustering the actual controls together, they're all over the keyboard: Enter/Return is attack, Z is magic, X is equipped item. Additionally the equipment screen is E while the rest of the menus are on Escape. The tutorial mentions the mouse controls, and they, at least, seem sane.The Ugly: Save points. I don't care how retro you're going, save points are a design sin. "

												Don't believe the reviews, this game is awful.  Short, yet feels super repetitive with it's uninspired maps and palette-swapped enemies.  A combat system that hold no balance at all, and doesn't even offer fun through experimentation since everything is so samey.  Plinky, bad music and terrible art (except for some sprite-work).  It's a terrible veneer of a game that doesn't even properly cover the systems that it's built on top of.Ignoring the story, this game is just baby's first XBLIG that somehow got on Steam just like a bad Minecraft clone would.  While it doesn't cost much money, I still don't think it's worth the cost in time.  But with a story that brings teenage angst to shame, it's just a mess that tries to be too edgy while ignoring any interesting conflict or ideas that might arise from it.			"

												The sole reason for the negative vote is the control scheme. Movement is standard WASD or arrows, but then Enter to attack and Z/X for magic/items. I just couldn't get used to it, and there's no option to rebind keys. There's obviously fun to be had, and I would like to finish this game, but with the controls as they are I just can't. With the option to customize the controls, and I would totally recommend it.			"

The animations are ugly, the music is forgettable, the plot is played way too straight, the controller controls are a bit clunky and sometimes glitchy, and the little humor it has falls terribly flat.

												As a fan of old-school action-RPG games, I can say that this game really delivers on all fronts.  The fighting is smooth and responsive, the spells look and feel powerful and the weapons are awesome as well.  While I do wish that Galvis' armor would change the look for each type he equips, it's a small gripe compared to what the rest of the game offers.  If you're a fan of old-school action-RPG games, or a fan of old-school games in general then this is a highly recommended buy from me.  And at only  $1.99 you can't go wrong.For those who may be concerned about the length I wouldn't worry.  There's a slew of achievements for this to lengthen the game and so far I'm having a blast getting them all.  Kudos to the devs on this game!  More please!			"

												Ok, I finished this one in under 4 hrs. Not a bad little game, wish it was a little longer and a little better in the dialogue department.  I see other reviews complaining about the hitboxes and other issues but it was certainly no worse than some of the first Zelda-ish type games we used to see. Now, is that a bad thing? Depends. I did not pay much for the game and for what I paid I can forgive a few missed hits here and there. It's better than I could make for sure and the story did make sense for the most part. All in all I would recommend it if you are looking for a fun little game. It's simple, fun, and actually humorous in places. Is it perfect? No. But it is fun and worth the 4hrs spent. I'd like to see more and with a bit more complexity!			"

												If you have ever played the NES game Crystalis then this game should feel right at home with you. The gameplay is what makes this game fun, but it's really short, though to be fair it's also really cheap so I'll let it pass.What I can't let pass though, is that the Designs for the stages and especially the characters differ from bland to out right ugly, the stage designs could have also been better and more varied.I only found two music tracks that I enjoyed in this game (the starting screen and the last stage), but most of them could have been great songs melody wise, if they weren't composed with some really bland sounding music maker program sounds or something like that.I still recommend this though, it's really cheap and is pretty fun gameplay wise, just don't get your hopes up for a grand spiritual sequel to Crystalis. And yes you are actually playing the bad guy to the very end.			"

Although EvilQuest isn't quite as breathtaking as its counterpart, it is much better than the GBC port Crystalis got (many fans of the original Crystalis were disappointed with its GBC port). EvilQuest isn't the most challenging game (only takes about 4 or 5 hours to complete, and all the healing you can do is pretty broken), but for such a cheap price I'm not going to complain.			"

												This game is a classic 2d RPG. There was nothing too spectacular about the story. The towns, scripting, npcs, and dialog were decently done. My dislike would be the boring-ness of the trash mobs enemies - the unoriginality, and their weak AI.The maps outside of the towns were also unoriginal and felt like simple paths.Boss fights were scripted well and were a delight to play. Items/Skills management was also enjoyable to use and the Stats management UI had no issues.I would recommend this game 7/10, only if you can get this for really cheap.			"

												This is a Zelda style game. It's also incredibly easy. Play on difficult if you have played any video game ever.Enemy AI, if you can even call it that, is so bad that you can easily approach and attack things with no danger. They are super generous with the amount of healing items you find as well, which you don't really need unless something weird happens.The last boss is God, and he was hitting me for 0 damage with most of his attacks. I just spammed my basic attack on nearly every boss in the game, not even caring if I was getting hit. They'd usually die before I had lost 25% hp.Still, it's like .99 cents, so why not.			"

												EvilQuest is a beautifully crafted little indie title, which plays in a style reminiscent of old school top-down action RPGs such as the original Zelda games. Rather than colleting the various gadgets which are the hallmark of Zelda however, the protagonist of EvilQuest primarily develops an arsenal of powerful spells, as well as steadily improving weapons and armour.The other main difference, of course, is one of tone! As you might imagine from the title, the theme of EvilQuest is a decidedly dark one. We follow the story of an aspiring evil overlord, Galvis. Players will control Galvis as he slaughters his way across the continent, steadily gaining power as he quests to breach a set of ancient seals, obtain a legendary evil weapon, travel to the astral plane, challenge God and destroy the world. All in a day’s work, eh?The mainstay of EvilQuest is the combat, which is a solid offering. As a traditional top-down fighter, Galvis can move and attack along the four cardinal directions with melee or charge for a ranged attack. The combat therefore revolves around cleverly outmanoeuvring your enemies, so that you can open opportunities to strike them without being stuck yourself. It all feels very solid and responsive, and as such I never recalled feeling that a death was unfair. And  rest assured, death is a very real option. The enemies do deal significant damage, especially in higher difficulties, making skilful evasion an important factor.Galvis also gains access to a steadily increasing selection of potent magic with which to mix things up. The spells are all creative and interesting, each having different tactical traits in addition to an elemental affinity, which meant that I found uses for all of them throughout the game. I particularly liked that higher level spells were, by and large, different enough from their predecessors that both spells retained some utility. Magic uses up quite a bit of MP, meaning that while spells are potent, you will also struggle to spam them continually (at least until late game), which forces you to balance your combat wisely.The game also includes a fairly standard RPG level up system, which allows you to customize Galvis’ focus a bit. Coupled with gear and spells, this makes for a straightforward but robust development mechanic. You begin the game clad in rags and armed only with a shiv, but by endgame you will be mowing through hordes of enemies that once gave you trouble. It’s all very satisfying, and mirrors Galvis’ rise to power nicely.Without a doubt, the greatest highlight of EvilQuest is the colourful boss battles. Each one is built up nicely so that it feels unique and climactic, and the attacks used by the boss are creative and varied, testing you on skills or knowledge you have picked up, and very much rewarding skilful play. A couple of the late game bosses fall to resorting to attacks which are impossible to avoid (or at least I couldn’t find a way to), however this only slightly took the edge off of the fun that these epic conflicts otherwise provided.The story is simple, but does the job well enough. The dark tone is carried well, and there are a couple of little unexpected twists along the way, which I enjoyed. It would have been nice to have learned a bit more about Galvis’ background and the source of his motivations, but all in all, the plot is sufficient for the length and depth of the game.On the topic of length, if you’re thorough with the game, expect a single play through to last somewhere in the region of 10 hours. It’s a fairly short game which doesn’t stretch itself out needlessly and can certainly be blasted through in a weekend. That said, quality is definitely the focus over quantity here, and given the very reasonable retail price of EvilQuest, I have been extremely satisfied that I had my money’s worth here.The sound is also worthy of mention. The SFX are simple and basic, but serve their purpose fine. The music is certainly worth a nod, as the soundtrack is above-average and I very much enjoyed it.All in all then, I thoroughly recommend EvilQuest. If you’re looking for a short, enjoyable romp with robust gameplay, and are tired of playing the hero all the time, you will certainly get your money’s worth from the very reasonably priced EvilQuest.

												Plays very much like an early ( 1990-1992 ) action RPG game on SNES, and has a twisted sense of humor.  I like it, even if the game is campy and simple - it tickles the nostalgia bone so well.			"

												Evil quest was fun, you'll enjoy it if you enjoy retro games, but it was a bit short. I beat it in a few hours and I killed everything I came across and searched the entire map. I think this game should get a DLC or a sequel to conquer existence, but besides DLC it needs to be patched because I built such a tank that when I fought the final boss I just stood under it and took 0 damage a hit.

												EvilQuest's biggest strength is the nostalgia for gaming on the Super and regular Nintendo. As many of the reviews have pointed out, it draws a lot of inspiration from Crystalis on the NES. And as an action-RPG, EvilQuest is competent and has some depth to the fighting mechanics. There are quite a few areas to explore and the story is pretty standard for a JRPG. But the writing, overall plot, and execution are lacking and need refinement or maybe someone more experienced in those areas. The game starts off with a bit of humor, but then half-way through loses that and the potential for some comedic moments. The game play doesn't suffer for this, but is doesn't complement it either.All in all, for a $2 game, it is an enjoyable experience that will last about 5 hours a first play through. "

YouTube™ Video: Cheap PC Games: EvilQuest Review

EvilQuest is Zelda-like ARPG.The most intriguing thing here for me is you are the villain. It's breath of fresh air. The story is simple. You are Galvis – dark knight, who wants to kill the good guys, take over the world and annihilate it. For that purpose, he needs the Chaos Axe, but it's protected by four seals and Galvis have to destroy them. This isn't oscar winning story and I don't consider it a bad thing. The guy wants to destroy the world – nice and simple.The graphics are retro pixel art and you won't find much options here. Sliders for music, effects, difficulty setting, auto save, flash effects, fullscreen and resolution. 1280X720 pixel is the maximum here and this is the biggest issue. But I have one problem, but it might be isolated case. My PS2 controller is not compatible with the game. But mouse and keyboard setup works perfectly. And you can rebind keys.Like I said in the beginning, this ARPG. You can attack only in four directions and the starting weapon is a knife. Soon after you start the game you will gain the ability to charge a shot, by holding the attack button for a few seconds. This is essential for surviving. In addition to shooting enemies from a distance, this will help you push hard to reach levers. There are three charge levels. Longer you hold, more powerful will the shot be.As the game progresses, you will find new weapons. They are connected with your quest. Every new weapon is more powerful than the old ones, so you don't need to use the previuos.If the game have only weapons, I wouldn't recommend it. But fortunately, you can use magic. They are pretty standard – fire, lightning, ice, water and earth. Every spell have two levels and they differentiate in their animation and usefulness. My favorite is Earth 2. When you are in a tight place with multiple enemies, a giant rock start ricocheting in the walls and damage everyone in the process.. You learn the spells from certain people, but if you missed someone, you may be abble to buy some of the in the shops.The level design is nothing special, pretty standard for old school game like this. But the environments are different – dungeons, volcano, grassfield and so on. While wandering, you will find villiges. There you will buy new gear, hearbs for restoring life, mana, antidotes, spells, sleeping, learning about places you have to visit, searchis houses and so on.Map exploration is recommened. Beside gaining xp by killing enemies, you will find treasure chests with money, herbs, gear and others. That way part of the money will be saved for something expensive.Enemies are also typical for the genre – ghosts, soldiers, lizard-like people, bats, rats and so on. A lot of them are just reskin of each other. What I mean is the attack pattern are the same. Of course, there are other with totally different attacks or combine two. The AI is basic, but it works. As a hole it's okay. Enemies constantly respawn, so you don't have to search for them to gain XP. After leveling up, you will receive different amount of points and you have to put them in 4  skills – strength, vitality, intelligence and toughness. You can't put more than 2  in one place. There is one thing I don't understand. What defines how much point I get? Sometimes I earn 4, other 2 and then 3. As far as the bosses, all I can say is they are ton of fun and you need different approach for each.Sound design is good, it' on the level of older 16 bit games. Every sound of weapons, magic, the effects as a hole, remind me of them. The music is the one thing I don't like that much. It's just not memorable for me.I had a lot of fun and this fun cost only 2E or your regional equivalent. You'll get great game, especially if you are into Zelda-like games. It took me little more than 4 hours, although Steam says 7. The dev done a great job of recreating 16 bit game. It's almost perfectly polished for what it is, aside from the low resolution. I recommend it. There is EvilQuest 2 on the way and it looks better in every way. Can't wait to get my hands on it.			"

												Evilquest, is a pretty interesting 8bit RPG, when i play it really just brings me back to the days playing Zelda for Advance it is just nostalgia love it.It's got a fun story, unique perspective for main character (Nice being the bad guy) OST's are nice, get a good retro feel from em, suite the atmosphere/level designs.Combat is fun, progression is decent in terms of leveling and stat's, boss fights are fun and intriguing same with design.only complains is that the game isnt that long and your armor always remains constant in terms of visualthat and the poor grammar but who cares about that lol8/10 Cant wait for Evilquest 2			"

												I'll be frank here, I liked this game AT THE BEGINNING OF IT!  I have only played this game and beaten it once.I think this concept is interesting, I love playing as a villian or antihero in a game gives you a different perspective.  The early sections of this game are pretty hard, especially the first few bosses though the normal enemies are pretty easy, the problem is this game has a REVERSE difficulty curve.  Meaning that as you go through the game the normal enemies start hitting for ridiculous damage, and the bosses become cakewalks.  I HATE THAT!  The hardest boss (for me) later in the game was the salamander and even then he wasn't that hard, I beat the final boss on the first try without much healing and it is a 3 stage boss, and there is another boss before him.  Overall a dissapointing game, but helped burn a good chunk of time.			"

												Could have been really good, instead is just pretty good.The game attempts to recreate the old-school feel of 8-bit action RPGs like Crystalis and Legend of Zelda. It largely succeeds, but the game's odd animations, inconsistent graphical quality and less-than-stellar enemy behaior prevent it from becoming as great as it could be.This is a game that I liked, but with a little more polish it could have been a game that I loved.I'll definitely keep an eye on the developer in the future.

The general gameplay is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy Adventure or Sword of Mana, which is a very good thing for me. I'll contining playing it until I beat it, also trying for the achievements. I'd even play a second installment if one comes out. I recommend this game with a few reservations.			"

												Be an ugly villian in armor struggling to destroy the world for the 'wrong' that it has done him. Explore 6 or so maps and destroy those who stand in your way! It's a very easy game, great for letting loose some steam or doing a quick stream. I would normally nitpick but for the price I really didn't expect as much as I got. A combat style that is a reminder of link with a Jrpg twist. Really only like 4 hours of content can get all achievements in less than a day if paying attention and careful. Game is actually funner as a melee character and a breeze as a mage. [I usually play a mix.] Like... it's a bad game, no joke but If you need to waste 4 hours and want something easy to do, this is your game.			"

												A classic. Simply a classic. Or at least in terms of doing what old games did right with the limitations they had at the time. It's not incredibly difficult from what I've played, but it's not easy either. It rewards players who grew up with these types of games with an enjoyable experience, and it challenges those new to the style. It's kind of ""lunch break"" difficulty, I suppose, but you can still die pretty easily if you're not paying attention.Another great thing is how the main character is a ""fresh"" kind of evil. It's been a while since I've seen a bad guy who just does evil things just because he feels like it. Galvis cares about one thing and one thing alone: himself. He's not out to change the world, sorta, and he doesn't have a cause other than making every living thing bow to his authority. Really, when's the last time you saw a bad guy do bad things just for the hell of it?It's pretty endearing to take on the role of ""I just want everything to either worship me or sleep with the fishes"".This game proves that what we now call ""retro"" can still be done in a way that's accessible and enjoyable for anyone playing it. I know anybody reading this has emulated classic games before, and, provided it's not pure nostalgia, EvilQuest has that exact feel.Trust me, if you love that type of thing, you'll definitely want to snatch this game up, especially for that price.

												In short, I love this game. It's on the short side but worth every cent that comprises it's cost. It has old school action, roaming around on a world as an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is fun! Since it's short, I was surprised to find there is more than one weapon in this game. The lack of direction in the beginning can be a little frustrating right in the beginning but speak to the people and listen to what they say, they'll guide you. Graphics are sub-par but fit the style of the game, plus graphics don't make the game. Combat is fun, akin to Zelda in terms of how you attack. You do have magic as well, which can be very strong, almost over powered. Magic variety is good for such a small indie game and certain elements are extra effective against certain enemies. Story is good, nothing groundbreaking but it's not to play the other side for once. People an evil tyrant is fun and relaxing in a way. Anyway, enough rambling, this game is most definitely worth it's price. Any questions about the game, I would be happy to answer, shoot me a message. To the developer, bravo sir, you've done an amazing job!			"

												Ok, I finished this one in under 4 hrs. Not a bad little game, wish it was a little longer and a little better in the dialogue department.  I see other reviews complaining about the hitboxes and other issues but it was certainly no worse than some of the first Zelda-ish type games we used to see. Now, is that a bad thing? Depends. I did not pay much for the game and for what I paid I can forgive a few missed hits here and there. It's better than I could make for sure and the story did make sense for the most part. All in all I would recommend it if you are looking for a fun little game. It's simple, fun, and actually humorous in places. Is it perfect? No. But it is fun and worth the 4hrs spent. I'd like to see more and with a bit more complexity!			"

												As a fan of old-school action-RPG games, I can say that this game really delivers on all fronts.  The fighting is smooth and responsive, the spells look and feel powerful and the weapons are awesome as well.  While I do wish that Galvis' armor would change the look for each type he equips, it's a small gripe compared to what the rest of the game offers.  If you're a fan of old-school action-RPG games, or a fan of old-school games in general then this is a highly recommended buy from me.  And at only  $1.99 you can't go wrong.For those who may be concerned about the length I wouldn't worry.  There's a slew of achievements for this to lengthen the game and so far I'm having a blast getting them all.  Kudos to the devs on this game!  More please!			"

												Made For Controller: this game while good has problems. The first is the save points as it gets frustrating as you have to play the game for as long as it takes to get to one just to save. The second prblem is being repetitve by having opponents that are pallet swaps from other oppoents. The third problem is that it was made for the X-box controller from what im hearing the keyboard controlls suck but it is playable with a X-box controller so there's that. The fourth problem is the humor comes from the fact that the main character thinks he is god and, if you don't think is funny you're not going to be buying this game for it's humor. This game a RPG it's retro styled which you you understandably might be tired of after all the retro indie games we've been getting over the past few years but, this game does have qualitiy and can be fun so overall so I recomend it.

Graphics are sub-par but fit the style of the game, plus graphics don't make the game. Combat is fun, akin to Zelda in terms of how you attack. You do have magic as well, which can be very strong, almost over powered. Magic variety is good for such a small indie game and certain elements are extra effective against certain enemies. Story is good, nothing groundbreaking but it's not to play the other side for once. People an evil tyrant is fun and relaxing in a way. Anyway, enough rambling, this game is most definitely worth it's price. Any questions about the game, I would be happy to answer, shoot me a message.

												I wish there where more games like this on steam, Its not too complicated but it isn't overly simple, the game is short but Considering what it costs I consider this game to be more then worth it. There are only two apparent problems with this game that I think worth mentioning. You can only use one magic spell at a time and in order to change it you have to go to the menu, this gets tedious and it would be more  convienient if it used number keys to use magic. The other thing is that although the story is not the same thing over and over the overall the story could have used more plot developments. This is still a great game though and I would recommend this game to everyone.			"

												EvilQuest's biggest strength is the nostalgia for gaming on the Super and regular Nintendo. As many of the reviews have pointed out, it draws a lot of inspiration from Crystalis on the NES. And as an action-RPG, EvilQuest is competent and has some depth to the fighting mechanics. There are quite a few areas to explore and the story is pretty standard for a JRPG. But the writing, overall plot, and execution are lacking and need refinement or maybe someone more experienced in those areas. The game starts off with a bit of humor, but then half-way through loses that and the potential for some comedic moments. The game play doesn't suffer for this, but is doesn't complement it either.All in all, for a $2 game, it is an enjoyable experience that will last about 5 hours a first play through. "

												Let me start off by saying that this game is worth it's worth.It's a great 8bit rpg game that has a solid unique storyline that drifts from the normal storylines that we are used to seeing. It keeps the feel of an 8bit game and doesn't stray from it at all. It's like playing a game from NES or SNES. I recommend this game to anyone who loves 8bit games.Sidenote: If anyone has any questions about the game (achievements, items, etc,.) I have fully completed the game with every achieve and more then happy to help!			"

												Evil quest was fun, you'll enjoy it if you enjoy retro games, but it was a bit short. I beat it in a few hours and I killed everything I came across and searched the entire map. I think this game should get a DLC or a sequel to conquer existence, but besides DLC it needs to be patched because I built such a tank that when I fought the final boss I just stood under it and took 0 damage a hit.

												EvilQuest. A great game for when you want to feel nostalgia. The bosses are fantasic even if the controls are a bit off. And the story line is well thought out but in my opinion it seems a bit clumsily made. I've seen a few loopholes in it but the story doesn't really distract from the fun gameplay. It tries to act open world like but in all honesty it's pretty linear. It's amazingly difficult though which makes it even more fun. And if you like being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you'll love this game.			"

												I really liked EvilQuest. This game isn't a timeless classic, and it won't win any prestigious awards. It IS, however, a fun action RPG that offers a decent challenge with a surprising amount of flexibility in play style. It's everything you would expect from an intentionally retro-style game. The graphics and music bring up those good old nostalgic feelings, but EvilQuest stands apart from similar games because of its dedication to its story. While most gamers may be tempted to overlook the story for its simplicity, I found it to be wholly satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that EvilQuest's story trashes the Good VS Evil in favor of an Evil VS All approach, and it works really well. I found myself caring about what happens next and who the protagonist would encounter. Think about that. These days, it takes a dash of something special in a game to make you actually care about what happens to the people in it, and EvilQuest has that spice. If you want a quick game with a moderate challenge and a rewarding story, you'd do well to grab EvilQuest. Don't sleep on this one.			"

												EvilQuest is an amazing, little RPG with the old school 16 bit look.  Super awesome so far and I've been playing for just under an hour and already I'm super happy with this minimal expenditure on such a quality game.  Loads of fun in the combat mechanics and they are simple to adapt to as well whether you use a keyboard/mouse or controller (xbox 360 preferred of course.).The best part is that you get to be an evil character instead of the pure hearts you always play as.  I have to admit, it is very fun indeed to be evil in this game!  Your character is a cold hearted SOB who will stop at nothing to make everyone in the world pay for his faulters as an evil general with aims on world control.  The story so far, is compelling and a lot of fun.Without rating the game on its pros and cons I'll simply say that if you like old school RPGs from the super nintendo days then pick up EvilQuest!  You'll love it almost immediately!			"

												When you think of an RPG, you think of a Divine goal with a group of Goody Two shoes who must save the world, and there will be dancing and rainbows and blah blah blah... Evilquest's plot can be discribed as.. basically the Song Verruca Salt sung from Charlie and the Choclate factory (hint: its the one about wanting the Whole World)Actually its nearly the plot from the First Final Fantasy, so its almost like playing that game from Garland's point of view.Gameplay is rather simple Zelda like combat, but getting new magic means more means to destroy enemies, ive heard from other reviews that magic is pretty overpowered if you focus completely on it, so maybe its best to even out your stats to keep gameplay fun (or crush everything with your unholy powers of the arcane, whatever floats your boat you World murdering Psychopath you.) although one minor gripe I had with the combat was the lack of any form the Zelda esc spin attack, but I guess magic is still useful, and you do get a ranged weapon.The core idea behind the game I think is what elevates it above an average one, that your not some Pig Farmer who must restore light to the world cause God told you, its just amusing playing as a complete Scumbag yet also wanting to succeed in his goal, even when you know the world is doomed if you do.Anyway to end, its fun for what it is, average gameplay but the game is improved by the fact your the Villain, I think of it were just a generic (save the world) plot, I would rate the game lower.

												This game is just too awesome for words...the best way I can think of to describe it is Zelda, with RPG elements thrown in. You get to customize your character, as far as what you want to focus on as you level up. I haven't played enough to know if running like a mage is viable, but there is magic in the game for all you ranged lovers! The only real problem I have is that the best way to beat...well anything really...is by standing back, charging up your attack and then releasing it. That way, you aren't in danger of getting touched and taking damage, as long as you can dodge whatever projectiles are being launched at you. Overall, a VERY fun game, 4.5/5!			"

												I'll be frank here, I liked this game AT THE BEGINNING OF IT!  I have only played this game and beaten it once.I think this concept is interesting, I love playing as a villian or antihero in a game gives you a different perspective.  The early sections of this game are pretty hard, especially the first few bosses though the normal enemies are pretty easy, the problem is this game has a REVERSE difficulty curve.  Meaning that as you go through the game the normal enemies start hitting for ridiculous damage, and the bosses become cakewalks.  I HATE THAT!  The hardest boss (for me) later in the game was the salamander and even then he wasn't that hard, I beat the final boss on the first try without much healing and it is a 3 stage boss, and there is another boss before him.  Overall a dissapointing game, but helped burn a good chunk of time.			"

												This is a Zelda style game. It's also incredibly easy. Play on difficult if you have played any video game ever.Enemy AI, if you can even call it that, is so bad that you can easily approach and attack things with no danger. They are super generous with the amount of healing items you find as well, which you don't really need unless something weird happens.The last boss is God, and he was hitting me for 0 damage with most of his attacks. I just spammed my basic attack on nearly every boss in the game, not even caring if I was getting hit. They'd usually die before I had lost 25% hp.Still, it's like .99 cents, so why not.			"

												It just brings the good ole memories back to those who played chassic RPGs (not my case actually) with a pretty cool storry of the protagonist being a bad guy instead of a good guy with verry fun interresting boss fights along with the interresting dialog even though some of the armors and enemies are the same design but with different colors and i would reallly appreciate if the world view armor (the armor that you see while you play) was different even though the armor  is kinda cool :) And overall even with the lack of diversity in some of the items and enemies it's till a verry good and fun game to play also due to it's price and i even got it during a sale wich is even better. Awsome game, totally recomended :D			"

												Fun little retro RPG.  This time you play the villain and kill half the people you come across and talk to.  Got taught a spell a few times by threatening, only to kill them after anyway (scripted).  Also instead of battle scenes its more of an action RPG which speeds up the pace.  Worth $5 or less I'd say.			"

												Evil Quest, a top down RPG that calls back to a simpler time. You are evil, and you want to overthrow God. That simple. You walk around a world in Legend of Zelda style, with level ups, weapons, armors, and spells. You fight a good number of enemies, but there are a few instances of Palatte Swap upgrades. I liked it, and hey, you might too.			"

												Nostalgia done right!If you've read some of my other reviews of older games, I tend to be let down as they don't seem to play as well as I remember. Though technically this isn't an older game, its made in the spirit of some of my favorite SNES rpgs while adding something new!  It's simple to learn and it gets you hooked playing as an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!No impossible achievements that you can't get without at least 2 playthroughs which I like as a completionist.Pick it up and enjoy if you want to play something simple and less complicated like today's rpgs.

												A nice game based off an NES classic, Crystalis. Although EvilQuest isn't quite as breathtaking as its counterpart, it is much better than the GBC port Crystalis got (many fans of the original Crystalis were disappointed with its GBC port). EvilQuest isn't the most challenging game (only takes about 4 or 5 hours to complete, and all the healing you can do is pretty broken), but for such a cheap price I'm not going to complain.			"

												The art is mediocre but effective. The main character dialogue makes me feel like a 15 year old who is mad at his parents wrote it, not very impressive to say the least. The general gameplay is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy Adventure or Sword of Mana, which is a very good thing for me. I'll contining playing it until I beat it, also trying for the achievements. I'd even play a second installment if one comes out. I recommend this game with a few reservations.			"

												This game is pretty good for $2. I bought it on sale so it was less than a dollar, but I'm glad I did pick it up. It is a fun game that is on the short side. It is kind of linar, but you do have to figure out where to go by talking to the towns people and reading what they tell you. Over all it is a nice little game and I will probably buy the sequal when it comes out, if it comes out, who knows.			"

												I really liked EvilQuest. This game isn't a timeless classic, and it won't win any prestigious awards. It IS, however, a fun action RPG that offers a decent challenge with a surprising amount of flexibility in play style. It's everything you would expect from an intentionally retro-style game. The graphics and music bring up those good old nostalgic feelings, but EvilQuest stands apart from similar games because of its dedication to its story. While most gamers may be tempted to overlook the story for its simplicity, I found it to be wholly satisfying. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that EvilQuest's story trashes the Good VS Evil in favor of an Evil VS All approach, and it works really well. I found myself caring about what happens next and who the protagonist would encounter. Think about that. These days, it takes a dash of something special in a game to make you actually care about what happens to the people in it, and EvilQuest has that spice. If you want a quick game with a moderate challenge and a rewarding story, you'd do well to grab EvilQuest. Don't sleep on this one.			"

												Having just finished the game on hard, I can safely say that for anyone who has any interest in Crystalis or similair action RPGs to give this one a try. It's not perfect but it does satisfy the fun I had playing the old 16 and 8 bit games of this nature. Also you get to play from the bad guy's perspective. Too many times games that take this route either wimp out and either A: make you really a misunderstood good guy or B: make your enemies even worse then you are. EvilQuest does neither, you're just straight up evil. That being said the rest of the writing is a bit off. It seems at times that the game isn't sure whether it's tounge in cheek or deathly serious. You'll have some humourous dialouge in one scene that's way over the top and in the next be talking to someone whose family was murdered and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It can be off putting to say the least.     Gameplay also has its ups and downs. Everything controls very well and the spells in the game are very satisfying to use but they also bring up one of the other downsides. The spells are extremely overpowered. Seriously just dump your points in intelligence and you can whip through this game even on hard. While this is a downside I can't deny there being a certain perverse glee in wiping out a whole screen of enemies and eating the bosses for lunch half-way through the game.       The one thing that really bothers me though are some of the enemies (mostly the bosses) hitboxes. This ones kind of hard to explain but it's the worst on the first boss a giant knight. I was standing behind him but for some reason his helmet was hitting me and killing me because the game thought I was touching him. This problem occurs in a few other bosses and considering that this wasn't a problem in actual SNES titles it's a bit unforgiveable here. In fact I almost quit right there but I am glad I didn't as the game is much better then its opening dungeon would suggest.        All in all give this one a try. Despite its downfalls it is still one of the better ""retro style"" games out there in a sea of similair games that are much worse. Cheers, I hope this review was useful.			"

												EvilQuest is an amazing, little RPG with the old school 16 bit look.  Super awesome so far and I've been playing for just under an hour and already I'm super happy with this minimal expenditure on such a quality game.  Loads of fun in the combat mechanics and they are simple to adapt to as well whether you use a keyboard/mouse or controller (xbox 360 preferred of course.).The best part is that you get to be an evil character instead of the pure hearts you always play as.  I have to admit, it is very fun indeed to be evil in this game!  Your character is a cold hearted SOB who will stop at nothing to make everyone in the world pay for his faulters as an evil general with aims on world control.  The story so far, is compelling and a lot of fun.Without rating the game on its pros and cons I'll simply say that if you like old school RPGs from the super nintendo days then pick up EvilQuest!  You'll love it almost immediately!			"

												When you think of an RPG, you think of a Divine goal with a group of Goody Two shoes who must save the world, and there will be dancing and rainbows and blah blah blah... Evilquest's plot can be discribed as.. basically the Song Verruca Salt sung from Charlie and the Choclate factory (hint: its the one about wanting the Whole World)Actually its nearly the plot from the First Final Fantasy, so its almost like playing that game from Garland's point of view.Gameplay is rather simple Zelda like combat, but getting new magic means more means to destroy enemies, ive heard from other reviews that magic is pretty overpowered if you focus completely on it, so maybe its best to even out your stats to keep gameplay fun (or crush everything with your unholy powers of the arcane, whatever floats your boat you World murdering Psychopath you.) although one minor gripe I had with the combat was the lack of any form the Zelda esc spin attack, but I guess magic is still useful, and you do get a ranged weapon.The core idea behind the game I think is what elevates it above an average one, that your not some Pig Farmer who must restore light to the world cause God told you, its just amusing playing as a complete Scumbag yet also wanting to succeed in his goal, even when you know the world is doomed if you do.Anyway to end, its fun for what it is, average gameplay but the game is improved by the fact your the Villain, I think of it were just a generic (save the world) plot, I would rate the game lower.
