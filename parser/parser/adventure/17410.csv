												The game is fast first person platformer. A fresh new adaptation of true and tried platforming. Rather than moving slowly and timing the jump from the edge. Speed is what counts here. You need to be moving at a constant speed to kick open doors, catch a drop wire etc. etc. Every thing is setup for constant nonstop movement. The level designs are so perfect; once you get hang of controls there is no need to stop. The game takes you through roof tops, A/C vents, malls, office walk ways and lots of other varied setups. At every stage there are multiple paths to move forward. There is a lot of freedom and it is tied well with risks.A critical thing to understand here is that the start-up period of the game is ROUGH. You are expected to be able to wall-jump, balance on thin rails, jump over chasms, and do other challenging things. The controls are going to be hard to get used to. Don't give up. It could be frustrating. Stick at it, and give yourself time to get used to those controls. Keep working through the initial levels. The reward is well worth it.Once you become used to the controls, the game really becomes captivating. You're expected to race top speed through a variety of obstacle courses. You have to think on the fly, react instantly, and pay attention to clues. It draws your mind in to focus on the moment.You can replay levels to try different paths, to try to get a better speed, and simply to have fun. So even if you ""solve"" a level in one way, there are reasons to go back and replay them multiple times.This game has been agony and ecstasy for me, and when I beat it I felt exhilarated. If you are a high-energy gamer who has the patience to try and try again, you will find yourself rewarded. If not, you should know ahead of time that there's no cathartic blasting your way out of trouble in this game.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a video game that definitely deserves a try.Its short length is the only complain I can mention about the campaign, because it's an incredible innovative title with a very powerful graphical side and an addictive gameplay proposal. A nice launching for this new saga that replaces the word 'brief' with the word 'intensity'.There's depth here that you'll only discover hours into time trialling a single stage and no other game in recent memory comes close to being as cool. I can't wait to see what Faith gets up to next. Console ports are usually a waste of time, but that's certainly not the case with Mirror's Edge. In fact, the PC version of the game offers even more than its console counterparts. Mirror’s Edge works like a charm with keyboard and mouse, too. Parkour above a shining beautiful city is a nice change of pace after normal shooters. Hopefully we get to see more games like this in the future.Mirrors Edge is an intense and intensely enjoyable experience from top to bottom that manages to capture a very interesting gameplay element and perfect it.

Mirrors EdgeThe Great Game That Nobody BoughtBefore I start, ignore how long I have played this game. I mainly played this offline.Mirrors Edge is a first person parkour game with some shooting elements. All combined highlights Faith's (the main character) trip through this beautiful city. The small details in the graphics, such as motion blur and even the dust particles when you land after a massive jump make this experience feel real at times. Highly recommended for fans of parkour based gameplay with the occasional fast paced, reflex combat.Also this is one of the very few first person games where you can acually see your feet as well as your arms.  Mirrors Edge is also a fantastic game because it still looks good even if you don't have a gaming PC to run it. Futhermore it doesn't take up that much space on your computer. (around 7 gigs or so)The only downside to this game is that it is a bit too short (around 6 hours). Keep in mind this is pretty much the only downside to this game.Verdict      9/10""Parkour + Amazing Graphics + A Little Bit Of Shooting = A Game Worth Your Money"" "

												Beautiful work of art, cleanly inspiring us for the better. Now I do wish to say more about this game, I played it years ago on my neighbors xbox 360 but now I am looking forward to Catalyst! It reminds me of hitman which is funny. So the point I wish to bring up now is about the settings, I have a GTX 980 Ti (Very high graphics card) But I had problems running this game, at certain points. This is entirely because of PhysX. There are two files which are in the game when you install here on Steam, and if you remove them then the problem is fixed, because this game came out half a decade ago, those files are outdated, and removing them will allow proper updated ones that you already should have to take their place, the files you need to find are called: PhysXCore.dll & PhysXDevice.dll. To find them go to Where Steam is on your computer, usually under program files x86, then steamapps, common, mirrors edge of course, then the first file maybe, called binaries, just find and delete those two I mentioned before hand and you should be completley done if you are up to date otherwise. Now this works as of now for me, maybe it will not in the future but I think it is worth doing this right now to try to help others. I found this fix on a fourm here: http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=335486 posted in 2010 apparently. It is 2015 now. Hope that helps you enjoy.			"

The only concern i had with this game was that the story was WAY to short, i was expecting that DICE could have gave alot more but oh well, Ethier way It's very innovational and cheap.100% Recommended.

												Mirror's Edge was an interesting experience. The first playthrough will always be rough, but this game has excellent replayability.  The theme of this game is that you are evading/rebelling against the government while trying to carry out tasks for an organization. The thing I disliked most about this game was the forced combat against heavily armored police. Some areas of the game can be very frustrating and may take multiple attempts to complete, but the feeling of accomplishment afterwards is present. This game takes a whole new approach on gaming. With very fast paced gameplay that sends you soaring through the skies across rooftops and construction sites. It really makes you feel like a badass ninja. Like I said, after your first playthrough, you will have a better understanding of how the game works and the level design which will make later playthroughs more enjoyable and smooth. If you have the money and are interested in a new exhilarating experience, I would highly recommend.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a game I've wanted to play for a while, and this past week I've completed it over once. Is it worth playing? Yes.From creators DICE (known for work on the Battlefield series and the 2015 Star Wars Battlefront), Mirror's Edge is a first-person platformer which involves parkour in all its glory, leaping across buildings, scaling walls, and traversing up factories. Parkour functions very smoothly, and the first-person view adds a layer of immersion which helps to sell the games atmosphere. Say what you want about the plot and characters (I found both to be good enough), this game's setting is a unique piece of art. Taking place sometime in the future in an unidentified utopian city controlled by a totalitarian government, Mirror's Edge conveys this by its very simplistic and pleasant art style: White everywhere, with bold colours such as brick red, lime green, or saphiere blue alongside. Cutscenses are also presented in a unqiue ""drawing animation"" (search up the first cutscene, I can't really explain it well), with a charm of their own. The soundtrack is also quite amazing, all the way from the main theme ""Still Alive"" to more atmospheric tracks used in the levels.As for gameplay, this game is centered around parkour as I said before. Your moveset includes jumping (no duh), sliding, wall running, climbing, and clambering to name a few. The feeling of successfully pulling of multiple moves at a fast pace is incredibly rewarding, and the game is entirely hard to master. Difficultly (for parkour) progression is smooth throughout the entire game, and (at least for me) the game never felt cheap at any times. However, combat also is an important part of this game. In some sections enemy soldiers will attack you, and you'll have to use kicks and punches to either kill or unarm them, in order to use their weapons. Gunplay in this game is very basic (kind of surprising as this game comes from DICE), and only serves as a way to kill baddies faster. Weapons include SMG's, shotguns, and snipers, however you wont find yourself using them too often as the bulk of the game is parkour, and some sections with enemies do involve chases, which are awesome and tense.That's pretty much this game! Sound a bit basic for you? Well, the main campaign/story mode is only 5 hours (it might take you shorter), and besides that there's a time trial mode, but that's pretty much the game. While a piece of art IMO, the game could have used a few more levels for the story mode, and perhaps a race mode for multiplayer, or at least something related to that. Gunplay/combat could also be expanded, and the parkour moveset could always be refined and expanded upon. Overall, it's an awesome concept and an original idea for a game, and I would give it a 7.5/10. For $19.99 it's a good price if you are absolutely sold on this game, but either than that I would either be cautious or wait for a price drop due to the lack of much content. Also, Mirror's Edge 2 for 2016!			"

												Yes, I have 20 hours in this game. But first, some background.Like with Final Fantasy XIII and Remember Me, I avoided this game because people complained about it when it came out despite me being hyped for it. I bought it when it was on sale for a dollar and regret not buying it day-of.I can see where people can find significant flaws, especially playing now just before the new game comes out, but there's so much good in this game that I think it's okay to overlook. The story's a little undercooked, Merc annoys the hell out of me (the white guy who's talking in your ear for 90% of the game), and for such an important character, you see Faith's sister three times and she does nothing significant. The borderless cartoon animation comic-wannabe cutscenes between levels are tragic and make my heart hurt. The biggest complaint I've seen is also slightly true: yes, some jumps and parkour tricks can be difficult to pull off because of finicky controls and poor item interaction (like not being in the correct centimeter length from a pipe so you fall to your death despite staring right at the bloody thing).But, honestly, the only parts of the game I got truly and genuinely frustrated at were the fights (particularly one boss fight with a ninja person *spoiler spoiler*). Thank god Catalyst ditched the guns because wow, I didn't get this game to play a shooter.Despite all of this, which I guess some is enough to ruin this game for people, I cannot recommend this game enough. It is quite possibly one of my favorite games of all time, and I play a lot of games. I spent $200 on Catalyst and got the prequel graphic novel. I own the soundtrack to the first game and will probably get the next. I seriously love this game. So what's good?It's art, pure and simple. And there's nothing else like it. Maybe some indie stuff popped up in hopes of scratching that virtual parkour itch, but nothing really compares to this full game of jumps and swings. It's like making Assassin's Creed first person and giving you complete control of every wall dash, every jump, every lunge, all those little tricky grabs and spins, and turning travel into the puzzle rather than combat or hacking minigames. Every tiny detail is carefully created and placed to challenge you and force you to think creatively, using the tools you learn in the tutorial on increasingly difficult puzzles. Even the fights can sometimes be enjoyable when you treat it as a marathon instead of an fps shooting gallery.The game is gorgeous, even for today's standards (though Faith's model is a little choppy). The color contrast and choice in neon vibrance and bright white have been lauded for years now. And it always stands our, no matter how many times you play the game. In a world of greys and browns, this game is quite the visual gem and that can't be understated. Traveling over skyscrapers really shows all these contrasts, then busting into office buildings and cunstruction sites, subways and malls, put those big blues, oranges, and greens right in your face.I'm a huge cyberpunk fan and there's not a lot of it. People want to think it died in the '80s, but I say ♥♥♥♥ that. Even if we don't have AIs or cyberspace, this is cyberpunk. A small group of rebels try to circumnavigate the system that the ruling totalitatarian government has created in this near-future dystopia. It's guilded, with high-rises and men in swanky suits, but crime and death in the cracks. This point's more about my personal interests, but anything cyberpunk is a win in my book.The music perfectly frames everything going on. It's fast, it's calm, and it's creepy. People complain about ""Still Alive"" but I'm one of the nerds who loves that ♥♥♥♥ing song. When i heard the composer for the main soundtrack was coming back, I immediately got the collector's for Catalyst. He's good. It's soft, kinda futuristic (as we'd like to imagine it) and is the perfect audial counterpart to the colorful visuals.Then there's time trials and doing speedruns of actual levels from the game, which is always fun. There's hackers on the pc, so don't bother trying to be number one on the leaderboards, but it can be very fun to push yourself to beat your own best times. Some of the most fun I had in this game was discovering new and faster ways of completing levels, like trick jumps I missed on my initial run or near-glitches that let you skip whle sections. I suppose these types of things exist in all sorts of games, but it truly feels different in a game with the parkour gameplay like this. I also thought the voice-acting was well done, particularly on faith and Jacknife, even Merc (despite me loathing his voice).I am a very big fan of this game, now franchise, and will likely love it forever. No, it's not perfect. If it was, would we need a sequel? But it's unique, fun, and stays in your brain. Granted, the folks around here bashing on it aren't likely to think about it again, but how are you to know you won't love it until you try it?One scene will always stick with me. Faith's sister's first appearance is in a cutscene, and not one with that horrible cartoon animation, but a realtime in-game cutscene in first person. There aren't a lot of these (in fact, off the top of my head, I can only remember two). This one is a good length, the vast city is visible in the background, you don't have control over Faith's actions, and it's emotional. It sets up the plot for the game (which isn't dreadful, they just could've done al ot more with it) and the relationship between Faith and her sister. Faith's personality is on full display here, her drive to run and escape problems rather than face them, and we never see her face. Many fps games don't have cutscenes from first person where the first-person character actually does stuff that the player doesn't do. But it's not awkward, it doesn't feel weird, even when the two sisters embrace and you see Kate's head go over Faith's shoulder. It's fluid and makes me wish there were more of these throughout the game. Even outside of the parkour, the music, and the visuals, this style of cutscene will always stick with me.TLDR- I love it, you might, there's problems, what game doesn't? You won't know if you're a hater or a lover until you try it. There's running, jumping, music, some iffy storytelling, and an overall unique experience. I've also heard it's good with VR. Give it a shot, it may just be your next obsession.			"

												Pretty late for a review, but OH WELL.This game has been one of my favourites for long years now and it hasn't changed. I still love it as I loved it after my first playthrough. Even with all its flaws, Mirror's Edge has some amazing moments, like Faith, her character overall. Music made by Solar Fields. Soundtrack is simply beautiful and one of the best I've heard in video games.Even after all those years game looks pretty good, especially city itself. Design is pretty original, sterile, trying to show ""the perfect society"" Kruger wants to create after The November Riots.Story... story is a little bit short, but blame EA for cutting like 60% of it without the writers knowledge, but even so... story about Faith and her sister, Kate, caught my heart. This isn't about saving the city or the world, no. It's just about Faith and her sister and this is why I loved it.Anyway, give it a try. I know ME is old and the new one is coming (reboot), but this is the original Mirror's Edge with the ""true"" story.			"

												kind of a puzzle platformer, you try to find the way through levels. the right method is always easy once you find it but the game forces you to figure it out while being shot at which is great fun as it turns out. There is combat and it's annoying. Running is the fun part. There is a fun way to do the combat while using your running moves but it is really difficult, Usually I just shot the enemies so that I could go back to running.Sometimes though running and fighting combine and it's BRILLIANT,  Like Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes: Slide... Kick!... incapacitate... wall run.. Kick...  disarm....  result? three cops knocked out, one broken nose, one stolen donut, capacity to shoot at main character greatly diminished. "

												1.You play the game, the graphics are nice, colour design awesome, the story is ""okay"", you die a lot in this game. There are cases where Faith doesn't grab a ledge and falls to her death, it is completly the games fault.2.You start to look at the areas with another view - it is more like a puzzle. Not eveything that is suggested (with runner vision) is really that fast. Fighting is slow, you start to avoid it.You discover that the cases where Faith falls to her death.... are completly your fault. It is just really precise timing and positioning. (There are some invisible things you can get stuck on, but at least they feel consistent.)3.You practice certain areas of a map over and over again. It becomes a puzzle-skill-choreography game. 4.You discover kickglitches.  You start to practice more and die a lot, lot, lot more in this game. Sometimes you ragequit. You get a dictionary and search for the word ""consistent"". You cannot find it.But: if combos work you feel like the greatest player who ever walked on this planet earth.5.You start to practice out of bounds skips. They look really cool. No progress. You see some speedruns and you think you are the worst player who ever walked on this planet earth.6.Irl you look at pipes and vents with disgust. In a potential run they slow you down. You look at your living room and mumble ""maybe I can avoid them by wallclimb-to-wallrun jump wallclimb-turnjump?"" Your mother looks at you with concern.7.Irl the missing runner vision annoys you. At the dinner table you want the fork to glow red. Even if you choose to ignore that and eat the food with your hands, because it is faster.8.Your psychologist suggests to write a review.tl;drUnique concept, awesome graphics, difficulty depends on how you play it rather than the difficulty set in game.I rate this game awesome/10.

-Quick Review-Mirror's Edge is a first person Parkour game developed by DICE in 2009. I don't know if this is “the first Parkour game ever developed”, but it is the first I've ever played, and I suspect it can earn its place as one of the first and one of the good ones.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist named “Faith”... I see what you did there DICE, touché. Faith is part of a rebel group that has risen up against the oppressive ruling government which monitors all communication within this city,  sound familiar? Hmmm...Faith is a “runner”, runners are individuals who act as couriers that carries messages around the city. Runners see the world in a different way; where one person might see a dead end, a runner see's opportunities to climb, jump, and vault to get to their objective.Gameplay: Mirror's Edge has one extremely strong selling point: First person Parkour. Have you ever wanted to jump off a building and not break your kneecaps? Have you ever wanted to travel a zip line from a skyscaper? Mirror's Edge is for you!There are various types of obstacles that you'll face throughout the game, the game teaches you how to deal with each one by going through a “training” session before you start the game. This training is skip-able but I suggest you get through it... but I'll be honest, I probably spent more time on the training then the first level. I could not master the “turn-around-wall-jump”, every time I missed the game would force-ably restart my attempt.Achievements: At this time there are no steam achievements for Mirror's Edge, however on the Xbox there are 50 Achievements, so it's possible sometime in the future Mirror's Edge might have achievements, but at this time (08/03/15) there are no achievements.There might not be achievements for Mirror's Edge, but there are time trials that you can complete against your friends on, unfortunately they're not sync-ed with steam leaderboards, so you would need to add your friends in game via Origin account.Price: Mirror's Edge is priced at $19.99, I completed this game on Normal difficulty in 7 hours. I want my games to go an hour for every dollar spent... If you go by that standard you should wait for this game to go on sale.However if you have the money, this is an excellent Parkour game that you definitely should give a try at some point, regardless of cost.Conclusion: To recap... Story: Okay, Gameplay: Excellent + Parkour, Achievements: Not available at this time, Price: a bit high.I recommend this game to anyone who likes jumping puzzles in first or third person video games. You can fight your way through the game (that's what I did) however it's not designed to cater to the fighting crowd (but it's so fun to punch out one guy, grab his gun and rata-tata-tata!), the game is designed to be like a Parkour or Free running simulator. And many times feels quite realistic on what you can and cannot survive... well almost, I did some pretty messed up stunts.			"

												I'm a great fan of this game. I love this and I can't wait to Mirror's Edge 2.The graphics are wonderful and I can't believe this game is from 2009. And you don't need a mega-graphics card for run it, i have a Nvidia GT630, and I have the maximum quality on textures, graphics and resolution. With 50 FPS!It's very innovational and cheap.The only thing It's bad for me, is the story's duration. It's very, very short. But it compenses because when you play it once, you can't stop playing it.Completly recomended.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a unique and wonderful experience. There are some rough edges, but it's a beautiful and memorable game.The closest gameplay comparison I can make is Portal. If you enjoyed the challenges in Portal 2, you will likely enjoy Mirror's Edge, too. The puzzles of both these games are about figuring out how to master a complex open 3D arena through trial and error, and the sense of fulfillment when you figure out the solutions in both games is similar.Mirror's Edge is set in a beautiful near-future city, with abstract gleaming white towers and stunning vistas. Outside, you engage in parkour-style running, navigating high ledges and leaping from tower to tower, in a fluid manner. It’s similar to the more familiar Assassin's Creed games, but faster. Indoor sequences are more puzzley, usually about getting from Point A to Point B efficiently. The free running is exhilarating, both outdoors and indoors. Missing a jump by a faction of an inch and falling to your death will make your fingers tingle as you catch your breath! And there was a memorable close encounter with a subway train that made me jump out of my seat from the adrenaline surge. Unfortunately, Mirror's Edge also features awkward combat sequences. The early training missions teach complicated combo moves for executing martial arts maneuvers. For example: blocking a punch while taking a weapon off an enemy. Honestly, these moves were way too complicated for me to execute confidently, but I quickly learned one easy combo that served me well in every situation: the slide-tackle. Turns out that if you take people out at the knees, everything else goes pretty smoothly!These combat events are generally unwelcome in an otherwise excellent game. Disabling a cop as you round a corner, then dash away? That's fun. Disabling a cop, taking his weapon, and then having a shootout with his partners for 5 minutes, moving from cover to cover? This does not match the overall theme of the game, and it's a distraction. Fortunately, these combat events are few and far between, and not difficult enough to frustrate you, or dissuade you from completing the game. Think of them as a different kind of puzzle.Last word: The trailer that Steam offers in the Store page is a poor choice. It features the cartoony animation from some of the between-levels cutscenes.  The actual gameplay is more like this trailer:

												It's one of the most original FPS that came out, won awards for its originality but it didn't sell that good.The game consist on parkour and you will die a couple of times but the view and adreneline it's just awesome.I know you wont like the next bit, but I love playing this game more than Skyrim. I may have more hours on Skyrim but the game feels to big, yes that's the point, but, this game when you are mid-air it's just beautiful and vivid.PS: Skyrim it's also realy realy good but EA did something good, and we should appriciate this due to the things they are doing to us (The Sims 4 is worst than the 3 and we have to buy the stuff that was for free). Wait for the one thats comming up with a open world.			"

												I have just finished the story mode and I gotta say I enjoyed my time. It's my first game of this kind so let me make a quick review.  Pros	+  graphics	For an older game, the graphics was just amazing and I caught myself just standing for a while admiring it, graphics is 10/10 in this game. +  story Even though on the beginning it doesn't ""pull you in"", gradually the story gets better and by the end of the game I was truly invested into the story, wasn't too original, just normal stuff. +  music Doesn't matter if you're fighting, exploring around or trying to figure out how to get on that ledge, the music is always amazing and fits the situation, it makes the experience better. +  gameplay Everything seems so fluid, your reactions have to be quick and when you're trying to escape ""Blues"" your heart starts racing, I wasn't able to put this game down until it was finished. +  content After you finish the story, you can go complete timed runs and work on your skills, compare yourself to others.  Cons -  shortness of game Despite not having watched any kind of guides and spending long time figuring things out, this game took me 7 hours to complete, which is fairly shot in my opinion. -  enemies AI I think a blindfolded monkey would hit me more often than enemies in this game, except for maybe last 2 chapters, I could run around in circles and not a single bullet landed, fun stuff (normal mode). -  combat It just didn't feel right for me, not being able to see health nor ammo, making it just hit'n'run at times, I loved my time when I could just run around, not escaping bullets. All in all, this game is still worth playing, as the pros outweigh the cons by a lot, I'd surely recommend this game to anyone, 7/10.			"

												Mirror’s Edge consistently feels like the point of impact for two diverging strains of game design.There is, first, the game Mirror’s Edge would propose itself to be, a first-person parkour escapade through a city overrun by corporate interest. It’s a crunchy, mechanics focused affair sold on the adrenaline rush that is leaping off a rooftop and hitting the ground in an effortlessly smooth, lifesaving roll. Where games such as Assassin’s Creed and Prince of Persia employ parkour as a flashy means to a navigational end, Mirror’s Edge obsesses over the act of putting one foot in front of the other; a roll here, a leap there, each action a purposeful and considered exertion meant to carry you forward as fast as possible with as little surface friction as can be managed.The precision Mirror’s Edge demands of you in controlling your character’s body is at once overwhelming and exhilarating. I routinely felt as if the game demanded more of me than its simple over/under controls allowed for, but then I would flawlessly string together a series of moves and everything would snap into place. There is a delicate balance struck between contextual automation and player driven navigation in how you traverse the industrial playgrounds that make up Mirror’s Edge’s levels, and more often than not the choice to keep the actual controls simple pays off and helps make for a game that feels both smooth and tactile.Problems arise though when Mirror’s Edge’s level designs fail to match the intuitive nature of its controls. There is a distinct visual vocabulary at work in Mirror’s Edge that seeks to clue you in on what can and can’t be climbed, jumped, and run on, familiar objects and situations giving way to habitual movements that streamline the planning phase and keep you moving. But despite what attempts Mirror’s Edge makes to help teach you how to read levels, by and large they remain entirely opaque. I might recognize a piece of geometry, but rarely did that translate into me knowing how to actually use it to move forward, and again and again I would find myself having to slow down and deconstruct a level before I could move forward.This stop-and-go workaround is certainly functional, but it goes entirely against the way Mirror’s Edge seems designed to be, and how it wants you to play. For a game built with speed and flow as top priorities, Mirror’s Edge does a poor job ensuring you ever make it through a level without needing to first memorize its layout and the sequence of moves needed to successfully navigate it. It’s not impossible to get good at Mirror’s Edge and capitalize on its promises, but doing so requires such an investment of time and energy spent beating yourself against its inscrutable exterior, that it hardly feels worth it. I never expected to reach speedrun level proficiency without putting in the effort, but Mirror’s Edge fails to accommodate for players who fall anywhere outside the hyper dedicated and skilled, without feeling as if that exclusion is an intentional choice. I don’t believe developer DICE wanted Mirror’s Edge to be as hard and frustrating as it ultimately became, but perhaps that is just what happens to games that move as fast and are as demanding as this.But I feel as if most of Mirror’s Edge’s failings are less the result of design oversights than they are the splintering of priorities. I said earlier that Mirror’s Edge feels like two strains of game design, and that second side comes into play in all the ways Mirror’s Edge either fails to flesh out the parts one would believe to be most important, or the things it chooses to include for no discernible reason. The much maligned combat is likely the biggest offender in this regard. You are rarely forced to engage with enemies, but not doing can often make the game more challenging than it is worth. Often I ran into situations where I would die dozens of times without making it through, only to reluctantly pick up a gun and be out in a matter of moments.The reason combat is so annoying then is the same reason much of the game becomes a frustrating slog the further you progress: it keeps slowing you down. There is also the added fact that combat, while technically functional, is horrifically clunky and unsatisfying, with kicks and punches being by far the least controlled actions you perform in the game, and the gunplay feeling loose and awkward (which is especially strange given DICE’s shooter roots). It all feels like a last second inclusion, as if someone high up at EA saw the game running and became worried that no one would buy a game without combat. One can only speculate as to the various hierarchies at play in Mirror’s Edge’s development, but that doesn’t change how wholly alien the combat feels to the rest of the game, and its inclusion means that at some point development time was being allocated to it over the rest of the game (the end result being the game we received).That isn’t to say that if DICE had opted-out of combat they would have been able to fix all of Mirror’s Edge’s problems, but when so much of the game feels rushed it seems hard to imagine that time couldn’t have been better spent elsewhere. The campaign itself is brief even by shooter standards at anywhere from 4-6 hours, and is made to feel more insubstantial due to being married to a narrative that is structurally akin to a show billed for 24 episodes that got cut down to 12. There is a framework here setting up a fascinating near future, where the control of information is paramount, and the only way to get messages relayed outside the government’s prying eyes is to use runners who carry them by hand. Our lead, Faith, is a quintessential sentimental rebel, enacting what eventually becomes an outright war between the city higher-ups and the runners in order to rescue her sister after being framed for a crime.There is a lot to work with in Mirror’s Edge’s setting and premise, but events are strung together with so little continuity and character development that the result is something of a mess. Much of Mirror’s Edge’s plot seems to hint at a history that is never explained, with character relationships never getting much attention even as they switch sides at the drop of a hat without any legitimate justification. Eventually things boil down to a blur of small-scale politics with big ramifications, plot holes that make for easy conclusions, and an overarching storyline that by the end seems to have gone nowhere despite everything that unfolds. I am a sucker for Marxist dystopia and would have loved to learn more about Faith’s world and how she fits into it. It is incredibly rare we get a female lead in games, which makes it perhaps more frustrating than it would otherwise be that Mirror’s Edge does nothing much to develop Faith as a person. I appreciate her being here and DICE avoiding most of the pitfalls that developers fall into in creating female characters, but that only serves to illustrate just how dire things are in games even so many years after Mirror’s Edge’s release, that even being a lousy character in her own right Faith still constitutes one of the better leading ladies in a major release.Mirror’s Edge is an experience that few games have come anywhere near replicating. Its blend of high-contrast visuals and a visceral sense of movement and impact can be incredibly exhilarating once you learn how to make use of what you’re given. However compelling a concept Mirror’s Edge might be though, its execution is so flawed as to make playing it often far less enjoyable than the idea of doing so. With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see if DICE learned anything from Mirror’s Edge relative failure, but until then it exists more as a curiosity than a classic.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I finally decided to play this. What a rush! This is the sort of game that can be played ten years from now and it will still play great and look great. It's one of those timeless games.Positives: Simple and refined gameplay, check. The free running is so very enjoyable. The sense of speed as you rush across rooftops is exhilirating. For someone like me who loves the thrill of heights, it puts a grin on my face. (You'll probably want to raise the game's FOV, it's pretty easy, look it up.)  I want to live in that city. Maybe without the dystopia but, it looks so nice. The art direction in the game is gorgeous. Indoors also. I want to work in those offices. I would desk jockey the ♥♥♥♥ out of those office environments. You can take a screenshot at any time and hang it on your wall. My F12 key is wearing out. I liked the world they created. The runner culture. The story keeps it simple, with just enough to provide you with incentive. Character designs are great too, from Faith to the runners and villains. Check out the unlockable art in the main menu. I was sad to hear Rhianna Pratchett wasn't invited to write Mirror's Edge 2 because  I liked her take on this. A girl on the wrong side of the law who's doing everything to save her her sister, the framed cop. Interesting backstory to the city and the characters. I'd love an animated series with the same setting and aesthetics. The negatives: Combat is definitely the weak point of the game. Most of the time it's frustrating. Lots of people wish it didn't have combat at all. I think they could have made it work. You can disarm most enemies via quicktime events that suck, even if you use the slowmo button. For a game about free running, it's pretty damn linear. I've seen corridor shooters that offered more varied paths. At least I played it without ""runner vision"" which literally paints your path in red. I didn't mind these but it seems a lot of people did: the cutscene cartoons are not as well made as the rest of the game. Not a big deal for me.Mirror's Edge 2 is supposed to address these issues, if it ever releases. DICE are a hostage to developing Battlefield after Battlefield, sadly. Unique and fresh games like Mirror's Edge are an exception and a rarity.Definitely worth playing.			"

												Definitely one of EA's more unique titles, and probably the best parkour-focused game you can find right now. If you're new to the series, play this and skip the largely disappointing Mirror's Edge Catalyst.Gameplay-wise, the game feels pretty good to play once you get a handle on the controls. It can easily be played via a controller or keyboard+mouse; the latter option will give you a slight edge in gun battles, but since the game can be completed without touching a gun (except for one part where you have to shoot a police van) it doesn't matter what you use. The controls are awkward either way at first, but the more you play the more natural it'll start to feel. And once you get used to it, you'll probably wish that more games had similar mechanics. While Mirror's Edge might look like a FPS at some times, it's a platforming game above all else. Levels are presented in a linear fashion and you progress through like you would in any platforming game; using the enviornment to vault, swing, and crawl your way past obstacles. With only 9 levels, the game is on the short side...but it definitely has some replayability if you're looking to speedrun it. Gunplay may leave a little more to be desired; it feels clunky, and Faith can't carry ammo so when she disarms an enemy she can only use the rounds that are already in the gun. Apart from pistols and SMGs, guns will also considerably slow Faith down, no doubt an intentional move by DICE to emphasize that you sacrafice speed for power by picking up a weapon. Again, this doesn't matter much since guns are an entirely optional feature.Graphically, it's a very pretty game. The game can be a little too bright sometimes, with it's pre-baked lighting and strong bloom effects, but overall it uses Unreal Engine 3 pretty well. The artstyle is fantastic; set in a near-futuristic dystopian city, the colorful city skylines make for a great view as you dance along the rooftops. Combined with a fantastic minimalistic HUD, the game presents many opportunities for gorgeous screenshots if you like to toy around with video game photography.Moving on to presentation, Mirror's Edge has the same appeal that a cult movie would. The story is far from perfect with average voice acting, poor pacing, and a somewhat anticlimactic ending. That being said, it was still done effectively. If the story does anything good, it's world building. I found myself wanting to know more about the events leading up to the game's story, about the city, about Faith herself. The cutscenes will probably remind you of those old Esurance commercials, but they eventually grow on you. The soundtrack is pretty well done too, with the music from the final level being exceptionally good. Overall, the game is very obviously far from perfect and yet still charming in it's own unique way.TL;DRMirror's Edge has a small but dedicated and enthusiastic fanbase for a reason. It's not for everybody and it's certainly not the best game in the world. In spite of that, it's aged well for an almost 10 year old game. It's got some of the best platforming mechanics I've seen in a first person game, although there's still a few frustrating trial-and-error segments. All in all, I think it's worth at least one playthrough...certainly more for a budding speedrunner. $20 might be asking a little much, but when it goes on sale it's a must buy in my opinion.			"

												This is the best parkour game out there. It's only downside that I can see is that it's single player is very short, and if you get really good at it, then it can take less than and hour to beat the whole game. I think that's what makes this game so fun is the fact that the creators make it so that you want to go back and beat your previous record. 10/10.			"

												First off I will start by saying that I am the worse parkour gamer in the history of parkour gaming. It only took Dying Light and Mirror's Edge to make me realize this and yet I still play them. Once in awhile I will fall off the buildings and die, and by once in awhile, I mean every 30 seconds or so. I just wipe the blood off myself, reset my broken limbs and continue lol.This seems to be one of those games that everyone passes up and I don't know why. The story is very good, along with the graphics and the voice acting. This is definitely a hidden gem in the Steam games list that everyone should play at least once, even if you keep dying.			"

English Version: I don't know how to define this game. A First-person action where your main purpose is to run. That's right, run! One of this game's strenghts is, among all and in my opinion, its freshness! But let's talk more in details about the game...The plot is based on a city (which apparently hasn't got a name) where information is constantly controlled and supervised (reminded me of ""1984"", for those who know the book!). This kind of society brought to the birth of the so-called ""runners"", who are rebels who do stunts taking advantage of the environment between buildings, pipes and platforms; are deliver information even at the cost of their lives. Our protagonist is the runner Faith Connor. The story begins when Faith's sister, Kate, is trapped and subsequently indicted for the murder of a politician. This will push Faith, to break the boundary of the city in which the rebels are ''crossing in the mirror's edge'' (reference needed). From here we will investigate to try to exonerate her sister.The gameplay is very hectic, which makes everything much more exciting and unfortunately short-lived given that, I finished it in a few hours. First of all I'd advice EVERYONE, even the expert players, to complete the tutorial in order to understand the game mechanics, because as I said it's a different game compared to the others! However a lot of It is about observing the landscape in order to notice any path you can take to move forward (it isn't always easy to identify them, even though they are highlighted in red, especially if you are running). In case there are policemen nearby, you can use the attack to beat 'em up, to steal their guns and to quickly shoot the rest of 'em (we still available a few bullets, also if we had taken the charge weapon). Still you'd better avoid all of that, 'cause it slows down the run and makes you more vulnerable (if they shoot you even just three or four times you can easly die).The characters are poorly characterized, little is told about Faith. The graphics are very pretty and fits in the context in my opinion!In conclusion I think it's a game that everyone should try. After that you can like It or dislike It, but as It's a different kind of game-experience that still allows the player having fun!Italian Version: Non so bene come definirlo questo gioco. Un gioco d'azione, in prima persona, dove lo scopo principale è di correre. Esatto, correre! Uno dei punti di forza di questo gioco è proprio questo, a parer mio, la novità! Ma parliamo più nello specifico del gioco..La trama parla di una città (senza un apparente nome) dove le informazioni sono costantemente controllate e vigilate (mi ha ricordato molto 1984, per chi conoscesse il libro!). A questa legge si ribellano i cosiddetti ''runners'', ragazzi che correndo e facendo acrobazione tra palazzi, tubi e pedane trasportano informazioni anche a costo della loro vita. La nostra protagonista è la runner Faith Connor. La storia inizia quando la sorella di Faith, Kate, viene incastrata e successivamente incriminata per un omicidio di un politico. Questo spingerà Faith, ad infrangere il confine della città a cui tanto si ribella ''varcando il bordo dello specchio'' (citazione necessaria) in inglese appunto Mirror's Edge. Da qui la vedremo indagare per cercare di scagionare la sorella.Il gameplay è molto frenetico, il che rende tutto molto più eccitante e purtroppo poco longevo dato che, almeno io, l'ho finito in poche ore. Inizialmente consiglio a TUTTI, anche ai più esperti, di fare il tutorial, per capire bene le meccaniche di gioco, perché come ho già detto è un gioco diverso dagli altri! Comunque il tutto sta nell'osservare bene il paesaggio per notare eventuali percorsi da poter fare per andare avanti (non è sempre facile individuarli, nonostante siano evidenziati in rosso, specie se si sta correndo). Nel caso ci siano poliziotti vicini, inoltre, è possibile usare l'attacco riavvicinato sia per stenderli sia per rubare la pistola e far fuori velocemente il resto della polizia (abbiamo comunque disponibili pochi proiettili, anche l'avessimo presa carica l'arma). L'arma comunque è meglio evitarla, dato che rallenta la corsa e ci rende più vulnerabili (non abbiamo molta vita, se ci sparano anche 3-4 colpi in pochi secondi siamo morti).I personaggi sono poco caratterizzati, viene dopo poco anche di Faith. La grafica è molto carina ed adatta al contesto a parer mio!Concludendo secondo me è un gioco che tutti dovrebbero provare, poi può piacere e non piacere, ma è un gioco diverso che comunque può divertire, quindi lo consiglio!

												Mirror's Edge was developed by DICE and released in 2010. Unlike other DICE games, Mirror's Edge wasn't using the Frostbite engine, instead they went with Unreal Engine 3.There is no game like it. The parkour is simply amazing here. There is no run button in this game - instead your character simply builds up speed as she runs. To complete an obstacle, you have to do it all in an instant, without stopping. It's not really about planning or puzzles, but more about instinct. You really have to give it to the level design in this game. Without right level design none of it would really feel right. All of that really make it feel very natural and epic. DICE really managed to combine cinematic feel (and i don't mean 30 fps) and gameplay together. I wouldn't mind for a open world though.There is also a bit of FPS in this game. You can never hold on to a gun or reload it. You have  to attack the enemy to get the gun, but it's easier said than done though. The game wants you to be tactical, even if you attack an enemy that only had a pistol, he will still gun you down if you just run out in the open to him like that. You have to use cover, pick the ones that are separated from the rest etc.The gameplay component of the game, whether it's parkour or shootouts, is simply amazing.The game also has nice use of aesthetics. They use primary colors mixed with white for the most part. It's so simplistic, yet so gorgeous. Musical department wasn't lacking either. Main theme by Lisa Miskovsky is superb.Unfortunately this game suffers from one big problem - the length. It will take you about 4 hrs to complete it. I guess EA thought of it as an experiment project?Additionally, there are also those terrible cutscenes in between the levels. Clearly shows the limited budget EA has given.Usually i dismiss these 4 hrs long games. Most of them offer no originality and are overpriced. But due to unique nature of Mirror's Edge i will have to recommend it. There is really no game like it.			"

												I finished the game just under 9 hours, and among frustration, experimentation and the thrill of adrenaline, I recommend this game.It’s a sad, dystopian future, where mega corporations control the world. Among conformity and corruption, the main character (Faith) lives life as a Runner. It’s sort of a rebel/delivery mail, highly skilled individual. It’s interesting, and without spoiling any further, her journey becomes personal, with a touch of vendetta to it. Nothing original, but it worked for me.The gameplay can be frustrating, and I bet most negative reviewers didn’t have patience to get familiar with the controls, but once you overcome that (and it can take some time), it becomes exciting and even scary to do the crazy parkour required to progress. Quick note: the visuals are beautiful, rendered in Unreal Engine with great colors.The enemies with guns killed me so many times, until I finally realized I was no match for an armed opponent, finally deciding to avoid them at all costs and find cover. If you knock one of them out and grab the gun, the game changes and it becomes easy to murder everyone, but I didn’t find that as appealing as escaping. Now, when the enemy runners started appearing and chasing me, I don’t know why, but that freaked me out. A lot. Maybe it’s because the sense of mobility and acrobatics was something unique to my character. I felt safe, knowing that the cops couldn’t reach me once I climbed out of their reach, but the enemy runner could. Their masks also added a tone of creepiness I enjoyed.  I’ll also be honest and say that I wish the characters had more depth and that the story was longer. I wanted to explore the whole city and walk among the pedestrians unnoticed. Still, it’s a good game.Buy it, but expect some practice and time to get used to the controls. Persevere and you’ll be rewarded with awesome parkour and amazing views.			"

I am not used to run away so it really gives that thrill of fast thinking and trying not to get hit.New experience, great game.			"

												I've always wanted to play this game ever since I saw the gameplay footage years ago.  And boy is it worth the wait.A very polished 3d platformer puzzle game.  Although it lacks the freedome one desires and keeps players on a mostly-linear path, one feels like a badass as they complete it.Although relatively short, it's still worth the price to experience first-person parkour virtually.

												I can not express the love I have for this game with words. Though one thing needs to be said: the game IS flawed.The universe and art direction is breathtaking, it takes risks, it's gorgeous... but they didn't really expand on the backstory enough. The gameplay is awesome: you run from rooftop to rooftop, you climb stuff, you make dangerous jumps while the police chases you, etc. but sometimes the flow of the game is completely broken by mandatory gunfights (which are thankfully few and far between).That said, Mirror's Edge is everything good that can come out of a big studio & publisher. I'm repeating myself, but the design of the city is just THAT good. The character design is pretty good; and hey! For once, we finally have an AAA game where a woman is the lead character! And last but not least, the sound design & soundtrack is the cherry on top of the cake: psychic ambient & downtempo electronica by Solar Fields, in a style that mixes two of his best albums: Leaving Home (2005) and EarthShine (2007).One of my favorite games ever, and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel...

												Disregard the 1 hour of playtime as I played this game while being offline. (which by the by, this game is fantastic to play offline.)What to say about a game that is centred around parkour and finesse... oh wait I said it.This game is about those two things mainly. and you know I have to say I like it. All the white trees and red pipes in the world make for an interesting style. (which is there because the devs wanted the player to have focus on the important objects)Umm yeah. takes a little getting used to. Story is great, the sounds are fitting. The game is rewarding, I mean I personally feel really cool jumping from building to building grabbing on to the pipes from the sides and then doing a few kicks off a wall to get up higher. so yeah. 10/10 gameplay. Honestly unique.Really wish there was a sequel.Story: 10/10 (Unique)Gameplay: 10/10 (Challenging, speed runs, etc.)Presentation: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 (Not amazing, but great.)Replayability: 8/10 (Yeah, I played it again.)

And it was really good, easy difficulties colored all usable obstacles, hard difficulty allowed free run without coloring, and that was pretty good feeling. Good replayability over the years.-???

												Mirror's Edge.

Props to him.- -: Visuals looks pretty damn good for a 2008 game.- -: Quite atmospheric and Immersive- -: Cartoon animations for some cutscenes. Despite the animation being a bit shoddy at times, it's a nice feat.Doesn'tbotherme's- -: The story honestly tries, but fails. I kind of liked the characters, I kind of didnt.- -: Combat is a cool addition, specially the disarming feature, but it's a bit tricky to master, and easily avoidable- -: There are some glitches, but not too many.Cons- -: A.I is garbage, the only way they'll truly kill you is when they get bigger guns later on in the game- -: Why do my enemies go completely stiff/ gmod like when I kill them? I dont understand why DICE couldn't just put animations for when enemies get shot at. Sure, you dont have to use guns, but some people like to. - -: When the soundtrack just stops playing.9/10 - Don't play the sequel, it unfortunately doesn't have much charm as this one.			"

Mirror's Edge, developed by DICE and published by EA Games, is an astonishing game that, I believe, still holds strong till this very day.This is a perfect game for freerunning/parkour and never actually gets dull for a single moment. The art style works well with the game and the graphics are still great for a late 2008-early 2009 title. The story is rather short but since the game is meant to be fast I guess it translates into the story as well.Besides the gameplay and freerunning elements, another highlight is the soundtrack by Solar Fields. Playing this game I cannot imagine another OST that would fit as well as this one did. Everything binds together in an harmonic way that relaxes you and pumps you with adrenaline when needed.What I liked:- Graphics are still good- Decent story- Great gameplay/freerunning- Amazing soundtrack- Great title for speedrunningNeutral about it:- Short game but I suppose it was meant to be for a title such as this- Ending is rather rushed What I disliked: - Combat is nothing great.- Sometimes clunky controls and you want to do something and end up doing the exact oppositeIn the end I feel this game is still great to play even for today's standards and I recommend it wholeheartedly.  Final Rating 8.5/10  "

												Mirror’s Edge is a game in its own league because there aren’t many – if any – like it. The gameplay consists of running, jumping, sliding, kicking, etc. You’re in (almost) constant motion. The learning curve is steep and you’re required to have a lot of patience. You might not even get full enjoyment out of it if you’ve just played through the game once, unless you get the hang of it straight away. Now, at first I thought that the game’s just unfair and unnecessarily difficult... until I stopped making things too complicated for myself.  Unfortunately, that happened about an hour and a half before the end of the main campaign. I expected all the routes to be very linear and complicated but the truth is that there are many ways to get from one place to another. I just had to open my eyes, learn how to notice things and think simply. Pros:•	The game is at its best during chase sequences and, fortunately, there’s a lot of them. You can actually feel the thrill of being chased while you’re running away from enemies.•	The graphics are gorgeous and the visual style is quite fascinating. I saw some wonderful greens, oranges and blues. A real sight for sore eyes.•	You can run through timed race tracks that are fun to complete. A good way to hone your skills.•	Running feels very smooth once you get a hang of the controls. •	There are some really exciting moments, like running towards a fast approaching train. •	The soundtrack is really cool and fits the world and atmosphere perfectly.•	Standing on the edge of tall buildings gives vertigo.Cons:•	Early on in the game the routes might seem confusing or not obvious. Often it’s not clear where you’re supposed to go, the indicators are misleading and so on. What I learned is that the routes that make you think, ""There’s no way in hell I’m supposed to go that way"", turn out to be the right ones.•	The game’s very bright, so it may be straining on people with sensitive eyes. The brightness can always be turned down but I found that this makes the game lose some of its visual appeal. •	Reloading autosaves may place you slightly ahead of where you just were and that might create some confusion. •	The main campaign is short. I believe it can be completed in under 5-6 hours.•	Trying to grab onto ledges and jump off things can sometimes be very frustrating to the point of ragequitting. •	If you’re afraid of heights like I am, then the possibility of falling to your death from tall buildings might create some actual anxiety (or it may be exciting, in which case this point belongs with the pros, not the cons). I must admit that I felt a bit anxious because, whenever you fall, you watch Faith fall until she hits the ground. In conclusion, I'd say that I recommend Mirror's Edge to people who: a) want to play something completely different because this game truly is like no other, b) are looking for a thrill and c) aren't put off by minor gameplay related annoyances.

												Mirror's Edge is one of the few games to get parkour feeling right, you may tussle with the controls at first although you'll quickly adjust. Visually Mirror's Edge is striking and clean, paired with the stellar soundtrack it leads to some unforgettable moments. Conversely, the weakest part of Mirror's Edge by far, the story is bland, uninspired, and sadly forgettable. Despite some flaws, Mirror's Edge is worth playing for the experience alone.			"

												In general terms it is a good game, you don't need to master the movements to enjoy it, but the fluency will be better if you do. Good: It gives the feeling of alternative routes, I never feel like one-track. Bad: Sometimes is not possible to avoid figth. Things to improve: I will include some ""messenger"" missions before the action starts, it will increase how much you go into the plot. The figth is terrible, sometimes your only chance is to run and try to get a weapom, and once you have it... it is extremely easy to kill everybody, a little bit unvalance on this side.			"

A solid concept lacking polish breaks down into tedium and frustrationThere is something to this game that really speaks to people, the free-running first person parkour, when it works, is absolutely amazing.Unfortunately, there's a whole lot of stuff getting in the way of your fun.It's not the plot, the plot is perfectly serviceable. Sure, it starts with your sister being framed for a murder and returns to that big bag of clichés for every new twist and development, but it wasn't bad and the little animated cutscenes did their job (...of masking loading screens, but they're neat too).No, what breaks this game is the lack of polish that was applied to it. The finishing touches. There are many small gripes to be had here (lack of non-hostile characters within levels, level design not making sense from a functional perspective, big bulkhead doors that take half a minute to open, no subtitles for ambient speech like overheard conversations and announcements, shoddy and partially missing directions) but the two main ones are:Bad checkpoints: In a game that is ALL about flow, making your way through complex environments and a certain amount of trial and error in how to approach things it is absolutely critical that messing up does not frustrate too much. The checkpoints as they are now are far too few and far between to accomplish this, and some of them are spaced very weirdly.There's a segment where you're climbing out of a large vertical shaft (it's in the Store page screenshots as well) and one of the checkpoints is right before a valve you need to turn to shut off a stream of water directly behind it. After that comes some tricky platforming, and I had to do that section several times. The problem here is that the game does not remember that you turned off the water, so you're stuck watching Faith perform the same ~8 second animation of turning off the water every single time, on top of the loading screen and unskippable bit where you're falling to your death that is far, far too much time to spend waiting and redoing things. This is only one of many places where I felt the game was far too sparing with the checkpoints, and to add insult to injury the in-chapter progress isn't even saved when you quit the game. You always start back at the beginning of the chapter.The enemies:In Faith's world the worst thing anybody can do is run across rooftops, it is immediate reason to send armed SWAT teams and attack helicopters after them. They shoot first, then shoot some more, and maybe ask questions later but that's not in the game. The justification for that is that you're supposedly carrying top-secret information and messages without the government surveillance catching it... except you don't do that in the game even once.You're able to disarm these enemies when you get close or punch them out, and then pick up their guns and use them but I didn't bother with that and the game very much feels like it doesn't want you to (there's even an achievement for it... you know, on consoles. Because Steam integration is too much to ask from EA).Regardless of whether you choose to engage or avoid these soldiers (they're hardly police forces any more) they will be in your way. Shooting for you as you duck and weave trying to make it to the next too-far-away checkpoint. I get why they're there, they are adding tension to the game.Or parts of the game anyway, their appearance and disappearance is very jarring. Open up an inconspicuous door that is marked as your next target to find a dozen soldiers just lazing around a parking lot in case a Runner (that's you, because you run) decides to come through there. Run your way past them into the elevator, go up a floor (or however many floors, the insides aren't marked with a number) and you're completely in the clear again. The game seems divided into platforming segments and engagement segments, and the transitions are almost always immersion breaking.In the late game the attempts at adding challenge become almost laughably silly, with every door you walk past popping open, revealing a tiny dark room with no other exits and one to three fully armed enemies that were sure you'd be coming this way. Add to that the new agile enemies, which should make the game more interesting since they can follow you around, but who end up doing pretty much the same thing anyway (and are as easily befuddled by you running through a door).For DICE, a studio that was at that point best known for its Battlefield series, this was a huge and impressive step towards something more creative. A first person game built around avoiding fights, with a kick-♥♥♥ female protagonist.For Electronic Arts, a publisher known at that point for buying up smaller development studios and turning them into faceless drones that will never make another fun game in their life this was a great moment to show the world they could do something special, something different. Unfortunately, they did not.With an extra 6 months of development and a whole lot more play-testing and polishing this could have been an absolute gem and must-play.As it stands it is a 5-hour eulogy for what could have been.Do not get this game, and be careful with the upcoming sequel, it might have similar problems.

												We saw many games having parkour mechanics such as Assassin's Creed,etc. But when it comes to FPS we dont have any, basically I love FPS having interaction just like as in real life, for example small things like seeing your own legs when you look down, shadow casted by your body, etc. these things are neglected in many games and devs still neglect it, it just feels unrealistic and most of the time you feel like controlling a ghost in the game. However this game pushed the standard boundaries of how an FPS should be, by implementing parkour and various other FPS mechanics. You can chain up your own moves by building up momentum using the environment around you giving a devastating blow to your enemies, this I didnt expect in a game and that too in an FPS!!. The speed run challenges are quite challenging no matter how many times you try there are multiple ways to do it and the most obvious path isnt always the right path... It also features a leaderboard where you can compete your stats with your friends but to do that you need to sign in via origin, the game and your friends should do the same for comparing stats, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and confusing for some. The soundtracks are awesome! for me its #1 in video games its always relaxing seamlessly free running here and there whilst listening to them, I would listen to it whenever I'am depressed.Yeah its that good and only people who are fond of FPS love it a lot but for others it might be difficult to play or uninteresting. Can't wait for Mirror's Edge 2!!9/10 "

												Hi ... Mirror's tells the story of Faith, a runner in an unnamed city almost completely devoid of personality thanks to the overbearing totalitarian government that rules the region. Faith's job is to deliver important pieces of information to an underground network who still live with a modicum of freedom. She uses her considerable acrobatic abilities to outrun, out-leap, and out-swing ""Blues"" (cops). Throughout the game players learn that Faith's sister, Kate, has been wrongly accused of murder. Faith must clear her name.Have fun ...+ Graphic+ Sound+ Story+ Sympathetic Faith - BugsI recommend !			"

This review is written from the perspective of someone who likes the game a lot, beware of bias and take it with a grain of salt.TL:DR - It’s twenty dollars, so damn cheap for what you get. Unless you are broke, BUY IT.Full Review:Let's start out with what I expected after watching the trailers and pictures:ParkourPretty mapsHand to hand and combatI got my parkour, pretty maps, and hand to hand combat. I also got a short story and very simple but annoying and unforgiving controls.Oh the controls... Given that one of the very important parts of this game is parkour, you would think it would be the most fleshed out and well done part of the game right? Wrong, unless you are on point with your movement every time, the game will punish you with the same old falling animation. Fighting or running away from enemies is a whole other deal. The game has a very simple movement base which can be fun when you fight enemies. Sometimes enemies get weird advantages and knock you down/do a lot of damage that nearly kills you; Some enemies are not meant to be fought so when you do fight them, you know why they are able to nearly instantly kill you. Even though one of the core elements of the game was designed poorly it won’t dock it points for this. Mirror's Edge came out in 2008 and I am willing to bet that not much was done to study how good its combat/movement system was since back then not many games could be used to compare it and see what it lacked/boasted. The art and modeling is so good. Without a doubt in my mind this game has absolutely beautiful looking maps, just visually at least, and even better looking models for props in the game. The maps however don’t feel like they were meant to be used for parkour. With all the clutter everywhere(yes clutter, even though it looks very clean), it is hard to really enjoy the game. I think the mappers did a lazy job of planning the maps which ended up making most maps feel slow, unintuitive, and clunky. A little bit more effort in the development of player movement through the maps would have gone a long way. On Top of all this the maps are relatively small making it very apparent they are linear. But like I said in my previous paragraph this game was made without much to go off of so this feels more like it was an experiment that went pretty well rather than a real game franchise.The sounds/music are just ounces of amazing. This game had extremely good and worked out tracks for different times during each map. The attention in detail to the sound as well as the physical location of the player made this special and memorable. I really is a shame that thanks to its initial unpopularity more people didn’t try this out and get to hear the games music. The sounds for the player and VA for the characters are on point and very good. You can tell what you are doing pretty easily by the sound and it doesn’t get in the way or rip out of the immersion. Certainly no argument here at all.The story in this game was interesting and relevant, but that doesn't really matter as those two descriptions are assigned subjectively. The story is short and lacks implementation. Yes implementation, I don’t mind cut scenes but you could literally play the entire game without ever knowing about the story. It is that loosely attached! Not like it matters since the story itself leaves a few things unanswered but not on purpose. It becomes extremely forced once you get into the later levels. Overall the story is a good idea and concept but it was poorly created and implemented making it feel cheap or unappreciated. This does to me count as a tick against them because it isn’t much effort for a game studio to make a decent story, and Mirror’s Edge story is not even close to being passable.Overall the game is 7.9/10 Not really mediocre just small and unpolished. The ideas behind it are great and a lot of what carries this game is actually the visuals, music, and maybe sometimes the movement. It’s certainly not a triple-a game, at least it wasn’t on its release, expecting a triple-a game is silly. If someone asked me if Mirror’s Edge is a good game for them to buy, I would ask them if what they were looking for was something quick to pick up or a new thing they can invest a few hours in. If you seek a quick game you don’t really want to get into then don’t bother getting this. But if you want something new and interesting you can really sink your teeth into then Mirror's Edge is the game for you.Extra:One of the things I liked the most about this game besides the art, music and gameplay is the fact that this was never even a triple-a game yet it felt like the game had been given access to the kind of resources a triple-a game gets when being developed. It wasn’t pandering and it had its own style instead of a bland mundane repetitive feeling you get from modern triple-a’s but with the quality of one. That’s what made is special to me. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! (hopefully its newfound popularity and hype won’t bog it's prequal(Mirror's Edge: Catalyst) down into another triple-a let down).			"

												We step into the running shoes of Faith, a runner in this fast paced, acrobatic game, which is one of a kind. There aren't many games that combine the action adventure platforming with the first-person genre. The concept is well executed, too bad the game falls short in other areas.In the unknown dystopian city, where crime virtually doesn't exists the Runners are the only ones that disturb the peace achieved by the totalitarian regime. It's a small group of anti-government individuals who can do one thing very well: run... and climb pipes and do acrobatic jumps, but that's (and committing crimes) part of the life style. Our protagonist is one of them, whose sister (a cop on top of that) is caught in political crossfire and arrested for the murder of the mayor candidate. From now on it's on Faith to discover the secrets that lie below the surface.Unfortunately there are no hearth stopping, breath taking moments in the story. It's pretty plain and simple, nothing we haven't seen somewhere else (1984 - Orwell). Likewise the length and scope of the game doesn't allow the story to get to deeper levels. The game can be finished in a mere 4-5 hours. On the other hand the cartoony cut-scenes are a nice touch and the characters are believable thanks to the great voice acting. Mirror's Edge consists of 9 chapters. In every chapter you have to get from point A to point B to complete an objective. It doesn't get any deeper than that, but at least the time spent between the start and finish is fun. The controls are reactive and you can take alternate routes to get an advantage over the riot police or just to be quicker and more efficient. In almost every level there is at least 1 point where you'll find yourself dying in 10-15 seconds after the checkpoint loads. Over and over again until you find the correct route or you can execute your jumps perfectly. These parts are pains, but the most frustrating thing in the gameplay are the gunfights. It's simply not meant to be there. Disarming guards and policemen, then shooting others feels off balanced, weak, and frustrating over all.Faith's story has its flaws, but the game is at its best when you have to do what it's created for: platforming, wall running, jumping from pipe to pipe, rolling, sliding and so on. When you learn the levels and you become more proficient in spotting out the best routes it feels like you are a panther capable of anything. Unfortunately if you aren't in for the challenge of finding the best routes in each map there is not much else the in the game that could keep it installed on your computer for a long time. After finishing the story mode you can jump in and do some time trials, but as I said there isn't anything else beside that (if you don't count the bags which can be found in the story mode - 30 in total).Rating: 68/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 5 hours; Played on: normal.

Mirror's Edge ReviewIn my opinion, this is one of the few games that EA did not ruin. Mirror's Edge to me is a unique title that gave me a breath of fresh, clean air while being in the comfort of my room. I say this because this game's graphics and quality are amazing for the year it came out not to mention it could easily compete with some game graphics today.I've played through Mirror's Edge three times and always find it equally challanging and exciting. Parkour games like Mirror's Edge can definitely have replay value as the game has difficulty settings that will make your Parkour experience much more difficult and a lot more real.I do recommend this game to anyone who is considering to purchase this title.9/10.

The mechanics are for the morepart solid, but I felt that they were abit unpredictable a few times.Overall this game holds up, but I recommend tweaking (sweetFX, FOV-fix and the other basics), to improove the looks/feel of it.I had massiv framedrops when PhysX was enabled, disabling the feature completely fixed the problem (first scene where they shoot at you and the glass breaks is a good bench if you want to test it out).

Mirror's Edge ReviewGame InfoMirror's Edge is an action-adventure platformer developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The game was announced on July 10, 2007, and was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2008. A Microsoft Windows version was released on January 13, 2009. Mirror's Edge is powered by the Unreal Engine 3, with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by Illuminate Labs in association with DICE.

Mirror's Edge is set in a quasi-futuristic dystopian society, in which a network of 'runners', including the main character, Faith, act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour. The game has a brightly colored style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment, allowing for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no heads-up display; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.Positives- Nice looking graphics and art style
- Fun parkour movement system
- Nice hand-to-hand combat
- Interesting story that keeps you immersed
- Nice looking cutscenes
Negatives- Gun combat is kinda bad
- Trial and error gameplay can get boring
Score 8/10 "

												Mirror's Edge is, without a doubt, one of my favourite games, ever. I'll glady recommend it to anyone looking for a new, visually spectacular, experience. I keep telling my friends this is one of the few games that they should've played at least once in their life. Unfortunately, no one ever listens. I don't mind though, because let's face it - it's their loss. And while there's definitely room for improvement, what's there is already very solid and lays the groundwork for a possible sequel, minus the story.About the story: Mirror's Edge puts you in the shoes of Faith, who has to clear the name of her sister after being wrongfully accused of murdering someone. Doesn't sound all that exciting ? Well, I might agree with you there. However, it's the way the game is played that makes it fresh and interesting. You see, the game is played from a first person perspective. But instead of shooting your way out (which is optional, but not recommended, for maximum enjoyment) you'll be running. Parkour style. In other words: free running.You'll be running through offices, on rooftops and many other places in order to get to where you want to go, all the while fighting off the police. This is all shown in one of the most beautifully realized environments I've ever laid eyes on (those office interiors ! *drool*). It's truly stunning.Like I mentioned before, the game does have some flaws. First of all, it's short. Many people will complete it in a hour or 4-5. Not terribly long, but not terribly short also. It keeps the experience fun. I personally would've liked it if it was at least twice as long, but it's nothing a sequel can't fix. Besides, the time trials will keep you occupied for days, maybe even weeks. One other thing that can definitely be improved for a possible sequel is the number of routes you can take to get to your destination. Mirror's Edge gives you the illusion of an open world, but in fact there's only one way to get to your objective. Agreed, this way it keeps you focused on the story, but it certainly would've been nice.Not much else I can say, really. This game is the reason why I play games. Play it yourself, and you just might agree with me. Maybe not today, but one day, I'm sure of it.[Rating: 92/100)			"

""ONCE THE CITY USED TO PULSE WITH ENERGY. DIRTY AND DANGEROUS, BUT ALIVE AND WONDERFUL. NOW IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.""Digital Illusions CE also known as DICE also known as People That Know What They Are Doing?I won't lie, I didn't play Motorhead that they did in 1998, but it was racing game, and it was pretty good as I heard plenty of times. And so Rallisport from 2002.I won't lie about this one either, I didn't play Benefactor, but it was puzzle platform and it was pretty great too. And it was 1994.Now, why am I talking about these old games, and DICE but not Mirror's Edge? Well, I'm mentioning them, just so people could realise that DICE is more than just Battlefield, Need For Speed and Star Wars. They've been killing it since day one and not just since the 2002 alias Battlefield 1942. But yeah, they did unbelievable games throughout the time and so they did Frostbite too and we love it right?And then, in 2008, somebody had an idea, why don't we make action adventure game, why not some running, jumping, escaping, shooting and fighting game that won't be war related like Battlefield. And so the Mirror's Edge was born, and came out as the hell of a great game. Story is not that deep as you may think, and it's not even long, or medium, for me it was kinda short. I wish it was a little bit longer but it is what it is. Also, I believe that if the game was released like in 2014, EA would already managed to release 2 extra story related DLCs and 4 visual DLCs. But let ""what ifs"" be what ifs. Glass City is absolutely mad beautiful, sounds are fantastic, gameplay and level-design someplace else great, Running through the city is an enjoyable moment. Running thru the Six with my woes. Enemy AI is pretty low, meeting with them is not good at all. But I guess that was the point, and encountering them is not primary thing at all. You should either escape, run over, or defeat them one by one because you cannot win if you go open on more than 2 enemies. Shooting is garbage, I recommend you throwing away weapon once you get it except few levels when sniper is needed.To sum it up, this game is unique, and yes, the Catalyst has been released few months ago, but it does not change the fact that this is the Father, and this is truly awesome game. If you enjoy jumping between skyscrapers and running over everything like Usain Bolt with no fear of heights, there is no way that Mirror's Edge will be repetetive for you anytime soon.Bonus Point: Glass CityRating: 9/10 "

												This is one of the few games that I have played that can get away with having a pretty poopy story because its other aspects are so strong. For one, these graphics are incredibel for the time especially, the game itself is so fun it is stupid, and the mechanics are flawless. Honestly, this is so, so worth your time, despite what negatives you have heard here. If you like parkour or shooters, this is your game, for sure.			"

												This game was one of those rare gems that flew under the radar of the mainstream audience.  A vast departure from what we've expected from DICE, this game featured some of the most unique visuals i've ever seen.  It may be, what, 5 years old, but still holds a place as one of the most unique looking games ever with it's trippy color scheme and the awesome Unreal Engine 3 powering it.  Parkour, featuring shooting elements, highlight Faith's trip through this beautiful city.  The small details in the graphics, such as motion blur and even the dust particles when you land after a massive jump make this experience feel real at times.  It's made me wish i had the ability to do stunts as this.  Engaging gameplay, cool puzzles, and oh, the Atrium.........neat game and cant wait for the sequel.9/10			"

												This game is pretty decent, but I would say is fairly niche. I'm gonna keep this review simple.Pros: Concept is seemingly uniqueThe art direction of the game makes look even good 7+ years later.Cons: Very short campaign. I beat it in less than 7 hours and there's not much of an incentive to go back and replay the levels since there's no achievements or to my knowledge, unlockables.The game crashed on me a couple of times. Keep in mind that you might not have this particular issue.There were a few times in the game I was completely stumped on where to go, which was weird because aside from those two or three instances, the game seems to do a pretty good job of giving you at least a faint idea of where to go. So... semi-con I guess?Overall, I'd say pick this game up. Just wait until it's on sale though as I think this game is more worth like, $15 nowadays.			"

Granted, there are some times where it gets super frustrating, but when you go back to those levels again (when speedrun mode gets unlocked) you feel like a total badass.

												I love this game - but I also hate it's guts.The game is so freakin' beautiful - but it's sorta a giant pile of bullsh!t.Great idea - kinda horrible execution.You're not really meant to use weapons - enemies have shotguns and are sorta, kinda really great at using them.so on and so forth...Regardless of my steam time played (1.3hrs as of writing this), I beat this game on PC before, and I played it more than half way through again on a friend's 360 a few years ago, so I think I can write a decent short review for it right now.So the pictures and videos don't lie, the graphics look insane for a 2009 game even 7 years later, if they were to replace the character models, and get rid of the ugly comic book/anime cutscenes, or at least animate them a whole lot better, they can easily call it a remaster/remake/redux/re...whatever, and sell it at full price (Origin, though! >_<).The gameplay is pretty decent and freerunning can be really fun when you get into the zone... til you get to a level where the world wants you to die, that is, and every citizen of, whatever this made up city is called, is blasting at you with a shotgun while you're struggling to find that piece of fence that doesn't have barbed wire on top. I mean, in those situations ""rabbit hunting simulator"" would be a better fitting title for the game, with the player being the scared wabbit.Story is there, it's alright I guess, voice acting and music are good, it's all AAA quality I'd say, no need to go into details, you're here to run, dammit!Ending song made a lot of nerdy boys and grils cry, I didn't like it very much, but maybe check out the Benassi remix, I don't know...Anywho, it's a game that can make you hate yourself, and the world, but it's worth a playthrough. I mean you own it already, and if you don't, wtf dude-bro?! it was like $2.5 on sales and in a $1 bundle, I mean c'mon... with the sequel coming out, now is the time to play this fantastic abomination.Final score 7.5/10			"

												Best first person platformer I played. The parkour mechanics is somewhat realistic and not terribly over-exaggerated. Despite the game being over 5 years old, the graphics on this game is suprisingly good, even scales up to 4k resolution.Also this game is supposed to be great with VR so this game would still be relevant in the foreseeable future.The story was ok, but the presentation of it was unique with the anime-ish type of cutscene. Unfortunately, the main story was just 4 hour long not counting the speedruin challenges. IMO, this game is only worth it @ 50% so better get it now this winter sale			"

												I wanted so badly to like this game.  I love the idea, I love the graphics, I love the setting - but the gameplay is just godawful frustrating.  The controls are sluggish and finicky in places.  Some actions - climbing up ledges, swinging on horizontal bars - are  smooth as butter, but some parts - grabbing onto vertical pipes, certain jumps off a wall-run - just never seem to work right.  The melee combat is awful, especially the disarming mechanic.  Put all these things together with checkpoint saves and a lot of trial-and-error, try-die-repeat to figure out how to get past an area, and you get a really repetitive, frustrating game.  The fun bleeds away pretty quickly once you're having to repeat the same sequence of jumps twenty times over in order to retry the one jump you keep missing because the controls are so fussy.Got it on sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.  Maybe I'll come back to it and try to finish it at some point, but I've got better things to do with my time just now.			"

												I woke up to see this game in the steam store, I quickly downloaded it to see what the hype was all about, as soon as it was downloaded I was about to click the play button when all of a sudden I got a knock at the door, I was startled at first so I jumped up to check the peep hole, and whoever it was on the other side had their finger over it so I got suspicious an grabbed my gun, I yelled ""who's there!?"" No reply so I asked once more... I got the same silence so after contemplating for the next several minutes I decided to open the door.My initial reaction was to shoot....BANG...BANG...BANG... I stood in shock as I found out it was my american stepbrother.I was in tears, he was dead, all three of my rounds had entered his heart...but then I looked down he had his laptop in his hands...with this exact game running.

												Do you like parkour ? Do you like the colour white ? Do you like tattoos ? Do you like cartoons ? Do you like the sound of broken bones? If you like these key elemets , you will need to get the game :) Joke aside , this is one of the games you must play at least once in your life time ...  The story To be honest it's pretty OK , the problem here is the writers , they presented it in a pretty mediocre way , and most of the story is told in the form of animated cutscenes, which can break immersion to some folk, i myself enjoyed them. (The art style they used is fairly unique) The story goes like this , you are a Runner , which bassicly is a parkour ninja courier , one day your Lucy Liu look-alike sister gets in trouble and you need to help her. I was saying earlier that the writing is nothing to brag about , a good example of this is the few dramatic moments of the game are not dramatic at all due to the fact that the character development is pretty much nonexistent, this game is an action-puzzle solving game so treat it like an action movie you won't expect some top notch story , you will expect some action ! Which is exactly where the game shines , in the gameplay, It's a very fresh experience , you  parkour your way out of level to level , sometimes you shoot your way out , with a suprisingly varied and realistic arsenal or by punching or kicking . It's pretty linear and the puzzles aren't that complicated , but that ain't much of a problem, A suprisng thing is that even the gameplay is pretty linear , it's not repetitive at all. The replayability factor is also there , after you finished the game , you can play it again and try to speed run it in under an hour.  Talking about how long it is , if it's your first time around the game , it will take you in the vecinity of five hours.   Visuals Pretty bland , most of the time you're feeling like you're in a hospital with all that white , it's something along the lines of Sin City, graphicly speaking altough it's a fairly old game (2008), the textures and models are pretty OK.  Soundtrack The classic combo between repetitive and boring ambient music and then the drumy and annoying fight music , this game truly needed a better soundtrack for example some really melodic chillstep during the puzzle solving part and some hard core dubstep during the fights , i really think a good soundtrack would have tied this game alot better. A cool thing about this game is that technically it's pretty well made , very few glitches and a very stable engine, no crashes, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (all hail Unreal Engine). All in all , a pretty neat game , i highly reccomend buying it during a sale , you'll have a pleasant experience. I hear it's prequel is pretty nice too, so check that out too.			"

												This is an older game I already bought when it came out. I am having huge interest in Parkour so I thought this might be a cool game. And it is. It´s fun, challanging and has a pretty simple story to it. The main character has not much depth, but is still very likeable.The gameplay is good for someone who has patient. It´s like a raceing game with some action elements to it. The speedruns are fun, the ""combat"" has a nice twist to it (I love choosing to not kill anyone or taking a gun).I can´t wait for the new Mirror´s Edge to come out! :)			"

												Quite a unique gameplay experience, and the graphic style still holds up today despite being almost 10 years old.Mirror's Edge is a parkour game where you play as the main protagonist, Faith, a rooftop courrier known as a ''Runner''. The gameplay is pretty simple once you get the hang of it, but it sure feels rewarding to get to the end of certain levels. There's also a speedrunning aspect integrated into the game, where you can try to beat the best times for each level, and compete against other people's times.The campaign story is pretty linear, and isn't nearly as good as the gameplay itself (it's still a nice addition.) It's a about 6 hours long, a standard for the time and I feel like it's neither too short nor too long.I would recommend getting this, especially if you're a fan of parkour and well coded gameplay mechanics.

												The game consists of story segments followed by a dash from one place to the next, usually chased by the police.  I love the clean bright look of the game. It really enhances the feeling of space and freedom as you are leaping about. The main challenge is to discover  where you have to go, while being chased, which leads to repeated ""death by bullets"",  and you just having to replay the section again and again until you discover the exit. But the constant race to avoid death leads to the game being very rushed, which somewhat undermines it because you can't take in all that  freedom and space.  Personally, I think they would have done better not having the police chasing you everywhere. It really wasn't necessary. Having said that, it's still an enjoyable game and one I have no reservation in recommending.			"

												It's hard to believe Mirror Edge already is six years old but this game has been one of the greatest experiences for me ever since. Mirror Edge was original because it was the first game to introduce parkour into a first person game. For the most part of the game you're unarmed trying to escape from trigger happy police. You are able to slide kick or punch enemies and you are even able to take their weapons. Guns carry a few bullets so you won't kill that many opponents but that's alright since it's not what this game is about. Most of my favourite games have a great story but Mirror Edge is an exception. It's not like the story is bad but it's not great either. What makes Mirror Edge one of my favourites is simple: Atmosphere. It's just amazing to run around sky high buildings, escaping from the police. The buildings all look white and clean even the indoor industrial areas look clean which are just great to look at. Even falling down from tall buildings was something I enjoyed and made dying a lot easier.... in a way.The graphics are still great for a 2009 + Mirror Edge has a great OST. This game is not recommended to people who want to kill lots of enemies but everyone else who is open to new things should really try this game at least once in your life.			"

												I'm honestly not sure if recommended is the right term for this game. This game feels like a testbed for an entire sub-genre, the First Person Platformer, its so far is the only unique example of it and it shows. When the game is in its stride it feels exhilarating to play with an amazing sense of direction and unique style in graphics that really has stopped it looking dated several years later. Unfortunately the combat sequences can feel really out of place and can get frustrating very quickly and the game can quickly confuse the player about where exactly they need to be to the point where you have to look up videos on Youtube just to get an idea of where you are supposed to be. These two negatives can also get happen all at once which only serves to unduly stress the player. The story itself is also a letdown with no real talking points or standout characters excluding that of the protagonist Faith.So with two glaring flaws why do I give this the thumbs up? I feel simply the concept that this game shows is full of potential, if DICE can iron out these flaws in the upcoming sequel it could really fly. There is something about this game that I just can't put my finger on, but it none of the less makes me excited to see if DICE can properly bake the formula into something incredible in the sequel.

												Mirror's Edge is brilliant! It's a one of a kind game that combined first person and parkour remarkably well together. The graphics are stunning given that this game was released back in 2009. Besides that, the story is distinctively outstanding too. This game has a rather unique storyline that was carefully crafted for this game, but at the same time also allows you to realize how seemingly true it is and reflect on the fact that this is something that can one day happen to us as well. According to Wikipedia and I edited it a little, the story of Mirror’s Edge takes place in an unnamed 'utopian' city where life is seemingly comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian government that monitors all communication, controls the media, have policies which include the outright illegalisation of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates sham trials, and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game they had also opened fire on a major protest against their deceitful rule, killing many civilians. The story is actually rather similar to present-day situations in real life where in some parts of the world, democratic system is failing and corrupted governments are simply clinging onto their power through fake democracy or dictatorship where they exert extensive control on things like the media and internet and also prioritize monetary gain while neglecting human rights and the environment. So it shouldn't be surprising that the scenario in game can quite possibly happen to us one day if we continue progressing down the current path without making much effort to create positive changes. Well, rant over lol. Anyway, it’s definitely worth giving this awesome game a try especially if you are blessed with the capability of not feeling motion sickness when there's a lot of movements on screen. Also, looking forward to Mirror's Edge Catalyst! :D			"

												This game was a major breakthrough in the gaming world. Parkour hasn't been addressed much in any game until Mirrors Edge came out. There are a few ninja games (or splinter cell games) that had a bit of these abilities available but it wasn't until this game came out that parkour started exploding (besides the youtube videos). I beat this game on xbox 360 and here I am again for more. You are a girl named Faith running through a city that is poison for runners (as her kind is called). These runners are pursued by ""police"" relentlessly until a potential mayoral candidate is found assassinated at his desk with Faith's sister (who is a police officer) right besides him. The story starts lifting more questions than any wrestling sitcom ever would.The gameplay itself is fairly good, especially for it's age (released 2008). Controls include jump, slide, punch, kicking while sliding, disarming, time distortion (slow), turning 180 on a press of a button and another button for hint. Sprint happens gradually as you gain momentum and hold LS all the way up. RS will allow you to move your head as you'd like even when climbing a pipe or ladder. Some of the grab controls feel clunkier on PC than they did on xbox. By that I mean you have to be very direct in where you point and how you jump. If, for example, you are jumping ledge to ledge and decide to jump from a diagonal, you may encounter issues in Faith grabbing the ledge. Sometimes it will catch (depending on where you're facing). Other times, you will fall miserably to your death from hundreds of feet. Besides that little hiccup, most of the game feels right on. Besides zip lining and running and jumping on ledges, the player can jump from some insane heights, run along the wall to reach another ledge and even combine sliding (crouching) and jumping under and over obstacles. All these mechanics put together with the pressure of evading bullets really combines for a neat and exhilarating game.To help the player figure out where to go, pressing B will point you in the right direction. It can be a bit confusing at times as not knowing what to use to maximize your parkour skills can be difficult. Fortunately, the developers chose to go with a simplistic graphics scheme. This simplicity does not take away from the game. Rather, it accentuates what's really important about it. The graphics using a minimalist design not only helps the player recognize tools they may use, but also gives the game a unique personality. Concerning the animations, they aren't the best but certainly aren't the worst. Some disarming scenes may feel a bit funny to watch. Would have been nice if they gave you more control in this situation! You will see faiths hands or feet appear on the screen as you jump (which is a great addition). Sounds and effects are pretty good. You'll hear Faith pant when she gets tired or a clunk when she misses something (or a big thump when she falls to her death). I think they could have done a little bit more with the sound to incorporate more of an ambiance.Overall, this game is definitely recommended. I'm not sure how it's predecessor will live up, but this is the game that made parkour ""famous"". The physics in this game were definitely a break through and a lot of other games have attempted to emulate such movement. When it first came out, it was easily an 8.5.

												Mirror's Edge is one of a kind type of game.  Superb graphics that really utilizes color well to create a surreal world while also using color to help guide you through the levels.  You are running from the authoritarian government and must not be caught throughout the game.  This is where this game is unique.  This is not a first person game where weapons will save your life, though weapons are available if you steal one from the government goons.  This is a game about parcour.  You run, jump, slide and slam your way through doors.  If you do so fluidly, you will gain more momentum, more speed, and the game seems perfect and so organic when this happens.  However, it's difficult to attain this type of fluidity.  The game is challenging, but this is what makes the game so attractive to me.  The challenge, the uniqueness and the sheer beauty of the game makes this an easily recommended title for all to try at least once.  This is a must have game for all gamers.			"

												Flow and rhythm, finesse and brute force. These factors mingle together with this game. The way it feels, plays, looks and sounds are all something beyond most games released at the time Mirror's Edge was. If it wasnt for the constant Kruger city police chasing the character through everything, I'd just camp out in this game and watch and listen to everything it has to offer. The DICE graphical texturing mixed with Solar Fields superfluous soundtrack create such a deep atmostphere that this is one of those games that grabbed me and made me finish the whole thing in one RUN. (hah get it).I can't even review this game properly like Transistor. I would just urge you at most to try it out and if not at least go listen to the sound track for bit. This is'nt the mess that Mirror's Edge Catalyst became.			"

												Amazing game, with (mostly) great controls, excellent free running mechanics, great atmosphere thanks to the gorgeous environments and flow of free running, all of which hold up strong even to this day! Completed the game on PS3, and was surprised to find this game on PC looks beautiful still compared to recent games, at least on the highest settings.

												Overall, this game was very well done, it was new for it's time and I still consider it revolutionary. Parts may frustrate you and seem glitchy, and the control scheme takes a while to get down pat as well as how Faith (main character) moves. But I'd still highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to try something new.			"

												Bought this after all the hype about this game. I was utterly disappointed. Here is a breakdown of pros and cons:Pros:- Great graphics even 6 years after its release- Some of the pakour part is funCons:- Extremely frustrating control and game play, just plain annoying sometimes- The physics doesn't make any sense, certain short juimps are impossible to make, while some of the seemingly impossible jumps are part of requirement to finish the story- There is essentially no plot- I have no idea why they use the cheap 2D water colour style animation - they look terrible. For their super short lengths, do the designer really have to save more money by not doing 3D animation?- The fighting is just plain frustrating- There is one way to do everything, no alternatives whatsoever, if you aren't able to read designer's mind, you are SOL- The objective is never clear, you are spending the entire game figuring out where to go (most of which makes no sense). The designers must be too lazy to put any real puzzles to challenge the player.- The checkpoint system is utterly frustrating - sometimes failing one obstacle could cause you to have to redo 10 obstacles, why not just allow the player to save?After finishing the game, I had to ask myself, what's the point of this game? I basically spend 7 hours getting frustrated and annoyed most of the time, and there is minimal enjoyment. I'm deleting the game right away and will never touch it again. Too bad I wasted money on this.			"

												I finally got my hands on this game, after all these years. So many times have I heard how good this game is.First of all, the game looks stunning for such an ""old"" game.Also this whole fps parkour concept was really unique and it had really good potential.Well that was really most of the things I enjoyed in Mirror's Edge.Most of the times I just hoped for the game to end, which by the way was really short. It could easily be beaten in three hours if you play in normal difficulty and you don't easily get killed by the bad AI or fall to your death because of the clunky controls.The story was interesting in the start, but it didn't take long when it didn't interest me anymore by being so poor and short. Even the ending was odd and it just stopped way too early. Cutscenes between the chapters were really cheap looking. Like did EA stop funding DICE in the middle of the production?Combat was one of the worst things here. I can't name any other fps with combat bad as in Mirror's Edge. Fighting with fisticuffs almost made me cry. Disarming an opponent was made a bit too hard and clumsy. Sometimes it would have been nice to sneak and skip a fight, but somehow the AI knows exactly where I am, and then most of the times I cannot escape from their rain of fire.The clunky controls were one of the reason I wanted to quit the game numerous times. Mostly the game did not do what I wanted it to do. Sometimes it didn't want to grab a certain ledge, jump at the right time, nor did anything smoothly as excpected. For example sometimes I lost all of my speed when Faith did not want to run to a step, which was few inches high (so she stopped and I had to jump on it). Also it was really common that Faith got stuck in certain points and it made me fail my jump.Now I know people will say that I will get better with the clumsy controls if I play more. But the problem is, the game is so short and it has no replay value. Also there is a time trial gamemode, but I dont really want to touch it after the storymode.I bought it from the summer sale for a few euros, but sadly it wasn't really worth it. I really wanted to like this game...I give it 5/10.			"

												In 2008 DICE released a beautiful game: Mirror’s Edge!It’s a first-person action adventure game but movement and graphics are a unique, Mirror’s Edge was an innovation and is still a fantastic game. It’s one of the games I’ve played multiple times and one of that I played without a break. This game should be in every library on steam.StoryMirror’s Edge takes place in a unnamed, modern city where life is comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the government is a totalitarianism regime which spies all communications and controls the media. People have to give up their personal freedom in this world. That’s the background story. I won’t tell more about the story because that would spoiler youGameplayAs I said above, the gameplay is unique and a real innovation, because you have a freedom of movement in the world you’ll have never seen in any game before. Faith is a runner, she has the ability to fight in melee [you can disarm enemies and use their weapons against them] and she’s a master in parkour running so you can use the complete environment to move forward. If you chain your movements you can build up a lot of speed. For example: You run a little bit, do a wall run, than you roll up on the floor and you continue to run with full speed. If you make any mistakes, you lose your speed. Faith is also able to knock out enemies with her body. For example she can use a wall run to build up speed and then jump to an enemy and kick him down or you disarm an enemy, knock him down and use the weapon against the others. But combat isn’t the focus, you can bypass the most situations, it’s better to run. The gameplay in Mirror’s Edge is so much fun unfortunately only the sequel Mirror’s Edge Catalyst has the same.A nice feature is that the camera is linked with the movement and that you see the body including arms and legs from Faith. Thanks to this you have a realistic feeling while playing this game.Graphic/SoundSurely you have already seen it, the graphics are very bright and have only a few colors, most of the time you see white. This is a special feature in Mirror’s Edge. It has its own art style which is very clean, almost clinically clean and minimalistic, it’s just beautiful. But it not only looks fantastic, it’s useful to retain the overview in the world. Also it matches to the city and the society, it accompanies the setting perfectly.The voice act is very nice like the complete soundscape. If you like ambient music, you’ll like the soundtrack here too. Solar Fields did a great job, the soundtrack is fantastic and Lisa Miskovsky created a masterpiece with Still Alive [not confuse with the Portal soundtrack].AtmosphereWith the unique graphic, the fascinating gameplay and the fantastic world Mirror’s Edge has its own very nice atmosphere. You are a lonely runner and most of the times you don’t see any allies, just hearing the voices and see enemies. You are against the world, a rebel refuses to be suppressed by the system that enslaves the people.Mirror’s Edge is one of the most unique games out there and a real masterpiece including many innovations. With a nice story, an impressive art style, a great soundtrack and an innovative and interesting gameplay you have more than one reason to buy this. I also recommend you Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, the sequel. It’s different because it has an open-world but it’s a nice game too. Unfortunately that you have to use Origin to play this.			"

												""It's not for me"", is all I can say about this game. People say it's an awesome, enjoyable experience, but for me, it just boggled my mind.The overworld is huge and confusing, I had no idea what I was supposed to do, barely ever, and no idea where I was supposed to go, and I found it super hard to do anything as the controls were weird too.But, the game just made me feel kind of anxious and ill, with all the jumping around and movement, I felt kind of motion sick after a while, and the ""chase encounters"" from the baddies just made me feel genuinely scared because I felt so out of control of my character. So, I did not complete this game, nor do I think I'll revisit. Sadly, I just think it isn't for me. And that's okay! You're allowed to not like some games. And for me, this is one of mine.Nilesy			"

												Mirror’s Edge, absolutely unexpected DICE project (which, we will remind, all the life I stamped continuous Battlefield), from the very beginning armed absolutely with other ideology: the main call in game — is in details worked acrobatics and difficult levels. It should be noted that the chosen direction was correct — before us really absolutely a new view on parkour, game which can present a lot of pleasure to fans of extreme adrenalinic jogs.

												Mirror’s Edge is a unique first person parkour game set in a stunning, beautiful futuristic world. I had a lot of fun playing this game! The music is phenomenal, the graphics are great, and its very original. My only beef with this game is that the combat system is terrible, you are constantly being chased while defenceless, and it has a lot of frame rate issues when other NPCs come out. I have a really nice computer so I know that the frame rate problem isn't due to my specs. I searched the web to see if any one else has frame rate issues while NPCs arrive and I found that TONS of people have the same issue. Overall, Mirror’s Edge is great game despite its irritating combat system and frame rate issues. I would recommend picking this game up while its on sale. I give Mirror’s Edge a 7.9/10.			"

												I really can't say I know of any games quite like this one. It may be short, but it leaves one heck of an impact, and will easily draw you in for more. Having previously played it on the Xbox 360, I can attest that while you can finish the whole story in one sitting with relative ease, you'll likely be playing the bits you liked over and over again.The story is where the game really shines. You quickly learn that the primarily trigger-based controls are, while unique, pretty intuitive after a while. Everything in the game feels natural pretty quickly. Finding a path, stringing together acrobatic moves, and generally making your way around. Only the combat really feels stilted, with a same few punch animations. You're mostly encouraged simply to disarm opponents by tapping the Y button when their weapon is highlighted, which gives you their gun and instantly knocks them out. This can get tedious, but pacifist runs are possible.The cutscenes have an animated comic sort of look to them. This is decent enough for getting the point across. The plot exists, primarily to get you between things to run around. It does a well enough job, and has quite a few surprises for only ten levels. The actual story levels themselves are like a combined puzzle platformer, as you mull over how to get where you're going and pull off some intensely satisfying parkour once you get the hang of it. The color scheme and lighting keeps the areas distinct from each other and easy on the eyes. It's a very particular, stylized look that benefits the game well.As for replay value, as the main story is short and sweet (it does not overstay its welcome by any stretch, but you may be expecting a bit more at the end), the game banks on you enjoying time trials. Really, really enjoying time trials. Because that's all there is. No other challenges in any way, shape, or form, just be the fastest. To be fair, it's quite clear the game is designed for this exact purpose when you start shaving valuable seconds off and learning how to keep momentum going throughout your run, but if you don't like them, already got the three runner bags hidden in each level, and, for whatever reason, don't feel a little thrill at pulling an awesome time off, you've pretty much finished the game as soon as the credits roll.The music is excellently fitting. The game overall can put a fantastic feeling of adrenaline into you, and a feeling of success when you figure out a new way through a level. There's no faster way to give someone a fear of heights than having them fall to their death in this game. The loading times are almost gone in the PC version (only three ""Loading Level"" screens still appeared for me), but the lengthy elevator rides and various delays meant to mask them are still perfectly intact, leading to some rather pointless waiting in the middle of a good run. Finally, the time trial scores are not registered through Steam. They are tracked through an EA Online account, which basically means you will not be finding your friend's times and racing your ghosts without a lot of undue effort.In the end, though, this is quite the amazing game, and I must still recommend it, if only because it leaves an amazing impression and stands alone as an experience. There's just nothing quite like it.			"

												This game brings back the good old parcour memories from the early 2009. I've played it around 2010 and lost the cd so after it was on sale on steam i bought it.There is nothing special to say about this game, it's a parcour game where you got control over a runner who is called Faith, im not going to spoiler more :)I finished the game in around 5 hours, good players are way faster.Good:-Different difficulty levels (they aren't that different imho)-The Enemy-KI is acceptable (cops are easy, pursuit cops are hard)-A lot of weapons (pistol, machine gun, shotgun, etc.)-Easy Control (easy to learn)-Good Graphic and Sound (it can contest many 2017 games)-The game is running fast, stable and the checkpoints are good setted-The Runners-Vision (doors, pipes, etc. are red, so you know where to go next) is a good help for new players-One fail (failed a jump in example) leads to death most of the time, first annoying, but very realistic-If the cops are shooting at you, you will run faster automatically, trust me :) -Most of the time you can avoid fights with cops and you are able to just run away or fight them, disarm them etc.-Extra stuff like artworks, music, video sequences and eastereggsNot so good:-New players will not be that fast, but if you are experienced you will beatthe game in around 3-5 hours, the 8 chapters aren't that big, could be more :)-It's always like go to this building, escape from the cops, a little bit boring-Roofs are most of the time looking the sameBugfix:If the game starts lagging really hard if the cops are shooting on you or glass shatters, you just have to disable ""Nvidia PhysX"" in the options ingame, you have to restart the game after and now it dosen't lag or freezes anymore (some graphic cards got problems with physx).What i can say:If the game is on sale (no idea why old games are always so expensive) and you want to give it a try, i can highly recommend it.

The story line is great however I think that they should have given more background information at the start of the game with a short movie as there are several things that don't get explained till well into the game which would make more sense if the backstory was told properly at the beginning.Still I love this game and am looking forward to Mirror's Edge 2.10/10 from me!

												A very good and intresting game. The game is unique in its own way. I really enjoy the parkour mechanics of the game, it is original and I have yet to experience anything like it in other titles. The world design is briliant, it is very clean and beautiful. Considering the game was realesed in 2009 makes it even more impressive. The graphics is really ""up to date"".There are also a few things I did not like. The story is not the best and the gun play (whitch does appear frequently) is terrible. You cannot aim, you can't see your current ammo and you can't reload. This can be really frustrating in clutch scenarios and it does not help that the crosshair is bad.However, I would recommend this game to all the people that are looking for a parkour/running game with cool ""jumps"" and different ways to reach the target. The game is good on what it does, but not really anything more.I would like to excuse for any grammar or spelling mistakes, english is not my main language :)			"

												Although the campaign is easily 4 hours long on normal difficulty, I would still recommend this game to anybody of all tastes. This is a unique blend of first-person action and platformer style puzzle solving. Although the story isn't very engaging, it fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly. The visuals are stunning if not photorealistic at times. It performs very well and you will encounter very little problems and bugs along the wayPros+Stunning Graphics.+Easy to learn, hard to master gameplay.+Engaging and captivating atmosphere.+Appropriate storyline which fits well into the game's universe.+Arcade mode for speedrunsCons-Poor AI sometimes throwing the game off balance.-Short Story mode 4-5 hours on first playthough.-Lack of graphics customisation-Little extra content-Very linearUltimately I would recommend this game, especially as it it dirt cheap. It is well worth a play through and I guarantee it will leave a lasting impression on the player for years to come.			"

												Played this in 2016, it does look good! Count around 6 hours of playing if you're like me and don't care about all hidden secrets but prefer running & playing the story. 6 hours isn't much, but eh, I got the game for free, and I enjoyed those 6 hours, so :) The gameplay is very interesting, I played the entire thing with a xbox controller, and it's pleasant. The gunfights didn't exacly felt right (maybe it's the controller, go figure), but I still enjoyed to ""shotgun those ninja's faces"" (play it to understand!). I got about 3 or 4 good adrenaline rushes, but also felt like the game felt me 3 or 4 times (like: I swear I pushed the right button and I fell - and died - anyway. not kewl!). It's technical, but in general it goes quite smoothly, and the overall feeling is really good : run, run, (jump), run.The story itself isn't really interesting, the plot has some severe holes in it... but it does make sense to run like a crazy-person and jump from roof to roof if you can look past these inconsistencies, and I believe that's the main point of this game. I could somewhat compare it to Dying Light freerun on top of which you'd add new moves.Anyway, despite it being an ""old"" game in 2016, despite the story that could have been better and the lifespan double, I still recommend it to about anyone.

												Dropped in the middle of an Orwellian dystopia, the fragmented story told in animated cutscenes, loosely pulls together a string of well-designed parkour sequences which comprise of running from (and optionally gunning down) militarized police.While the basic parkour is fluid, I suffered motion sickness when knocked to the ground or falling from buildings, due to the wobble and sway of the first-person viewpoint and even with the onscreen reticle/dot. Yet another game where an option to switch between third and first viewpoints would improve the experience.Melee encounters are so few and far between that when forced into combat the lack of practice can breed frustration. While it's possible to avoid firing a shot for the entire game, I found it less frustrating (less checkpoint restarts) to use guns. There are also collectable packages, which didn't add any real challenge or in-game reward.While not a bad parkour title, it's still worthy of a recommendation, however I would play Assassin's Creed, Shadow of Mordor or Styx over this.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

												Mirror's Edge is a First Person Parcour Shooter... thingy.. I guess?You're playing the role of Faith, a girl having lost her parents and having only her sister left. She meets Merc, the head of the gang or organisation called the ""Runners"". He trains her in the art of.. well.. running, and using the rooftops of the city to their advantage. Essentially they are what one could call delivery people (don't quote me on that, I played it early morning so I don't remember much of the beginning).After a short parcour and CQC tutorial you're being thrown right into the game, the only help you get is the so called ""Runner's Vision"" giving you hints on where to go. Even with this help I was sometimes struggling to find the correct pathway, even though the levels are mostly linear, only giving you no more than a few ways from one area to the next.Personally I really enjoyed the game. My only problem was incredible FPS drops in areas with shattered glas or when I've been shot at. To fix this you have to delete a folder and two files from the game files because those are outdated drivers which EA included for some ♥♥♥♥ing stupid reason.Anyway, you should really give this classic a try because even on the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computers (my laptop is from 2011) you can play this game on maximum settings and it looks absolutely beautiful.

												TL; DR:Mirror's edge was okay.The game play was the best and most infuriating part of the game. The hand to hand combat was a bit clunky and the disarms had to be timed perfectly. However, the guns were powerful and very fun to use I found myself wishing the game allowed you to parkour with the machine guns instead of having to drop them to continue. The parkour was enjoyable, fast and fluid for 60% of the game the other 40% was frustrating, repetitive and boring.The visuals were nice and unique being a bit more memorable than the parkour. The soundtrack is forgettable for the most part but still not bad.The story is like a modern CoD game; there isn't much.The game is different but okay not amazing, not bad, but okay. I do recommend the game, however you should play any unplayed games in your library first before buying this game.It takes 8-12 hours to beat the game and I would rate it a 6/10.			"

												Mirror's Edge, when it ""works"", is a fun game.  The ability to run, slide, leap and climb feels wonderful when it comes together.  The story is pretty ""meh"" but you don't play ME for the story.Where it falls apart is the difficulty of executing some of the moves.  I'm not used to playing platformers so maybe this is on me, but there were lots of places where I jumped, died, jumped, died, jumped, died, .... etc.  Until somehow, thru what seemed like sheer luck, I happened to hit it right.   There were one or two jumps where I'm absolutely sure I was executing them right, but until I invoked ""bullet time"" (or whatever it's called) they didn't work.  Even worse, in some cases the game sends you back to an earlier checkpoint where you then get to execute a couple of other finicky moves.  Yes, I did get better at it, but a few things like wall running felt hit or miss the whole way thru.  That stuff turned what would have been a fun runthru into an exercise in exasperated persistence.All that being said, it is a fun game, just be prepared to get annoyed.			"

												I first played this game back in 2009 when it came out and I still play it to this very day from time to time.Gameplay is smooth with the perfect mix of realism and arcade elements to still make it a game. It really feels like you flow through the levels, quickly fight back (or escape) an enemy and get back on track running towards your goal. The game has also some of the greatests vistas of urban landscapes I have ever witnessed in a videogame. The level design is remarkably beautiful to date.Some negative aspects I could drag your attention to are its lenght and the way the story is presented. The game is short, no doubt. Although it offers a certain level or replayability because of its open level design, each time you play it you will finish it faster (but we can say that about just any game, can't we?). As for the story, it feels like it is just there; a filler that gives you a reason to run from point A to point B. But you do not really get into it and what you actually do in the game does not feel too much related to its further development.However, I do not think they are game breaking or that the experience suffers as a whole from these two elements, otherwise I would not have been playing it for the past 5 years, let alone recommend it.

												This game is something that I would reccomend, because I personally enjoyed playing through it, but it definetly depends on who you are and what you care about in a game.If you're looking for a game with a good story, I don't reccomend it, the story is crap and the ending sucks.But, if you're looking for a game that has fun gameplay (Most of the time) than you should play this.The gameplay is fun and refreshing, the game does have red objects that guide you but theres enough freedom in how you find out how to get across, But, i have one huge problem with this game, which is that you, the player, doesn't have enough freedom in how you aproach things, you always do the same kinds of things and there are no alternate ways that you can reach the end in, theres more a straight line and no real other ways to do it.Like i mentioned earlier the story is crap, and the ending is just terrible.Can i talk about the ending real quick? If you don't wanna be spoiled then don't read this.What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the ending, its not a satisfying end, you don't have any motivation to stop Jack Nife, he just kinda shows up there and has for some reason kidnapped Kate, it doesn't pay off, you're just lead straight to him by the glowing red objects that lead you to the helicopter, and then he crashes you both magically survive, cue game song, the end.Now, it may seem like I dislike the game, but I don't, I reccomend that you play it because its fun, but just remember, if you're looking for a good story or a satisfying ending, this is NOT the game for you.

#1 Reason you should buy this game: you can look down and see your feet.Mirror's Edge (let's just call it Edge), was EA's bold idea to try something new. And it worked out really well (we are not talking about the slight failure Catalyst is). Edge tells us the story of Faith, definitely not a reference to the leap of faith, a runner in an unnamed city almost completely devoid of personality and full of order, absolute control and sparkly clean buildings, thanks to its totalitarian leaders. Faith as a runner, delivers special packages that contain information to an underground network that seek to undermine the authorities. And the best way to do that, is parkour.The story is pretty mediocre, at best. Characters are dull and not interesting, full of cliches and devoid of any emotional ties to the player. They simply are there to serve their role and that's it. The cutscenes are similar to really bad street sign commercials, trying to get in touch with ""modernism"", but they fail to do so, and personally, they simply deprived me of any enjoyment to watch. At least, the story doesn't last long, leaving you to enjoy your second playthrough.At least the world is interesting to explore. The art style and the minimalistic colors help to understand what over-bearing goverment means. You can almost feel the concrete blasting heat all over the place as you traverse pipes, fences and wall-run to your goal. It's beautiful, but the limited choice of colors can make you feel a bit frustrated after a while, thinking that the city is in fact, the same neighbourhood redone over and over again to fill in the maps with small tweaks. I can look past that though. They could allow the players to freely roam though, not simply constraint them to small parts of the city in each stage. Shame they didn't come up with this idea.The gameplay however, is the true star of the show. Faith will slam doors with her hand, her feet will kick during a long jump, the motion blur on the sides, they all come together to create an incredible level of immersion and momentum, making you gasp for breath as you leap through the gaps between skyscrapers, uncertain whether you survive the jump or not. At times, squads of policemen will chase you and you have the options to avoid them, or grab one of their guns and fight them. However, hand-to-hand and gunfights are your only options and they feel slightly clunky at times, since punches and kicks are very redundant and to perform a weapon steal you need to wait for the right moment when the weapon becomes red.After the campaign, there's not really much you can do. You can pop up the difficulty and try the challenges, but that's about it. There is no multiplayer, but there are leaderboards where you can test your skills against other people, but never in direct, straightforward competition.It's a nice game, it's worth giving a shot since it's something you don't see everyday. You won't regret it.RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 8/10Story: 4/10Unique Factor: Detailed Animations: 8.5/10OVERALL:7.1/10 "

												Full of plot holes, bugs and not fun in general. Entertaining at most but a nice time killer.EDIT 1:But why, do you ask.ABOUT THE PLOT.-There are many points where story doesn't have a continuity (After getting your sister back in both cut scenes ""COME ON, YOU WERE JUST IN PERSIUT"")-Forgettable, unbuilt characters. (Seriously, I forgot all the names)-An ending so bland and a game length so short (Where most of the games I take double than this)-Nothing to do after you're doneABOUT THE GAMEPLAY-Great fluidity and simple controls-Terrible shooty shoot system.-So unawardiing and uncompelling gameplayABOUT THE BUGS-EA. Need I say more?-Alt + Tabbing is a gamble with the devil-Random game crashes and freezesPLEASE NOTE THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPPINION, WHICH IS SUBJECTIVE, SO PLEASE DON'T BE SALTY ABOUT IT.EDIT 2:Longest review for meEDIT 3:Apparently lowering the specs should help but this game is so painfully bland it falls flat on the hype. Sure, it was good for the price but I'd never play it again. The only people who play it is my family who wanted a 3D version of the mobile game ""VECTOR"" (Not good either, but more stable than Buggysoft's release).I mean, just look at the ending: You save your sister while waves of poliece officers come to the rooftop and after you crash a ♥♥♥♥ing helicopter at downtown you don't have to run anymore. BTW, if you think I have a biased opinion, then see my other reviews, they are 100% by the base game experience with no online functions unless required.			"

												Wow, just wow, best game I played as of recent, felt really like a breath of fresh air and something truly different!If I had to describe this game with one sentence, it would be: Prince of Persia/Assassin's Creed with modern setting and story, no time control and swords, but with guns and most of all, first person perspective.Especially the idea of creating a parkour game in first person was brilliant and unique.Aside from that, the game also has very nice graphics and a beautiful environment, full of strong colors, especially red.The story is very engaging, enriched by its cartoon/comic style presentation and filled with many twists as well (along with the usual ""who is the masked villain?"" twist, though I guessed it soon enough). The fact that we had a strong female lead and not your stereotypical male hero added to it, Faith was a really well structured, beautiful and cool protagonist.The soundtrack is quite good, the ambient music fitted the game's tone, though I didn't find it exceptional.One minor flaw that I had heard many times was the game's short duration (~10 levels), but in my opinion the game was just long enough to keep the player's interest unwavering and ended right on time, with an open -kind of- ending, leaving us wanting for a hopeful sequel!

												I usually get nauseated and dizzy in these type of first person games however I didn't playing this game so take with that what you will.On the other hand, the game itself has a very compelling protagonist, with a wonderfully drawn script that kept me going throughout the game. The level designs are absolutely breathtaking, from the skyscrapers to the underground levels.The combat is very fluid and for once in any sort of game, I feel that having a weapon is actually a detriment. You move so much slower, attack so much slower. Without one you feel very fluid, able to weave in and out of a battle and depending on how skilled you are.Overall the games fun as hell, the levels are beautifully designed.

												AWESOME GAME!I really liked the parkour style gameplay. Kickass game!I was surprised that the ending mission took less than 5 seconds on my first try, maybe because I followed my instincts as Faith and haven't done otherwise.What I don't like in this game is that I can't disarm opponents early in the game. I just learned it when I'm already at chapter 8 when I used my adrenaline first then was able to successfully disarm an opponent. Another thing I hate though, is that I had motion sickness in early levels...I don't know about the game's replay value since I just completed normal mode in 10 hours, and I don't think that I would play it on hard mode. Also, I got all the bags before I ended it with the help of a guide.But overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes action-type games, since I really enjoyed it. Thumbs up, yow!

												Mirror's Edge is one of those games that you have to play. It's a classic and, while the story is far from being great, the game is a fresh concept set in a interesting near-future world.Controls are great, and easy, but you have to master them. You get to know Faith and everything that she can do. And when you know her, you can release all her power.Combat... I think Mirror's Edge Catalyst (the new Mirror's Edge game, which is a reboot) has a better combat system. Mirror's Edge combat is somehow clunky and weird, and it's kinda pointless to allow the player using weapons. Honestly, this game is way more fun if you don't use any weapons at all. Just run or combat with your hands!Parkour is awesome, and it feels so real. You can even feel some vertigo!This game is one of the best games from the past generation, and it's so underrated in my opinion. "

												I never thought a Parkour style game would be this good. It didn't start off that strong with frame rate issues due to physx being on and of course, the seal of quality and money, the E.A. logo when you start it up. But overall this game is really good, It's art style is uniqe and isn't re-made of some game that already exists. It's faster/harder than I thought it would be when I first started keeping it nice and challenging. The only issue I have had with the game is screen/texture tearing. It is pretty bad when it comes to that, even with v-sync on it still tears a bit. But anyone reading this should definitely go buy it during a sale or now. Since it's on Steam instead of Origin and Steam has sales. *1 of many hint hints E.A.*			"

												This is easily one of the best games EA/Dice has ever made. This is not only beacuse of the story which is easy to follow, or the amazing graphics (Especially since this game was released about 5 years ago), but it's beacuse it simply is a game you simply can grab, and easily get grabbed by it. The story though is a little short, but it is covered up by the different time trial courses which take part in some of the same places the story does. Even though there's no anti-cheat system for the game, which makes the world record impossible to beat, it's a very nice feature with stars being handed out in the time trial section as well. It promotes players to think, which is actually quite nice when you actually beat the level, since they're quite hard to get all the 3 stars in. Even though it's old, it for sure is gold!			"

												This game is really really gud, the campaign is fun to play, and still after you finishged it once, and you have to use your brain to compete this, so its not just a cod campaign, it is a challenge, although if you dont like playing campaigns, i advise you not to buy this.   Pro's	  -good campaign-replayable campaign-playable on a controller-the campaign is actually a challenge-good control placement on the controller-good background songs-   Con's	  -bad control placements on the mouse and keyboard My Rating: 88/100 Remember, this is  MY	 opinionShoutOut to   SpaceWaffle	  For Gameshare			"

												Wow! This game is amazing! I love every single exhilirating moment of the gameplay, (Except when I fail a stunt 20 times in a row....) The awesome brightly colored cityscape, the fact that you get to run across building tops and not have the restrictions of a typical gamer, (Gah! I twisted an ankle! Gah! I skinned my knee! Gah! Sunlight!) and the super tricky combat ( I don't use the weapons, I prefer to combat batman-style.I don't know why people hate it!). It is a spectacular game, and I definately wish more people knew about it.9/10 Worth 20 bucks			"

												Breathtakingly beautiful in its stark minimalism, MIrror's Edge is a graceful foray into first-person platforming.

												Revolutionary back in the day and still pleasant to play. The main gameplay revolves around freerunning a futuristic and superb looking city, getting from Point A to Point B as efficient as possible, with a little martial arts and gunfights thrown in here and there. The game is set in a city, where the police is in control of everything and sharing free information has become almost impossible. The runners are the ones transporting them illegally for their customers high above the city. You play such a runner and it doesn't take long until you get in trouble with the law and may discover something bigger along the way.The gameplay is fast and is only slowed down by some combat sequences. You can either solve them with your fists or overwhelm an officer and use his gun, but most of the time you will be evading the cops with your freerunning skills. It is not an open world game, your path is linear with a few possible variations. Combat is the weakest part of the game, followed by the story, which basically only exists to give you a reason to run to a certain point and is fairly short. Afterwards you can play the levels in time trial mode or try and find all hidden collectibles throughout the levels.Sometimes you need to find the correct path and the game feels like a puzzler. If you are not surrounded by police and can take your time to figure things out, those parts are really enjoyable. If you're under heavy fire and have to act quickly and constantly chose dead ends or wrong jumps, because you don't have the time to study your surroundings, it can get a bit frustrating. If you are having trouble, you can enable the runner vision in the options menu (you can disable it too, of course). It highlights possible paths for you.All in all a game I would recommend, despite its flaws. Defenitly pick it up at a discount, at full price you might be a bit dissapointed. I bought it anyway for nostalgic reasons.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a very original game which became an instant classic because of its innovations and timeless charm.What makes the game original is the complete focus on running and navigating the environment without having to deal with puzzles, combat or other distractions.You play as ""Faith"", a runner, in a beautiful yet dystopic city, where the goverment constantly monitors its citizens and oppresses the freedom of information; your goal is to deliver sensitive data and uncover a conspiracy that revoles around the main character sister's framing. The whole game relies on a constant ""flow"" of movement; the more you run the faster you go and you're encouraged to link jumps, wallruns, slides and rolls like you would in a fighting game, in order to maintain some kind of a combo.As soon as you start it becomes incredibly addictive, and you'll soon challenge yourself at being faster, faster and faster.The thing that separates this game from the rest, other than the simple yet perfect gameplay, is the masterful level design; the city you play in has an incredible charm, with its candid roads and silver skyscrapers and the developers really put a lot of though into the design of the map. Whenever you are not runnin you'll spend countless minutes enjoying the scenary and daydreaming about how living in such a place must be like, and the specific use of primary colors for the interiors makes a nice contrast to the bright white outdoors; everything is clean, perfect, symmetric, simple.The path you have to follow is linear, but that allowed the developers to craft the most interesting way ever to navigate the environment, showing an insight into the life of the city, making the player visit its underground stations, offices, sewers, police headquarters, rooftops ecc...It's very hard to describe this with words and you really have to play it to witness it.One thing that's fair to admit it's the game's lenght; realistically you'll finish the campaign in about 5 hours or less, which for me never was a problem but i know for many others could.There's not much else to say about the game, because of its genius semplicity, other than it's a masterpiece; a game that every gamer worthy of this title should experience, to make its cult status grow even bigger.A game like this is only made every 10 years or so, it rightfully became a cult classic.

Oh, cool!Despite giving me serious bouts of rage-quitting, having issues with how linear the game is and a little cliched story, Mirror's Edge was a rewarding adrenaline rush. Beautiful music and art direction adds more to the atmosphere. The fact that I'm not given a gun and have to run to evade NPCs was fun (you can get involved in fights, which is more fun). Spectacular game with a simple but innovative gameplay. Hopefully the prequel will have a more open and dynamic world with multiple path options. A great game nonetheless.			"

												I finally got around to beating this game after like two years. I got about 2/3 of the way done before, got stuck on an area, got salty, and quit. Picked it up again and finished it in 3 hours or so.It's usually not hard to see WHERE you're supposed to end up, it's just finding the path there and not falling to your death from a bad jump. I'd say there's replay value, because as soon as you finish the game you're just really getting the mechanics down and tend to make less mistakes.I see a lot of people complain about combat - I sort of get it, the combat isn't exactly fun but it's also not the point of the game in my opinion. You're a runner. You should be avoiding every enemy you can and taking the others out with acrobatic grace. Should be, anyway. I suck at disarming enemies so I just had to punch folks until they fell down. It was underwhelming, but I also think being chased and attacked was necessary to the feeling you get while running away. Glass crashing around you and bullets flying, Faith escapes again into the corners of the city.I adored the art style and selective use of colors. People saying it's all red and white are blind or didn't actually play the game. The colors do a lot of foreshadowing and kind of mentally prep you for upcoming events. I plan on doing some speed trials just to get pretty screenshots.PhysX is a turd and will blow your computer up, even if you have a PhysX optimized GPU. If you get huge FPS drops when windows break, it's PhysX. Disable it and enjoy the game.It's so easy to not notice the soundtrack. A lot of the time you're just being talked to via headset, or you hear the sounds of the city. But there are a couple areas where the song is inspiring, where it makes you feel like you're flying and the air is rushing past your ears and through your hair.The story is so-so. Think 90's action flick and you've got an idea of it. There are a couple plot holes but they're pretty easy to overlook and don't affect the enjoyment of the game for me personally. I just wanna jump off walls and do cool stuff.If you're into acrobatic gameplay and using speed rather than force, definitely give this game a shot. It's fun and the style is so memorable. "

Mirror's Edge is a game built solely on free running/parkour and fleeing from a new government's regime.This includes reaching your destinations in unusual ways through roofs, obstacles and other wide or narrow spaces. All of this often leads to an encounter with armed forces which sometimes can be avoided or challenged through a combat.★ Movement has a good flow until you reach combat. However, it can be sloppy from time to time and because of that your character might miss objects that you're supposed to hang onto like poles. ★ Combat is one of the worst aspects of this game. The melee part is kind of fun until you take possession of a gun. Its mechanics are probably the worst that I've ever seen. It would've been better if there were less combat because you can't avoid everything and you'll be forced to engage in it at some point anyways.★ As for the story, it didn't seem to be interesting for me at all. I was really trying to get into it during my second and third playthrough and make it grow on me but I still found it dull. I knew that it isn't the strongest part about this game but it sure is a problem when you have no idea what's happening. ★ Music and graphics had a huge impact for this game's success. Soundtracks are relaxing and fits the theme. Moreover, colorful and minimalist graphic design added so much to this game visually that it distracted me from the gameplay just to enjoy the view.Therefore, this game stands on the verge between + and - but I'd still recommend it since I enjoyed it to some extent. If you only care about the story, don't even bother picking this game up as I guarantee that you will be unsatisfied and bored.6.5/10 "

												This is very good. The premise of a first-person Parkour game is really original, and the level design really has you believing you're clinging to the edge of a tall building. Some of the moves you can do in this game are just thrilling. The mouse and keyboard controls work well and don't feel like they came from a console port.There's about 6 hours of content here. The bad:- Contains quicktime events.- The gamepad controls aren't great (use the mouse).- The combat sections aren't much fun (but putting the game on easy mode makes them go by quicker)- The game locks up every time you switch tasks.- The online leaderboards are full of cheaters, making time trial mode less fun than it could be.

Since Mirror's Edge Catalyst isn't on steam, I'm going to put my review for both games down here.Mirror's EdgeMirror's Edge is a fun game to play when bored, and the options of free running are great, but there's a limit to them in the way of levels, so that you can never really free roam in the game. The story is not that great, but the parcour you can do in the game makes up for that matter. But...Mirror's Edge CatalystThe big sister of the two games is definitely better than the first game. The story is better, the free running has a few more options and is slightly better, but the option to be able to free roam gives us what Mirror's Edge lacked, the option to do whatever you want wherever you want in the city of Glass. And yeah, Faith looks even hotter in this game.			"

												A game for people who wish they could do the stunts they see on YouTube. Pros -Stunning graphics for a 2009 game, especially the models. Everything you look at is beautiful, especially the environments.-Very fun parkour system(with a learning curve), that makes you want to come back for more. By far the highlight of this game, you can do a variety of different parkour moves that tie together smoothly and fluidly.-Great soundtrack that perfectly captures the modern/sci-fi world of Mirror's Edge.-Interesting level design that captures the creativity to do parkour.-The mechanics itself feel realistic. There were few times that it felt as though I shouldn't have survived something or shouldn't have been able to jump that far. And in places where I don't survive, it makes sense. A young woman in nothing but a tanktop and sweatpants wouldn't be able to survive 3 point blank headshots from an automatic weapon. Cons -textures show flaw at times, but on very few objects-Campaign that falls flat. This is the biggest gripe with this game that I have. I didn't feel invested in many of the characters, and I only wanted to go through the story because the parkour itself was fun, and the ending was very disappointing. I particularly didn't enjoy the animated cutscenes, but that's simply personal preference.-The game fluctuates from rather simple to extremely difficult. I turned off ""runner vision"", which lets you see what objects to run/jump/climb onto next, and at times I didn't think it would've been possible to do WITH runner vision. -The combat felt extremely clunky, and in the late game, AI could kill you extremely fast. At least an hour of my 7-hour run through of the game was spent redoing combat sections because the AI killed me too damn fast and I didn't know how to go about the situation.-Fair share of bugs. Nothing much. TL;DR/Conclusion An experimental, revolutionary game that takes the art of parkour and implements it perfectly into a game's setting. It's innovations pay off with stunning visuals, fun mechanics, and an immersive, beautiful atmosphere. This game is a cult classic that should be played before you die. However, don't expect much from story, and prepare to be frustrated at various aspects of the game.7 out of 10. Great game			"

												Mirror's Edge was a breath of fresh air back in 2008, and it's still breathtaking to this day. The amazing sense of motion, the visceral sensation of speed and falling, the dazzling art direction... it's an amazing combination, let down only by the underdeveloped story and reliance on trial and error.  But don't let that and one too many air vents turn you away! This is the best first person parkour game ever made and is ♥♥♥♥ing sensational on PC with a deliciously decadent-sized effects budget.

												First of all, don't be fooled, even if it says that i only played 0.2 hours, it's not true. i can't use the steam client all the time, so i play offline, i actually played 2 hours and a half, give or take. Anyway, like most of other reviewers, i have to select NO, unfortunately, this game is a ""yes, but.."" kind of game. Don't get me wrong, the game looks stunning but it's basically ""portal meets super mario"". you are thrown into a level and you have to get to the other side by jumping and running on walls, but if you die (and you WILL die, more on that later) you'll respawn in a fixated spawn point (just like portal) the problem that this spawn point can be anywhere from a few feet away to three rooftops away, this will force you to re-jump previously jumped obstacles, re-punch enemies and re-listen to any conversation that might have happened (i swear to God, if i have to hear that ""the cops are closing in"" one more time i'm going to kill someone). now, about the dieing part, everything wants you dead and will shoot you on sight. there is no stealth option, no way to defend yourself besides the stupidly weak melee attack (i know, you can disarm cops but first you must get IN RANGE and wait for the gun to get flashy and even if you do that, you'll have only a couple of shots) and if you are even slightly misalligned you'll end up doing the wrong kind of jump, plummeting to your doom...and respawning...and hearing those same lines over and over and over again. the story for what i could grasp between the bullets, it's the classic distopian future with evil corporates that want to silence the good people (feel free to correct me on this one) but, again, it's hard to focus on the story when you are shot by literally the entire police force! and, apparently, there are subquests you should complete (picking up bags, i think) but i was only able to find 3 of them (again, hard to explore when trying to avoid bullets).i'm really disappointed, it's the first time i actually asked for a refundso, to recap:+good visuals+interesting setup +(probably) good story-anti-immersive game mechanics-you'll burn more miles in half an hour of this game than Shaggy and Scooby did in the whole Scooby-Doo universe-necessity to explore but inability to do so-annoying navi-like navigator (i know there are cops here, THEY ARE SHOOTING ME!)

												I would give positive, if it was indie game.But this game is pretty disappointing. It should give you ""joy and freedom of run"", but give nothing of it.Freedom is absent, because there is only one corridor way. And joy also, because far far majority of game you are under heavy fire, so good luck with looking for, where the corridor is, if you fail at first try, death. And even, when you know, where to run, still you are getting hitted the whole game, because, as I have mentioned, the heavy fire. So it is game about running Terminator.That was very frustrating and unenjoyable. I finished the game only to check ""finished"" in game list, And surely will not buy Catalyst.			"

												A very solid platformer with some action thrown in for good measure.  This game forces you to think in real time to get to your goal while dodging trigger happy cops in some parts.  You could also relieve the cops of their weapons and show them how to put it to better use if you're more of an aggressive player.  The levels are fairly linear, but the overall gameplay experience is one that is quite enjoyable.It would be a good idea to play this one with a controller.Pros:Solid freerunning platforming action in first person.PhysX support, for those with Nvidia cardsCombat sequences don't clash with the actual gameplay, and you can choose to take out your attackers in most cases.A few extra challenges added in to really test your ability to cover ground.Time Trial mode once you ace story mode.Excellent graphics and environments.Cons:Low replayabilityAfterthoughtsPlay this one with a controller, as the controls are better suited for a controller as opposed to a keyboard.  AMD/ATI folks should turn off PhysX, it will really cull your performance.			"

												Mirror's Edge was released back in 2009 with it's gorgeous visuals and brilliant mechanics that still hold up to today's game's standards. In the world of Mirror's Edge you live in a dystopian city that appears innocent and comfortable yet is corrupted by surveilance at every corner. In a city like this information usually tends to get around and no one's secrets tend to be safe. This is where you come in, you take the role of Faith who is a runner. Runners are highly trained free-runners who can get information from one side of the city to another without government organisations stealing information.As for structure of the game itself most of the mechanics are great yet the controls can feel quite fiddly. Sometimes in missions you can feel almost lost not knowing where to go by simply overlooking the red glint of a ledge you can climb upon. The story in quite linear but most would say that that is okay due to amount of sheer fun you get by pulling off fluent streams of actions and dashing by at high speeds which is realy what this game is about. Game duration is also quite low as I completed this game within 10 hours. Even though this review does appear somewhat negative I did truely have quite an extensive amount of fun with this game so i'm rating it a 6.7 / 10			"

												Mirror's Edge is one of those games that was made a few years ago, but still wipes the floor with most recent games. Don't let EA's involvement in the game throw you off, this one was from before the dark days that give us nightmares every night.While the storyline of the game is not amazing, it is still pretty decent and is still more interesting than a lot of storylines in current games. The main appeal of this game for me was the apparent freedom of movement you have, even though the levels are quite linear. The wide-open level design makes you feel like the path you take is not necessarily the one and only path through the level, even though most of the time it is. The time trial levels reuse some of the storyline levels, which makes them somewhat repetitive yet familliar in an environment where practising easily makes you more comfortable with the section you are running.The freerunning mechanics don't feel clunky and with the focus on momentum, they feel really fast and smooth when you are playing well and have a reasonable drop in this when you are not (which still does not make the freerunning feel clunky).Considering the game was released in 2009 for PC, you don't need one of those new-fangled super-toaster 5000 with four bread slots and fast-defrost action- glueing a few potatoes together should suffice. Since the game is over five years old, it is pretty cheap now, too. Unless you don't like this kind of game, there isn't much argument for not giving it a go.			"

												Fight or flight: a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. There, i just summarized the gameplay in Mirror's Edge. And the ""simplicity"" of it is perhaps the main strenght in this gloriously original game. You either fight, or flight(run). Or preferably both. It's as simple as that. And it will honestly take you quite a few tries overcoming both enemies and obstacles in your way. I've experienced my fair share of deaths, and especially when you first start out, it can all seem overwhelming. But with every death comes a lesson learned, and hopefully after a few tries you will manage to both run and fight seamlessly without any mistakes or hiccups. And when you accomplish this, it feels like you can take on the whole world(or at least the city's policeforce). There are multiple ways from A to B and the controls are solid(with a controller, never tried keyboard). When you're not being chased or bullets don't fly in your direction, you also get parts in the game where the road you must take isn't always as clear. Normally, you posess something called runner's vision, which visually guides you through the game in the form of the color red(red boxes, planks, doors). But some areas in the game unfolds like a puzzle. You stop up, think, do, die and retry. A welcoming break, in which you also can take into account the amazing visuals or beautifully crafted locations in the game.Perhaps it is the visually stunning graphics/animations that is the main strenght? It took me quite a long time to finally play this game, i think its close to 3 years. And its too bad and clearly long overdue. The animations are quite smooth, from the fight sequences to the parkour element. The areas are intelligently crafted which in some cases reward your curiosity. And running from cops wielding assault rifles or helicopters with machineguns has never been so adrenaline pumping. Especially when you take leap of faiths and float through the air in what feels like an eternity, all while the sun is shining in your eyes. Soundtrack is another major plus with this game, with a special mention going to the end sountrack. Overall the soundtrack enchances the gameplay and visuals of the game with a exhilarating sound which fills you  with adrenaline during some of the most intense chase sequences. This game isn't without some flaws though. Albeit the story isn't necessarily bad, it't only enough there to keep you somewhat invested as you enjoy the other brilliant aspects of this game. The campaign is also quite short, in which i completed it in about 5 hours. Fear not though, as there are other gamemodes to keep you occupied, such as timetrial. The highest difficulty level also unlocks when you complete the game once, so that may inspire you to go for a round 2. I'm not a fan of giving out a rating in terms of numbers, but i can definitely recommend this game. A truly innovative game in terms of gameplay and visuals(for its time), with an amazing soundtrack to boot. This game can be aquired dirt cheap, and give you an adrenaline kick in your otherwise uneventful life.Still alive.			"

												I recommend this game. It has found its place among my top three most interesting games.The gameplay itself is very immersing and may be worded in a very simplyfied way as problem solving under timelimits.It is however very heavy in getting the right timing for performing the right action. Altough one may slow time down for a short while i rarely use it because it disrupts the gameflow (in my humble opinion). I could not play this game in full resolution (1920x1080) when there where multiple enemys appearing. Even so there are only barely visible differences when playing on 1360x768 pixels thanks to the way the levels are buildt.One fustrating thing is the setting of Savepoints, that force you (especially in the later chapters) to start some long passages over once you die/fail. On the other hand really being forced to get longer sequences  and timings right gives this game its charm and made me think back to the first Rayman i played on a Gameboy advance.All in all a fun first person parkour game/ 3D Platform jump and run, that gives you the freedom to either fight your way trough or run past all obstacles without harming anyone. Wheras the main point is to match your timing and finding your way.Ps.: Because I played offline my game time was not recorded. "

												Incredible game! Mirror's Edge is unique in story, graphics, and gameplay and becomes addicting once you learn the mechanics. Breathtaking color palettes give this game an intense vibe and the multiple routes to take and tricks to learn keep the game interesting. Combat defies the usual ""gun 'em down"" strategy, forcing you to get creative with takedowns while the music helps set tones for different scenarios. Better get used to the splat of your body falling a zillion stories, though. My only gripe is that it's a fairly short game, but I'm already starting a second playthrough. It's definitely worth your money just for the experience of adrenaline fueled parkour!			"

												Really fun and unique. The design of the environments and characters is really well done and the gameplay is super smooth. The only problem is that combat can be a gamble. You can enter a room one time and get shot and killed within a second, but then respawn and go into that room and fight and win like it was nothing. That is literally the only con in a beautiful game though. I cannot wait to play the sequel. Supposedly they are improving combat in that one as well. So I am expecting a perfect game in the future. I'll give this game an 8.75 out of 10. Super fun.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a game I can't recommend enough to be honest. I'm just so in love with its design I can't believe that a game like that actually managed to make it out into the world without being ravaged by EA executives. Its a must buy for anyone who like platformers and a must try for anyone who likes playing good games. The creative design, solid mechanics and fairly interesting narrative just make it a good all around good time. I would go so far as to call it a modern classic and I'm fairly sure that its going to age fairly well compared to other modern games.If you want to read a detailed review you can find it over here at my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/08/mirrors-edge.html.

												Mirror's Edge is a beautiful game. It's fast paced and doesn't have to ever slow down if you are a good enough free-runner. But, this game isn't perfect, and as a hug fan of this game I'm going to be completely honest.The good things about Mirror's Edge:The Look - The City is amazingly gorgeous and dynamic. Different color schemes for certain buildings really help piece the city together.The Feel - The controls are decent enough to get you where you need to go without looking like an idiot, but it's the animations and the lightweight feel of Faith that really make you feel like a runner. The way she vaults and slides across the floor look fantastic.The Soundtrack - One of my favorite videogame OST's, Mirror's Edge has a distinctive feel that's core comes from listening to it's music. The Bad things about Mirror's Edge:Wonky parkour controls - At times you'll find that what you want to pull off isn't achievable unless you're a skilled pro at the game. You want to wall run then coil over that fence? Until you're completely familarized with the controls you'll fail 90% of the time.No Achievements - You wanted to get achievements and cards for your amazing parkouring in this game? You would be better off buying it on console. That's right, Steam doesn't offer any achievements or trading cards for this game. Probably because the game is so old, the port to Steam is missing a lot of things that would make playing Mirror's Edge worth your while.The combat - Now, this is completely avoidable if you have the skill to evade the police, but the combat isn't all that great. Sure, when you have the chance to pull of wallrun-kicks and leap onto SWAT members it can be enjoyable. But the areas at which you face the police are so open and empty you'll end up walking up to them, waiting for them to hit you with a melee attack, and easily tapping a button and countering them. Then you'll drop their gun, rinse, and repeat this process until all of the police are taken down and you can get on your way.Short storyline - The story is pretty uninteresting in my opinion. It only picks up at certain parts, and it's easy to tell who the villain is going to be by the final chapters. The game is only 9 missions long, and these missions are usually 10 - 30 minutes long. In the end, Mirror's Edge is a great game that you will enjoy if you're into parkour and first person combat games. But if you want rewards, achievements, cards, or badges, steer clear of this title. By the end of the game, you'll feel one of two emotions. Satisfied with a great short-but-sweet experience, or you'll be left wanting more out of the game, since you can only now speed-run the same sections of the game or do time trials on certain parts of missions. Also, mentioning the no achievements you'll feel like you just sped-ran the whole game and all of the time trials for nothing, seeing how your scores on the leaderboard are only going to be buried beneath hackers of the game.6/10 - Good but could be a lot better if Steam supported the features that other titles have on it's store.

												Short but sweet game. A one of a kind really. Best part is...NO ORIGIN!!!! :DThe games controls feel a little on the clunky side. But, its not enough for me to not recommend it.Also, $20 is steep. I'd wait for a dank sale as I originally did.7/10 Would take leap of Faith again			"

												I recommend this game. It has found its place among my top three most interesting games.The gameplay itself is very immersing and may be worded in a very simplyfied way as problem solving under timelimits.It is however very heavy in getting the right timing for performing the right action. Altough one may slow time down for a short while i rarely use it because it disrupts the gameflow (in my humble opinion). I could not play this game in full resolution (1920x1080) when there where multiple enemys appearing. Even so there are only barely visible differences when playing on 1360x768 pixels thanks to the way the levels are buildt.One fustrating thing is the setting of Savepoints, that force you (especially in the later chapters) to start some long passages over once you die/fail. On the other hand really being forced to get longer sequences  and timings right gives this game its charm and made me think back to the first Rayman i played on a Gameboy advance.All in all a fun first person parkour game/ 3D Platform jump and run, that gives you the freedom to either fight your way trough or run past all obstacles without harming anyone. Wheras the main point is to match your timing and finding your way.Ps.: Because I played offline my game time was not recorded. "

												Hands down the best game in the entire world. Not even kidding. I based my life around it.BY THE WAY:The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.			"

												8/10This game is super fun, super beautiful, and also really hard. There are lots of different elements of parkour and fighting that come into play, keeping it from being monotonous as you try to uncover the secret plots of the government. The cutscenes have their own distinctive art style, really making this game one of a kind. The textures and objects are fairly simple, but it adds to the futuristic environment and makes the parkour more straightforward. Despite the appearance of a massive world, you can always tell what you are supposed to do due to color coding of useful objects and also pressing alt lets you look where you need to go in most places. You do all sorts of crazy stuff like climb down stormpipes, hop from train to train, jump from one crane to another, and use a helicopter to swing to freedom. This game is definitely worth any investment of time and money. Although this game was on the shorter side, I really enjoyed my time and can't wait for the sequel.			"

												The Good:1) Parkour: This is what makes the game so damn fun. DICE put a lot of work making it feel real and fun at the same time, and it pays off really well. The fact that its first person makes you feel like you're actually doing it. Despite the combat not being up to par, the parkour works so well that you almost forget about it2) Graphics: For a game that came out in 2008, this still looks great. Not only does the world feel real, but the art style is just so memorable. It makes me wish a city like this was real3) Soundtrack: For an electronic soundtrack, it creates a relaxing feeling. It fits the tone and world perfectly4) Level design: While the game is very linear, it makes up for it with well thought out levels that give you multiple paths to get to your destination. The Bad:1) Length: It's only 5-6 hours. Should've been at least 8-10 hours2) Combat: I wish you could chain your parkour with your fighting skills to take down enemies while still moving fast, instead of having to come to a complete stop every time you want to do a takedown. Also, the punching and kicking animations feel stiff. Using guns is even worse; I wish they would have improved the hand-to-hand combat and removed guns completely.Despite its flaws, this is my favourite game of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique action-adventure game.9/10			"

												Mirror's Edge is a one-of-a-kind game with it's own expirience when you play it. Get involved into some action and fast-paced parcour on roofs, inside buildings and on the streets! All that comes in addition with a bright style of graphics and a handfull of other, very fitiing, colours.To begin with, the mechanics and the idea are a very neat thing, and it keeps you occupied for the time you play the story, as you get to use the variety of interactions, like wallrunning, pipe climbing, walljumping, disarming, sliding, etc. in a totally random order, depending on the levels.The con at that part is, that the level design forces you to take a passage, the game is rather linear when it comes to that. There sometimes are several possibilites to get around though, still they end with the same result/position to be in.The idea behind collecting secrets to unlock artwork/extras is a neat idea, still, I do believe that it does not really improve the fact, that the replayability is kind of low, as you barely get to see something new when you play for a second time.The multiplayer, if you can call it like that, is more like a racer. No cool disarming, no avoiding or dodging of gunfire. You race other people, with the hope to win. Nothing else to say at that point.In total, I can recommend Mirror's Edge at the price it is at. It is worth buying and enjoying, as it is a different expirience.			"

												Very short, (I beat the storyline in 5 hours) but very fun.  Picked it up for $5 on sale and it was absolutely worth it.The movement is amazing.  With about half a dozen techniques to use, you can approach most of the game from a variety of (literal) angles.  There's also a time trial mode to really test yourself.What little combat there is is intentionally clunky as you're a ""runner"" not a ""fighter.""  But if you master the movement, you can do some amazing combat techniques too.  I, however, settled on repeatedly doing a running slide and kicking every single opponent in the junk over and over.  Crude, yet effective.The platforming never felt ""cheap"" like in a lot of platformers, where you need nearly pixel-perfect precision.  In this game, if you're having trouble with a jump it's more than likely you're using the wrong techniques.There's not much to the story, so don't expect anything wonderful there.  Someone wronged you, you're trying to figure out who they are and why they did it.  Nothing epic or grandiose like saving the world, it's pretty much just personal revenge with a bit of a political background.I had a few minor issues, including one slowdown/crash that was remedied by simply turning off PhysX in the options.  Other issues were my character not grabbing ledges that I clearly thought she should, or at one point I must have ""stubbed my toe"" mid wall-run because I just stopped and fell off the wall.Due to the extremely short length of the game, I can only recommend picking it up on sale.  It has difficulty settings, time trials, and some collectible items, so there's a small bit of replay value to it.			"

												Ever heard of a first person platformer? Not really, no. So that's a pretty wide gap to bridge. Mirror's Edge does a nice job to jump the gap, but it sure is no bridge.Mirror's Edge puts you in the bright red shoes of Faith, an inhabitant of an Orwellesque city who runs and jumps on rooftops to deliver secret packages to people who try to liberate the population from the regime. The premise is interesting, but the game refrains from giving you a clear motive or goal; it just drip-feeds it to you. It is not paced very well. You don't really understand what you're doing until the credits roll. Call it Chekov writing if you must, I call it demotivational. The controls are simple, yet effective. This isn't like platforming in Half Life where pressing the jump button launches you into space and pushing up to ladders makes you go up; this is about momentum and clever jumps and acrobatics. The freerunning is done fluently and intuitively. However, your runner's high tends to be tackled by the game's awkward and completely redundant combat system. It is a shame cause it would have been so much more fun if you could just...keep on running. You run through a weird city that is coloured white and then some other colours. It looks very stylish and makes it pleasant to look at while you jump from building to building. Mirror's Edge has an interesting concept going for it, but it seems to lack refinement and pacing. Still, it's worth a shot just for the experience of FPS running.			"

With great visual and sound design accompanying a slick and exhilarating parkour experience, there's a lot to love. Combat falls down in certain sections, which can hamper some enjoyment, but the first person mechanics overall do a decent job at creating a wonderful, zen like vibe. I found myself coming back simply to enjoy the calm nature of the title.Pros: Slick Parkour Beautiful Music Decent Challenge involving some speedrunningCons Clunky Combat Lackluster Story "

												It's at least my favourite game on PC. The amazing graphics, bright lighting and intense colours really make this game look unique. One of my favorite aspects is the amazing combat. Disarming a SWAT officer and shooting the others with the same gun made me feel like a bad ♥♥♥! I'm still obsessed with it after a year of bying it. Ever since I jumped of a building and on to another I wanted more!And for the people who can't wait for the second (me included): Mirror's Edge 2 will be coming out as a prequel in 2016 or 2015, at the earliest. Faith is apparentley in ger late teens and it looks like it might have alot of stuff to do with her mother and family.			"

												Mirror's Edge was released back in 2009 with it's gorgeous visuals and brilliant mechanics that still hold up to today's game's standards. In the world of Mirror's Edge you live in a dystopian city that appears innocent and comfortable yet is corrupted by surveilance at every corner. In a city like this information usually tends to get around and no one's secrets tend to be safe. This is where you come in, you take the role of Faith who is a runner. Runners are highly trained free-runners who can get information from one side of the city to another without government organisations stealing information.As for structure of the game itself most of the mechanics are great yet the controls can feel quite fiddly. Sometimes in missions you can feel almost lost not knowing where to go by simply overlooking the red glint of a ledge you can climb upon. The story in quite linear but most would say that that is okay due to amount of sheer fun you get by pulling off fluent streams of actions and dashing by at high speeds which is realy what this game is about. Game duration is also quite low as I completed this game within 10 hours. Even though this review does appear somewhat negative I did truely have quite an extensive amount of fun with this game so i'm rating it a 6.7 / 10			"

												Mirror's Edge is one of those games that was made a few years ago, but still wipes the floor with most recent games. Don't let EA's involvement in the game throw you off, this one was from before the dark days that give us nightmares every night.While the storyline of the game is not amazing, it is still pretty decent and is still more interesting than a lot of storylines in current games. The main appeal of this game for me was the apparent freedom of movement you have, even though the levels are quite linear. The wide-open level design makes you feel like the path you take is not necessarily the one and only path through the level, even though most of the time it is. The time trial levels reuse some of the storyline levels, which makes them somewhat repetitive yet familliar in an environment where practising easily makes you more comfortable with the section you are running.The freerunning mechanics don't feel clunky and with the focus on momentum, they feel really fast and smooth when you are playing well and have a reasonable drop in this when you are not (which still does not make the freerunning feel clunky).Considering the game was released in 2009 for PC, you don't need one of those new-fangled super-toaster 5000 with four bread slots and fast-defrost action- glueing a few potatoes together should suffice. Since the game is over five years old, it is pretty cheap now, too. Unless you don't like this kind of game, there isn't much argument for not giving it a go.			"

												Fight or flight: a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. There, i just summarized the gameplay in Mirror's Edge. And the ""simplicity"" of it is perhaps the main strenght in this gloriously original game. You either fight, or flight(run). Or preferably both. It's as simple as that. And it will honestly take you quite a few tries overcoming both enemies and obstacles in your way. I've experienced my fair share of deaths, and especially when you first start out, it can all seem overwhelming. But with every death comes a lesson learned, and hopefully after a few tries you will manage to both run and fight seamlessly without any mistakes or hiccups. And when you accomplish this, it feels like you can take on the whole world(or at least the city's policeforce). There are multiple ways from A to B and the controls are solid(with a controller, never tried keyboard). When you're not being chased or bullets don't fly in your direction, you also get parts in the game where the road you must take isn't always as clear. Normally, you posess something called runner's vision, which visually guides you through the game in the form of the color red(red boxes, planks, doors). But some areas in the game unfolds like a puzzle. You stop up, think, do, die and retry. A welcoming break, in which you also can take into account the amazing visuals or beautifully crafted locations in the game.Perhaps it is the visually stunning graphics/animations that is the main strenght? It took me quite a long time to finally play this game, i think its close to 3 years. And its too bad and clearly long overdue. The animations are quite smooth, from the fight sequences to the parkour element. The areas are intelligently crafted which in some cases reward your curiosity. And running from cops wielding assault rifles or helicopters with machineguns has never been so adrenaline pumping. Especially when you take leap of faiths and float through the air in what feels like an eternity, all while the sun is shining in your eyes. Soundtrack is another major plus with this game, with a special mention going to the end sountrack. Overall the soundtrack enchances the gameplay and visuals of the game with a exhilarating sound which fills you  with adrenaline during some of the most intense chase sequences. This game isn't without some flaws though. Albeit the story isn't necessarily bad, it't only enough there to keep you somewhat invested as you enjoy the other brilliant aspects of this game. The campaign is also quite short, in which i completed it in about 5 hours. Fear not though, as there are other gamemodes to keep you occupied, such as timetrial. The highest difficulty level also unlocks when you complete the game once, so that may inspire you to go for a round 2. I'm not a fan of giving out a rating in terms of numbers, but i can definitely recommend this game. A truly innovative game in terms of gameplay and visuals(for its time), with an amazing soundtrack to boot. This game can be aquired dirt cheap, and give you an adrenaline kick in your otherwise uneventful life.Still alive.			"

												I had always heard good things about Mirror's Edge and it's amazing gameplay, but I never had the opportunity to try it for myself. One new computer later, and one of the first games I bought was Mirror's Edge. The free-flowing parkour system is the first thing you notice about this game and it works so well. The controls and the animation of Hope work freely with the player and the game allows you to pull off some sick moves across ridiculous distances. The music accompaning the parkour fits well and the enviornment is beautiful and slick. The red guidance system, while it does not always work, is very helpful and it really helps to drive the momentum of the game. The story is pretty good, and it keeps the levels relevant and with purpose. My issue with the game is that some jumps don't work the first time sometimes, leading to some frustrating deaths. That and the combat is not very well-implemented and it almost helps to try to run past combat encounters than to engage them. Overall, Mirror's Edge is a great parkour action game that is an experience that you won't be able to play many other places. Despite some weird jumps and the mediocre combat sections, Mirror's Edge is a great game to own, and I have a sub-par computer, so it will run even if your computer is not up to standard.			"

												After buying this game for £2.49 I had high hopes for a game that now has a AAA sequal, and I was not let down. The art style is rich and bright with the RED standing out helping giving hints to where you need to go. The actual gameplay is smooth and the first person aspect makes it that extra special when jumping between buildings. The story is gripping however on my first playthrough I was not interested as I wanted to do more parkour. Finally the level designs are incredible. You spend 5 minuites wondering where to go, to then see a door behind you xD. The only downside is the combat. The slow movement and the terrible action moves make it almost impossible to defeat the enemy. The generic jump kick and slide kick both have to be used on each enemy making fights feel the same. Other than this I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game. Its an amazing experience which I have finished multiple times.			"

												8/10This game is super fun, super beautiful, and also really hard. There are lots of different elements of parkour and fighting that come into play, keeping it from being monotonous as you try to uncover the secret plots of the government. The cutscenes have their own distinctive art style, really making this game one of a kind. The textures and objects are fairly simple, but it adds to the futuristic environment and makes the parkour more straightforward. Despite the appearance of a massive world, you can always tell what you are supposed to do due to color coding of useful objects and also pressing alt lets you look where you need to go in most places. You do all sorts of crazy stuff like climb down stormpipes, hop from train to train, jump from one crane to another, and use a helicopter to swing to freedom. This game is definitely worth any investment of time and money. Although this game was on the shorter side, I really enjoyed my time and can't wait for the sequel.			"

												This game is absolutely spectacular. It's movement is incredibly fluid, and requires just the right amount of skill and perception to pull off, as it is mainly timing based. The combat, while clunky, can be streamlined if you know how to use your momentum to pull off strong attacks such as slide kicks. If you don't have time to charge up those moves, you can attempt to master the counter system, a challenge within itself. I love this game, and think that it sets strong foundations for the next generation of platform era and first person games.			"

												One of the most original games of recent years. I would never have guessed that a developer company would some day release an FPS game where the emphasis would be on running, sliding, jumping, vaulting, rolling, crouching and all this done on the rooftops of skyscrapers. These are the movements your protagonist, Faith, uses whenever she is faced with an obstacle.The game is an unstoppable roller coaster ride. All the movements you do you do while running. And to make it more exciting the game does not want you to stop - your ""vision"" enables you to see certain objects, ramps, ledges and pipes highlighted in red so you know you can interact with these objects and you do not need to stop to look for clues. Later on as the game gets gradually more difficult this assistance is reduced and you can even turn it off completely so that the game can offer you the ultimate challenge.Enemies can be taken down with melee combat but most of the time you need to run. Those that have weapons can easily eliminate you. Interestingly, you can knock out some of these police officers and pick up their weapons. Bear in mind that the ammo is limited so once your magazine is empty you should get rid of your firearm. But with weapons you want to aim like in a true FPS game, right? So, using a firearm will break the pace here, therefore, it's best to just skip this opportunity and run all the way till the game ends.And pretty much that is the only problem with Mirror's Edge. You run fast and you reach the end fast. They could have included some extra chapters to make the game longer. You have time trial challenges so that you can keep playing stages over and over again improving your total time for completion.  I really wish, however, if there was a sequel to this game as it was such an exciting ride. It would be really nice to be a courier again in the new era of next-gen games.			"

												Mirrors edge a game full of talk. What is it about and why is it so popular? Well if you love free running first person gun shooting action this is the game for you. The story sets off as the main protaganist faith (late after she joins the runners) Finds out her sister was about to get framed for a murder. Faith tries hard throughout the game to cover her name while the cops thinking Faith was the one who killed the man. Now about the gameplay, It's a great parkour game with things like wall running climbing on pipes rolling and many others but your character specializes in hand to hand combat making things a whole lot interesting. You can take guns from people in great fashion and even jump kick them. With that being said the question ""Are there any mods for this game""? are possible but you'd have to download them off the internet, not from the workshop. So back to the question ""Why is this game so popular?"" That's up to you to decide based on all the things i have talked about here So If you like games like this check out some gameplay or even buy it!			"

												Mirror’s Edge is one of my all time favorite games, I’ve played through it multiple time on the xbox and twice now on my PC and it never gets boring. The controls and gameplay are damn near perfect when it comes to running and jumping, once you get past the training level most of the moves you do feel natural and the game does a great job of telling you when to do what without being super obvious and still allowing for improvisation. It gets your heart pounding and makes you feel like a badass and is just genuinely really fun. But the game isn’t perfect, the most obvious thing to point out is the forced gun combat. It feels like it was added as an afterthought because the publisher wanted a more action packed game, and by action packed I mean more guns, and it never felt as intuitive or as fun as the running parts of the game. Another disappointment was the story, it’s just not well written and it’s way too short. If they hired a team of great writers to write Mirror’s Edge the game could have easily become a classic. But those are minor things, the bottom line is that this game really ♥♥♥♥ing fun to play.			"

												Lots of fun. While many people say it's not replayable, I've gone through the game a good ten times and enjoyed each run. Memorizing spots to speed up your runs that you may not have known existed during your first playthrough and seeing a great running combo pay off is very rewarding, which adds a sense of replayability to the game and also makes second and third runs faster and more fun.On the flip side, by giving players such an intensely graceful experience, after a few runs the player starts to play overly recklessly and hectically as they try to keep the flow going, which often results in death and frustration. Going fast for the whole level is incredibly addicting, and I hope Mirror's Edge 2 either adaps to or changes this. Give the player an incentive to ever stop going very quickly, like a decent combat system or a small chance to explore and see what the safest/fastest routes through a level are and make your choice. Otherwise, make sure the game flows as neatly as possible and feels graceful and fast the whole way.For what it is, Mirror's edge is definitely worth the buy, especially at $4.99, which I've seen it go for many times.

												Quick note about making this work on modern systems:1. The default PhysX setting will use outdated software and murders performance when the cops start shooting. There are several workarounds available on the game's PcGamingWiki page. Alternatively, just turn PhysX off.2. The in-game Vsync did not work (at least for me). I still got horrible tearing even with it enabled on my 60Hz monitor. Forcing adaptive Vsync in the Nvidia drivers worked perfectly.Once you get those issues fixed, it runs like a dream, and honestly it looks pretty great for a game from 2008. The bright, sunny, whitewashed world is a nice change of pace from the typical grimdark of many recent games. The city feels vibrant despite a relative lack of NPCs. Also, the good anisotropic filtering means that textures usually look pretty good (at least, they're not distractingly bad like they are in some 360-era games). The character modeling on the enemies is relatively weak and probably the biggest indication that this is a last-gen title.The gameplay itself is primarily first-person platforming with occasional combat mixed in. The platforming is the stronger element - nailing a free-flowing parkour section is exhilarating. Early in the game, the platforming is quite easy, so you can gain a lot of speed and you start to feel like you're flying. It's amazing. Some later levels have much tougher platforming sections that break up the momentum a bit (at least on your first playthrough), but successfully navigating them is still extremely satisfying (and once you've figured them out you can speedrun them to feel even cooler). There's also one boss fight that's a little bit stupid, but it's thankfully short.Overall, despite the occasional moments of frustration, Mirror's Edge is a unique and frequently breathtaking game that's worth a buy for both FPS and platformer fans.

												Mirror's edge is uniquely frustrating. The aesthetic is wonderful; the cyberpunk city, the intriguing story, the beautifully rendered scenery. However the gameplay left a lot to be desired. The game starts off well, the free running aspect of the game is very smooth and rewards skill. However even early on I found myself with no real sense of direction, and I lost track of the amount of times I yelled ""Well where the HELL am I supposed to go now?"" in frustration. On top of that, the gun-combat does not fit in with the game AT ALL, and those areas of the game where gun combat is MANDATORY (towards the end of the game) became tedious in the extreme. It's a real shame because Mirror's Edge has so much going for it, but I honestly can'y recommend it unless you pick it up for a greatly reduced price. I've heard the sequel is superior. We shall see.			"

												This game is absolutley beautiful. Almost everything in this game is done perfectly even if it is not intentional.Pros:Graphics hold up wellFluid movement Infinite replayability The glitches improve the game (more on that later)Great FPS on almost any computerCons:The combat is clunky and boringHit-boxes can be odd at timesPipe clumbing is unbearably slowHackers ruin any chance at in game world record timesDifficulty goes from good to what is this when going from normal to hardAs mentioned earlier, the glitches greatly improve this game. What I mean by this is that the capability of using the glitches (which actually require skill to pull off) can allow you to improve your speed on runs greatly. It is one of the best feelings ever to successfully pull of a difficult kick-glitch that shaves of 10 seconds of your time. The only time I have encountered a hindering bug was while performing a non-hindering bug so, what can you expect.Aside from that, if you aren't interested in speedrunning this game still includes some of the smoothest freerunnung in any game to date. The genre created by this game is the best of it's kind and has not been bested, which only proves this game's greatness more.TL;DR This game is godly get it immediatley. "

												TL;DR : Skip to conclusion.Mirror's Edge, a First Person Action game developed by DICE and published by EA. Although the game was released in 2009, it still has features that many games nowadays can't recreate.Story Introduction: You play as Faith Connors, an agile and deadly information carrier called ""Runners"". You live in a city that has been heavily monitored and is run by private security corporations. Also, your sister, Kate Connors, is framed to be a murderer of a mayor candidate named ""Pope"". You must save your sister and uncover the secrets that will bring harm not only to herself and Kate, but everyone she loves.Here are the game's Pros and Cons:Pros: The movement system: Mirror's Edge is known for it's parkour elements. You can scale walls, jump between buildings and even ziplining across skyscrapers!Combat: You can jumpkick, slidekick, and also disarm opponent's weapons. It is not hard nor easy.Scenery: It is simple, but yet beautiful. There are not much colors, like mostly I see white, red, green, blue, and black. Also, somehow, trees are white... but in this game, scenery is stunning to watch and explore.No UI Clutter: This game has just one small dot in the middle and the screen, and that's it. No ammo counter, no health bar, and you might ask how in the world am I going to know where to go? The answer is Runner Vision.Runner Vision: Some objects in the game, eg. stairs or pipes will turn red if you get close to them, it gives you a hint of where to go or do. Runner Vision is a very creative game design in my opinion, you don't need a waypoint with distance marker in this game, just the Runner Vision.You can always turn it off if you don't want it.Cons:Story: The story is tedious, the characters are okayish, and also it's very short. I beat the whole game in 4 hours! It is just too quick. However, I did not collect all the ""Runner Bags"" (Collectibles) that are scattered in every level though. I'll do that later.AI: The enemy shoots like stormtroopers, they do not have a good aim (at least in Easy and Normal difficulty), but their weapon damage is fair enough.Bugs and WTF moments: You will find some bugs and some WTF moments, but they are not to the point where you will rage.Conclusion: I loved this game, despite the flaws I can see that this is one of the best FPA games I've ever played. Parkour hasn't been so much fun in a videogame! I recommend that you get this game on sale if you want to parkour and shoot!			"

If you are a fan of parkour, and like AAA titles, then it is probably worth picking up Mirror's Edge. It is highly polished, and graphically beautiful. The controls are minimal, in a good way. It really does a great job of simulating parkour on postcard-esque skylines and high heights. It would be wicked with the Occulus Rift, or something similiar.With that being said, as an indie-game-enthusiast, I probably won't play more than I already have. I got this for (I think) less than five bucks - I didn't know it was an Electronic Arts title, or I would not have bothered.			"

												Mirror's Edge is great if you like parktour and platforming games. If you are afraid of heights, falling, dying or getting vertigo, you might not like this game.Very challenging game even on easy mode. The MC is sorta like Neo in the Matrix.  Falling to your death is common. Dying from guards shooting you is common.  Autosave works offen but you will have to rerun some parts a lot.  Might get stuck in a deathtrap or two, till you figure out where and how to go.  I thought it was funny and exciting falling to my death often.  Just wish the cops would not be shooting at MC as much.  Not many hints of where to go, but there is one right way and many wrong ways. Trying to attack guards is difficult, better to run.  Tutorial helps but for me gets stuck teaching combat moves(the 2nd Disarm).  You will be shot at very often with no way to stop the shooting except to escape or hide behind something.  You heal up quickly, so it is a good idea to stop briefly or hide when hurt.  You will be hounded by the cops from air and surprised by ground cops on the rooftops.  The combat is ok but hard to do.  You can punch, kick, use your parktour, disarm, and pickup a gun and use it. The forum has a lot of people complaining this game has game stopping bugs. It might not run on some computers.  I had no problems sofar runnning game on a Quad Core computer with Win 8 (64bit) 8 Gig RAM.Great view of the city from the rooftops. Great graphics.  Good Story. Has a speedrun gamemode.This game does NOT have Steam Achievements and badge cards.Just get it on sale, maybe worth the price then. for more info:

												Man I have always loved this game.  The gameplay is exciting, and the art style is distinct and has it's own atmosphere that you can get immersed in.I've always been impressed at how they managed to make a game out of free-running, something that seems very organic and wouldn't lend itself very well to a video game, or at least very difficult to capture.  But they certainly achieved that, and in an interface that feels intuitive as well. It's very timing based - jump so that the top of the metal fence will be at the apex of your jump, and when she reaches it, she will gracefully vault over and maintain her momentum.   Press it too late and she'll jump and slam into it, hanging from the edge and pull herself up, climb over, and drop down to a standstill, so you have to build up your momentum again.   It's genius, that it ""makes sense"" to you physically and feels right, and yet is also an enjoyable game mechanic.You can steal an enemy's gun and breifly engage in FPS gameplay.  Very briefly, because you will never pick up new ammo for the gun, she will cast it away when it's spent.

For better or for worse they removed this in the sequel Mirror's Edge Catalyst, and I can't agree or disagree with that.  They want to keep it purely about parkour, and have a legitimate sounding explanation (the weapons are high-tech and bio-locked to the owner).  So you don't get the thrill of an FPS session, but more focus is put on the parkour, and they go into more detail with it there too.You MUST have an nVidia graphics card when you play this version of the game.  This will enable PhysX and a lot of ""dressing"" will be enabled in the levels.  On paper this might sound superficial, but it really heightens the action.  A mini gun on a helecopter rips the tarp in front of you to shreds as it opens fire, tattered cloth blowing away in the wind.  Shards of glass rain down around your ears as the enemy shoots at you while you run through a hallway with tall glass windows.  Don't underestimate the emotional impact this effect has.  I played it on an AMD card and forgot about it, then wondered why the game felt so empty and lifeless in the action sequences I previously remember playing.  When I looked into it, I got my education on PhysX, and was so annoyed I immediately sold my AMD card and got an nVidia one again.  (This has less relevance now since most games are console ports and devs can't justify putting effort into effects that a very small percentage of their user-base will see).I've had many movie-like moments in this game, that were completley born of the dynamic combat and free-running system.  It takes a very special game to achieve that.   Spend time learning the controls and making them second nature, and you have a really good game with an exciting story, for very cheap now.  I personally believe the art style holds up, even if it may appear a bit flat and lacking detail by modern gaming standards.  That was 2009 remember, and they did a damn good job.			"

												Definitely one of the best games ever made. I have never seen anything like this before or after this game's release. It's a bit on the short side, but has a lot of replayability to make up for it and a ""Speed Run"" mode, where you can compare your times with friends. The combat is for the most part foucsed on melee, however you can disarm your enemies if you wish to use a gun. Every movement you make feels fluid and satisfying. The $20 price tag may feel like a bit much at first, but I assure you that you will not regret buying this game.			"

With other games, you put in 12 or so hours in the campaign and then ask yourself ""Now what?"". Not with this game! There are about 20 or so time trial missons to do! Or go back to different levels of the campaign and think of different ways to get from A to B! However the levels are more linear than they appear.

												Mirror's edge is an interesting tale of free-runners (parkour, if you will) be sort of rebels in a city overran by corruption, ""law enforcement"", and conspiracy. You play this female freerunner whose sister somehow gotten herself involved in a giant conspiracy, and you need to run through a gauntlet of cops, SWAT teams, and perhaps, other runners in your quest for truth and justice. As this is a first-person parkour game, you will be vaulting fences, guard rails, making death defying jumps between buildings, zipline across cables, wallruning between platforms sliding under some obstacles, as well as do some unarmed combat where you take guns away from cops and such (optional, this is NOT a shooter). There are plenty of challenges, and the game has a way to ease you into it by having a rooftop training course. Then it's balls to walls time as you're being chased by everybody... cops, SWAT, even helicopters. The idea is to chain together moves smoothly to get maximum speed, and it's not easy. But it's quite satisfying, as it's a very unique game.			"

The gameplay is exciting, and the art style is distinct and has it's own atmosphere that you can get immersed in.I've always been impressed at how they managed to make a game out of free-running, something that seems very organic and wouldn't lend itself very well to a video game, or at least very difficult to capture.

												Game with boring story, not interesting characters, terrible fighting and not catchy soundtrack. There is only one thing that made this game great and it's running. Running in Mirror's Edge, or just parkour, is amazing. It makes things that aren't good not important at all, just a little addition which you can ignore. There probably aren't game about running made so well and enjoyable. There is also one thing praiseworthy and it's graphics. Graphic in Mirror's Edge is great, even tho it's game from 2009 - simply yet beatiful mix of few colors on and in buildings makes you think ""damn, it looks great"".Mirror's Edge is short game - for the first time playing you might spent at most 5 hours but trust me, every second is filled with great parkour actions. There are few difficulty levels, special speed run option so you can see how fast you are and time trials, where you can beat tracks as fast as you can and compare scores with your friends. There are also bags to collect in story mode if you enjoy searching for hidden stuff. These things makes game much longer to enjoy. I haven't tried everything yet (speed runs and all of time trials) but I'm sure I will be back to Mirror's Edge one day, when Virtual Reality headsets will be avaible for everyone. Just imagine, this thrill and excitement with goggles which will make gaming even more real... I can't wait for this to happen!			"

												A parkour game. While sadly fairly short, although the time trials add extra time, this game is very fun, with very flowing free-running that feels very natural and fun. However, the same cannot be said for the clunky combat, athough that can be avoided for all of the game apart from a boss battle, however this fight is very enjoyable as the boss has the same fighting as you, rather than having guns which will cause your death the moment you try anything other than countering. Despite a lacklustre end, this game is so damn fun - let's hope that in the sequel they either remove combat or make it more fun and intuitive.			"

First person parkour gaming at its finest.Short versionRun around, get creative on how to get from A to B using parkour tactics while avoiding enemies that attack you. What's not to like?Long versionThe story is a bit weak and predictable with some big plot holes and on the short side but you are not going to care about that. You'll be too busy running around the city map missions using creative ways to get around, under and above obstacles. Enemies can be avoided, fought or just killed; it's up to you. The PC version does not have the trophies achievements from the console versions, you will unlock everything by just finishing the game on any difficulty. So go nuts and kill if you want, there is no penalty or Steam achievements.The game uses checkpoints, but they are not located far from each other so no frustrating long re-attempts at difficult points.The stage designs.....GORGEOUS!!!  Bright clean colors and great architecture. Even background (or rather the far ground floor looking down from skyscrapers) has actual people and traffic life to it. You don't feel like you're in a dead city. Even birds and airplanes are sometimes visible in the sky. Seriously, who ever made the maps, is a genius. I really enjoyed just being there like it is a real city. The atmosphere alone is totally worth playing this game.			"

The game did suprisingly horrible at launch, but over the years, Mirror's Edge is a force to be reckoned with. This game packs AMAZING visuals for such low requirements. The controls are absolutely perfect. They feel like you're not doing a ridiculous combo move to move Faith around, but you're also not one-buttoning it. The story is amazing, and packs a punch. You'll love feeling like a badass, dodging bullets and slaying the ""blues"" of the game. But, along with every person that has ever played this game ever, THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUNS IN IT.

												What a dissapointment after all the hype around this game. Yes it's awesome. looks good and controls are great. I could play this all day long  ...If it would be actualy centered around parkour without the plot. Game is at it's best when you try to figure out a route across an area that looks just impossible. or you are following someone and trying to hang on. Game is also at it's worst when there is a lot of combat and deus ex style plot twists.  The pipes and bars marked red should have been skipped and instead given ample time to observe the roof tops and plan your route. Also there is very rarely any alternative routes despite the fact that the game tells you to be on the lookout for alternatives. Thumbs up anyways - If you are not that interested in parkour then atleast check out how Dice managed to make believable parkour game.			"

												What a dissapointment after all the hype around this game. Yes it's awesome. looks good and controls are great. I could play this all day long  ...If it would be actualy centered around parkour without the plot. Game is at it's best when you try to figure out a route across an area that looks just impossible. or you are following someone and trying to hang on. Game is also at it's worst when there is a lot of combat and deus ex style plot twists.  The pipes and bars marked red should have been skipped and instead given ample time to observe the roof tops and plan your route. Also there is very rarely any alternative routes despite the fact that the game tells you to be on the lookout for alternatives. Thumbs up anyways - If you are not that interested in parkour then atleast check out how Dice managed to make believable parkour game.			"

												This game has been defined as a ""Cult Classic"" by Gameinformer in 2013 and, quite frankly, I couldn't agree more. The game did suprisingly horrible at launch, but over the years, Mirror's Edge is a force to be reckoned with. This game packs AMAZING visuals for such low requirements. The controls are absolutely perfect. They feel like you're not doing a ridiculous combo move to move Faith around, but you're also not one-buttoning it. The story is amazing, and packs a punch. You'll love feeling like a badass, dodging bullets and slaying the ""blues"" of the game. But, along with every person that has ever played this game ever, THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GUNS IN IT.

												The concept of not playing another first person shooter is refreshing but then game ruins it by introducing awful gunplay .First person platforming is not completely original idea but Mirror's Edge provides more variety for jumps and techniques .Overall this game is a mixed bag of experiences with some great and not so great moments . Some parts are exciting like jumping on a train but for the most part you stack in close spaces doing easy linear platforming which gets repetitive .Initially you are encouraged to avoid enemies which gives this game a unique feel . Unfortunetly toward second half of the game you often find yourself playing crapy first person shooter .I think game fails to progressively add more intuitive options to gameplay . If you played it for 1 hour you pretty much have seen eveything that it has to offer in terms of moves .Sliding down the building like Jackie Chan is awesome but there is not enough of that .I like the artstyle which is probably the best thing about this game .Animated cutscenes and aesthetic hights gives the game good atmosphere . It is a bit too bright sometimes but it makes the game look different . Music is good also but I wish there was more heavy techno for when you in danger .Not much to say about the story . I did not really care for it because of complete disbelief in a person running away from bulelts . 7/10 Mirror's Edge is very much linear so there is almost no creative ways to approching a problem . You just move from point A to poing B with poor gunplay and minimal fighting options . There is a lot of downtime in this game to do mindless platforming which I find a bit boring . It is unique enough to play it once but I am not really crazy about buying sequal .			"

												Fantastic game.The game mechanics were fluid. The art style and soundtrack was beautiful. The story is debatable. Some find in cliche, others don't. I personally thought it was fine. The game is somewhat shorter than what you might expect, but the game itself has a lot of replayability. There are ""Race/Speedrun"" and ""timetrial"" versions of each level that aim to please players.Some describe the levels linear - as opposed to an open world - but I find that Mirror's Edge levels lies somewhere in between. Yes, objectives can be as simple as ""Getting from Point A to Point B"" but I believe the beauty is this game is that there are so many different routes to take to get to your objectives. Which is why I advice you to turn off ""Runner's Vision"" in the options. ""Runner's Vision"" is the guide to the game, showing you just ONE way to get to the objective. I feel the game is more fun when you discover these routes yourselves and develop your own ""Runner's Vision"" without the game doing it for you.I Already finished the main campaign but I'll be playing it again in the future. Then I'm off to it's sequel ""Mirror's Edge: Catalyst"" 10/10			"

												I only have to be mildly drunk before I start swearing this is the best game ever. It’s not, but between the fights there’s something absolutely unparalleled about the rough and tumble of scrambling around these rooftops and offices. You see yourself roll with every fall, feel every clamber, hear every breath and footfall, and at the same time you have a sense of how quiet and small it all is. Next to this vast, stingingly bright, bleach-clean city, you’re completely insignificant. Apparently that’s something I want to feel.			"

ENG score 6/10 thumbed down due lack of neutral Go with the flow they said. You're going to go le parkour in first person they said. I'm running, looking for it while a blur effect cuts the screen - must be the babe ""feeling"" it, screen starts tearings badly - must be Nvidia Phsyx ""feeling it'', dead. Even with a GTX 970, turning it off, rebooting. Back again I need to jump, through the flow and up above a 4 meters wall - police start firing at me (again), need to jump, wrong direction, too fast, dead. Helicopter found me (again, no options) first person le parkour with white background, can't see a thing, too slow, dead. Another fighting, (while cops are firing as always) he's disarmed, another sniper ahead, dead. A flat roof! I can finally feel the flow!... nope, police start firing (again), bored, fingers hurting, dead. I try to get in the one said ""feeling"", but when I'm in, the flow is interrupted by some glitches here and there, bad design and EA's Illuminati dystopia cliche. How I will flow, if I'm always being barred by the game's mistakes?Port nota 6/10 negativado por falta de neutro Falaram pra ir no fluxo. Falaram dar uma de Altair do futuro em primeira pessoa. Estou correndo, quando sentindo, a tela fica desfocada - deve ser a gata ""sentindo"" aquilo, tela começa a cortar feio - deve ser a Phsyx da Nvidia ""sentindo"", até com uma GTX 970, desliguei, reiniciei. Voltei e preciso pular, por pelo menos 4 metros de parede - polícia já tá atirando em mim (denovo) preciso pular, direção errada, fui muito rápido, morte. Helicoptero me achou denovo (óbvio, vc não tem escolha) dar uma de Altair com cenário muito branco, não enxergo nada, fui devagar demais, morte. Outra luta (enquanto chove bala) disarmei-o, mas já outro sniper ali, morte. Um telhado liso! Agora sim posso sentir o fluxo!... nada, polícia já está atirando (denovo) enjoado, dedos doem, morte. Eu tento chegar no tal ""sentido"", mas quando estou quase despertando o meu cosmo, o fluxo é constantemente interrompido por glitches lá e cá, uma história de nova ordem mundial jaz machacada pela EA, e um mal design de jogo. Como vou fluir no tal do fluxo, se estou sempre sendo barrado pelo erros do jogo? "

												Mirror's Edge is a phenomenal action platformer. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you land the perfect jump, disarm a cop, or slide kick a dude in the nuts is just tops. The story itself is fairly short, but the replay value seems to be pretty good. There's lots of stuff for you to find around the levels, and beyond that there's time trials and races with leaderboards, if you really want to see how fast you can blow through a level. The music and art are downright breathtaking at times, there was more than one moment where I had to stop running and just look out at the cityscape. Overall I loved this game, really glad I picked it up finally when it was on sale. The first few times I fell I winced and audibly gasped, it really sucks you in. The few hours it took to get through the story were incredibly exhilarating and visually stunning. Even the combat animations are just so incredibly smooth, you go from running along the side of a wall to twisting a dudes arm around and snatching his gun in a few seemingly effortless motions (if you get your timing right). Only played through once, on normal difficulty, and I found it pleasantly challenging to downright punishing at times. Some of the sparring with enemy NPCs was ridiculous, but after a few failed attempts I felt like a total badass taking them down. Highly recommend this game. Visually it's held up over the years, and mechanically it's one of the most thrilling games I've played. Parkour platforming and combat come together like peanut butter and chocolate in Mirror's Edge.  "

Personal Rating : ""Worth trying""Traditional Rating : 7/10Let's jump on conclusion, this one is a breakthrough of all platformer game with touch of 3D environment and well, running x jumping simulation.The overall story and gameplay is so so, neither the soundacting. Sometimes the cutscene are the Faith itself or just a cartoon drawing. And until now I still don't know what Faith doing.Despite of not-so-good story and roughly 5hours of gameplay, running and jumping a.k.a parkour, is always fun to do.The UI in-game are so minimum it makes you feel like your really face the running and obstacles yourself.the only, downside of this game, is countless trying.. sometimes the save point are so far away from the hardest part of the map, so everytime you die you need to run for a minute or two before facing the hard part again. Or sometimes its just too short from save point that when you respawn a second later you're already dead.The cycles always the same, run > dead > loading > run > (almost got it) but dead > et cetera.Im not fond of tryhard person, but it really iritates me when there's only a linear story and linear path to follow.TL;DRworth to try, easy to learn but hard to master. but no, it's not worth to master this game anyway.

												Definetly worth getting. Its quite nice fast-paced puzzle/fps game- unlike in Portal series, you have to think fast, on the go, while bullets fly by your ears.You play as Faith Connors, female runner in futuristic city ruled by dictatorship. Runners serve as line of communications for those who want freedom back.Anyways, this is sadly where things go.. cliché. Faith's sister is framed for murder she didnt do and rest of game Faith tries to save her. Without spoiling (hopefully), on top of everything this has open ending, for sequel that still isnt announced (new Mirror's Edge is prequel).But despite story, its incredibly fun game. There are literally dozens of ways to reach your goal in every map, you can fight guards, you can avoid them, you can lure them into your trap. There is nothing like playing peek-a-boo with cops with shotguns near shipping crates for few hours (though AI is actually quite good).Be warned though, at first this might seem dull because its frankly very easy to play trough it but bloody hard to master, but when you do, you are going to play this for hours			"

												Surprisingly good game, I really enjoyed it despite its shortness (it takes about 5-7 hours to beat it, may be 10 hours with finding all collectives, but if you're interested in speedrun walkthrough, current world record is about 35 minutes with skipping all cut scenes and using all short cuts, if I'm not mistaken).Strong colours everywhere, protagonist is so full of life, whole city is beautiful(although a little empty on pedestrians), very immersive first person view, stylish 2d in game clips.Reminds me about Portal, where you have impressive (no sarcasm) running skills instead of portal gun. Climbing isn't as boring as in Assassin's creed, story is good too, although I find it a little unfinished.Levels are mix of running, labyrinth puzzles and fighting/running away from enemies. And some more running. Yes, even more on top of that.I enjoyed every minute of gameplay(except the time where I got stuck in puzzles).""Extras"" menu in game allows you to check some beautiful concept arts, from early ones to the latest pre-release ones.The game worth the price even without discounts, that's a rare sight to see, for me at least, so I totally recommend anyone to grab it and spend at least few evenings playing it.

												The game started out fun, but the more I play it, the more of a drag it becomes. I just want to get through it.The game presents itself as a parkour game, when it's actually a fighting/puzzle solving game. The combat is super lame, you can punch and kick people, but they have heavy armor, so you can't take them out smoothly while running and you have to fight fists vs guns at point blank. It's usually easier to just pick up a gun from a fallen enemy and shoot. If I wanted to shoot people, I would have chosen to play literally any other shooter. The puzzles are also usually annoying because you miss one thing and spend up combing the map for it.I've only spent about 10% of my gametime doing cool parkour stuff, which I expected to be the point of the entire game.

												Pros- Interesting genre: parcours with FPS. A lot of variety.  - You 'should' not get lost as both visual and audio clues help you to find your way to your goal.- Some parts of the games are without any clues. This allows you to be a bit creative and succeeding feels more rewarding. This is what games such as 'Remember Me' are lacking. - The controls are generally rather smooth...- ... and the FPS elements let you blow off some steam when the controls just fail. Because you die - a lot. - The respawn system works well. Really. - Stunning graphics and environments- Very fitting music- A great amount of detail in terms of random banter. Cons- The story. Only the surface of so many things has been scratched. No depth and the ending feels abrupt. - Basically no character development and everyone feels like a filler. You do not get attached to your heroine.- Controls are sometimes horrible for no reason whatsoever. Very, very annoying.- The odd balance between ""a lot of help"" and ""no help whatsoever"" in the parcours makes the game rather frustrating. - The combat system is difficult to master. Even slowing down time (your ability) makes it difficult to disarm ennemies. - Avoiding combat feels much better than actually fighting.- No replayability. No time trials. - Collectables are pointless as they do not unlock anything nor give any achievements.  - Audio quality sometimes sucks as most of the conversations happen through radio waves.  While you are being shot at by machine guns.- FPS Issues despite owning a Nvidia card. Disabling PhysX is mandatory. - Alt+Tab is a deathwish.I honestly did not enjoy this game. You might.			"

												This game has a particular fanbase, guess that isn't me. Beat it in under 6hrs, also with no achievments theres no point in playing without using guns.Mirror's Edge is a unique parkour style game with some cool elements and tension driven missions toward the end (where enemies parkour chase you).However with some clunky controls and a cheesy story with oddly done cutscenes it's not very memorable.

It's so much fun running with very well-fitted music and sometimes I feel the adrenaline pumping when I know the parkour persuit cops are on my tail. Seriously, I got intersted in free-running after playing this game. This is a game where you are struck in awe, but a shame that the adventure ends quick.

												Did I like this game? Not at first, no. It took a while to like it. My main problem with it? Nvidia. PhysX is awful. Its broken. It doesn't work. I spent the longest time trying to get the game to stop lagging and to stop screen-tearing. I gave up for a couple months, and eventually came back. This time I figured out what was wrong. It was PhysX. So I enabled v-sync and disabled PhysX. BAM, suddenly the game runs perfectly. BUT when you finally get into the game, its great. The running is a bit awkward, parts of the running and stuff seem unrealistic, however on the whole, its pretty awesome. You get to run around and jump and vault and wall-run and more. What I wish they'd fix is the combat. Its okay, I guess, but when you're trying to disarm, its a 50/50 for whether you can actually do it. Most of the time you're a split-second late or early, and the soldier kills you. You can take a few shots, but it gets to the point later in the game where you're getting killed what seems to be WAY too easily, compared to earlier in the game. The story is great if you're paying attention. It could be a lot better, they should have revealed more about what happened to the City and how its come to this awful state its in now, but instead they set all the focus on saving Kate. Its not bad, because its still a pretty great story, but it could be better and more indepth. I figure Mirror's Edge 2 (if it ever gets released, and if DICE doesn't ♥♥♥♥ it up) will have all that backstory.			"

												This game is so freaking unique in its kind!Talk to me about another free running game that is in 3D and that has managed to impress millions of fans around the world. Nop? Well, there's Mirror's Edge, an unique adventure with excellent graphics and things to do, to think about and to explore (kind of)The good:- Jump, fall, slide- Explore a wide array of environments from rooftops to sewers to interiors to offices to everything!- Can pass the game without shooting a bullet!- Overall, the experience is great, you're going to have fun playing it, but...The bad : - Graphics cheat. Game looks nicer because some things shine a lot but that is because they programmed it so that there you see no more coloyr, only the shiny thing- Missions are somewhat repetitive, some are too easy, some are way too difficult- Storyline hard to believe but still interesting enough ( cuz it's a cartoon for God's sake!)- Although the city looks well planned and beautiful, no free running 'round unfortunately. Yes, I fel immersed into an urban futuristic city probably like never before, but in-mission. I never could explore things on my own			"

												Mirror's Edge is a properly done 3d Sonic in disguise.If you are stopping to fight enemies, you did something wrong. In fact, if you are slowing down at all, you did something wrong.Much like in Sonic, speed is earned in Mirror's Edge. It's the reward for doing well. Are the levels linear? Yes. Does that make them bad? No. Does that make it so that there are no options? Heck no. If you play time trial mode, you'll quickly discover that you did the levels in the story mode all wrong- you were taking the wrong paths, timing your jumps badly, or otherwise screwing up.The occasional platforming puzzle can sometimes be frustrating, but if you're looking for a game about dodging gunfire as you wallrun, power-slide, vault, and just flat-out RUN, you've found the right title.Now hurry up with the damn sequel, DICE.

												Great game if you love parkour..and if you're looking for a different style of gameplay. I got it mainly because I was excited to see a game with just parkour and freerunning instead of weapons (although you can occasionally still use weapons) like usual games these days are. I was completely satisfied when I started playing it. Graphics could be a bit better, but the gameplay and plot totally makes up for it.			"

												I bought this game a couple day ago and finished it today. This is the first game in my entire library that I have finished. The free running in this game is simply superb, the run feels natural and the wall running for the most part is great. The graphics and art design are astounding accompanied with an awesome soundtrack which matches the intense parts with fast paced music and the calm parts with slow calm music. But the one major flaw in the game is the combat as many other fans will tell you. Now the idea of having to take other people's guns and having to work your way up the guns from a pistol to a submachine gun to a  shot gun and so on, theoretically would provide a nice idea. However the combat in this game does not please or deliver in those ideas, as the combat feels unbalanced, weirdly designed in both controls and gun handling as well as the power of weapons and enemies. However, for the most part you can avoid combat situations, but eventually you reach a point where repeatedly trying to steal a weapon through a quicktime event (as stealing guns from behind is a very rare occurence as the guards usually know where you are and immediately start shooting) becomes your only option. However the good very much overpowers the bad the story is intriguing but not too overbearing and if the gameplay doesn't meet you're tastes with great free running, the aesthetic design sure will.

												You need to play this game. It mixes interesting new gameplay (the running, jumping, sliding mechanic) with an interesting enough storyline and slick visuals. It's something as uncommon as a game set in a dystopian future where the environment is not a part of the «dystopian feel». There are bright and shining prime colours everywhere, which clashes with the rather dystopian storyline, yet it pulls it off brilliantly. The gameplay mechanic is pure fun, and something distinctly different. I first finished the game on PS3, and have re-bought it on PC - it's that good. Highly recommended.			"

												Loved the game. Parcouring is the central point of this game, you're free to get from one point to another however you like.Speed is the key, you're really looking through the eyes of the character and you get drawn in to the game like it's actually you running. Making quick left-right decisions, how do I get to that point, it's all set up brilliantly.Only point that's discussable for me is the length, the story's quite short, at the end it left me with the feeling of wanting more, playing more.On the other hand making it longer, extending the story might make it dull as the enemies remain generally the same, there's only so many locations to access... it's a thin line of being repetitive and keeping the player at the edge of his seat.

It's truly remarkable game with intense gameplay - the freedom of movement it gives you, the speed of your running, jumping, flying... sometimes you can really  feel just like a wind.The graphics are maybe a bit unusual, but somehow beautiful and optimistic in otherwise grey and pesimistic world. Storyline is no Deus Ex, but still - it's above average.And the soundtrack - especially with the title ""Still alive"" song - is just beautiful and fits into the game perfectly.Overall I dare to say it's one of the games that I've enjoyed playing the most and left me with really nice feeling in the end.

												While I wouldn't go so far as to say this game is obscure, it certainly deserves more attention than it has received. I've never played anything quite like it. In fact, I'd like to say that Mirror's Edge is the best first-person parkour game I've ever played, but it's also the only first-person parkour game I've ever played. You know what? To hell with it. Mirror's Edge is the best first-person yada yada I've ever played, there you go. This game is something special and the experience of playing it, in spite of a few noteworthy imperfections, is awesome.The story takes place in a large sterile looking city where The Man has established a typical sort of Orwellian society with all the usual tropes therein. Granted, this is only really explained to you through flash animation-esque cutscenes, and never really explicitly shown. There are police here, like anywhere else, and you do have to avoid and occasionally fight them, but other than that, the air of oppression that they speak of is never really conveyed through the gameplay. All I see here is a society where the cops just really don't like you running around on the roof. The plot revolves around a conspiracy and, like many conspiracies, certain details don't really add up. Expecting a tight cohesive story out of this game is probably not something you should do.You play as Faith, a professional courier who conveys senstive items and information about the city via the art of parkour, flipping and jumping about far above the streets where the ubiquitous eye of big brother is ever watchful. Faith is an alright character. All those people who think video games are sexist might actually be okay with her. She's resourceful and athletic and determined and she also has normal sized cans, so women with average proportions don't have to be jealou- I mean, outraged at what a bunch of pigs the men who made this game are. She's also Asian, so if you're a creme colored frat boy with a weird fetish where you want to control a woman of the orient and make her do your chores and bear your children, this game is for you. I actually knew a guy in college who was like that. He constantly tried to make his American-born Vietnamese girlfriend come over and do his laundry. That relationship didn't last long. And no, he wasn't me. But I digress. Faith never does any of that, really. She's more of a sprint-up-the-wall-and-occasionally-murder-a-police-officer kind of chick.As far as the parkour in this game is concerned, the gameplay is fluid, intuitive, and uniquely excellent in its execution. The runners of the game, ""runner"" being the name prescribed to those of Faith's ilk, often expound upon the virtues of ""flow,"" which I guess is sort of like the Force for these guys. It's the essence of what keeps their ninja mojo a goin'. This game actually has that: flow. Once you get over a moderately steep learning curve, you really develop a sort of intuitive feel for how to play this game well. It's pretty cool. The only downside is you might also start to feel a little ashamed of sitting in front of a computer for hours, pretending to be an extremely athletic person by pressing a series of buttons.What is a little lacking in Mirror's Edge is it's combat system. This is usually easy to forgive as combat is something best avoided 95% of the time. You are a runner, after all. However, you do have to engage in hand to hand combat and wield a gun occasionally. For lack of a better term/brain, the best way I can describe combat here is as ""woogity,"" or maybe ""rickety."" You could even say its a little ""finicky,"" or perhaps ""mercurial."" I guess what I'm trying to say is it feels pretty unnatural and inconsistant. It's basically the exact opposite of, well, everything else involved in playing this game. But that's okay, it's more or less functional and there's a good chance if you've decided to get into a gun fight, you should actually be running away anyway.One more thing, the atmosphere in Mirror's Edge is pretty cool. The people who made this thing did a whole lot with not very much as far as graphics are concerned. It's got a sort of over exposed, white washed, ultra clean sort of style, with lots of post modern angles and a stark ultilitarian urban sensibility or something. I should also add that the music is, like, real chill, bra. I mean, its nice, I really do like it. Sort of a nice mellow electronic thing going on there.Alright, so anyway, clearly I have too much time on my hands and IGN needs to hire me. Play this game, you won't regret it. You'll be hoping the sequel actually happens.			"

It's as if EA/DICE got high and took the 1st person feel of Portal and mixed that with ♥♥♥♥ing Crayola markers and Parkour....and it worked. Mirror's Edge puts you into a very immersive story of Faith, a type of parkourer who now has to run from the law and save her sister as well as the ""parkour organization"" she is with.

												Have you ever done a jumping puzzle in Counter Strike or TF2? This game, at its strongest is emulates that as its core game mechanic, with an increased sense of speed and sheer scale. For that alone, I've enjoyed playing it, and recommend it if at a bargain price. The drawbacks, however, are several. The story isn't captivating, and the characters are monotonic. The combat system when fighting police officers feels broken; I often feel as if I'm winning a fight by chance. Some of the more difficult levels push the boundaries of what can be done with the pre-incorporated moves, such as sliding on poles, climbing ladders, hanging off of railings, etc., and as a result can feel a little gimmicky. The levels are often on rails, where there is but one acceptable way to traverse the world. The emotional impact of falling was excellently captured by the dev team, but there's something taken away from it when you fall for the 12th time trying to do the exact same jump. This game is at its best in ""race"" mode, which eschews combat in favor of going for the fastest time through a progression. However, many of the race maps need to be unlocked by playing the campaign, and while many of the race maps are more open to route interpretation than the campaign maps, just as many are again ""on rails."" I conclude to recommend this game if it's at a price that you deem is ""pocket change."" It's thrilling. You'll have fun. You'll be glad you didn't spend a significant amount of cash on it.			"

It is a good concept but could use it a little bit better and it gets stale quite quickly. Overall fun but feels a little limited "

												At best Mirror's Edge is fast paced and brilliantly exciting. Leaping across buildings, sliding and rolling through a beatifully stylised city, the parkour can be fast and fluid with a real sense of freedom. Dodging bullets and racing through buildings, disarming guards and finding quiet moments by sneaking through air vents is all great fun. For odd bursts of thirty seconds or so, this game is brilliant.Then you find a jump which is just too pixel-perfect and takes thirty tries to get right, or the slightly awkward combat and inconsistent level design keeps getting you killed, or despite the hint system it simply isn't obvious where to go next or how. As well as being frustrating in themselves, these events break up the pace of the game and take the shine off the best parts.If it were consistent, this would be one of the best games ever made. As it is, it is a variable experience which is superb in parts and well worth playing overall.			"

												I loved this game.  Some people said it was too short, but I think it was just concise.  It told a good story, it told it well and it never tried to be just another FPS.If you are looking for a shooting game, look elsewhere.  This is free-running done in a way I never really thought a PC game could do.  It might have been a disappointment to people whose expectations were a little off, but this is really an under-appreciated classic of the AAA world.			"

												This is one of my favorite games. I played it throught three times. (And there will probably be a forth time, if Mirror's Edge 2 isn't dropping soon...)This game is very unique. It is an egoshooter, that focuses on running away and avoiding fights instead of shooting your way throught tons of enemies. Matter of fact, in my third play throught I didn't shoot a single bullet. There are other games that tried to capture this ""parcour""-feeling, but it was never done this well. If your know your movements and your timing is right, you can reach an amazing speed.And it is an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of game. Even as a beginner, you make progress, but you always have the feeling, that you can do it better and faster and there are other/better ways to reach your destination.Besides the amazing game play this game features a great art design with this futuristic, all-white city and a lovely, kick-♥♥♥ main character named Faith Conners. Unfortunally the NPCs are more or less stereotypes and the story line is an average. And it is rather short, you need about 9-12 hours to finish this game. If you like freedom, speed, amazingly fluid, skill-based gameplay and unarmed, kickass female characters, that beat the crap out of heavily armed cops, this is your game!I'll give 9/10 stars.PLAY THIS NOW!You're welcome.

												I had done a commission and requested this game as a payment. The hours I spent drawing was 100% worth the reward, and has already taken my total and complete interest from my many other games and put it all into Mirror's Edge. This game has already been one of my top favorites, and has wonderfully transfixed me on it's visual style and EXTREMELY smooth gameplay.Pros:-Wonderful visual style.-Strong story line.-Great mechanics.-Reliable characters.-Great combat.-WONDERFUL first person view. Never had any other game that felt so alive and real.Cons:-Cannot in any way block during melee fights. Can be a BIG annoyance when facing later enemies.-Some minor clipping issues with the pipes, mostly ignorable. Pro Tip; definitely look straight at the ♥♥♥♥ing things and keep going forward, it'll all work out.-You will die, a lot.

												My rating: 8.5 / 10Mirror's Edge is an innovative game that will leave you looking at things a little differently.Pros: - Unique gameplay: Less gunning, more running leads to some fast-paced sequences.- Fun combat system oriented around disarming enemies hand-to-hand.- Amazing visuals. This game is gorgeous.- Great atmosphere. The visuals and soundtrack blend well into an immersive experience.- Strong female lead that depicts the female game character in a less sexual, more powerful way.Cons:- Collision glitches. Some areas will not always register your grabbing on to them, leading you to plummet to your death.- Frequent death, can be frustrating for some.- Sometimes combat can be glitched; disarms may not register properly.Mirror's Edge isn't a traditional first person shooter, and that difference may be hated by some and loved by others. This game however, happens to be one of my personal favorites.			"

												     I rarely write reviews, but having just finished this game, I feel like the experience wouldn't be complete without a short response. This is by far not a perfect game - but I recommend it anyways to anyone who considers gaming a hobby. If you are craving an excellent show of single player gameplay and atmosphere, this is the game to check out, even with it's blemishes.Personal praises:-Revolutionary Art Direction (Beautiful environments with powerful splashes of color - see the screenshots)-Wonderful Sound and Music (The flagship track is one of my favorite piece of gaming music)-Mechanically intuitive (Various gameplay feats ""Make sense"" with how they control)-Rewarding replay value (Becomes more fun as you learn the game - not less)Potential areas of improvement:-Combat (Feels forced and wrecks the pacing; personally my least favorite part of the game)-Story (Lacks a real punch, despite excellent potential in characters and set up)-Multiplayer Tweaking (Currently only features a time trial mode which can cheated)     Mirror's Edge does so many innovative things, yet stumbles just short of being a masterpiece. Despite this, I seriously believe it is something that should be experienced by anyone who counts themselves a gamer. It will change how you look at games.			"

												tl;dr: Absolutely stunning and vibrant visuals, a masterfully performed soundtrack, unique, heart-pumping gameplay that tests your spatial awareness skills and encourages you to run the levels as smoothly as possible, and a lifelike world. It is a bit short however (my playthrough took 4 hours). All in all, Mirror's Edge is most definitely worth your money. Buy it now.Mirror's Edge, developed by DICE (makers of the Battlefield series), released in 2008, is a first person running game. You play as Faith Connors, a Runner in a futuristic unnamed city in which the government monitors all forms of communication. Runners were established to send messages without the government knowing about it. The plot revolves around Faith's sister being framed for a murder she didn't commit, and Faith unraveling the web of truth, forgive my simplistic metaphor. There are 9 chapters in the game, each one separated by an animated cutscene. Mirror's Edge, however, is not praised for it's intricate story. The component that shines is the unique gameplay. Despite being developed by the makers of the Battlefield series, combat is far from the focus of this game. The main objective is to traverse from point A to point B via rooftops, air vents, hallways, whatever stands in Faith's way. All of this is done on foot. Occasionally, the police force (referred to as ""Blues"" by the characters) show up to try and kill Faith. The Blues are dangerous, and should not be confronted head-on. The main strategy of survival is avoiding enemies and escaping them. Faith is not a fighter, she's a runner. Her only weapons are the environment around her and her limbs. A neat mechanic that greatly enhances the experience of Mirror's Edge is ""Runner Vision"". What this does is highlight possible pathways through the level, making it easy for the player to focus on the immersive world and parkour experience. Certain objects such as ramps, ziplines, and doors are highlighted to guide the player along. If the player is stuck and does not know where to go, pressing a key (or B on an Xbox 360 controller) will snap the camera to the direction of the objective. While Mirror's Edge is a fantastic experience, it is lacking in the length department. I completed the main story in under 5 hours, and that was with countless deaths and moments of ""What the hell am I supposed to do here?"". The game makes up for it by including a separate ""speed run"" mode for each level, and additional time trials. Overall, Mirror's Edge is a fulfilling and satisfying experience that delivers on all levels. The visuals are vibrant and memorable, the soundtrack adds the perfect amounts of ambience and tension, the plot is interesting enough, and the gameplay keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend playing this at least once in your gaming career.			"

												I honestly don't know where to begin, other than saying that this is a great game. And I truely mean it. With a compelling story, fascinating and yet unique gameplay, and georgeous level design, this game forms a true masterpiece.While the story certainly isn't  BioShock-level great (no, I'm not comparing this game to BioShock), it's not bad either. You play as a runner (the ""protagonists"" of the story), Faith, and save her sister after she's been accused of murder. Nothing to fancy. Unless you've complete the game, however, but I'm not going to spoil it. The story also is a bit short, I managed to complete it in 4 and a half hours, and that was on my first run through it. Story - 7/10The graphics some will say aren't the best, and I can see that. But I think that the game looks spectacular when running at the highest settings. Brilliant use of color, especially an uncommonly used color in games these days, white. The lighting helps too, however, it proved to be a bit annoying in some levels, but that's okay as you can turn the brightness down if you wish. The levels mainly consist of rooftops, and sometimes inside a building. However, you will also explore the inside of a storm drain, alleyways, and a harbor. I did think that it was a bit linear - at first it seems like pathways branch, and they do, but only in certain segments of a level. (Example, you're on a rooftop, and there is a gate. There are multiple ways to get around the gate, but once you do get around it, lies behind it a ramp you're to spring off of.)  Level deisgn/graphics - 8/10While the gameplay may look quirky in videos, and actually may seem quirky when learning them for the first time, believe me, they're not. You'll get used to them right away, and just like the game's purpose, you'll flow smoothly right through the stages. The game isn't that difficult, but some levels can be. You also can use guns, which was actually going to be a bigger element of gameplay in earlier versions, it really isn't that big. They work like normal guns, should - they shoot.  But honestly, they didn't feel needed, if it weren't for how many cops the game throws at you in certain levels. But like I said before, the game's intenion is to flow through the levels. They want the gameplay to become a natural thing. And I think they achieved that.Gameplay - 9/10Mirror's Edge is a wonderful, exhilerating action-platformer that requires some skill. While things may look different through a video, the game will suck you in and drop you into a whole new world of flow and colors. I think it is completely worth the $20 it charges, though if a sale is coming quite soon, I reccomend waiting as you won't be missing much. Final verdict - 8/10			"

												A race for time, or a waste of time?Mirror's Edge takes something that many of us wish we were fit enough to do, and makes it into a core gameplay mechanic for anyone to enjoy. Is it fun? Yes! Absolutely! But it's not as groundbreaking as some hoped it would be (someone like me :P).It's a good game with some designer flaws, none of which, however, deter from the experience. Allow me to elaborate.In this game you play as a runner named Faith (how quaint) who runs into a, well, let's call it a ""political disagreement"" with the local PD, giving her (and you) an excuse jump off walls, off buildings, off TRAINS! Basically there is a lot of stuff to jump off of. And on, as well, as you are given the ability to beat the crap out of your enemies using said running and jumping abilities. This is very a smooth combat system, and very entertaining to do, as using your momentum to drive your punches and kicks like a projectile leaves you with an awesome feeling. The game seems to suffer from some kind of split personality disorder, though, as it can't tell if it wants to be a freerunning racing game, or another stylish EA shooter (meh). There are several points in the game where the only way to progress is to pick up a gun and blast/snipe your way through. Luckily there are only a few parts like these. The game markets itself as something unique and different that the current FPS generation would enjoy, however if you ignore running aspect and focus on what else the game is offering you basically have a linear campaign with several elements taken from games such as Half-Life 1+2 and portal, such as having to analyze your surroundings and cleverly use them to your advantage (another would be crawling through the air vents). This doesn't necessarily make this a bad game, just don't expect it to be ground breaking. I thought I was going to have an experience similar to Prince of Persia, but really it was far from it. It's a game of speed and momentum, where you are trying to get from point A to point B in the smoothest and quickest way possible, whereas Prince is about using special climbing techniques to solve puzzles that take up entire rooms.The graphics are great, and the massive city truely looks amazing. The Unreal 3 engine really shines in this game. I just wish we could actually go into the city and explore it more. Instead you are guided through a linear path, probably because that way it could tell the story, however unrelatable it was. It's clear that they worked hard on the story, but it's just so convoluted that I found myself paying less and less attention to it as I went along. The gameplay keeps you more engaged than the story, which is ok.I personally liked it, and found myself coming back to the time trials to kill some time. Without a doubt this game had much more potential, and with the fact that they had to revise the story several times, it kinda shows. But for a new IP with an experimental play style it seemed to present itself quite well. I would recommend this game to people who want to kill a weekend with some high velocity scissor kicks and clever outside-the-box speed run levels.			"

												One of those games that has pulled me back a few times. To this day the graphics are stunning. I won't lie...it is not easy. There are some parts I did over and over again, trying to get it right. The core free-running mechanics are solid, and the environment is immersive as hell. Definitely a fun game if you like to really let yourself be taken away by  a tense moment in a game world. Worth the sale price. SUGGESTION: Don't come to this party packing a 9800GT or some other vid card from the Bush Administration. This game needs power. Also check the forums if you can't get the  Physx effects working.

												Mirror's Edge is a gorgeous and unappreciated freerunning game. It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey ""realism"".The freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and ""that was crap, I pressed that"" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.The gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.

												 If you are tired of the usual genres and gameplay styles and want something new give this a go.  Yes, parkour is sooooo 2005, but it's really well done here: it's fast, fluid, and fun with just the right balance in player control required to keep the game from turning into ether a cumbersome and overcomplicated mess or an over simplified and tedious push-a-button-and-mindlessly-jump-from-roof-to-roof ""Assassain's Creed"" type experience.  The storyline isn't all that great (although it's kind of refreshing in its ""run from the bad guys!"" simplicity), but the graphics are still awesome 4 years later and the art design has a nice ""Run Lola Run"" meets ""Blade Runner"" aesthetic to it.    The game can get a bit too ""trial and error"" at times, but it's so short (I completed the entire thing in 4 hours my first time through) and it looks and plays so well that it really doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's the perfect game to get on sale for 5 dollars and waste an evening or so with.			"

												Positives:-Gorgeous visuals, with colorful aesthetics, that escape from the boring greys and darks from typical urban environments in videogames.-Well implemented Parkour gameplay (the core aspect of the game), with decent physics and a nice flow of momevement and momentum. A breath of fresh air, on a market where all first person games are shooters by default.-Great soundtrack, that fits the visuals of each level (even for those who dont usually appreciate the subgenre of ambient music, like me).-Faith, the protagonist and best character in the game.Negatives:-The combat gameplay, felt a bit clunky and forced, i always preferred to run away form enemies.-The shooting gameplay is not very good, but it wasnt supposed to be anyway, with the option of not using firearms in all scenarios, and discarding the guns when done with them (this is a positive!).-The story and most secondary characters are, if not bad, at least, unremarkable, and the ending is too rushed (hopefully the sequel will provide more answers and some sense of achievement).Overall:Great, innovative game with fun, fluid (not so much on my crap PC) gameplay, with a short story but with a good amount of extra challenges, that add up to a nice length of entertainment. May Mirrors Edge 2 come quickly, and even better!			"

												mirror's edge is a slow and fast paced parkour game with a bit of shooting.PROS+parkour is really fun+great graphics make you feel like a ninja+no DLC (where is EA and what have you done to them dice?)+doesn't take up much space on your computer+taking out baddies makes you feel totally badass (throws right leg over enemies left side of neck, pulls down, takes gun, smacks baddie in head with gun. baddie is ded.)+easy to learn controls and gameplayCONS-very short, only about 10 levels and 5-6 hours of gameplay. Left me wanting more!-suprised nobodys mentioned this, but worst final boss battle ever!small description of fight below you just run, jump over a thing, slide under a thing, press space to jump onto a helicopter, done. Cutscene! very good. 9/10			"

												This game is a great example of a game where the controls/options/mechanics don't have to be super in depth for it to be extremely enjoyable.  Once you get down movement of the game (which can take a while), speeding through areas, flying over sky scrapers, and dodging police can give you an adrenaline rush at some times.  Movement is nice and fluid, and the soundtrack is amazing.  It's not that expensive of a game either, so I'd say it is definitely worth picking up.  Took me about 9 hours to finish, but that included a lot of retrying areas.			"

												An amazing game! The first person perspective redone in a fully immersive experience. Sure, at certain points you can disarm and use guard weapons against them, but that isn't the focus of the game. It's about running, jumping, and using parkour style techniques to work your way past guards and through obsticles. Hearing the character breathing, hearing and even FEELING the damage done by messed up jumps, and the camera's movements according to the character has literally left me on the edge of my seat more than once. If you enjoy platform games, enjoy a action packed game, enjoy a parkour-style game, I highly recommend Mirror's Edge. And if you enjoyed this game already be sure to keep on the lookout for a Mirror's Edge 2, I've heard that there's one in the making!			"

												Mirrors Edge is one of the most innovative games ive seen in a while. I does something that no on has done before which is making a game solely based on parkour and freerunning. The game has very little combat but it isnt a flaw here, the sheer adrenaline and excitement that the freerunning gives you completely makes up for it. Story wise this game isnt very big on that. You wont care for most of the characters besides the protagonist Faith who is a total bad ♥♥♥. The overall plot is a bit convoluted and boring but is still a fun game. It is a short game so i would recommend you get the game when its on sale for less than 10 dollars. The main game is around 7-8 hours long with the extra time trials maybe giving an hour or two of extra fun. 7.6/10 great game.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a freerun shoot/punch game,pro's:-It runs smooth and feels like it is well optimised.-It looks fresh and the colors really pop out.-The freerun gameplay feels great.-Great replay value, in fact I would say the more times you play and the better you get at it, the more fun it becomes.-Falling to your death makes your face muscles active xD.-Great for speedrunning challanges-Most of the time it's clear which routes you can take and keeps the speed in sprinting and jumping aroundcons:-Combat is megh, against pistol cops the combat is kinda fun, but after mid game the enemies are just annoying to deal with, it takes the speed out of the game and hand to hand combat is just clumsy as balls.-Boss battle like things are awfull-Story doesn't grab me at all.. in fact I played through it 3 times before getting it on steam and I still only remember half of it.-Sometimes the game is quite unclear about where to go, and you're running around in the same room untill you get bored, grab a guide and go like: ""jebus could've made it a bit more obvious"".Conclusion:The pro's far outweigh the cons and if you like first person fast paced free run games then this is a must have.

												Parkour, cyberpunk, high-octane adventure/action thriller with a female hero protagonist.Pros* Sexy asian female heroine, lead protagonist provides a distinction to just about every other game out there since Tomb Raider which I found refreshing and captivating.* Visuals are excellent, and could have been even better if my system would have handled it.* Storyline was simple but easy to follow and still captivating.* Simple and straight forward, it's main tenant is one or two things and it doesn't try to pretend to be anything more.* Has been made to work in VR, which I am very excited to try.* Really liked that it had combat strewn in there as well. I began to really look forward to weapon encounters just so I could steal the weapon and shoot every one up - kinda breaks up the rhythm of the game.* Exhillarating, fun, almost-realistic, inspires a rush of adrenaline and fear.* Breathtaking and awe-inspiring cityscape views.* Beautifully animated cutscenes.* It was really fun, and the combination of parkour, gun battles, fighting and chases was enthralling.* Cinematic quality gameplay that really flowed from one scene to the next, creating a sense of urgency - really well done!Cons* The wall-running and other parkour techniques that are fundamental to the game are not explored thoroughly enough in the tutorial, which can lead to frustrations later on in the game and slowed it down, when the challenges become more difficult.* Extremely laggy on an 2xGPU ATI gfx card with PhysX turned on (in particular the scenes where lots of glass breaks) - had to disable PhysX - then it ran excellent.* Storyline may be a little too simplistic for some. Could have used a few extra twists perhaps, but I was satisfied just the way it was, but could definitely have been a little longer.* Some of the city detail could have been a little richer (cars, trees, animations, pedestrians, etc).* Recognising it was an experience focusing around jumping around buildings and parkour, I would have enjoyed a little more combative / weapon encounters.* There is one particular part of the game when the parkour and 'movement sequence puzzle' became a little overwhelming, but not enough to not want to see it through (though I could've done with about half as much).* No stealth. I mean this is a Pro as well, as the game is not designed to be ""Thief"" - I feel that every other game should have develoepd the parkour elements of Mirror's Edge to this degree and not the other way around. But since it is already such a simple game, adding stealth would have enriched the game dynamics further somewhat. I can't help but feel that it was designed to be a 100% parkour game, but then at some point someone made a decision to chuck in some weapons, and left the storyline/gameplay with regards to weapons under-developed, whilst the parkour elements over-developed. I mean I could have done with a 100% parkour game, but if you added the weapons element, why not extend it a little further.ConclusionI really, really enjoyed this game! My biggest gripes are that I wish it were a little longer and that they explained the wallrunning and other parkour techniques a little better at the beginning. I managed to get to almost the end before realising ""OK this is going to HAVE to be a wall run!"" and finally googled how to do it, though it would have made the rest of the game just that much easier (in the sense of time wasted) if I had known how to do it correctly from the beginning.Also, in relation to making the game longer, it seems that if the devs had invested as much time as they did *SPOILER ALERT* with that huge empty atrium, and instead filled a few more carparks or construction yards with a bunch of baddies with guns in a fashion that allowed a combination of parkour, gun battles, chases and fighting - the replayability of this would be enormous. I'd still be playing it instead of writing this review :) With just a little more encounters that combine your parkour and stay under cover, steal weapons, fight, chase all rolled into the same scene, it would have stretched the hours playtime considerably as well as increasing replayability.I will be definitely playing it again, and will definitely play and look forward to a sequel. It was awesome!			"

												tl;dr: Absolutely stunning and vibrant visuals, a masterfully performed soundtrack, unique, heart-pumping gameplay that tests your spatial awareness skills and encourages you to run the levels as smoothly as possible, and a lifelike world. It is a bit short however (my playthrough took 4 hours). All in all, Mirror's Edge is most definitely worth your money. Buy it now.Mirror's Edge, developed by DICE (makers of the Battlefield series), released in 2008, is a first person running game. You play as Faith Connors, a Runner in a futuristic unnamed city in which the government monitors all forms of communication. Runners were established to send messages without the government knowing about it. The plot revolves around Faith's sister being framed for a murder she didn't commit, and Faith unraveling the web of truth, forgive my simplistic metaphor. There are 9 chapters in the game, each one separated by an animated cutscene. Mirror's Edge, however, is not praised for it's intricate story. The component that shines is the unique gameplay. Despite being developed by the makers of the Battlefield series, combat is far from the focus of this game. The main objective is to traverse from point A to point B via rooftops, air vents, hallways, whatever stands in Faith's way. All of this is done on foot. Occasionally, the police force (referred to as ""Blues"" by the characters) show up to try and kill Faith. The Blues are dangerous, and should not be confronted head-on. The main strategy of survival is avoiding enemies and escaping them. Faith is not a fighter, she's a runner. Her only weapons are the environment around her and her limbs. A neat mechanic that greatly enhances the experience of Mirror's Edge is ""Runner Vision"". What this does is highlight possible pathways through the level, making it easy for the player to focus on the immersive world and parkour experience. Certain objects such as ramps, ziplines, and doors are highlighted to guide the player along. If the player is stuck and does not know where to go, pressing a key (or B on an Xbox 360 controller) will snap the camera to the direction of the objective. While Mirror's Edge is a fantastic experience, it is lacking in the length department. I completed the main story in under 5 hours, and that was with countless deaths and moments of ""What the hell am I supposed to do here?"". The game makes up for it by including a separate ""speed run"" mode for each level, and additional time trials. Overall, Mirror's Edge is a fulfilling and satisfying experience that delivers on all levels. The visuals are vibrant and memorable, the soundtrack adds the perfect amounts of ambience and tension, the plot is interesting enough, and the gameplay keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend playing this at least once in your gaming career.			"

												Despite already owning a copy for the Xbox 360, I do not regret purchasing this game on Steam as well. As it would turn out, when DICE isn't busy in an uphill battle with Call of Duty, they have the ability to churn out works of art like this one.The storyline of this game is one that I met with a resounding 'eh'. Despite having a brilliant setup with many different directions to go in, it goes for the more subtle route based on what the main character, Faith finds most important. I wont spoil it too much, but I will say that your character, in this game at least isn't going to be playing the great big hero. But also not an antihero. Her job of transporting sensitive information as discreetly as possible is iffy at best, but at her core she clearly cares about others, even more than herself. I'd like to see Mirror's Edge 2 explore the more story driven aspect, but Mirrors' Edge's story is just alright.But everything else about this game feels like gold. Between the beautiful visuals which shine through even on lower end hardware, the amazing(if occasionally redundant) musical score, and the phoenominal gameplay, you not only get a stunning experience, but a deeply emotional one, too, and not in terms of a storyline. When I hop in an elevator and rapidly click the up button while bullet holes spur up in the door after being chased by 20 cops, I let out the same breath of fresh air Faith does. And when Faith takes a plunge to her death during a particularly adrenaline pumping chase sequence, I almost feel like I'm going to actually die.This whole package is wrapped up in a fantastically optimized piece of software. I own a low end machine, and the framerate ranges from dreamlike to slightly choppy, but it never becomes unplayable or difficult to control, even on an entry level laptop. And I can only imagine what it must be like to play on a higher end piece of hardware.The way the game works with a controller is, while unconventional, very smooth and well put together, but the keyboard and mouse is where it's at with this title. I'll spare the details, but all I can say is that you don't know good control until you've touched a DICE game.Another largely refreshing aspect is the gunplay. Traditional aim assisting mechanics have been foregone for a greater sense of realism. It not only feels refreshing to have gunplay be more skill based than about getting your crosshairs relatively near the target, but it also provides an incentive for you to drop your weapons periodically. With no reloads or tons of ammo, and most weapons weighing you down from sprinting or doing the parkour moves this game is great for, it provides the player a reason to not just lug around a big weapon all the time.The game's biggest drawback however is the production value. It certainly did get a solid budget being a AAA release, but some... interesting design decisions were made in lieu of a larger budget. The Flash animated cutscenes are some of the best Flash animations I've seen in a LONG time, but they feel somewhat out of place with the rest of the game's style. Not to mention the clunkiness behind grabbing your opponents' gun could really be worked on. Last but not least, the game was short for what it was. The campaign is only a few hours long, and with no multiplayer to pad it out(unless you like time trials) and a lack of mod support, you'll be left hungry for more. And even with how few levels there are, some of them are fairly boring, such as generic boat, generic high security building, and not to mention, generic subway station. However, all of these are refreshed a bit with the art style being so fantastic, but at the end of the day I would've liked to see more creative ventures like you in The Shard or New Eden Mall.No matter the production value, however, this game is well worth the $20 price, and an absolute must have if you ever see it on sale. You probably wont need to worry too much about if your computer can run it decently, so long as you have at least a 2.6 GhZ CPU(counting cores) and a half decent graphics card. Mirror's Edge is an experience that I think everyone should have.			"

												Mirror's Edge has a really short but nonetheless very enjoyable singleplayer campaign. It takes roughly 5 hours to complete. The story set for the campaign is decent- but that shouldn't deter you from buying the game. The main selling point of this game is the parkour. The parkour is very enjoyable, you will get to do many stunts and it will feel quite satisfying. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop, ziplining, walljumping and even using weapons (even though it is quite mediocre).There aren't many cons to this game, overall it is a decent game but there isn't much to do other than the campaign, and that being quite short- leaves you at a quench for more. I'd recommend this game, but do yourself a favor and buy it during a sale.			"

The only bad part is the combat, which they will hopefully fix in the sequel. There really isn't anything wrong with the game besides the combat, and the fact that it is unlike most other first person experiences. Five years later, the game is still way worth the money.

												I bought this game a couple day ago and finished it today. This is the first game in my entire library that I have finished. The free running in this game is simply superb, the run feels natural and the wall running for the most part is great. The graphics and art design are astounding accompanied with an awesome soundtrack which matches the intense parts with fast paced music and the calm parts with slow calm music. But the one major flaw in the game is the combat as many other fans will tell you. Now the idea of having to take other people's guns and having to work your way up the guns from a pistol to a submachine gun to a  shot gun and so on, theoretically would provide a nice idea. However the combat in this game does not please or deliver in those ideas, as the combat feels unbalanced, weirdly designed in both controls and gun handling as well as the power of weapons and enemies. However, for the most part you can avoid combat situations, but eventually you reach a point where repeatedly trying to steal a weapon through a quicktime event (as stealing guns from behind is a very rare occurence as the guards usually know where you are and immediately start shooting) becomes your only option. However the good very much overpowers the bad the story is intriguing but not too overbearing and if the gameplay doesn't meet you're tastes with great free running, the aesthetic design sure will.

												An amazing game! The first person perspective redone in a fully immersive experience. Sure, at certain points you can disarm and use guard weapons against them, but that isn't the focus of the game. It's about running, jumping, and using parkour style techniques to work your way past guards and through obsticles. Hearing the character breathing, hearing and even FEELING the damage done by messed up jumps, and the camera's movements according to the character has literally left me on the edge of my seat more than once. If you enjoy platform games, enjoy a action packed game, enjoy a parkour-style game, I highly recommend Mirror's Edge. And if you enjoyed this game already be sure to keep on the lookout for a Mirror's Edge 2, I've heard that there's one in the making!			"

												Freedom.That's pretty much what this game made me feel. The platforming and running mechanics amazingly portrayed what parkour is all about. And the game gives off a definite feeling of speed and momentum as you navigate the few levels the base game has to offer. And that feeling is emphasized even further by the vibrant and colorful environments. The premise is neat but how they told the story and the characterization could have been done better. That's kinda disappointing since the player character, Faith, is pretty much a badass.Only thing though is don't buy it on Steam. Buy the game on Origin, EA's own client, because for some absurd reason the great Time Trials DLC is not for sale here on Steam. The DLC is worth it because it's just pure running and none of the atrocious combat is present.			"

												In this game, your objective is to run, climb, jump, etc to reach the end of the level. It's pretty much a parkour simulator with guns and combat sprinkled in here and there for a bit of variety.The combat system is alright, but I just wish it flowed better into and from the parkour because stopping to fight or disarm an enemy slows the game down a lot.The story isn't that good, but for your first playthrough I still reccommend watching the cutscenes just to understand whats going on in the game.The game is organised into chapters, all of which are fun and at no point in the game did I ever say ""Oh no, here comes THAT part"".This is one of the few first person games I've played where I actually feel like I'm controlling a real person, instead of a floating head who can shoot guns. This comes from the fact that movement is fluid and responsive, and if you look down you can actually see your character's body.The main character who you play as, Faith, is a woman, but doesn't come across as the ""STONG, INDEPENDENT, DON'T NEED NO MAN"" type. This is a good thing thing because I despise feminazis and SJWs.A lot of the problems with this game seem to be fixed with the sequel releasing next year, which I am eagerly awaiting because this is one of my favourite games I've ever played.Go buy it, it's dirt cheap.

It's a game where you have to parkour over objects and obstacles to reach your point of destination, occasionally fighting enemies with melee and firearms.

												Parkour, cyberpunk, high-octane adventure/action thriller with a female hero protagonist.Pros* Sexy asian female heroine, lead protagonist provides a distinction to just about every other game out there since Tomb Raider which I found refreshing and captivating.* Visuals are excellent, and could have been even better if my system would have handled it.* Storyline was simple but easy to follow and still captivating.* Simple and straight forward, it's main tenant is one or two things and it doesn't try to pretend to be anything more.* Has been made to work in VR, which I am very excited to try.* Really liked that it had combat strewn in there as well. I began to really look forward to weapon encounters just so I could steal the weapon and shoot every one up - kinda breaks up the rhythm of the game.* Exhillarating, fun, almost-realistic, inspires a rush of adrenaline and fear.* Breathtaking and awe-inspiring cityscape views.* Beautifully animated cutscenes.* It was really fun, and the combination of parkour, gun battles, fighting and chases was enthralling.* Cinematic quality gameplay that really flowed from one scene to the next, creating a sense of urgency - really well done!Cons* The wall-running and other parkour techniques that are fundamental to the game are not explored thoroughly enough in the tutorial, which can lead to frustrations later on in the game and slowed it down, when the challenges become more difficult.* Extremely laggy on an 2xGPU ATI gfx card with PhysX turned on (in particular the scenes where lots of glass breaks) - had to disable PhysX - then it ran excellent.* Storyline may be a little too simplistic for some. Could have used a few extra twists perhaps, but I was satisfied just the way it was, but could definitely have been a little longer.* Some of the city detail could have been a little richer (cars, trees, animations, pedestrians, etc).* Recognising it was an experience focusing around jumping around buildings and parkour, I would have enjoyed a little more combative / weapon encounters.* There is one particular part of the game when the parkour and 'movement sequence puzzle' became a little overwhelming, but not enough to not want to see it through (though I could've done with about half as much).* No stealth. I mean this is a Pro as well, as the game is not designed to be ""Thief"" - I feel that every other game should have develoepd the parkour elements of Mirror's Edge to this degree and not the other way around. But since it is already such a simple game, adding stealth would have enriched the game dynamics further somewhat. I can't help but feel that it was designed to be a 100% parkour game, but then at some point someone made a decision to chuck in some weapons, and left the storyline/gameplay with regards to weapons under-developed, whilst the parkour elements over-developed. I mean I could have done with a 100% parkour game, but if you added the weapons element, why not extend it a little further.ConclusionI really, really enjoyed this game! My biggest gripes are that I wish it were a little longer and that they explained the wallrunning and other parkour techniques a little better at the beginning. I managed to get to almost the end before realising ""OK this is going to HAVE to be a wall run!"" and finally googled how to do it, though it would have made the rest of the game just that much easier (in the sense of time wasted) if I had known how to do it correctly from the beginning.Also, in relation to making the game longer, it seems that if the devs had invested as much time as they did *SPOILER ALERT* with that huge empty atrium, and instead filled a few more carparks or construction yards with a bunch of baddies with guns in a fashion that allowed a combination of parkour, gun battles, chases and fighting - the replayability of this would be enormous. I'd still be playing it instead of writing this review :) With just a little more encounters that combine your parkour and stay under cover, steal weapons, fight, chase all rolled into the same scene, it would have stretched the hours playtime considerably as well as increasing replayability.I will be definitely playing it again, and will definitely play and look forward to a sequel. It was awesome!			"

												Mirror's Edge is a freerun shoot/punch game,pro's:-It runs smooth and feels like it is well optimised.-It looks fresh and the colors really pop out.-The freerun gameplay feels great.-Great replay value, in fact I would say the more times you play and the better you get at it, the more fun it becomes.-Falling to your death makes your face muscles active xD.-Great for speedrunning challanges-Most of the time it's clear which routes you can take and keeps the speed in sprinting and jumping aroundcons:-Combat is megh, against pistol cops the combat is kinda fun, but after mid game the enemies are just annoying to deal with, it takes the speed out of the game and hand to hand combat is just clumsy as balls.-Boss battle like things are awfull-Story doesn't grab me at all.. in fact I played through it 3 times before getting it on steam and I still only remember half of it.-Sometimes the game is quite unclear about where to go, and you're running around in the same room untill you get bored, grab a guide and go like: ""jebus could've made it a bit more obvious"".Conclusion:The pro's far outweigh the cons and if you like first person fast paced free run games then this is a must have.

												 If you are tired of the usual genres and gameplay styles and want something new give this a go.  Yes, parkour is sooooo 2005, but it's really well done here: it's fast, fluid, and fun with just the right balance in player control required to keep the game from turning into ether a cumbersome and overcomplicated mess or an over simplified and tedious push-a-button-and-mindlessly-jump-from-roof-to-roof ""Assassain's Creed"" type experience.  The storyline isn't all that great (although it's kind of refreshing in its ""run from the bad guys!"" simplicity), but the graphics are still awesome 4 years later and the art design has a nice ""Run Lola Run"" meets ""Blade Runner"" aesthetic to it.    The game can get a bit too ""trial and error"" at times, but it's so short (I completed the entire thing in 4 hours my first time through) and it looks and plays so well that it really doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's the perfect game to get on sale for 5 dollars and waste an evening or so with.			"

Parkour, action, stunning art/graphics design, amazing sountrack!Problems: None worth mentioning. Game runs very smoothley.Story: Story was pretty simple but good enough to keep you motivated. Well written dialoge and characters. Overall nice story but nothing groundbreaking.Mechanics: First person parkour works great when running around but some manouvers like rolling can get a bit dizzy, but you get used to it. Nice focus on parkour and disarming opponents rather than kill them.Playtime/replayability: Playtime around 5-7 hours to get through the story mode depending on how good you are and if you look for the hidden collectibles. You can race/time trial levels so if you're into that kind of thing expect more playtime.			"

												This game is a great example of a game where the controls/options/mechanics don't have to be super in depth for it to be extremely enjoyable.  Once you get down movement of the game (which can take a while), speeding through areas, flying over sky scrapers, and dodging police can give you an adrenaline rush at some times.  Movement is nice and fluid, and the soundtrack is amazing.  It's not that expensive of a game either, so I'd say it is definitely worth picking up.

												A race for time, or a waste of time?Mirror's Edge takes something that many of us wish we were fit enough to do, and makes it into a core gameplay mechanic for anyone to enjoy. Is it fun? Yes! Absolutely! But it's not as groundbreaking as some hoped it would be (someone like me :P).It's a good game with some designer flaws, none of which, however, deter from the experience. Allow me to elaborate.In this game you play as a runner named Faith (how quaint) who runs into a, well, let's call it a ""political disagreement"" with the local PD, giving her (and you) an excuse jump off walls, off buildings, off TRAINS! Basically there is a lot of stuff to jump off of. And on, as well, as you are given the ability to beat the crap out of your enemies using said running and jumping abilities. This is very a smooth combat system, and very entertaining to do, as using your momentum to drive your punches and kicks like a projectile leaves you with an awesome feeling. The game seems to suffer from some kind of split personality disorder, though, as it can't tell if it wants to be a freerunning racing game, or another stylish EA shooter (meh). There are several points in the game where the only way to progress is to pick up a gun and blast/snipe your way through. Luckily there are only a few parts like these. The game markets itself as something unique and different that the current FPS generation would enjoy, however if you ignore running aspect and focus on what else the game is offering you basically have a linear campaign with several elements taken from games such as Half-Life 1+2 and portal, such as having to analyze your surroundings and cleverly use them to your advantage (another would be crawling through the air vents). This doesn't necessarily make this a bad game, just don't expect it to be ground breaking. I thought I was going to have an experience similar to Prince of Persia, but really it was far from it. It's a game of speed and momentum, where you are trying to get from point A to point B in the smoothest and quickest way possible, whereas Prince is about using special climbing techniques to solve puzzles that take up entire rooms.The graphics are great, and the massive city truely looks amazing. The Unreal 3 engine really shines in this game. I just wish we could actually go into the city and explore it more. Instead you are guided through a linear path, probably because that way it could tell the story, however unrelatable it was. It's clear that they worked hard on the story, but it's just so convoluted that I found myself paying less and less attention to it as I went along. The gameplay keeps you more engaged than the story, which is ok.I personally liked it, and found myself coming back to the time trials to kill some time. Without a doubt this game had much more potential, and with the fact that they had to revise the story several times, it kinda shows. But for a new IP with an experimental play style it seemed to present itself quite well. I would recommend this game to people who want to kill a weekend with some high velocity scissor kicks and clever outside-the-box speed run levels.			"

												Mirror's edge is the funnest game I have ever played, It had a ok storyline and the graphics are alright as well. It was a great game at the time, now when you look back at it, it still looks the same as some of the games made today. Or in 2010, when i first saw mirror's edge i was exited to buy the game and play it, back then, i have never seen a fast-paced parkour related game like mirrors edge before. And when i played it i had fun. Onto details about the game!The game is a Action packed Fast-paced parkour game, and i mean really fast. You gotta make shure you time things right sometimes, and one small slip may mean your death. but all in all, when you get used to the game it is great, and it is very fun. It's like Pouring Oxy-Clean Detergent on your laundry.I haven't seen much of the community of the game, Mirror's edge is kind of dead, but is still a fun game. There are no mods for it. But if you get back to it in a few months you will want to play it again. I heard that they are working on a mirror's edge 2, but i think they cancelled progress on it, i think they started working on it on 2012, i haven't heard much about mirror's edge or mirror's edge 2 scince then, just a bunch of call of duty and stuff like that. You know, the usual video game commercials.Mirror's edge is a Dead game that i think is lost and probably hasn't been touched by people in a while. (no pun intended) But someone somewhere in the world probably looks at it and plays it again for old time's sack. It is a great game and i reccomend it highly.			"

The mechanic of building up momentum is very well integrated into gameplay. I also liked the shift away from shooting and combat, relying more on evasion to get past enemies, as facing them head on is pretty much suicidal. If I had one complaint it's that navigating can be a little bit confusing at times because it's not always clear where you need to go.

The parkour mechanics were excellent, they actually felt as if I was doing those acrobatic manouvres, and I'll tell you I only clenched my buttocks 30+ times.

												You need to play this game. It mixes interesting new gameplay (the running, jumping, sliding mechanic) with an interesting enough storyline and slick visuals. It's something as uncommon as a game set in a dystopian future where the environment is not a part of the «dystopian feel». There are bright and shining prime colours everywhere, which clashes with the rather dystopian storyline, yet it pulls it off brilliantly. The gameplay mechanic is pure fun, and something distinctly different. I first finished the game on PS3, and have re-bought it on PC - it's that good. Highly recommended.			"

												Mirror's Edge is a gorgeous and unappreciated freerunning game. It has an art style that really struggles to be beaten for something that was made in the Unreal 3 Engine. This is probably due to the fact that DICE developed their own lighting system for the game. The vibrant colours and cleancut city really made the game stand out in an era of brown and grey ""realism"".The freerunning itself is often let down by clunky controls and ""that was crap, I pressed that"" moments, but if you get it right and can make the freerunning flow it really does make the game and you can get a lot out of the time trial missions.The gunplay is pretty much non-existant and I would highly recommend a no guns playthrough in order to really get the runner feeling.

Because there are no other FP Parkour games out there (that the public no of)!This is the first in the series so people could think it's flawed in multiple places... wrong... well sortaThe only downside to this game is the lack of free-roam mode which will be coming back in Mirror's Edge Catalyst!(2nd ME)The story links in well with the gameplay even if the cartoon animation do look slightly out of place!No big specs needed just a decent monitor. (for added fun get an Oculus Rift)			"

												I enjoyed the time I had with Mirrors Edge. While it manages to pull of a beautifully fluent free running and combat system that tie greatly into the world, it does have its host of problems.The first thing I saw in Mirror's Edge was the controls. At first, I was hard on the idea that these controls sucked, and that they needed alot of tweaking. However, I learned quickly the game had a curve to it, and got passed the controls. When I finally got good at basic movements, I became absorbed in the world. The towering skyscrapers, colorful rooftops as well as the very dark secrets that were hid in this utopian masquerade. Cool right? Yes. However, it is really hard for me to appreciate the mythos of the game beyond its scenery, and beautiful scoring. This was because the story was god awful. Riddled with messy , sloppy, cheezy, and otherwise worthless dialouge, there was no way I was going to give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the sister to sister relationship in the story. And to put the icing on the cake, I was utterly displeased with the ending. You will know when you get there. Completely disregarding the story, the freerunning in the game was spectacular. With many ways to run on rooftops and build up momentum, I was very much envigorated when I pulled off the perfect string of moves. The blur on the sides of the screen when momentum building is a very amazing feeling. Then came the combat. For reasons I can not understand, people hated the combat in the game. And I agree and disagree at the same time. While pulling off ninja moves on a guard was fitting for the missons, the gunplay was stale. This could have easily been avoided by making weapons more sleek and getting rid of the heavy guns. It really brought me out of all the agility in the game when I lugging around a huge ♥♥♥ M249. So for Mirrors Edge 2, please keep the gunplay; but make it exciting! Make me feel like a badass when I finally get the gun out of the guards hands and run away from the firefight.There is also one other problem in the game, and that was the Runner's Vision. While artisticly this was cool, I felt as a game mechanic I did not like this. However, this really comes down to personal preference. I personally thought Runner's Vision held my hand throughout the game, highlighting where I should go next. Being chased from rooftop to rooftop by guards is not very fun when you know exactly where to go - I want to have to think fast to move to my objective! This mechanic can only be turned off on the hardest difficulty too, which is a shame. However, this is totally up to you on what you want out of Mirror's Edge. To conclude, Mirrors Edge is a great game. Free running is a wonderful time, and stringing together the perfect combo is simply rewarding as hell. The combat, while it can be vastly improved, is a good concept. And Runner's Vision is totally up to personal prefrence. The world is spectacular too, really putting a ""POW"" into the scenery with all its spectacular and vibrant color, while appropiatley contrasting the darkness that lies within the utopian universe. I really wish I could care more for the politics in this game, but the story is just too boring and dull for me to care! Characters are generic and unexciting, not to mention the cutscenes look like an All State commercial. But overall, this game is a gem, and the parkour is hands down the best I have ever been able to experience.			"

												Mirrors edge is a very small, short lived game, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a first-person view. The emphasis is on the parkour type movement rather than shooting, and you only get a gun for a minute at a time as you snatch one from a guard or officer, throwing it away in order to be mobile again. This game looks stunning and is worth the price just for the free-running challenge mode.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played, in terms of innovation.Positive:- Unique parcoursystem in first-person.- Good and very characteristic graphics- Unique concept that doesn't focus on combat or sneaking.I didn't really experience this is as negative, but it could be improved upon:- Combat system: it takes a little while to figure out. Once you get the hang of it it's actually very rewarding, but I suggest watching some youtube video's, because you get virtually no instructions for it.- The concept of the story is okay, but while you're playing you never get the feeling that you're part of something bigger. You're pretty much on your own for the entire game while you're supposed to be part of 'the runners'.Should I buy and play this game?Yes! The game, although not without its flaws, is something I had never played before. I found it very rewarding to master and I have found my self replaying it and trying out all the speedruns.			"

												Mirror's Edge is an extremely enjoyable game that provides great freedom to the player in regards to speed.This game is a first person game where you are able to run as fast as you can to get to point A to point B. And it does not disappoint in doing so. You can climb over many obstacles, gaining momentum as you zip through your mission. Speed matters in this game, and Mirror's Edge does a good job at bringing parkouring to life. You can jump to buildings, climb on pipes, wall run across billboards, and sprint your way to the goal. There is so much you can do in regards to running and the adrenaline you get from it is amazing. There are not a lot of games out there that solely focus on freerunning (InMomentum and the Assassin's Creed series only come to mind to me) but this game harbors a great experience. The story is neat, and you can enjoy some time trials to beat your old times or top others. There are some puzzles in the game that you have to go through, but it's what makes the runner experience just as fun.There are some issues that I would like to point out. The story is short. I was disappointed when the game had ended to early, and would like it if they added more to the mix. The combat system could have been improved as well. In some instances in the game you would resort to killing your enemies via gun or hand-to-hand combat. The gun mechanics are okay but lack the ability to aim down the sight (but that shouldn't matter since this isn't an first person shooter). The close quarters combat is really clunky with only one animation to combo some punches and a kick to knock your enemy down. Fighting in this game wasn't really satisfying, but it didn't ruin the experience for me. I had more fun sprinting freely through obstacles than punching guys who sometimes are not worth fighting.I hightly recommend this to those who love freerunning and a fast paced adventure game. Mirror's Edge brings up a nice take to a type of game that has not been touched upon in a while.			"

I really enjoyed playing this, it took me roughly two weeks of here and there playing, I don't think I would go through and collect all the collectables, but I would definitly recommend this game to a friend who wants a challange. I coach parkour in real life so I found this to be more related to myself as well as giving me plently of neat ideas at what to do out there in the real world, minus being chased by swat teams. The neat thing about this game is there isn't just one way to play it, I noticed as I was going along there are different routes you can take if you are skilled enough with your keyboard to make those jumps or wall runs. While doing some of those jumps, it has moments where you feel the fear of heights shiver up your spine. This is the only game where I noticed my head moving with the characters head, and I say my neck is rather sore now! I look forward to playing the second Mirrors Edge soon!			"

												This game is amazing!This is the only game I've played that's all about parkour, and I love it.Amazing graphics, amazing gameplay.There's only a few things I don't like, including the fact that the combat system is a bit wonky. I wish the combat system was better, instead of just MOUSE1 spam, you would kick, dodge, light punch, hard punch, throw, et cetera. That would be awesome.The other thing I don't like is that you can't change video settings in-game, yet the option is there.PhysX is also enabled by default, which causes a lot of lag, but that's no major issue.I got this game while it was -78% off. I could not have gotten a better deal than that.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics! I love the simplistic art style.+ Fantastic parkour elements of gameplay!+ Good story.+ Amazing voice acting!Cons:- Wonky combat system.- PhysX is enabled by default.- No third person mode. (You can activate a glitchy third person mode by changing some fancy settings, but you can only look a certain way. It would be nice if they implemented a third person mode into the game which you could choose from - either first person or third person. Still, I love the first person, and I most likely would not use third person anyway, but it would have been nice. A toggle-able third person would've been nice at long jumps, et cetera.)- You cannot change video (graphics) settings while playing the game, which is weird.- Cutscenes share this weird comic book art style for some reason. I don't hate it, but I don't like it very much either.For a game from 2009, this game is overwhelmingly fantastic.I really wish they'd make a sequel.			"

												First person running game. The world is cool and the way they use white with whatever other color in buildings really stands out. The combat involves countering a guy with a gun and then shooting everyone else with said gun for the most part. The hint system that points you in the direction of the next way point is not that helpful. Moving through vents and swinging on pipes is slow. The cops that chase you are the least of your worries cause you fall and die a lot trying to jump on pipes but the checkpoints load quick so it is not too bad. The gun play is not good. Summary: Running on rooftops is fun but the other stuff not so much. A good 4hr game to knockout out in one day and it is cheap.      4/5 stars "

												This game has beautiful visuals and music...but honestly not worth any more than 5-10 bucks. However it is most definitely one of the most unique games I've ever played and it still gives you a rush. You actually feel like you're doing the parkour and combat and there is no other game like this out on the market making it a unique experience. I recommend getting this really cheap because it's very short and there really isn't any story to it. All you know throughout the game is that you are a Runner and you excel at parkour and athleticism, the police are corrupt and you need to save your sister from danger. You barely get to know the characters other than Faith herself. The ending was very abrupt and disappointing but despite all that it is a good game to have. 8/10			"

												Needless to say, this is one of the greatest games ever made. It's a first person parkour game. I would leave it at that but that wouldn't be very helpful. As a free runner myself I can say this is the best free running engine I have seen in a game. Whereas games like Assassins' Creed feel too floaty and Sleeping Dogs feels too clunky, this really feels as if I'm the one doing it. The physics seem very accurate to doing the real thing, if ever so slightly floaty at points but compared to some of the engines I have played with, it's superior by far. The story is nothing special but the game makes up for that through game play mechanics and stunning visuals. It has been a long time since I completed the game but it's still very enjoyable to go back and improve your ""flow"". Would I recommend this game? Yes, if you want something original and enjoyable gaming wise, this will satisfy your want.			"

												After a long break, I finailly finished this game by switching the difficulty from normal to easy (I'm not a great player).  I really like this first person runner style, where the empahsis is moving through the levels rather than fighting opponents.  There is some combat, but at least sometimes I think you can avoid it.  I enjoyed the way you move through the city (when I wasn't falling and dying), which can give some cool views, and the story that tied things together was interesting.  There's some replay value, too, since the game includes story, race, and time trial modes.  More automatic save points in the game would have been nice, because sometimes I'd lose progress when I stopped playing.  Some parts got repetitive as I tried over and over to pass them, but that's kind of the nature of games like this.  It wasn't too frustrating (on easy) though, since after I while I could learn the general patterns and improve how I played through those parts.  Overall, I thought this was a good game, enjoyable to play, so if it sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend getting it and giving it a try.			"

												This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			"

												This game is amazing, no doubt about it. EA and DICE used clever mind tricks into making it seem like a really beautiful game by simply over simplifying everything but still having it look super sy-fy. The story isnt really all that great but the gameplay is awesome. Its such a crazy feeling running and stunting all over the roofs of ""the city."" I especially liked how this game actually encouraged avoiding violance. Violance will usually end in you getting shot in the face unless youre really quick and can disarm enemies. It is such a satifying game. Buy this game. It is amazing.(if in the second mission the game lags out like crazy when the glass get shot, if you have an AMD graphics card or any non- Nvidia card just turn of ""physics"" in the options menu and it should be fixed. if you have an Nvidia card then look it up on the fourums. i have no idea how that works but i know its different.)

												Oh my god. I love this game and I hate it. The structure is sections of really, really satisfying first-person parkour broken up by awful sections where you'll die to a bunch of dudes with guns over and over. I don't know if I've ever played a game with such a huge gap between my best and worst experiences: at its best, its levels are designed like puzzles you need to solve with the handful of techniques you're taught (for better or worse) at the start of the game. At its worst, you're thrown into a big room with a bunch of boxes and heavily-armed guys, and given no sense of where to go or whether to fight. (Pressing the Alt key is supposed to direct your view toward your goal, but that's not always the case.)The joy of running, the visual design, and the world-building are all good enough, in my opinion, to still make this a game worth playing. I just wish I could give an unqualified recommendation.			"

Time for Parkour!This is a good parkour game that has a lot of action and an interesting enough story to make you want to keep playing. The controls take a little bit to get used to however the tutorial is adequate enough so that you have a decent feel for the game before you make the leap to fighting enemies at the same time. With that being said the combat is challenging at times and doesnt feel clunky, and the techno music the accompanies the game is fitting. However it should be mentioned that the game is fairly short for a single-player game, with the main story being approximately 6 hours long. Although it is short, this game is very cheap to buy on the steam sales and other sites, so it is definitely going to be worth the money shoudl you buy it at a discounted price :)			"

												I've heard about ME years ago. After finishing the whole story line, I have to say that this is quite a great game, in my own opinion.As a parkour game, ME is totally focused on the element of PARKOURing. Unlike Assassin's Creed, which has a far longer story line, ME is totally about parkouring. The heroine, also known as Faith, runs around on the roofs and inside buildings in order to rescue her sister. Although the story line seems a little short for me, it is still a good game to play.

												Mirror's Edge. Painfully tedious at times, too heavily reliant on guns, unimpressive combat.And yet, the best parkour game out there, probably. (Until ME: Catalyst comes out.)Worth buying if you like these kinds of games.Parkour was not a theme commonly used in games until recently. So when Mirror's Edge came out no doubt people would have been excited. And as a person that enjoys Titanfall, I think it's got the best first-person mobility on the market. (ME, not Titanfall, great game though it is.)But the fluidity came at a cost. I can't help but feel DICE tried too hard to make it part-FPS. The combat breaks the smooth free feel of the game, unless you just run away. They're fixing this in Catalyst, making the combat more parkour-based, which is only good news. So, that's another box ticked for fans of the game.One of ME's best qualities was that, in theory, most chapters could be beaten in one fluid run, without stopping. And it does a good job of replicating the adrenaline-filled leaps of faith that comes with rooftop running.And you can't help but admire the art style of the city. It's a beautiful landscape of white and red that can hardly be put into words. It has to be experienced.Except that you're kind of trapped in small areas in the levels. But, again, DICE is adressing this and giving Catalyst the open world that the original desperately needed.To summmarise:Good parkourBad mostly everything else, but that doesn't matterEasy on the eyes - very easyNeeds open world and better fighting (both happening, thanks DICE)Buy this if you can't be bothered to climb a building and jump off roofs yourself.I would have made this review humourous, but I just couldn't think of any jokes. Sorry, folks.			"

The blend of First-Person view with the acrobatics of a Third-Person action game creates an unforgetable experince. The combat system makes you feel like your in a acutal fist fight and DICE's shooting experince comes close to that of the Battlefield series. (the only drawback is that there is not aiming down the sight) The story completes the game entirely as it's mystey, intrigue, and deception add for an exciting action thriller.

The story is one that video games tend to not bother with, but that in itself allows it to give you a unique cast of characters who feel real in a world that feels all too realistic.  In the gameplay you run around and do stunts in an attempt to get to the next designated location.  The problem is that more times than not, you know exactly what you should be doing and you did the right inputs for it, but the game oftentimes arbitrarily decides that you die this time, and have to try again.  Still, pick this one up during a sale and play it through, it's worth it for the story.			"

												Mirrors Edge's negatives blurred the fun concepts. The game's music, and cut scene animation was near perfection, being both unique and beautiful. However the level design, (some cases) voice acting, and gameplay was the epitome of a repetitiveness. I felt as if i was playing the same level over and over again, until the story finally threw it's self together during every cutscene. By far the worst problem was repetition, and this was will hopefully be improved in the sequel.			"

												The City. A marvel of modern technology and science. Skyscrapers rise into the air everywhere.While it is a beautiful sight, the City can be a dangerous place for some individuals.In Mirrors Edge, you take the role of a Runner called Faith who's sister has been framed of a murder that she didn't commit, and you are being chased by the police, also known as 'Blues' by the Runners.Mirrors Edge lets you preform wall-runs. death-defying leaps across buildings and vaults over objects. The graphics for Mirrors Edge are magnificient. Sometimes I just wanted to be able to stop and just soak it all in. While the game has a very basic art style - mostly white and red with the occasional blue, orange or green - this tends to help the player focus on intense moments of action. The hud is not cluttered at all, as it only comprises of a small dot in the middle of screen, which is used for aiming weapons.Mirrors Edge doesn't focus on combat and instead focuses on movement throughout the enviroment, which is why I would extremely recommend that you play this. 9/10			"

												At best Mirror's Edge is fast paced and brilliantly exciting. Leaping across buildings, sliding and rolling through a beatifully stylised city, the parkour can be fast and fluid with a real sense of freedom. Dodging bullets and racing through buildings, disarming guards and finding quiet moments by sneaking through air vents is all great fun. For odd bursts of thirty seconds or so, this game is brilliant.Then you find a jump which is just too pixel-perfect and takes thirty tries to get right, or the slightly awkward combat and inconsistent level design keeps getting you killed, or despite the hint system it simply isn't obvious where to go next or how. As well as being frustrating in themselves, these events break up the pace of the game and take the shine off the best parts.If it were consistent, this would be one of the best games ever made. As it is, it is a variable experience which is superb in parts and well worth playing overall.			"

												While I wouldn't go so far as to say this game is obscure, it certainly deserves more attention than it has received. I've never played anything quite like it. In fact, I'd like to say that Mirror's Edge is the best first-person parkour game I've ever played, but it's also the only first-person parkour game I've ever played. You know what? To hell with it. Mirror's Edge is the best first-person yada yada I've ever played, there you go. This game is something special and the experience of playing it, in spite of a few noteworthy imperfections, is awesome.The story takes place in a large sterile looking city where The Man has established a typical sort of Orwellian society with all the usual tropes therein. Granted, this is only really explained to you through flash animation-esque cutscenes, and never really explicitly shown. There are police here, like anywhere else, and you do have to avoid and occasionally fight them, but other than that, the air of oppression that they speak of is never really conveyed through the gameplay. All I see here is a society where the cops just really don't like you running around on the roof. The plot revolves around a conspiracy and, like many conspiracies, certain details don't really add up. Expecting a tight cohesive story out of this game is probably not something you should do.You play as Faith, a professional courier who conveys senstive items and information about the city via the art of parkour, flipping and jumping about far above the streets where the ubiquitous eye of big brother is ever watchful. Faith is an alright character. All those people who think video games are sexist might actually be okay with her. She's resourceful and athletic and determined and she also has normal sized cans, so women with average proportions don't have to be jealou- I mean, outraged at what a bunch of pigs the men who made this game are. She's also Asian, so if you're a creme colored frat boy with a weird fetish where you want to control a woman of the orient and make her do your chores and bear your children, this game is for you. I actually knew a guy in college who was like that. He constantly tried to make his American-born Vietnamese girlfriend come over and do his laundry. That relationship didn't last long. And no, he wasn't me. But I digress. Faith never does any of that, really. She's more of a sprint-up-the-wall-and-occasionally-murder-a-police-officer kind of chick.As far as the parkour in this game is concerned, the gameplay is fluid, intuitive, and uniquely excellent in its execution. The runners of the game, ""runner"" being the name prescribed to those of Faith's ilk, often expound upon the virtues of ""flow,"" which I guess is sort of like the Force for these guys. It's the essence of what keeps their ninja mojo a goin'. This game actually has that: flow. Once you get over a moderately steep learning curve, you really develop a sort of intuitive feel for how to play this game well. It's pretty cool. The only downside is you might also start to feel a little ashamed of sitting in front of a computer for hours, pretending to be an extremely athletic person by pressing a series of buttons.What is a little lacking in Mirror's Edge is it's combat system. This is usually easy to forgive as combat is something best avoided 95% of the time. You are a runner, after all. However, you do have to engage in hand to hand combat and wield a gun occasionally. For lack of a better term/brain, the best way I can describe combat here is as ""woogity,"" or maybe ""rickety."" You could even say its a little ""finicky,"" or perhaps ""mercurial."" I guess what I'm trying to say is it feels pretty unnatural and inconsistant. It's basically the exact opposite of, well, everything else involved in playing this game. But that's okay, it's more or less functional and there's a good chance if you've decided to get into a gun fight, you should actually be running away anyway.One more thing, the atmosphere in Mirror's Edge is pretty cool. The people who made this thing did a whole lot with not very much as far as graphics are concerned. It's got a sort of over exposed, white washed, ultra clean sort of style, with lots of post modern angles and a stark ultilitarian urban sensibility or something. I should also add that the music is, like, real chill, bra. I mean, its nice, I really do like it. Sort of a nice mellow electronic thing going on there.Alright, so anyway, clearly I have too much time on my hands and IGN needs to hire me. Play this game, you won't regret it. You'll be hoping the sequel actually happens.			"

												This is a game that gets me really excited for the sequel because it was both a really fun game, and it could have been so much more. Sometimes the combat was frustrating and rarely did the freerunning aspect of the game feel clunky, but overall, kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of these guys in this BEAUTIFUL environment was very enjoyable. It's another unique take on what a first person puzzle game should be. The artsy cutscenes told a good story along with the commentary from Merc, ending the game in kind of a cliffhanger.Overall, the story could have been a bit longer, they could work out a few kinks in the combat system, they could allow for a bit more freedom in each level, but all in all it's a solid 8/10.I really hope the sequel is what AC2 was to the original Assassin's Creed.

												Mirror's Edge is a properly done 3d Sonic in disguise.If you are stopping to fight enemies, you did something wrong. In fact, if you are slowing down at all, you did something wrong.Much like in Sonic, speed is earned in Mirror's Edge. It's the reward for doing well. Are the levels linear? Yes. Does that make them bad? No. Does that make it so that there are no options? Heck no. If you play time trial mode, you'll quickly discover that you did the levels in the story mode all wrong- you were taking the wrong paths, timing your jumps badly, or otherwise screwing up.The occasional platforming puzzle can sometimes be frustrating, but if you're looking for a game about dodging gunfire as you wallrun, power-slide, vault, and just flat-out RUN, you've found the right title.Now hurry up with the damn sequel, DICE.

The structure is sections of really, really satisfying first-person parkour broken up by awful sections where you'll die to a bunch of dudes with guns over and over. I don't know if I've ever played a game with such a huge gap between my best and worst experiences: at its best, its levels are designed like puzzles you need to solve with the handful of techniques you're taught (for better or worse) at the start of the game. At its worst, you're thrown into a big room with a bunch of boxes and heavily-armed guys, and given no sense of where to go or whether to fight. (Pressing the Alt key is supposed to direct your view toward your goal, but that's not always the case.)The joy of running, the visual design, and the world-building are all good enough, in my opinion, to still make this a game worth playing. I just wish I could give an unqualified recommendation.			"

												8/10: Mirror's Edge is a very cool game. I thought I'd better try it out since Mirror's Edge 2 will be coming out, and I'm sure glad I did. Mirror's Edge offers a really unique and entertaining form of gameplay with its free-running mechanics and a beautiful world with vibrant colors to enjoy them in. The story isn't amazing, but it works well with the gameplay. The gunplay/combat is pretty poor (though you can pull off a pretty sweet dropkick), and I wish you had the option of simply avoiding fighting altogether, so you could focus on the aspect of the game that really shines: its core mechanics. Running, jumping, and navigating the city feels extremely satisfying, and the game presents you with many exciting environments to test your parkour skills. The chase scenes in particular can be quite exhilarating. There are some moments of frustration and minor annoying details, but overall the free-running system is done very well. There is also definitely some good replay value as there are time trials, and the main story could easily be enjoyed for multiple playthroughs. I will definitely be looking forward to the sequel.

You take the place of Faith, an overly serious woman, whose lack of voice expression indicates that she couldn't care less about the fate of this city whose colour scheme fails to widen to more than five colours, all of which are garishly bright and do not include brown.

												This game is amazing!This is the only game I've played that's all about parkour, and I love it.Amazing graphics, amazing gameplay.There's only a few things I don't like, including the fact that the combat system is a bit wonky. I wish the combat system was better, instead of just MOUSE1 spam, you would kick, dodge, light punch, hard punch, throw, et cetera. That would be awesome.The other thing I don't like is that you can't change video settings in-game, yet the option is there.PhysX is also enabled by default, which causes a lot of lag, but that's no major issue.I got this game while it was -78% off. I could not have gotten a better deal than that.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics! I love the simplistic art style.+ Fantastic parkour elements of gameplay!+ Good story.+ Amazing voice acting!Cons:- Wonky combat system.- PhysX is enabled by default.- No third person mode. (You can activate a glitchy third person mode by changing some fancy settings, but you can only look a certain way. It would be nice if they implemented a third person mode into the game which you could choose from - either first person or third person. Still, I love the first person, and I most likely would not use third person anyway, but it would have been nice. A toggle-able third person would've been nice at long jumps, et cetera.)- You cannot change video (graphics) settings while playing the game, which is weird.- Cutscenes share this weird comic book art style for some reason. I don't hate it, but I don't like it very much either.For a game from 2009, this game is overwhelmingly fantastic.I really wish they'd make a sequel.			"

												A unique game, with stunning visuals.  Set in a world that is blurred between utopian and dystopian with a story that unravels from an unknown beginning, this game sets a focus on speed and agility rather than your typical guns ablazing FPS.  This game will keep you interested as your jumping across rooftops and dodging fire from patrolling police helicopters and also have you cursing as you misjudge that jump to the next building only to realise at the last second, that you're just not going to make it!

												Amazing game. The world feels very vast and open on the rooftops and the first person freerunning is very smooth. The mechanic of building up momentum is very well integrated into gameplay. I also liked the shift away from shooting and combat, relying more on evasion to get past enemies, as facing them head on is pretty much suicidal. If I had one complaint it's that navigating can be a little bit confusing at times because it's not always clear where you need to go. Otherwise, this game is stunning in it's world design and gameplay.			"

												As im reading the reviews on here, im noticing alot of graphical difficulties. This I personally solved by turning off the physics portion in the options. For some reason the bullet particles cause lag. I can recommend this game as a precursor to Catalyst, but only because i finished it. Parkour is so so ie Dying Light makes this look like a bad joke. Combat is horrid but passible IF you can remember to jump kick and steal their guns long enough to shoot them dead. Reason why i think its a mediocre undone mess is that towards the end of the game you are required to jump jump jump up a tower of construction peices while bouncing off walls, and without precision aiming its nearly impossible to execute. Is the game fun, of course. Is is worth buying, on sale yes. Is it worth more than one playthrough, depends on your level of patience with crap mechanics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat. Story is fairly simple with a few twists. The graphics style of anime story is kinda lame, but its just the format, doesnt depreciate the game. Something wouldve made this game excellent regardless of the crap mechanics is free running, but all you get is time trials which only unlock after beating the levels ie you rerun what you beat in the game. There is no circuit of path you can go like some the of newer fps that basically let you run around the map in practice mode: this i hear is dealt wth in Catalyst by becoming open world. Also mentioning graphics: Turning off Physics, Post Processing and Anti Aliasing should fix the lag fps. Over all, this game is clearly 5/10. I recommend this game on sale ONLY as a practice for Catalyst.HOPEULLY THE DEVS FIX THINGS FOR THE NEW ONE			"

												Just the artistic visuals of this game alone is enough to sell it, however, you mix in a game play style not dedicated to combat an more to moving seamlessly an quickly around the map parkour style, you've got a hit. This surprisinglywas developed by DICE/EA games, before they murder my affection with BF3 and BF4.  Can't wait for a sequel and am praying that they will stick to the general non combat game play and amazing visuals.			"

												Great game. It has its moments of frustration from game mechanics not working, but then you realize you're doing it wrong anyway. I really enjoyed playing this, it took me roughly two weeks of here and there playing, I don't think I would go through and collect all the collectables, but I would definitly recommend this game to a friend who wants a challange. I coach parkour in real life so I found this to be more related to myself as well as giving me plently of neat ideas at what to do out there in the real world, minus being chased by swat teams. The neat thing about this game is there isn't just one way to play it, I noticed as I was going along there are different routes you can take if you are skilled enough with your keyboard to make those jumps or wall runs. While doing some of those jumps, it has moments where you feel the fear of heights shiver up your spine. This is the only game where I noticed my head moving with the characters head, and I say my neck is rather sore now! I look forward to playing the second Mirrors Edge soon!			"

												Despite already owning a copy for the Xbox 360, I do not regret purchasing this game on Steam as well. As it would turn out, when DICE isn't busy in an uphill battle with Call of Duty, they have the ability to churn out works of art like this one.The storyline of this game is one that I met with a resounding 'eh'. Despite having a brilliant setup with many different directions to go in, it goes for the more subtle route based on what the main character, Faith finds most important. I wont spoil it too much, but I will say that your character, in this game at least isn't going to be playing the great big hero. But also not an antihero. Her job of transporting sensitive information as discreetly as possible is iffy at best, but at her core she clearly cares about others, even more than herself. I'd like to see Mirror's Edge 2 explore the more story driven aspect, but Mirrors' Edge's story is just alright.But everything else about this game feels like gold. Between the beautiful visuals which shine through even on lower end hardware, the amazing(if occasionally redundant) musical score, and the phoenominal gameplay, you not only get a stunning experience, but a deeply emotional one, too, and not in terms of a storyline. When I hop in an elevator and rapidly click the up button while bullet holes spur up in the door after being chased by 20 cops, I let out the same breath of fresh air Faith does. And when Faith takes a plunge to her death during a particularly adrenaline pumping chase sequence, I almost feel like I'm going to actually die.This whole package is wrapped up in a fantastically optimized piece of software. I own a low end machine, and the framerate ranges from dreamlike to slightly choppy, but it never becomes unplayable or difficult to control, even on an entry level laptop. And I can only imagine what it must be like to play on a higher end piece of hardware.The way the game works with a controller is, while unconventional, very smooth and well put together, but the keyboard and mouse is where it's at with this title. I'll spare the details, but all I can say is that you don't know good control until you've touched a DICE game.Another largely refreshing aspect is the gunplay. Traditional aim assisting mechanics have been foregone for a greater sense of realism. It not only feels refreshing to have gunplay be more skill based than about getting your crosshairs relatively near the target, but it also provides an incentive for you to drop your weapons periodically. With no reloads or tons of ammo, and most weapons weighing you down from sprinting or doing the parkour moves this game is great for, it provides the player a reason to not just lug around a big weapon all the time.The game's biggest drawback however is the production value. It certainly did get a solid budget being a AAA release, but some... interesting design decisions were made in lieu of a larger budget. The Flash animated cutscenes are some of the best Flash animations I've seen in a LONG time, but they feel somewhat out of place with the rest of the game's style. Not to mention the clunkiness behind grabbing your opponents' gun could really be worked on. Last but not least, the game was short for what it was. The campaign is only a few hours long, and with no multiplayer to pad it out(unless you like time trials) and a lack of mod support, you'll be left hungry for more. And even with how few levels there are, some of them are fairly boring, such as generic boat, generic high security building, and not to mention, generic subway station. However, all of these are refreshed a bit with the art style being so fantastic, but at the end of the day I would've liked to see more creative ventures like you in The Shard or New Eden Mall.No matter the production value, however, this game is well worth the $20 price, and an absolute must have if you ever see it on sale. You probably wont need to worry too much about if your computer can run it decently, so long as you have at least a 2.6 GhZ CPU(counting cores) and a half decent graphics card. Mirror's Edge is an experience that I think everyone should have.			"

												tl;dr: Absolutely stunning and vibrant visuals, a masterfully performed soundtrack, unique, heart-pumping gameplay that tests your spatial awareness skills and encourages you to run the levels as smoothly as possible, and a lifelike world. It is a bit short however (my playthrough took 4 hours). All in all, Mirror's Edge is most definitely worth your money. Buy it now.Mirror's Edge, developed by DICE (makers of the Battlefield series), released in 2008, is a first person running game. You play as Faith Connors, a Runner in a futuristic unnamed city in which the government monitors all forms of communication. Runners were established to send messages without the government knowing about it. The plot revolves around Faith's sister being framed for a murder she didn't commit, and Faith unraveling the web of truth, forgive my simplistic metaphor. There are 9 chapters in the game, each one separated by an animated cutscene. Mirror's Edge, however, is not praised for it's intricate story. The component that shines is the unique gameplay. Despite being developed by the makers of the Battlefield series, combat is far from the focus of this game. The main objective is to traverse from point A to point B via rooftops, air vents, hallways, whatever stands in Faith's way. All of this is done on foot. Occasionally, the police force (referred to as ""Blues"" by the characters) show up to try and kill Faith. The Blues are dangerous, and should not be confronted head-on. The main strategy of survival is avoiding enemies and escaping them. Faith is not a fighter, she's a runner. Her only weapons are the environment around her and her limbs. A neat mechanic that greatly enhances the experience of Mirror's Edge is ""Runner Vision"". What this does is highlight possible pathways through the level, making it easy for the player to focus on the immersive world and parkour experience. Certain objects such as ramps, ziplines, and doors are highlighted to guide the player along. If the player is stuck and does not know where to go, pressing a key (or B on an Xbox 360 controller) will snap the camera to the direction of the objective. While Mirror's Edge is a fantastic experience, it is lacking in the length department. I completed the main story in under 5 hours, and that was with countless deaths and moments of ""What the hell am I supposed to do here?"". The game makes up for it by including a separate ""speed run"" mode for each level, and additional time trials. Overall, Mirror's Edge is a fulfilling and satisfying experience that delivers on all levels. The visuals are vibrant and memorable, the soundtrack adds the perfect amounts of ambience and tension, the plot is interesting enough, and the gameplay keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend playing this at least once in your gaming career.			"

												I bought this game a couple day ago and finished it today. This is the first game in my entire library that I have finished. The free running in this game is simply superb, the run feels natural and the wall running for the most part is great. The graphics and art design are astounding accompanied with an awesome soundtrack which matches the intense parts with fast paced music and the calm parts with slow calm music. But the one major flaw in the game is the combat as many other fans will tell you. Now the idea of having to take other people's guns and having to work your way up the guns from a pistol to a submachine gun to a  shot gun and so on, theoretically would provide a nice idea. However the combat in this game does not please or deliver in those ideas, as the combat feels unbalanced, weirdly designed in both controls and gun handling as well as the power of weapons and enemies. However, for the most part you can avoid combat situations, but eventually you reach a point where repeatedly trying to steal a weapon through a quicktime event (as stealing guns from behind is a very rare occurence as the guards usually know where you are and immediately start shooting) becomes your only option. However the good very much overpowers the bad the story is intriguing but not too overbearing and if the gameplay doesn't meet you're tastes with great free running, the aesthetic design sure will.

												Mirror's Edge. Fast-paced action game all about momentum and using three buttons to do a million things. The game is set in a dystopian and overly uniform city of towering skyscrapers, and the plot revolves around the murder of a close friend of the main character's family. The game is essentially get to Point A to Point B, without dying, as fast as you can. Combat is rather awkward and there isn't much of a way to learn moves except trial and error, which can prove to be extremely irratating. Graphics reflect the dystopian world in solid, vivid colors, and keep the puzzles simpler as different key objects can be easily separated by the distinct colors. Voice acting is tolerable, but not especially impressive. As previously mentioned, momentum is imperative in performinfg many of the game's not-so-realistic moves, but oddly is often lost in solving some of the intermediately difficult puzzles. Overall, I would recommend this game.Graphics: simple yet uniquely beautiful. Gameplay: engaging, smooth and straightforward, although some moves are difficult to figure out. Story: not exactly gripping, but good enough for a parkour game.I would give it a confident 8/10 review.			"

Nice focus on parkour and disarming opponents rather than kill them.Playtime/replayability: Playtime around 5-7 hours to get through the story mode depending on how good you are and if you look for the hidden collectibles.

												Mirror's Edge™ is visually beautiful, and makes you feel as you are really inside the character's body. The body awareness is something never seen in a game and sadly it wasn't seen again in other games. After playing this game, I don't understand how developers can still make refrigerator box based games, when it's totally possible to make something like this. Or at least look down and see your feet, climb a ladder and feel like you are actually climbing, jump over a fence and feel like it, and so on.As for the story, it is short but excellent in every way, and the gameplay is basically parkour through the city and ocassional gunfights.
