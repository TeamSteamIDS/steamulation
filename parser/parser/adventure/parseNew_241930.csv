												Shadow of Mordor is an excellent third person action game that takes the best parts of the Batman Arkham games, places it in Mordor, throws in a little (of the best of) Assassin's Creed and some outstanding voice work and out comes an excellent game. Here's the tl;dr Pros/Cons:Pros+ Looks great. Sounds great. + Exceptionally optimized. Don't be fearful of the requirements. I came across no bugs whatsoever.+ Takes one of the best combat systems in recent gaming history and applies it to a world that it really excels in. Combat animations are brutal (in a good way). Sneaking up on orcs and/or mauling a large pack of orcs is fun throughout the entire game. Some awesome ""orc death"" animations. The sight of an orc head flying away never gets old.+ Strong story in a world that is teeming with stories.+ A TON of stuff to do.  Sidequests, hunting, collectibles, challenge modes. Nemesis system essentially creates a neverending enemy hierarchy.+ Encourages further reading of Tolkien.+ Stealth is fun and easy to get the hang of.+ Fun with Carigors! When you hear an orc say ""It's a carigor!"" Climb up high, and have fun siccing them on orcs.Cons- Story can be finished quickly unless you take your time.- An absolute fart of a final boss fight. Total copout in terms of design.- A smattering of quicktime events that are annoying and take you out of the immersion.- Some forgettable supporting characters. Lack of Middle Earth races represented. Mostly just men and orcs.- Respawning of enemies in areas cleared prior happen almost immediately and is another immersion killer.- Game map (there are two sections, one opens later in the game) seems small for a game that is a 35 gigabyte download.- A bit easy. Lack of a choice of skill level hurts replayability.I'm writing this review shortly after completing the story. According to Steam, I have 20.3 hours invested into it. I did not do everything there is to do and I imagine had I taken more time I could easily have gotten 50 hours into it. However, I found myself into the story and enjoyed the missions a lot, so I kept at it especially after gaining one particular ability. I won't spoil it, but it starts with a ""B"" and you get it roughly 60-70% of the way into the story and can totally change how you approach any skirmish in the game, big or small. Needless to say ""B"" is awesome and plays a key role in the lead up to the final confrontations. I am on the fence as to returning to the game to finish the plethora of side missions and I am probably going to wait until story DLC before I do so. Without going into too much detail of the story, the game is one that grabs you immediately. Put simply, the Shadow of Mordor is a story of revenge and the opening is done so exceptionally well that I was immediately engaged and wanting to destroy orcs within minutes of taking control of the main character, Talion. While the game does a decent job of keeping this interest, I do feel there were some shortcuts taken in almost every respect. The story is not immediately predictable, but does run into some typical cliches that may have been unavoidable.  The big bad guys that are your true ""targets"" (they're not orcs) are more fearful in terms of their look than their bite once you fight them.One of the most remarkable aspects of the game is what's being termed as ""the nemesis system"". What this means is that when you are defeated in battle, the orc that defeats you grows in power, remembers you, and you are encouraged to seek him out to exact your revenge. There is almost a neverending limit to orcs that get promoted, so as you kill one,  another will take his place in the power hierarchy in essence creating a constant power struggle amongst the orcs of Mordor. They will even fight themselves, plot against one another, and you can essentially push this one way or another by the choices you make. Unfortunately, this system does not have an effect on the story and could almost be considered a meta game as the story missions are mostly unaffected by this system until nearer the end. Despite this, the nemesis system is one that I imagine will be copied and perfected by other games. I am already imagining something like this in a game of political intrigue, or with a terrorist mastermind who becomes stronger via the choices you make. This is an excellent mechanic that deserves to be explored more fully. QuickTip: Focus on Ranger abilities first. They are integral to strengthening Talion.Most of the enemies in this game are run of the mill orcs. Some are stronger than others (i.e. Captains) and require some aspect of a mission (kill X number of guys a certain way) before they appear.  It is very Arkham-esque in certain respects as most of the foot soldiers are complete pushovers. That said, I found most of this game entirely too easy. The only times I felt truly challenged by my enemies was when they were completely overwhelming or I was stuck in a chokepoint unable to defend myself. You will die, but I guarantee you will feel ""cheated"" at times regarding your manner of death. The lack of a skill level selection hurts this game's replayability.QuickTip: Run a benchmark when you first launch the game and experiment with the settings from there. I was able to Ultra everything even if the benchmark put me at high on everything!All in all, I am extremely impressed by Shadow of Mordor. It's an engaging and fun third person action game in a familar world with great mechanics and some new ones that should be staples in future games. It's technologically sound, and while I felt extremely let down by the final boss ""fight"", the journey was worth it. I wanted Talion to succeed and that is half the battle in a game like this. When the player cares about the ""avatar"", you've got yourself a great starting point. If you are at all a fan of this world, you owe it yourself to play this game. Overall: 8/10			"

												The experience that stands out most for me was encountering an Orc named Zakadush The Warrior. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ showed up everywhere. He was also immensely terrifying. Not just because of his insane strength, but because of his personality. You see, Zakadush never spoke. He would only breathe heavily, giggle, and scream. There were many times I found myself with the upper hand in an intense combat situation, only to hear heavy breathing from behind -- and BAM -- Mr. Giggles (Zakadush) would ambush me, fling me around (literally), and beat me to a pulp. When I finally bested him during one of his many ambushes, I felt sweet relief and satisfaction. I was finally done with that psychopath.  NOPE.JPEG.  Zakadush somehow found his way back from beyond the grave and hunted me down again. This time, scars covered his face and gave him the look of an all-familiar clown villain from another series we're all familiar with. Mr. Giggles continued to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for the rest of my game. I finally threw him off a cliff about an hour ago. Since I didn't cut off his head, there's no way to know for sure if that's the last I'll see of him. I want to believe he's dead, but I've learned that this game is cruel. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor may be one of the most surprising games of the year. My expectations were hugely surpassed by this gem -- and a shiny gem at that, the game is gorgeous and smooth. The main storyline is alright. The overall plot is interesting, but it feels disconnected between missions and has odd pacing. You can tell it isn't the main focus of the game, which is fine as I spent all 32 some-odd hours crafting my own story.  The combat flows smoothly and is incredibly brutal. There is weight behind every sword swing, stab, leap, throw -- you see where I'm going, it feels good to control. The combat is heavily borrowed from the Batman: Arkham games, but I feel it adds its own flavor to it as well. The animations are amazing through and through and make the combat, movement, and just about everything else feel very immersive and smooth. The open world exploration is heavily reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed franchise and a bit of the Far Cry series. Movement feels good and climbing is nowhere near as clunky as it is in Assassin's Creed. Climbing isn't without its faults though, there are a few hang ups with the parkouring system, though they aren't big issues and are hardly worth commenting on. The stealth system is a nice mix between what is found in the Batman and Assassin's Creed games -- overall, there is a bit to be desired, but the mechanic is satisfying nonetheless. I have beaten my enemies and have been bested brutally many times. The game isn't a cakewalk and rewards quick-thinking as well as slow tactic. You can be easily overwhelmed if you're not careful and sometimes you can't bounce back. As you get used to the controls and systems at play, the game naturally gets a bit easier -- especially when leveling up. As a difficulty junkie, I was still experiencing death in the late game, though significantly less often.  Death is satisfying in Mordor -- it's the main way you build stories with your many enemies. The Orcs who slay you will grow in power, they'll taunt you the next time you meet, and they remember every meeting. They'll recall their defeats and your demise. You develop an enemy -- a nemesis. The system is dense. The nemesis system is probably one of the most dynamic, deep, and satisfying AI tech I've seen in quite awhile. The stories that unfold through the gameplay are amazing -- they're also unique, in that they're YOUR stories and experiences. The replay value is absurd. It's incredibly hard to stress just how great this game is, but it may be one of my all-time favorites now. The potential this game has met, and the systems it has introduced, are immense. I very much look forward to experiencing more of Middle-earth and I'm going to be playing in this world for quite some time.			"

One does not simply walk into Mordor. One hacks, slashes, stabs, shoots one's way into Mordor.On the look for Orc Hunter Sim? Look no further!Developer: MonolithProductions, IncPublisher: WB GamesRelease Date: 30th September, 2014Remember when Assassin’s Creed was first released? I bet you were just running around, climbing and jumping your way through the land and feeling free. You could do the missions whenever you want and you literally didn’t have a care. Those were good times.Do you also remember when the Batman Arkham Asylum was released? Boy we were all speechless. I mean the combat system was sweet. You really felt like the Dark Knight. Counter here, break a limb there … Sweet. Not to mention the Story. I never thought they could pull off such an impressive Game yet they did.But then again … while you liked both of those games individually you always thought they lack something … But you just couldn’t put your finger onto it.Ever wondered how awesome it would be to have the movement of Assassin’s Creed and the combat system plus a Story as good as from the Arkham Batman games in one game? Well me too buddy ... me too.Now sprinkle some blood and Orcs into it, take Mordor as your location et voilà you have your game which you’ve lusted for a long time … Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor!After I got you excited … Let’s get onto the review!In Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor you slip into the role of a Ranger of Gondor, by the name of Talion, who seeks Revenge after he witnessed how the Black Hand of Sauron killed his family in front of his eyes. After he watch helplessly how his family has been murdered, the Black Hand kills him as well though Talion survives thanks to his new Best Friend a wraith, an Elve. Thanks to his new BFF he now also has wraith-like abilities. That’s pretty much the Story, well as far as I’m going to spoil it.So what exactly does this mean wraith-like abilities?For starters you can jump from any height without breaking your legs and if that doesn’t sound cool enough, you can also interrogate Orcs. By interrogate I mean that your BFF will get you the information you need. MissionsWhile this is pretty much a free roam game you actually have to do something while you enjoy your man … I mean orcslaughter.I don’t want to get too much into the Missions since I feel it would spoil way too much of the Story but there are side missions involving a creature we all know from the Movies and Books and Missions including the Slaves.Personally I’d say that you just tackle the game anyway you want. You can start of with the story missions and do a side mission every once in a while or just focus on something. The decision is yours.CombatLove it or hate it but the combat is exactly the same as in the Arkham Batman games. That means you deal your blows while also focusing on enemies attacks so you can go ahead and counters those. Once you reach a certain hit combo you can go ahead and execute enemies so they stay down. Usually that means you see a head flying in the opposite direction of the falling torso. Always good for a giggle.Besides that you can also mount mighty Caragors, beasts which you have to dominate, basically you show them who’s the boss, and you can rush into battle with one of those.Caragors are way more agile than they look, meaning you can actually climb walls with one so you don’t have to demount every time one of those puny Orcs flees in fear at the sight of you and your beloved mount. The sight might remember someone at He-Man …. so that would explain why they flee.Anyway. Health is actually rather rare in this game. You gain health either by implanting runes in your weapons which grant you a bit of health every time you kill an Orc or you gather plants which replenish your health completely.Nemesis SystemSo here’s the beauty of Shadow of Mordor. The Nemesis System.That is one sweet feature let me tell you that. Basically, the Nemesis System tracks certain Uruks. Those are either Captains or War Chiefs pretty much the crème de la crème.So what exactly those this System do besides showing you who’s the most badass among Sauron’s Army? Well we all know that Orcs and Uruks are just mere brutes. Some more intelligent and some less.  Meaning they will fight and kill each other in order to climb up the ladder. So they get stronger with every battle they survive. Therefore becoming harder to kill for you.So killing those leaders rewards you with two things: You weaken Sauron’s Army and each time you chop of their heads you are rewarded with a rune.UpgradesSo your reward for every kill is a rune. You can use those runs to upgrade your Weapons. They drop different type of runes every time you kill them and the rune type, whether it’s a dagger, sword or bow rune, depends on how you killed the Leader.A rune gives you certain powers. One makes you immune to poison while another gives you +10 health every time you headshot one of those beautiful creatures.So you see hunting and killing those is actually a pretty sweet way to make yourself stronger while weakening your enemy.So runes aren’t the only way to gain more power. Completing missions and killing Orcs grant you experience and once you have enough you gain abilitiy points which you can use to gain certain abilities.Then there are also Mirian. To get Mirian which you need to upgrade your attributes like max health or the number of rune slots your weapon have you need to complete challenges.Challenges require you to either kill a specific amount of animals or gather some plants.So you see there is actually a lot of stuff to do in Mordor.Last wordsIf you enjoyed Assassin’s Creed and the Arkham Batman games you will love this game to death. There’s not much left to say. It’s just way too much fun for me. I mean I could run around for hours and just backstab, behead or just spook every Orc I see.I’d even go as far as to call it Orc Hunter Sim 2k14.			"

												First things first.Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor will NOT evade comparisions with Ubisoft's heavyweight Assassin's Creed games and even WB's own Batman Arkham series.After a fairly long 40hour hands-on with this game,I can say its one of the bests this year.While the game itself draws inspiration from a handful of popular games,Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor has not failed to create its own identity.[TL;DR Version,Down below] PRESENTATION:Starting from the protagonist(s),Talion certainly seems like a good fit for Tolkien's universe,with his stringy shoulder-length hair,his stoic manner,and his three-syllable moniker.The story bits and indentity of a particular ""wraith"" have been disclosed pre-release and I prefer not to discuss it here,a story that doesn’t make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars,but it’s brillantly-acted and paced!In any case,the Talion/wraith dichotomy leads to some Shadow of Mordor's slickest moments.The ghostly wraith slides out of Talion's body from time to time to talk with him and then dissipates in a vaporous sigh.When the wraith's anger becomes all-consuming,Talion's face melts away to reveal the apparition underneath.Mordor itself is an engaging open world with a vibrant and grim setting.The burnt orange-brown cliffs and pastures of Nurn are some of the best vistas you will appreciate.They say that the devil is in the details,but in Mordor,the devil is plain to see.It is in the details that you find the glimmers of light,even though you know that no happy ending is nigh.To sum the voice performance,Troy Baker and Alastair Duncan have done an exemplary job bringing Talion and the ""Wraith"" to life.GAMEPLAY:The reason this game stands apart from other adventure games is the Nemesis System,which works suprisingly well just as advertised!Think of it as a dynamic AI that puts you in epic encounters with orcs who have studied your behavior and will react accordingly,making each battle personal.If you flee from battling an enemy captain, you’ll hear about your cowardice the next time two of you tango.If you’re defeated by one,you’ll really get raked over the coals at a followup clash.Its a particularly phenomenal concept without which the game could be terribly boring.Mordor’s close combat involves great,gory decapitation and stabbing animations,and outside of the scripted story missions,there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas.What sets the feel of Mordor’s combat apart from the Batman games is that it’s really easy to get into trouble,especially early on.If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds,or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map,you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle.Picking out the shield bearers and berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when you’re completely surrounded and it goes downhill from there.[ONLY FOR TL;DR SPAMMERS]PROS:+Well-realised open world with great art style+Great characters complete with top-notch voice acting+Surprisingly challenging combat+Loads of references for Tolkien scholars.+Nemesis system+Storyline seems intriguing,BUT...CONS:-...the narrative just feels dull at times.-An utterly disappointing finale.VERDICT:If you've been burned by one of those big-budget massively hyped games that released recently,come to Mordor and you won't walk away disappointed.Sure,it isn't a perfect game by all means,it has its share of flaws but it's strengths overweighs those.A far better and impressive game than many would’ve imagined,not just in terms of its action and LotR authenticity – but in bringing a genuinely new idea to gaming.

												Having played for hours now, I've been extremely surprised by the quality of Shadow of Mordor.  Great story and characters, visuals, environments, etc.  What I really love is how much personality the developers lend to the actual Orcs, it's very unique in a game like this.  Highly recommended, I forsee Shadow of Mordor going on several top 10 / GOTY lists this year.

												Disclaimer: At this point, I have finished the main story and have dabbled into much of the sidequests.This review will be split into 4 parts and each will be rated out of 10, with a final average score at the end:-Story-Gameplay/Mechanics-Visuals-Sound[STORY]The story is full of cliches and tropes, such as but not limited to a badass ranger having his family killed in front of him, but survived and goes on a roaring rampage of revenge. Nothing new in particular, but I believe it can be excused by the fact that it was Tolkien who kickstarted much of these tropes and trends. The writing takes creative liberty of gutting the lore often. While it is a subjective as of what it does to the story, I believe that the bending and breaking of the lore (i.e. elves cannot be wraiths) works to the strength of the game, giving it a more interesting story. To sum it up, the story is a good story, yet lacking in originality. The worst part is probably how rushed it is towards the end, but nevertheless it is a memorable plot anyways.Conclusion: 7/10[GAMEPLAY]The gameplay can be viewed as something of a cross of Arkham games with a smidge of Assassin's Creed thrown into the mix. I personally view the criticism of it being an ""Assassin's Creed ripoff"" as invalid, largely because of the fact that the only thing that is a rip-off of AC is the free-running mechanic, which is smooth for the most part. It does have stealth kills, as does the AC franchise, but nowadays stealth kills/takedowns are so common in gaming that it can hardly be considered a rip-off, and even if it is, it is a very well done rip-off. It is also published by WB, so I don't believe it to be wrong to rip-off another game under the same producer. (Batman Arkham Asylum/City/Origins)The combat is much more challenging than either AC or Batman, in my opinion. While it is still relatively simple to completely obliterate orcs, there are usually huge numbers, especially in strongholds, and berserkers and shields make it quite difficult to just breeze through. While there are instant kills in the form of stealth kills and finishers, higher level captains/warchiefs are much more resistant and immune to this, making it a real challenge to figure out the weaknesses of certain uruks, meaning that it is challenging, but not unfair.This brings us to the nemesis system. It is very well designed and gets rid of a bit of the repetitiveness of the game. This system means that all the captains and warchiefs are unique. Some are strong, some are weak, and if one kicks your butt a few too many times he might even become your arch-nemesis, meaning that he will keep coming back! My personal nemesis was Ratlug the brave, who was immune to everything but explosions and ranged attacks, forcing my to turn him into a pincushion every time I face him. What's worse is he has the Ambush trait, meaning that he keeps showing up in the worst of situations, such as when I'm fighting another captain or warchief, or when I'm running for my life from a horde of ghuls, poisoned and heavily injured. I would not like to divulge much as it would spoil the game for you.The lack of bugs and glitches is also amazing. In my 15 hours of playtime, I have not run into a single bug and only one glitch one time, where I tried to drop assassinate a captain but was stuck frozen mid-air above the ground for a few seconds, before the game teleported me to the spot next to my target, who was unharmed.Conclusion: 8/10[VISUALS]I was unable to run this game in Ultra, as it requires an absurd amount of Video RAM (6 GB, holy moly!). However, the texture quality, while not ground breaking, is still rather decent most of the time with the occasional terribly textures, but nothing immersion killingThe cutscene quality is reasonably high, and weaves itself seamlessly into the in-game visuals. I believe a good amount of it is pre-rendered, but it is very hard to see the difference. Overall, the visuals are not hugely amazing, but it isn't too shabby either, and the landscape and map design in general is beautiful.Conclusion: 7/10[SOUND]I have had some audio cutoffs and stutters in cutscenes, but I believe that is most likely a framerate issue instead of a sound issue. The sound effects are top-notch, you can feel immersed with every single sword blow, arrow shot or explosion as you shoot a barrel full of putrid uruk grog, really making the gameplay feel very smooth or impactful when it needs to. The soundtrack is also quite a fine tune.The voice acting is flawless, as I can't find a single thing wrong with it. Every single line of dialogue was delievered with clarity and emotion, and the voice actors have done a very good job. From the protagonist and the antagonist, the supporting cast in the main quest to the idle musings of random uruk grunts or the complaints of the human slaves littered around Mordor, not a single line of dialogue struck me as strange or not well-delievered.Conclusion: 10/10[OVERALL]Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game. While it lacks a lot of originality, it makes up for it by using the right ideas from the right places and implementing them very well. While the story is nothing to write home about, the way it is delivered to the player through the visuals and the sounds makes it a memorable one, with a host of memorable supporting casts, especially a certain dwarf!The gameplay is smooth and it is very satisfying to hack at an uruk and send its limp body flying or to decapitate a warchief, but here lies the problem; the gameplay is good, but it is also repetitive. It means that you will most likely not get to do much else in this game but run to a place, kill some uruk, rinse and repeat. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable experience.[FINAL VERDICT: 9/10]			"

												I finished this game after about 33 hours of playing. Was that good fun? Yes, for sure, but it wasn't exactly what I expected.I started playing this because I thought it will be mix of RPG and action in open world of Middle Earth. And all of this is true besides one thing. RPG element is very, very small in that game, what was a problem for me on the beginning. But when I gave it some time, I realised that even without RPG, this is still really good game. Not so great as I expected, but really, really good.So action part is just great. There is probably best melee fighting I've ever seen. You can slay orcs and sometimes monsters in many spectacular ways. You won't be bored of slaying for hours, that's for sure. You will kill them in open sword battles vs. superior forces, you will stealth and kill them silently and you will shoot them using your deadly bow. All of this is perfect and you will be delighted of this.But to be honest there is not much more than fighting. Of course, you can collect herbs and some hidden items, but all of this is just irrelevant and not very engaging. In second part of the game you will be able to control orcs and other creatures, which is definitely great idea and it's implemented also very good. But besides this, there is nothing more. Don't expect any dialog options, any hard choices or things like that. If you're expecting this is RPG game, let's say it straight, it's not. It has little RPG elements like quests (filled with fight and stealth only) and character progression, but that's it. Nothing more.To be honest for me it's something like unfinished game. On the one hand, everything what is implemented here is perfect. But on the other hand all the time I had feeling that this should be something more, some epic RPG with great story and all that stuff. But somebody just forgot to implement this second part.VERDICT:If you expect good action game in open world and you want to slay few thousands of orcs, this is it! You will be delighted.But if you expect something more than action, I'm afraid this is not the game you're looking for.Like this review?

												Took me 24 hours to 100% the game. I'll be brief: the gameplay is pretty solid, fast-paced and brutal, the graphcs is top-class, nemesis system is innovation in game design and I totally fell in love with it, the plot is mature and the final scenes are just masterpiece with no happy-end and no final kiss. For me Shadow of Mordor is among BEST 3rd-person action games of all times. A solid 9/10 and I strongly recommend buying it. Keep up the good work, Monolith!			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Middle Earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Monolith Studions (known for such works as the F.E.A.R. and Condemned franchises) and published by Warner Bros. Interactive. The game's story takes place in Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' universe while gameplay takes inspiration from the Batman Arkham titles as well as some elements from the Assassin's Creed franchise, and at the same time, featuring an all new mechanic called the 'Nemesis System' where Uruks (Orcs) in the game world vie for promotion and domination by either fighting each other or killing the player.PLOT (No Spoiler):The player takes on the role of the Gondorian Ranger Talion who, after seeing his family murdered and he himself executed at the hands of the servants of Sauron, was given a second chance at life as an undead ranger by the wraith of an ancient elven lord named Celebrimbor. Together they seek revenge for their murdered families and at the same time, break the curse that binds them to the moral plain.PROS:+ Good graphics, animation quality, special effects and over-all art style+ The 'Nemesis System' is a novel concept that is both fun, and adds a lot of game time to the player's main campaign+ Great use of the 'Lord of the Rings' franchise and material+ Good character progression for both the player and the Uruk (Orc) Captains and Warchiefs+ Excellent voice acting and over-all sound design that adds to the atmosphere and immersion of the game+ Lengthy game time: I personally sunk 20+ hours on my first game not including the DLC+ Relatively large map with several side missions and collectibles+ Combat gameplay is fun and satisfying making good use of the Arkham/Assassin's Creed gameplay+ The Uruks (Orcs) have authentic personalities that adds to the atmosphere of the game+ Good quality story DLC: Although I personally think the Bright Lord DLC could have used more polishing it does have a way more entertaining and challanging final boss battle than the main game.CONS:- Orc Captains / Warchiefs level cap at 20 (25 if you're playing the Bright Lord DLC) which leads to...(see next CON)- Gameplay is not as challenging as I would have expected from an action-adventure game- Story bosses, specially the final boss, were unstatisfying to fight (Arkham Asylum Syndrome)- Added little to no improvement or change on the Arkham Style of fighting aside from the mind control mechanic- Story is a bit weak and some of the characters were not particularly memorableCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and I would like to see more of the franchise. Shadow of Mordor is a fun title and is a must buy for action-adventure fans regardless whether or not they are fans or non-fans of the LOTR universe.WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price so if you see it on a sale, then it's a no-brainer. The game does carry with it a slightly heavy system requirement to be fully enjoyed so be sure to check it out before you purchase.FINAL NOTES:It adopts a unique take on the 'Lord of the Rings' universe by opting for an action-adventure genre rather than an RPG style of gameplay and surprisingly enough, the said action-adventure genre works well with the game mechanics of this game. ----------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												I really enjoyed Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, it’s a well-adapted LoTR / Middle earth open world action game which combines both Batman and Assassin’s Creed gameplay and style in a nice way as combat and game progression are well implemented and fun. If you enjoyed those games, you are gonna like this one then.The story itself is strong enough, with some nice fan service (you will even find Gollum in it), but definitely one of the best features the game has is the Nemesis system, which is extremely good. Maybe at first you’ll think it’s nothing really special, but trust me, it is! and it works very well, the way orcs can remember the encounters you have and how they talk to you when they meet you again is really effective and credible and it’s going to arouse your emotions, especially when they kill you and grow in power because of that.You can get your revenge and also avenge people in your friend list if you want. Eventually you will have your own story of vengeance and confrontation.  The orcs have their own ranks of influence and power which are always changing not only based on your own actions, but on their own and oh boy! they are selfish and ambitious and will do everything, even betray their own, to gain more power.The Nemesis System is actually so good that I hope they implement more things like that in other games, it makes the game feel alive.As you play you will gather information about your enemies so you can always have the advantage (if you want) of knowing which their weaknesses are and even turn them against each other and have a lot of fun with your powers as they increase.There are other activities which are not part of the main quests and they can also be fun and challenging.Killing so many orcs can become a bit repetitive at some points, but you won’t get bored easily, the combat system is fun and intuitive and there are a lot of options to engage and kill your enemies, I’m sure you will find some very creative ways to get the job done. If you like the stealthy approach or the kick the door and kill them all style both are gonna work in different situations.You earn ability points that can be assigned the way you want and get runes that can be applied to your weapons to customize your gameplay even more.The graphics are really good and well optimized for PC specially with the HD textures (By the way, you don’t actually need the 6gb vram to run them, but the more you have, the better - obviously).Finally, I would recommend to play with a gamepad, it’s amazing!, the keyboard and mouse combo works , but it is just not as intuitive nor as comfortable. At the end Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game with a AAA production value, a precious one!En verdad disfruté La Tierra Media: sombras de Mordor, es una buena adaptación de mundo abierto del Señor de los Anillos y de la Tierra Media y el cual combina la jugabilidad y el estilo de Batman y de Assassin’s Creed de una manera adecuada ya que el combate y la progresión en el juego están bien implementados y son divertidos. Si disfrutaste de esos juegos, entonces este también te gustará.La historia en sí misma es buena, e incluye “fan service” (¡te encuentras con Gollum!), pero definitivamente una de las mejores características que el juego tiene para ofrecer es el sistema Némesis, el cual es extremadamente bueno. Tal vez al principio creas que que no es nada especial, pero creéme, ¡lo es! y funciona muy bien, la forma en la cual los orcos recuerdan los encuentros que han tenido contigo y como te hablan cuando te enfrentan nuevamente, es en verdad efectivo y creíble y va a hacer vibrar tus emociones, especialmente cuando te maten y crezcan en poder al hacerlo. Podrás vengarte y vengar gente en tu lista de amigos si lo deseas, eventualmente tendrás tu propia historia de venganza y confrontación.(Por cierto, mención especial al doblaje latino que esta excelente, encontrarás algunas voces conocidas como la de Humberto Vélez, si, Homero Simpson da vida a las voces de algunos orcos, puede incluso parecerte que en cualquier momento dirán algo así como: “¡morirás montaraz... D'oh!”, ja ja ja)Los orcos tienen sus propios rangos de influencia y poder los cuales cambian constantemente no solamente basándose en tus propias acciones, también en las de ellos, y vaya que son egoístas y ambiciosos y harán cualquier cosa, incluso traicionar a los suyos, con tal de obtener más y más poder.El sistema Némesis es de hecho tan bueno que espero implementen cosas como esta en otros juegos, ya que hacen que el juego se sienta vivo.A medida que avances obtendrás información sobre tus enemigos para así tener la ventaja (si lo deseas) de saber cuáles son sus debilidades e incluso enfrentarlos los unos a los otros y divertirte mucho con tus poderes conforme estos se incrementen.Hay otras actividades que no son parte de las misiones principales y que también pueden ser divertidas y desafiantes.Matar tantos orcos puede volverse repetitivo en algunas ocasiones, pero no te aburrirás con facilidad, el sistema de combate es divertido e intuitivo y hay muchas opciones para enfrentarte y matar a tus enemigos, estoy segura de que encontraras algunas formas bastante creativas para hacer tu trabajo. Si te gusta el enfoque sigiloso o el de patear la puerta y matarlos a todos, ambos estilos funcionarán en diferentes situaciones.Ganas puntos los cuales puedes asignar a tu gusto y obtendrás runas que puedes aplicar a tus armas para personalizar tu experiencia de juego aún más. Las gráficas son muy buenas y están bien optimizadas para PC, especialmente con las texturas HD (por cierto, no necesitas los 6gb de vram para correrlas, pero entre más tengas es  mejor, obviamente). Finalmente, recomiendo jugar con un control, ¡es incredible!, la combinación de teclado y mouse funciona, pero no es tan intuitiva ni tan cómoda.Al final La Tierra Media: sombras de Mordor  es un gran juego con una producción de AAA, ¡uno precioso!

Positives+ Excellent graphics+ Combat is fluid and extremely fun, with lots of options+ Open World+ Interesting story in the LotR environment+ Nemesis system is innovative and fun+ Stealth+ Very well optimized - I was worried about this, as my graphics card is at the very low end of the system requirements, but the game looked great and game play was extremely smoothNegatives:- A few of the side characters could have been fleshed out more- Melee combat is extremely fun, but I found ranged a bit underwhelming and difficult to use- While the combat is excellent, it gets a little repetitive after a while- Caragors are annoying!Overall:An extremely fun and enjoyable game.  This is my personal game of the year, and one of the best games I've played recently.  Highly recommended.Rating: 9/10 "

												Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor is an action packed RPG that has a bunch of lore and content from the loved lord of the ring and hobbit franchise . It is an absolutely awesome game with reasonably good storyline. The graphics are very next gen with a beautiful landscape that is full of detail, amazing lighting effects and interesting characters both new and old characters to the J.R.R. Tolkien's lore.   The combat is very similar to the Assassins creed franchise and even more to the Batman games. With swift, immersive gameplay that will make every kill feel beautiful but it can be quite challenging when you face more than a dozen enemies at once. With three different weapons, the Sword, Dagger, and Bow. There are plenty of ways to take out you enemies , going silent with a knife or bow or just rushing head long into a pack on Orcs. You can then use your wrath powers to stun enemies and unleash a fury of attacks, or shoot an arrow to teleport to your enemy and take him on one on one. The game takes place open world of Mordor, in which you are trying to kill off Orcs and their Captains to get to the top of the tree. Killing Captains will give you runes that you can put on your weapons and skill points which can be used to unlock exciting new skills. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings or Hobbit franchise and enjoyed the combat from the batman games, then you will love this game from the start to the end, therefore I highly recommend this game for you. Even if you aren't into the franchise of LOTR or The Hobbit, the game is still an amazing game with its appealing graphics, very fun combat and a smooth and beautiful open world.			"

												Orc Murder Simulator 2014 is a game that's centered around killing orcs. That's the vast majority of Orc Murder Simulator 2014, and pretty much everything revolves around the Murder of Orcs in this Simulator from 2014.Jokes aside, this game wound up being surprisingly good. The nemesis system, despite sounding like a gimmick, wound up being an extremely impressive, and occasionally downright personal, part of gameplay. I can tell vast tales of the clashes I've had with other orcs, the battles and attacks that I've suffered and caused, but that would take time away from the review.Let's just say it's a system that uses randomized orcs, gives them interesting characteristics and has the orcs give you lines depending on how you've interacted with them in the past, how you meet them in the present, and how they expect you in the future. I've had many orcs mock the sheer absurd number of times I've died. There was one who asked if my brains were scrambled, since, and I quote, ""Every time you've fought me, you've died!"" It's an incredibly deep and impressive system, and one I'd love to see in more games.Combat-wise, this game is essentially ArkhamAslysassin's Creed, but it does that well, too. The combat is responsive, the bouncing between orcs mid-fight feels incredibly good, the animations are top-notch in quality, and the brutality of the combat lends itself a kind of weight to the fights. It's all really smooth and fun.In terms of challenge, the game also requires the player not just rush in and fight. It's certainly possible, it's just not a very good idea, and the player WILL be overwhelmed if they don't retreat when he or she needs to. It necessitates proper planning, stealth and scouting. The player can look over the landscape, see if there's a more powerful orc in the midst, and make sure they finish their objective/grab their collectibles/do whatever without being terribly murdered. Actually, that's something else to discuss. When you die, the game doesn't just reset your progress. The orc that murdered you, if it's a grunt, will get promoted to a captain, and the side-missions will progress without you. It's a great way to give a price to death, and an even better way to have the orcs remember you when you die. Just makes me love the game that much more.The story is essentially ""Middle Fanfiction: Shadow of Headcanon"". It's not super-great. The voice-acting and production values are high, but I didn't care too much about Gruffy McGravellyvoice and his Elven Stand. I cared much more about Ratbag (Who was funny up until his face was rearranged) and Torvin, and the ending was kind of garbage. But in the end if you're playing this game for the written-story you're missing the point.On the technical side of things, I've experienced a few slowdowns but that's probably because my CPU is getting old and needs better cooling. It will set your game to some settings that are optimal for your machine, and I had zero problems running it at 60. There shouldn't be too many issues.Overall, the game is great. It plays great, it runs pretty damn well, and it has one of the most impressive mission-framing-mechanics I've witnessed. I want more games like this.			"

												Only just started, will be updating the review as i go along but so far this is an amazing game, the mechanics are easy to use, the graphics take my breath away and the voice syncing is superb which is something that seems really hard to accomplish for many other games+ Great Soundtrack+ Amazing Storyline (So far)+ Good Keyboard/Mouse Controls+ Great Voice acting and Voice SyncingSo Far rating is: 9.5/10Edit2: (spoilers ahead)Completed review below. Enjoy Shadow of Mordor puts you in the shoes of Talion, a former ranger of Gondor who watches his family murdered in an unexplained ritual before being murdered himself. Revived and bound to an amnesic ghost, Talion embarks on his quest for knowledge and vengeance.Shadow of Mordor takes elements from the Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham games along with a unique setting, excellent soundtrack, brutal combat, memorable characters and with a breathtaking story creates a game that pulls you in, and you cant pull yourself out until you finish it. Shadow of Mordor gameplay mechanics were well done, since i use a keyboard/ mouse setup that is all i can tell you. The controls on the keyboard was organised well, you easily switch between wiping out opponents without anyone knowing you were there, but if that isn't your way of doing things you can just as easily run up to an Uruk and kill him to his face. It really doesn't matter how you do it, taking Uruks out from above and below, poisoning grog, freeing caged beasts and exploding barrels seeding discord, becoming the unseen shadow that they fear. But if that isn't your style become the other half, the unstoppable ranger, that enters a fully manned Uruk fortress through the front gate, and leaves soon after covered in Uruk blood from head to toe with none left alive, becoming the clearly seen monster that they fear. In the eyes of Talion it doesn't matter, as long as no Uruk remains alive and you aspire ever closer to your vengeance.Now onto what makes Shadow of Mordor a real experience, the Nemesis System. A system that makes Sauron's army not a programmed force with its directives fully controlled from start to finish, but a real army filled with unique opposition each with their own strengths, fears, personalities and weaknesses. The system is shaped by your actions, making your experience unique,for every Uruk you kill another will take its place and each will have their own story. A particular Uruk i had problems with was Shaka the Sickly, i first met Shaka by decapitating him  and i thought that was the end of him, how wrong i was. Our second meeting was a surprise for he still had his head! so i decided to see if two times the charm, but it wasn't to be Shaka was prepared, the Nemesis system granted him an immunity to combat finishers and i was already very low health, so i died and Shaka became a Captain, becoming stronger and my revenge target. I encountered Shaka four more times throughout the earlier parts of Shadow of Mordor until i unlocked my new favourite ability, brand, the ability to control any Uruk and when i next encountered Shaka, head now covered in cloth that if i cant kill him lets make him my slave and then i took it a step further, for Shaka was the strongest Uruk around due to his multiple encounters with me and Shaka the captain became Shaka the war-chief. Shadow of Mordor is a game that makes your actions matter, if you choose to blitz though the campaign without considering the other aspects, you will enjoy the game but you will cheat yourself into missing out all of what Shadow of Mordor has to offer. I died three times in Shadow of Mordor and every time i did Saurons army changed from what it was promotions, treachery, feasts, recruitment, hunting, initiations, executions and more happened while i was gone. Shadow of Mordor was a game that the longer i played, the more i enjoyed it and it was done i felt a combination of satisfaction and sadness. Satisfaction because i saw the climax of what was one of the greatest games i have ever played,and sadness because the main campaign was over. But i didn't despair for long, for much was left to be done Uruks to kill, Catagors to ride, Graugs to kill, Artifacts to find, Challenges to be completed and weapons of legends to be made. Overall Rating 9/10 - An amazing game that cant wait for any DLC to be made.			"

												Monolith’s first adventure in Middle-earth, Guardians of Middle-earth, was less than stellar, but the developer has rediscovered its mojo. Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game, and it shows.You take the role of Talion, a Ranger that’s soon thrust into the harsh reality that Mordor and Sauron’s forces aren’t quite as dormant and broken as Gondor has been led to believe all these years. After witnessing the deaths of his son and wife, Talion himself is then slain...only to reawaken later to discover that he is for the most part immortal, and now bound to a particular Elven wraith. The opening moments of the game are, as you’d expect, a tutorial in the guise of introducing you to the Shadow of Mordor. We get a crash course in sneaking, basic combat and are then thrown into the open world of this pre-Lord of the Rings slice of Middle-Earth.The fairly basic set-up is elevated immensely by some superb performances. Talion’s mission for revenge never feels forced, and the slow revelation of his elven companion's identity and past is genuinely engaging. Even the addition of Gollum fits neatly within the narrative, and gives Shadow of Mordor a solid link to the film adaptations without forcing it and smacking players like they were a fish on a rock.Never before I have played an open world third-person action game that involved so much running away, but Shadow of Mordor is full of ‘tactical retreat’ moments you’ll be facing, otherwise you’ll just be whisked back up one of the few towers spread throughout the game world for fast travel. Combat itself is inspired by the close-up brawls and acrobatics from the likes of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series, and Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed. That’s not exactly a problem although Shadow of Mordor can at times become a little unwieldy with enough foes and obstacles surrounding you. Counters to enemy attacks are generally easy to do with a single button, but dodging can run into trouble and those sharp pikes hurt – a lot.As you keep slaying orcs and uruks in your travels you’ll be accumulating experience which you can eventually spend on new abilities, or some that unlock during specific story missions, so you can begin to see some unique flavours emerge. One of the Wraith abilities will let you use our bow to teleport to a target for instance, helping you get out of a tight spot. Then there’s always covering ground riding a Caragor, or even a mighty Rancor-like Gruag. Talion has multiple upgrade paths available to him. Not only can he upgrade his martial skills, and his ranged and stealth based wraith abilities, he also can modify each of three weapons with runes, which alter their effects when used. Coupled with unlockable skills and combat moves, Shadow of Mordor provides more depth in combat alone than practically any game on the market, and it's all in service of the wholesale slaughter of orcs.But where Shadow of Mordor really shines...is the Nemesis System. Enemies are for the most part a generic horde you’ll be swinging a blade through or firing an arrow at, but that’s where Monolith’s Nemesis system plays its part. Sure you’ll be wading through the grunts of Mordor but very quickly you’ll find yourself being introduced to the higher echelons of orc and uruk society. Captains aren’t your average grunt as they’re much tougher with greater strengths, and early on they’ll have some debilitating weaknesses to exploit like a crippling fear of being burned.Each of the captains – all the way to warchief – have their own name and ‘motivations’ to give a sense of what they’re thinking. The more interesting part about this system is how easily the deck can be reshuffled. As you start picking them off lesser uruks and orcs will rise to take their place. This means there’ll always be a command structure for Sauron’s army but it also provides an endless array of more challenging foes, as Monolith attempt to make them ‘unique’. It’s a façade to be sure as they end up spouting the same insults eventually, and the models are recycled with variations, but it’s a neat little trick that does try to keep things appearing fresh. To help the Nemesis feature more is the ‘memory’ these captains will have of previous encounters with Talion, so much so that they could be all bandaged up, their eyes turned milky white, or gloating you’ve yet to beat them at all and instead died by their hands many times. If you think it’s easy to take these guys out then you’ll be rudely awakened. Just because you're a Ranger doesn’t mean battles will be easy. As soon as those uruks start swarming around things get heated fast.In the latter half of the game things switch up as you no longer have to just slice and dice your way through the uruk hierarchy, but can instead brand them as puppets that’ll do your bidding. It’s definitely a welcome change of pace, tactics and fun than just butchering a load more generated captains. It allows for some pretty interesting power struggles as you effectively ‘gain control’ to a degree.Exploring the land of Mordor is where the game really shows its quality, and is highly recommended. Collectables, upgrades, side quests, weapon upgrade quests, artefacts, and hunting missions are littered throughout the world. They're a completionist's dream, adding more flavour and some interesting rewards.Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a strong foray into the Tolkien universe, backed up by popular combat from other major action series, with its own free-running style to boot. The Nemesis system does keep things a little fresh even if after a while it’s illusion of orc and uruk society does start to break down. The fact these captains are going about their business just as we are helps it feel more chaotic. It is without a doubt the best experience set in Middle-Earth, but also stacks up against any action fantasy adventure, whether with a cape and cowl or haystack diving.A Must Play "

If you like fighting hordes of enemies, and look cool while doing it, get this game for sure. No doubt. Although the story can be boring at times, it'll be compensated with a execution attacks, and the satisfaction of destorying a group of 50 orcs all by yourself.

												Best game I've played this year so far! It has a mix of combat between AC and Batman and it's gory as hell. The story, to the point I have played, seems pretty interesting and the orcs have great personality! The world is beautiful and it feels alive and very Middle-earthish. Well, SoM is an excellent game and I couldn't be happier with my pre-order! *Review Update:I took about 10 hours to complete the story mode with lots of side-quest and collectables unattended. The game lets you continue from where you stopped if you want to achieve 100%. I also began to do the Trials, and I have to say something... They're pretty hard! An amount of time is given and you have to face the captains and warchiefs in that time. The story of the game is well-paced and it gives you a good ending, suggesting a sequel (and gosh, I hope they make one!).Overall, I had an amazing experience with this game, and would definitely recommend to anyone!P.S. I met a warchief called Blob the Cooker. I throwed him in the fire and then he ran away. 2spicy4u, Cooker! 12/10 GotY			"

												This new installation of Assassin's Creed really brings a new atmosphere. Ezio has gone into witness protection and changed his name to Talion. As a measure of self defense, he trained with Batman to expand his knowledge of combat and martial arts. Occasionally throughout the game, Ezio does an assortment of drugs, causing him to think that he has wraith abilities, such as jumping from extremely high heights and not dying, which in reality, is because of the wagon full of hay that he falls into. Thankfully, we don't have any of the ""present day"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story that nobody really cares about, so the game does have some improvements on its predecessors.			"

About The Game:Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a open world action adventure  game set in a timeframe between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings storylines. The game is like Assasin's Creed mixed with Batman combat with the LOTR setting / story, and it turns out to be a great mix.If you are a fan of Middle Earth and like Assasin's Creed style games, this is a must have.Story:I can't comment much on this yet as I am only a couple hours into the game, but the story seems decent so far, and there are quite a bit of story missions and cut scenes to help move the story along. The main characters seem interesting, not boring and the dialogue is well written.Combat:The combat is like a mix between Assasin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games. There are three weapons: Sword, Dagger, and Bow.The bow is great for taking out enemies from a far and slow motion is enabled while using the bow to take time and aim.The sword is used for hacking and slashing enemies and is the primary weapon to use when you are fighting against large groups.Lastly, the dagger is used for stealth kills while sneaking up on enemies or leaping from the sky to take them out.There are other skills used in combat called ""Wraith powers"" which are unlocked as you play the game and gain experience points. Examples are: stun enemies and unleash a fury of attacks, blow up fire pits to destroy large groups of enemies, shoot an arrow to teleport to your enemy, and many more.Overall the combat is very fluid and fun to play, especially as you unlock more powers. It seems like it will get repetitive over time, but why hack and slash game doesn't?Open World:The game is an open world sandbox of Mordor in which you are running around trying to kill off Orcs and their Captains. There are story missions marked on the map that help progress you through the story, and side missions as well that you can do whenever you want. You can also just run around killing orcs and looking for captains to fight to increase your character's power.The game features the nemesis system which is a hiearchy of the Orcs' military essentially. You can gather intel from orcs to find more information about the captains and warchiefs in the world and find their locations. If you die in the game, you don't restart from a check point, instead the orc that kills you increases and power and moves up the ranks and will remember you next time you try to fight. Killing stronger captains rewards better rune drops which increase the power of your weapons.Overall:If you are a LOTR fan and like similar mechanics to the Assasin's Creed games, then I would highly recommend this game. It has decent graphics, very fun combat, and some great game mechanics that let it stand out from other open world action games.I would highly recommend purchasing this game if you enjoy open world action adventure games.How it Runs:Game is running on all High settings with High Textures at an average 60+ FPS (1920 X 1080 resolution).Benchmark: Max FPS: 250, Min FPS: 42, Average FPS: 65.Computer Specs:GPU: Geforce GTX 760CPU: Intel i5-3570K 3.40GHZMemory: 8.00 GB RAMResolution: 1920 x 1080, 60HzOS: Windows 7PSU: Corsair 750WNote: Game is running great so far and I am having a blast playing it. Will continue to update this review.			"

Middle-earth: Shadow of MordorI separated this review into few parts mentioning the most significant aspects which influenced the rating I gave this game.Ø CombatShadow of Mordor offers fighting system like Batman, not hard when you get used to it and when you get enough skill points it makes you invincible. Running around and fighting everything at once while drinking coffee as I heard is not exact, but it's close to it after overcoming first obstacles. Some players won't appretiate this, but I think for many as myself it's good enough so I don't see it as a minus for this game. + World The game also offers not large open world, but what I liked about it most, is that you can walk or climb to every imaginable part of it, and really exploit enviroment, for example hide before Uruks by hanging from a pier or roof. Also every part of the world, every place, has its history and every creature, person, even flower has some info you can discover and if you are interested to read about it. For example who is The Black hand of Sauron or what and where is Barad Nurn and much more about it. - Story The main storyline of the game is interesting, but short and not much complex. It's quick, few cutscenes and the game focuses mainly on your actions, which some players may appretiate. If you are fan of LOTR you might find it remarkable, but not deep enough.+ The Nemesis SystemThis is really unique and really perfectly made. Uruk leaders of Sauron's army must be the best warriors, so they fight to take the leadership. One uruk murders his superior and can get promoted on to his position, and this all is influenced by player. Every uruk leader has his own unique name, randomly generated visuals, rank (depends on how long he's in the system), strenghts and weaknesses (which can be revealed by interrogating another uruks), relations with other leaders (bodyguards) and fighting styles. All this is admirably made.+ Side missions10 rather challenging tasks for each of Talion's weapons (dagger, sword, bow) and 24 slave rescue missions are entertaining and alongside with collecting artefacts and pieces of The Lord of Light puzzle gives you points, which can be spent on improving weapons (by opening rune slots) and stats (hp, focus, arrows).  9/10 Overall I really enjoyed this game and I can say this game really deserves GOTY award.

												Despite its initial detractors, J. R. R. Tolkien's novel, The Lord of the Rings, is revered by many fans and is one of the best-selling novels of all time. It's an extraordinary story that has spawned three extraordinary movies, but managed only a few ordinary videogames. Until now.On the surface, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor owes a lot of its gameplay to the inspiration derived from the successful Batman: Arkham and Assassin's Creed series of games. Players are given an open world setting within Mordor to explore, and innumerable Orcs and Uruk-hai to battle, and it’s these battles that set Shadow of Mordor apart from its influences. The combat mechanism is a familiar combination of hit and counter, but with an added “last stand” mini-game that allows the character to parry a deathblow to remain in the fight. Winning the mini-game and surviving feels truly epic.What’s more, Mordor introduces a fascinating ""Nemesis"" system for players to contend with. Enemy combatants stand to gain promotion (and effectively level up) from defeating you,  or from the death of one of their rivals. If you flee from combat, which is a perfectly valid option when faced against a dozen enemies, you will also be taunted should you face the same foes again.While not perfect--dead Orcs should remain dead--it can be enthralling, especially as more abilities become available.Outside of the gameplay, there’s also something for the screenshot enthusiasts out there. The most recent update has added a Photo Mode, which is quite fun in and of itself with the options  available to tweak shots. Check out the Community Hub for some great examples of the shots being produced from within the game.It seems like the gaming industry has turned a corner with respect to licensed products. The Batman series is exceptional, and from what I understand, there’s even an Alien  game that’s actually very good. And now, at long last, we’ve got the one Lord of the RIngs game to rule them all.			"

Best LoTR game so farShadow of Mordor is a very good example of how important gameplay is.StoryYou play as Talion, a captain serving at the Black Gate of Mordor. Sauron's forces siege the garrison, kill your wife and son and finally end your life as well. Your body merges with a soul of an ancient elf and together you seek revenge. Yes. Yes, it is a revenge story and to be honest the story is pretty much none existant. You are introduced to different characters as you progress in the story. You're introduced to exactly 3 characters. Yup. That's it. You'll meet a dwarf, a woman and an older woman. None of them get enough screen time and as a result you don't really care about any of them. Story is not the strong point of this game.However that's not why the game is loved...GameplayGameplay, while quite simple, is just so amazing.You can parkour Assassin's Creed style through an open world map while brutaly killing thousands and thousands of orcs. There are fast travel points (towers) to unlock just like in Far Cry 3&4, monsters to tame and ride, slaves to free, challenges to do, collectibles to..collect and did I mention you can also murder hundreds upon hundreds of orcs?You have the freedom of choosing how you want to uproach each situation. You can be a stealthy sniper and shoot 'em all down from distance with your bow. You can just jump right in and go berserk or you can use stealth and take them down one by one or take control of the orcs and make 'em kill each other.It feels more like a stealth game at first since you get overrun by orcs easily but as you progress in the game and unlock new skills and weapon runes you become a bonafide buttocks.Not only are there survival and hunting challenges in the game (picking flowers and killing innocent animals) but there are also 3 different weapon challenges scattered across the world: Dagger, sword and bow.Each of these challenges make you use different skills from your skilltree and try out different approaches making the gameplay a bit less redundant because let's be honest, the game can get a bit repetitive. Especially those slave freeing missions.All in all Shadow of Mordor is a great game and definitely The best LoTR game till date.It's also the best orc murdering game out there. If you want to slay thousands of orcs then look no further. "

												(TLDR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)Middle Earth is a world with no shortage of lore but surprisingly enough hasn't always translated well to video games. It's ironic given the number of high fantasy games that have been strongly influenced by Tolkien's world. Monolith has stepped up to the plate to give us Shadow of Mordor, combining open world action with a few original game mechanics in hopes of giving Middle Earth fans the game experience they have always wanted. Set entirely in the dark land of Mordor and taking place between the events of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, it acts as a much needed bridge between the two. You play as Talion, a ranger from Gondor who's in charge of defending the black gate. He's killed along with his family in a sudden attack lead by the hand of Sauron but instead of dying, his body is possessed by an elven wraith. This wraith grants him power over death bestowing him with a plethora of different abilities to use, like the ability to fire magical arrows, lightning speed, and increased resilience among others.The world is a typical sandbox design, feeling very similar to games like Assassin's Creed. There's a relatively small map to wander around in, along with towers that help to reveal the immediate vicinity as well as acting as checkpoints and fast travel stations. These towers are pretty much identical to those you'd find in an Ubisoft game. Despite having a strong and interesting narrative, there aren't many story quests and there isn't as much content as you’d expect from a game of this genre. It doesn’t take very long to walk from one end of the map to the other, featuring a miniscule sized world compared to Grand Theft Auto V or Assassin’s Creed Black Flag. There are optional missions and challenges to be found though which can provide you with new runes and abilities, however these don’t add much to the gameplay experience.The saving grace of Shadow of Mordor and the main thing that sets it apart from being just a generic mediocre sandbox game is the nemesis system. This one feature is innovative, addictive and extremely well executed. It single handedly makes the game worth playing. The basis of it is whenever Talion is killed by one of the many Uruk Hai orcs, that orc becomes your rival and is promoted in Sauron’s army. They'll gain access to new weapons and abilities making them all the more formidable when you run into them a second time. Even specific dialogue will play out between Talion and the orc as they will recognize him from last time. If you're killed by just the average orc, he will immediately be promoted to captain and can have a posse of followers the next time you see him. If you're killed by a captain, they will continue to rise in strength and influence as they'll use Talion’s death as a stepping stone on their path to warchief. Each of your nemeses will have their own unique personality along with strengths and weaknesses which can be revealed by interrogating other orcs. For example, a captain could be immune to ranged attacks or become significantly stronger if you kill one of his friends. On the other hand, he could have certain weaknesses such as being afraid of fire or certain beasts. This allows for elements of strategy and planning prior to hunting down one of Talion’s nemeses.        Events will also happen without your intervention, orcs will fight amongst themselves, often killing one another, leaving openings in the army. They will also seek to raise their strength and standing with various trials. The warchiefs can be particularly difficult to hunt since they will often have multiple captains defending them, and sometimes it’ll be better to pick them off one at a time prior. I had so much fun with the nemesis system that I found myself dying on purpose on more than one occasion just to watch an orc rise to power.The combat in Shadow of Mordor is similar to games like Assassin's Creed and most particularly the Batman Arkham titles. It favors countering your assailants while maintaining a high hit chain with the odd special move thrown in. It's not overly challenging and the game can be completed rather easily with only the odd nemesis being difficult based on the combination of passive abilities he possesses.The bosses aren't noteworthy, being fairly easy, with the conclusion of the game coming about rather abruptly. Shadow of Mordor could have really benefited from another ten or so hours of content. The DLC from the season pass seems to promise more but I would have definitely preferred if this was included from the get-go.The game does have RPG elements however they're not really in-depth. There's no Bioware or Witcher style dialogue either if you were hoping for that. The game shouldn't be advertised as an RPG and should have just been marketed as a sandbox game. It has a fairly straight forward talent tree that doesn't add much of anything significant aside from passive bonuses while each of the abilities are usually unlocked as a result of completing a mission. There’s also a rune system where runes can be added to each of Talion’s weapons. These runes give different buffs and are obtained primarily from killing your nemeses, the higher their level, the better the rune generally.The visuals are well done but I noticed some inconsistencies in the textures and between the orcs. Some orcs are highly detailed, while others appear to be ripped right out of the original xbox title; Call of Cthulhu. I also experienced quite a few bugs, primarily Talion getting stuck somewhere with fast-travel being the only option to rectify the issue. The voice acting is noteworthy with fan favorite Troy Baker voicing Talion among a host of other industry veterans for the supporting cast. The soundtrack is solid and fits the theme but it isn’t nearly as memorable as Howard Shore’s score from the motion pictures.Ultimately Shadow of Mordor would feel like just another typical sandbox game if not for the nemesis system. This one feature is the game’s saving grace and along with the story are the main reasons to play it. The Nemesis system is most likely a sign of things to come for what we expect games of the future to have. It adds elements of re-playability and does wonders on holding one’s attention and creating an immersive environment. I’m sure it will be improved upon in future releases and that Shadow of Mordor will be remembered as its progenitor.TLDR? This review is also available in video format:

												Going into this game I was afraid it would be the same ol’ generic open world game that seem to be the trend these days (at least when this game came out back in 2014), but, to my surprise, Shadow of Mordor nails down the size of the world. It’s just the right size. Not too big and empty and not too small to make it a hub-game, like for say Deus Ex: Human Revolution. So traveling from one side of the map to the other doesn’t take long, but there is fast traveling nonetheless. Game also has a fair amount of collectibles to learn more about its lore.The protagonist is your run-of-the-mill guy, nothing special about him, nothing makes him stand out. Story is nothing to write home about, another story about a guy getting revenge. No twists to keep you guessing, no real message behind it to make you think. But, that’s okay, because the meat and potato of this game is its gameplay. While combat is technically speaking shamelessly ripped off from the Batman Arkham series, but with a slight twist from the usage of a Bow, which slows down time, Max Payne style, if you have the meter for it. If you played any Arkham game you know what you’re getting into. Press the button when you see it over the head of an enemy (or if he’s trying to swing at you if you turn it off), press 2 buttons to do various executions etc. Stealth is also extremely similar to how Arkham games handle stealth. Parkour is reminiscent of that from Assassin’s Creed. However, later on, you get to unlock an ability that will drastically change the way you go about things. Instead of killing the enemies, you then have the option to control them and make them obey you.But the true enjoyment in the game comes from Nemesis System. Orcs or rather Uruks, all try to haunt you to climb up the ranks, but they will also fight amongst each other to take other’s positions and gain power. There are essentially 2 ranks in the game: Captains and Warchief, the latter being the highest rank in the game. The system is simply put: incredible. You could die to a random Uruk in the world, who then gets promoted to a Captain, you then could control him and make him start a war with a Warchief, aid him in the war and make him to the next Warchief and then finish him off. I was hanging on a ledge once, waiting for a Captain, who was also a bodyguard for a Warchief, and also weak to stealth takedowns, doing an execution, just as he executed he was just close enough for me to stealthily control him making him and his entire gang he commands mine.The game seems to be very well optimized, loading times are short (though I did encounter once random situation where the game had to load for several seconds for some reason) and it has a fair amount of graphic options. Shadow of Mordor is a fun game.			"

Middle Earth : Shadow of MordorShadow of Mordor is a third person open world adventure game with RPG aspects and Hack and Slash mechanics that remind you of Assassin's Creed or the Arkham games.GraphicsOne of the best looking games of 2014.It features two distincs themes.A darker theme while roaming inside the walls of Mordor and a lighter theme with grass and more sunlight later in the campaign.GameplayThe game does a really good job at having a fun combat system.It steals a lot from the Arkham games but it is more forgiving,making it easier to time your counters.It also feels a lot more fluid.There are also special abilities that you gain throughout the campaign that spice up the repetitive nature of this style of gameplay.Executing enemies is also possible after you hit a large combo or when you have stunned or knocked down your enemies.You can upgrade your gear and fighing prowess by advancing in the storyline or by buying the weapon/ability upgrades with in-game currency.It's a pretty straightforward system and by the end of the game you will most likely unlock almost everything.It's simple,but it gets the job done.Shadow of Mordor is not a platformer game but it does a good job on having a lot of ledges,towers and structures to climb on.Climbing and jumping around feels smooth and responsive.Stealth in this game is very basic.You press SHIFT and crouch to avoid being detected.You can also use bushes/walls to hide from orcs.Stealth killing orcs is satisfying because of the animation and gore but that's about it.Orcs will check the last place they saw you but that's about it.The nemesis system makes this game stand out even if it borrows a lot from other games.The game does a good job at generating random captain and warlords with different physical features and attributes but after awhile it starts to get repetitive.The relationship you have with the orcs is shallow and they will just yell out something at you before the fight and that's it.Sometimes you will influence their attributes and physical appearance after a fight.An interesting aspect it's the fact that once a random orc kills you,he automatically becomes a captain which means you can take sweet revenge on him.Captains have different ways of advancing through the ranks to become warlords by triggering events that you can be a part of.For example,a captain may challenge another captain to a duel.You can go there and kill them both,or help one win the duel.This system has enough content to keep you entertained for at least the duration of the main campaign,but after that it will start to feel repetitive and boring.Aside from orcs,uruks and fighting captains/warlords.You can also encounter different creatures like Caragors,caragaths,graugs,ghuls and ghul matrons.Each with unique fighting styles and counters.Some of them can even be tamed in-game which is cool.Collecting stuff and doing side quests in this game is quite tedious but at least it's fast and easy unlike in other games where it may take a long time and a lot of effort.And because the gameplay is so fun,sometimes you will just do side quests just for the gameplay.This game has a perfect map by having it feel so big and alive.I noticed how small the map was only after 1-2 hours of gameplay because it was so full and vibrant.It's the perfect size for a map.Most of the time,games have huge maps that feel empty and covering ground is boring.StorylineNot that good.The main character doesn't have a great personality and backstory.During the campaign you will meet only two memorable characters in the likes of Ratbag and Torvin.The rest,even the villains,are forgettable.Also,this game features Gollum and doesn't waste the potential of his persona.The campaign just doesn't have enough substance.The plot is boring and at some points,it takes weird turns and twists.The ending is disappointing and the choice to kill a certain character is questionable to say the least.TL;DRShadow of Mordor has a very fun and fluid combat with great visual style but lacks in terms of plot.The nemesis system is unique but it's not what most people expected.The game can get repetitive after awhile but if you like the combat,you can easily finish the main campaign without getting bored.Overall,the game is for sure one of the best of 2014 and deserves at least a chance.

												Mordor is very similar to a ac/arkham style combat action game with new mechanics thrown into the twist along with gorgeous graphics, action, gore and plenty of orcs to kill. The game starts off with you playing as the ranger Talion a ranger from Gondor that guards the gates of Mordor  and due to a certain event is now cursed and partnered with a wraith. Together they  take on the army of Sauron to exact vengeance while discovering the identity of the wraith himself and to break the curse.The voice acting is done with care to  the characters to bring them to  life in this game. From Talion and the  Wraith along with all  other characters that will is met during the quest to the various evils whom roam the land which includes orcs and creatures alike all have voices that represented them really well as if one was watching them from a lotr movie. The  effects and the ambience sounds bring immersion to the game. Weapons, and sound effects were  all done skillfully well to the point where you cannot get bored with hearing the sound of clashing swords and orc heads chopped off. The music playing the whole game is expected from this type of game with an epic war feeling to it along with some really adrenaline pumping pieces composed. The graphics in this gamel looks incredible and absolutely gorgeous. The background aesthetic, the armors and weapons,  characters, orcs, and everything else including the mucky grounds itself was very detailed and done really craftully to show an immersive battlefield environment which truly breathes life into the game. There will be ruins, orc buildings and cages throughout the map which takes place in Mordor to give it that very morbid environment. There are also interactable objects in the environment such as explosive pots, explodable campfires, breakable walls, hives,  and hanging baits.The map of the game is decently sized with in two locations. Udun and the Sea of nurnen both  full lof orcs of all types of other evils. Ghouls that roam the land when a body is gathers, and rideable caradors and graugs. The maps shows icons in a very organize legend  packed with  main missions, side missions along with Missions ranging from human rescue missions, kill missions, power struggles,   hunting captains,  accomplishing timed tasks, Vendetta against captains to avenge other players who died in their game and finding hidden mirian  points and bonus items. It was fun when it started thenll feels repetitive after a while and lacking variety.The game play battle system is similar to the game Arkham and has a nostalgic Ac feel to it. The controls' option menu includes the ability for players to also key bind. Players will be taught how to attack, block, jump, dodge and stealth to dispatch enemies as the basic. As the game progresses Talion will be able to invest in abilities making him stronger. Players will need to master all these down to fight against variety of evil on the battlefield. Some of the skills becomes ridiculously overpowered later.As Talion levels up he is able to invest point's abilities and acquire a plethora of skills that will aid him such as faster finishes, flurry attacks, dashes, and more all revolving around three weapons, which are the bow, daggers, and sword. There is a total of forty  abilities he can invest in. Most of them can only be unlocked by leveling, doing the main quest, or power struggle quests.The Attributes menu requires mirian points, which had to be invested in order to upgrade health, weapons and rune slots for them. They are divided into resources and weapon's branch, which totals up to 30 total abilities of upgrades.  Talion is able to place  a divergence of runes into the weapons to upgrade their stats to improve thier function ranging from stronger hits vs certain units in percentage value based on its level for more attack hits, and regenerative functions. There are also epic rated runes. Each weapon can only take a total of five runes once they are upgraded, and runes can range in levels. If extra runes are acquired, they can be destroyed and converted to Mirian's points.The real meat of the game lies in the nemesis systems in hunting of enemy captains. Enemy captain's fight is a very dynamic system in the game and really adds an interesting fresh mechanic to the game. When meeting a captain, players is greeted by a dialogue if the captain knew Talion or heard of him, including having fought him before. He'll spout all kinds of verbal attacks on Talion some, which are great and other times creepy.  They are usually specially ranked orc units in the game that are uncovered when Talion interrogates and kills grunts in the battlefields which can be scouted out to be  marked and observed for weaknesses which can aid him in dispatching them quicker or used to call out the war chiefs which is the toughest of the hierarchy.  There are also sub ranks such as veteran, elite, and legendary ranked. They are much harder to kill and usually reside all over the battlefield, including strongholds where the enemies are concentrated. Once they are killed the chain of captains is switched about, and orcs falls around in ranking. The enemies themselves battle each other in a power struggle and rank around by themselves so as time goes along during gameplay or if manually forced they will become harder and level up in power. IF Talion is killed himself, the chain of command is also dynamically changed causing them to get even stronger.The orcs themselves are dynamic and can be dealt with in a variety of ways, usually when killing one, players can choose to drain them for power or interrogate them to find the captains. By doing so players can work their way up to the chain from hunting down grunts to captains and then to war chiefs, which are the most powerful. Players are also able to kill an orc to use him to scout other orcs in the heiarchy, threaten them so that he increases thier levels, or even take control of them through branding in which he is able to pull out any ranked orcs to the field and there is no way they can counter it therefore breaking orcs difficulty.The grunts themselves are  very dynamic in the field with the dialogue, looks and spout  among each other showing  interaction on the battlefield. Orcs Ai also can fear the player when low on health or show anger depending on what type of  weakness is exposed. In dialogues when players clashes with ranked orcs they will always spout previous encounters and different phrases depending on the events that gives players the immersive feeling the orcs knows them.Healing is only regenerative in this game through rune skills, leveling up and herbs. Some of the other features such as qte are also unique. The only times you'll see them is when you try to jump on mounts,  on the verge of death, or finishing off certain enemies where it'll require certain  mouse movements along with button presses which sometimes breaks immersion.Multiplayer available so far is only avenging players from other games who dies to orc captains and a trial game play and leadership board ranking. No other mode seen thus far. Loses replaybility because offers not much else.Pros + superb graphic+ Adrenaline pumping music scores+ Dynamic nemesis system gameplay and battlefield giving orcs variety+ Variety of pleasing  skills+ Incredible  voice acting+ Ai Interaction on battlefield+ Solid StealthplayCons - - Only multiplayer is the trial gameplay where players are scored on a timed based event.- Battlegrounds is decently sized over 2 maps, feels like many things missing.- Last boss qte? WTF!- No difficulty slider.- Mostly orcs, caradors, ghouls and graugs. No other enemiesCurator search - StreamYT/Twitch - KenutyYoutube Review-

												It’s been said once, and I’ll say it again. We need a middle ground between yes and no for recommending games in reviews. This game is fun if you’re into the whole mindless slog of being able to kill entire garrisons with just two buttons. Shadow of Mordor suffers from the same illness that seems to plague most games of this genre these days. That is, it gets easier as you continue to play. All the nifty tricks you unlock eventually make you into a fighter capable of making the big bad bosses of Mordor into your ♥♥♥♥♥. Which isn’t completely awful. There is some fun to be had annihilating strongholds; stealthily killing and branding Uruks until all that’s left is dead bodies and turncoat Uruks.If you’re a Lord of the Rings fan, Its neat that it talks about the creation of the rings, but it also completely rewrites the story of Celebrimbor’s involvement. That’s some heavy-duty nerd♥♥♥♥♥♥that will only bother the die-hards, though.While it may be a bit mindless, it does what it sets out to do and does it correctly. If you enjoyed the Assassin’s Creed games, you’d like this.  "

												It's like Batman arkham asylum and Assassin's creed had a baby.If you are a fan of those games, and the Tolkien universe.Then this is the game for you.I personally feel like this game lived up to my expectations. I was a little sceptical at first, because it looked too much like Assassin's creed. But when you actually play the game, you forget all about it. Pros:+ Astonishing graphics+ Counter Combat system+ Stealth mode+ Gollum... Do i need to say more?+ Detailed environment+ Wraith mode+ Photo mode + Cape Physics+ Nemesis system + Look mom, i can make a frontflip!Cons:- An Uruk threw his spear into a cliff and it killed me, apparently- I insta killed a warchief with stealth- Boss fights are way too easyIt's easy to say that this game has slowly become one of my favorite games of 2014. Apart from the random spear kill, i really loved this game. I give this title a 8/10 (9/10 if that spear didn't hit me) "

												+ Perfect for fans of Arkham-based combat.+ All about killing orcs.+ Nemesis system that encourages personal vendettas vs orcs that simply wont die, or ""feeding"" yourself to a certain Orc to grow his power until you brand him and take over, play orcs vs orcs in power struggles, being the shadow that controls it all...+ High production values, excellent voice-acting, expansive character and art direction for the orcs.+ Properly difficult, for once.+ Very well optimized, and even on ""Medium"" settings its a jaw-dropper.- Those who dislike Arkham's combat wont like this game.- all about killing orcs, and nothing else.- Story is ""okay"", with an almost-forced references to LOTR in places.- Difficult enough that it can turn off many folk who simply hate dying to orcs, even when its a valid part of the game- Overblown displayed system requirements for ""Ultra"" have negatively impacted the perception of the game, even when Medium and High is more than enough even for graphical fidelity afficionados.IN SHORT: A Lord Of The Rings game that not only does not suck, but is a GOTY 2014 contender. Worth the asking price and then some :D			"

												This game does not bring a lot of new things to the table, except for the Nemesis system, which makes it really stand out.All in all, this is a really good action/adventure game and beneficiates from the LOTR Universe.Feels like an Assassin's Creed game but not as boring in my opinion.Unfortunately the game is a bit too short and sometimes repetitive, but it's a good game if you want to enjoy some epic action from time to time.I do not regret buying this game in the slightest, but try to buy it for cheaper than it is right now, because the game is really too short for my tastes.

												COPIED FROM YOUTUBE COMMENTS, User Name: XACKADEUnique stories from the Nemesis system.I knew a guy. Norsko. 'The Rat', they called him. Rats run, but not Norsko. No, Norsko was a fighter. A good one.First Uruk to send me to the grave, he was. I was young and foolish, testing my strength against whoever I could find. Then he appears, a name. The first one I've faced. Adrenaline pumping, I take him on. He's good, but I can match him. But then my inexperience starts to show. I'm surrounded. More captains show up. I thought I was invincible. Norsko showed me I was wrong.A lot of promotions were handed out that day. Ranks changed hands. It's funny how a body can carry more weight when dead. Norsko got the brunt of the appraise and applause. He took a step forward, gloating the whole time. I didn't like that. At all.I rose from the dead, blood boiling. I wanted revenge so badly. I hunted Norsko down and tried to kill him. Instead I found out how much revenge can cost.I was slowly learning that Norsko got stronger everytime he killed me. More powerful in more than just rank. My determination to kill him never wavered and eventually I got my wish. It took time, another captain getting a lucky shot in, a lot of orc corpses and a few of my own but I did it. His power level was 9 and I made sure he never saw double digits first-hand. Norsko was no more.Or so I thought.Somehow, he didn't die. I was running free sometime later, already forgotten him when he attacked me. Suprise and shock were the brothers by my side as I read that dreaded name. I didn't understand it. It must be a error. So I decided to debug it and once again teach Norsko how much better off he was when his head departed his shoulders.But it didn't end. He appeared again sometime after that. He was more powerful and had a poisoned mace. His presence certainly felt like poison. And his taunts always beat themselves into my skull. Norsko would not die, even when I killed him. This time he was better of us. I ran. Since then I could only watch as he lived on, bearing the scars of our history as his power increased. One day, there she stood. Mightiest of the captains yet not even a warchief. Power level 20.Skirmish after skirmish and we learned to stop killing each other; he couldn't manage it and I didn't want to. Truth be told, I was proud of him. We'd both made it as far as we had by killing each other. If there was a chance that we could break the cycle, killing Norsko for good, it would wait. Norsko was an enemy worth fighting. A rival to wrestle with. A foe to give battle purpose. He was my nemesis.It was sadly not to last. I had only started killing warchiefs when it happened. Norsko was my dear Ratbag the Coward's bodyguard so there was even some tactical worth in keeping him alive at this point. Naturally it was entirely my concern when a duel was struck up between him and some level 8 trash. I forget the whelp's name as he was not even worth remembering. We shall call him Morgul. I do recall that he was known as 'Map Bearer'.I decided to take part in watching this bloodbath. Perhaps I shouldn't have. We'd always cursed each other, but I never wanted this. I expected Norsko to triumph easily, as he should. He wasn't unstoppable, as I knew firsthand, but there was no enemy who'd made the progress he had. It should have gone to him. But life isn't fair.The poisoned mace was a pretty thing, but when you aren't as fast as a Ranger, it's sadly ineffective against a shield and trident. As I watched I realised that Norsko was losing. At once I felt a need to protect my personal villain from an ungainly death. I resolved to step in and save his life if he should reach critical levels. It was a decision made too late and too indecisively. Even as I steeled myself to interfere, Morgul jabbed with such ferocity that he wiped Norsko's health out from over the halfway point.In one single blow, Norsko was gone. For good this time. His position wouldn't be redeemed through his animated corpse it would be stolen by this 'Morgul Map Bearer' who I had known for all of two missions. It was unjust. It was unworthy. I should have been the one to kill him. It should have been a fight with grandeur and closure. It should have been our personal showdown after all we'd been through where I finally put him in his place and proved to him that we were no longer equals and we never would be again.But that right was lost in this single accidental moment of weakness. It would not be unpaid for.I leapt from my perch and in the single push of a button, in a single flash of my blade, I cut Morgul Map Bearer's throat, killing him at once. It wasn't fair to have his rightful victory snatched from him, but after watching an unknown fool kill my longtime nemesis I was in no mood to discuss injustice. As his life slipped away I whispered to him: ""Norsko would never have fallen to that."" It's true. He was immune to stealth.I looked down upon the miserable faces of the two dead Uruk who had come here to contest each other, willing to take on the risk of death, even if it meant no longer fighting the people they truly hated and I realised, as their followers fled the scene and as I stood there in the middle of it all, collecting their final runes to remember them by, nobody was happy. Nobody left that day with a warm heart and a smiling face.Was it worth it? Should I have done that?I may never make up my mind on any of it save for one detail. Nobody in all of Mordor - in all of Middle Earth - will ever match the glory of my one true nemesis.Farewell, Norsko the Rat.			"

												I haven't played big AAA game in a long while, so I had to shift my gears a little in this one. This is a game I had actual had on pre order, but have only just got round to playing. I will put it right out there....why on earth did I wait this long to play? The movement mechanics are very much similar to that of Assassins Creed, the free running and parkour style jumps are done to perfection, and you won't find another game that does them any better. The combat system is again, similar to another game series, Batman Arkham, again, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Arkham combat is one of the best, if not the best style of combat system around. Simple to grasp controls and easy enough to master. Some of the graphics on show here are some of the best I have seen, I can see why the game is 42GB, as the textures you can push out of this are sublime, I was able to get some absolutely gorgeous screenshots that you could quite easily think were real (except maybe the ones with Sauron in the background). This is essentially an open world RPG game, you roam around middle-earth carrying out the main story, finding collectables, completing side quests, and boosting your starts and abilities. This is my favourite genre of game, and all of the features on show are all done to perfection. SoM offers a new game mechanic in the form of the Nemesis system, this allows you to form rivalries with orc leaders and warchiefs, if they kill you, they will gain power and possibly a higher rank, which really sucks you into the immersiveness of the game because after you have been killed a few times by one of the leaders, you REALLY want to take him out as his remarks get sassier and sassier each time you fight him.Shadow of Mordor is actually quite a challenging game, I found myself to be on the receiving end of quite a few beatings at times, some missions, even the early ones, required a lot of thought and consideration into I would complete them, especially the stealth objectives. Of course the swarms and swarms of orcs can sometimes become overwhelming at times, but being realistic, it probably would do if that were to actually happen...I have put about 24 hours into this game over the course of a few days, I have completed the main story, and almost all of the side missions, collectibles and rewards, to me that is a lot of content on offer, almost looking at £1 an hour, which to me, is a fair price. Considering how graphically and resource demanding this game is, I had no technical issues what so ever, and at times I was even playing with upwards of about 90 FPS, which is amazing.For me, this is the best game I have played this year, and if I had played it when it was released, it would of easily of been my Game of the Year. I cannot recommend Shadow of Mordor enough, you should all pick it up and play through it regardless of whether you like Lord of the Rings or not. This will go down as one of the classics of our generation. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Even a blade in the face can't stop these Uruk.You will burn them, slice their necks, have fierce beasts maul them, throw them from ledges and still, some of them will find a way to return. Their wounds will be stitched together, left to heal on their own or even have iron platings stuck on them to prevent them from opening. That's their nature, and that of their homeland, Mordor, merciless, brutal and upredictable.Enter Mordor as Talion, a ranger of the Black Gate. As soon as the tutorial finishes, you and your family have your throats slit as a sacrifice by the servants of Sauron. You are immediately banished from death however, since an ancient elven wraith possesses you, and you embark on your journey to avenge your family's death.It's a pretty straightforward and shocking intro that will make you think ""hey, this game's story seems brutal and interesting!"" Unfortunately, that's also its best part. The rest of the storyline is shallow and feels as if the writers preferred to hunt Pokemon than write a bloody amazing scenario, one that this game is worth.However, the rest of the game's elements are BLOODY AMAZING! Think of it like Batman: Arkham series and Assassin's Creed had a baby in the world of LOTR. It's that good, and more.As an undead fella, Talion gives you the impression to be unstoppable without sacrificing the fear of defeat. As you progress, you unlock more powers and combat movements that you can tailor your battle style on. You can use stealth, force Uruks to fight for you, use beasts to do your dirty work, or straight-up massacre anyone that stands in your path. If you bite more than you can chew, though, you will find yourself respawning in the closest spawn point and the Uruk that dealt the killing blow being promoted or become stronger.Mordor is alive. Uruks have not tamed the land and you will find patrols getting served by the local wildlife or slave camps where you can release the slaves for your benefit. Everywhere something is happening and you can sit back and watch, laughing, as a band of poor soldiers is getting skewered alive by gollum-like creatures. Or you can join the fray and leave none, orc and beast alike, standing. Your choice.Since we talk about Uruks, here is where the game shines. They come in many professions, from slavers and hunters to assassins and archers. Their place in the army defines their weaponry and general attitude. Uruks have their own society, with soldiers, various forms of captains and always 5 warchiefs. An Uruk can progress through the ranks randomly, by killing Talion, killing other captains etc. Each Uruk likes and dislikes some of his peers, or he's even a bodyguard of a warchief. This information can be used to your advantage in order to clear Sauron's army more efficiently or take it under your control. Each Uruk has his strengths and weaknesses, like fear of fire or weakness to arrows, and you can find them out by interrogating worms, other Uruks that possess such knowledge.Killing one of them does not always guarantee a success. If they get in a tough spot, Uruks might try to flee and learn from their encounter with you to counter your tactics. You are also in for a surprise once you realise you did not do your job properly, and a captain stitched himself up and is really, really angry with you in your next encounter. Their dialogue changes as well, depending on their past encounters with you or their activities when you ambush them.The game is simply beautiful. The animations, the graphics, the lighting, the vegetation, everything. Detail is everywhere, from the scars in the captains' faces to the laces in Talion's armor. It's a wonder to look at, and certain known landmarks like the Black Gate inspire awe and a sense of greatness as you explore them.On the downside, while meddling with the Uruk hierarchy will never bore you, some side quests will leave you bored out of your mind. The slave side-quests are always about rescuing 3 of them and gear-related quests are usually around stealth, long-range encounters or straight-up slaughter. It gets pretty dull quickly, and that's a big minus.It's a game that's worth your time (and money). Its beauty combined with its unpredictable battles and fluid, intense battle system will keep you hooked and wanting for more, even if the story will not amaze you and tends to be forgotten quickly.And remember boys, always chop off their heads, or else they WILL come back. Probably.RATING:Gameplay: 9/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 4.5/10Unique Factor: Combat System: 9/10OVERALL: 8.1/10 "

												I don't really know what to say about this game. I played for nearly 20 hours, and it certainly didn't feel like 20 hours, but I'm not sure whether that's because I was having so much fun, or because there's not actually that much to do before you find yourself rinsing, repeating, and killing killing killing your way to the end. There's really 2 halves to the game - the half where you grasp the controls and prance around a rocky, muddy wasteland slaying anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 types of missions; and the half where you prance around a rocky, verdant meadow slaying or brainwashing anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 different types of missions. To be fair, I did enjoy myself for a large part. But it was upon staring slackjawed at the screen as the woefully anticlimactic final boss fight came and went in about 15 seconds (no, I am not exaggerating) that I realised that this game introduced one interesting game mechanic, rehashed a number of established mechanics (albeit well enough to make them functional and fun) and then offered nothing else other than a sandbox with which to exercise these abilities for as long as it took you to turn yourself to the main story. Which would be FINE if the story had a satisfying conclusion, or the sandbox didn't feel so much like a literal pit within which the developers had simply thrown some enemies leaving a lot of empty space with little else filling the gaps. I sound confused because I am. Monolith make well-designed and fun games, and Shadow of Mordor is both those things. But given that the review that convinced me to buy it stated that 'no-one could feel short-changed with the amount of content on offer', I felt remarkably short-changed. The Nemesis system is fantastic, there is no denying that, and it offers some of the most genuinely intelligent and dynamic enemies in gaming history. It truly is a gaming milestone. However, nearly everything else about the game comes from somewhere else - the parkour was better used in Assassin's Creed, the combat is straight from the Arkham series, the mission structures are ripped from nearly every open-world game in existence, the skill trees are old, the XP system is old, and on top of all that the enemies are practically deaf and blind...And it's this lack of true depth that left me feeling like the purchase wasn't worth my money. By the time I had finished playing, I felt like I had explored everything this game had to offer, and there was no reason for me to return. I didn't DISLIKE my time, but I didn't feel compelled to play again. I suppose I have been spoiled, because I bought Alien: Isolation at around the same time, and that's a game that left me feeling like I could play again and have an entirely different experience a second time around. I paid almost the same amount of money for this as I did that, and I don't think I'll go back again, which feels like a waste - like buying an $80 meal to find that you've eaten it before elsewhere, and cheaper.To make a comparison, I feel that Shadow of Mordor is like the first Assassin's Creed, in that it introduces a fantastic concept (in this case, the Nemesis system), but the game itself exists only as a framework for that concept, and offers little else that the player can't get elsewhere. To make another comparison, the issues I have are the same as with Infamous: Second Son, for those of you that have played: The MEAT, the things that you are actually given to do, all fall within 2 or 3 different categories, and all those categories involve killing a bunch of enemies that are fundamentally the same, and as such the environment becomes little more than a set of boundaries within which you can kill these nameless creatures, and your character becomes little more than a tool with which to kill.There are open-world games, and there are open world games. Games like GTA IV keep me coming back because every time I play I can turn a corner and find something new. The beauty of the first two Arkham games was that the city itself had such personality that there was always something to see for those who cared to look. Unfortunately, I feel that Shadow of Mordor falls into an increasingly large pile of games that have a lot of style and little substance. Which is a shame because there is so much right about the game - the characters are great, the animations are wonderful, the voice acting is excellent, the action is gory and adult, the Nemesis system is truly a step forward, and the LOTR lore is explored in a really engaging way. However, after a short time the game feels repetitious, the environments feel big and empty, and the story ends as if the writer fell off a cliff mid-sentence and someone had to smash together what they thought the ending was supposed to be. I'd love to recommend this game, especially as it is evident a lot of money and hard work went into its creation, and for a cheaper price I absolutely would. But for the good of the consumer, I can't recommend it for full price - if this game were a bag of chips, the product would be delicious, but the bag would be mostly air.			"

												Thoroughly surprised. Actually yelled ""This is awesome""Auto-detected almost everything at ultra on my HD7970 (obviously not textures), looks good, sounds great, and controls work very well with mouse and keyboard for those of you rightly worried about console port issues.This has been a bad year for games on pc, this is not one of them.Edit: The dialog, the cutscenes and story quests really immerse you in the land of Mordor. The game doesn't start you off easy and then increase the difficulty, this is a single ranger in the black lands. Often I find myself taking a wrong turn into an army of orcs and having to either flee for my life or fight to the death. Very well done so far in.			"

												I waited 'till I played a few hours before posting this review. I find myself coming back to this game every few weeks since I bought it almost a year ago. It's the best hack & slash game I've got and I've got a few. Very satisfying and the game mechanics couldn't be better. If they could do this with Battman and the Assassin's Creed series......well.....your social life would be ruined and you wouldn't give a damn. The gameplay is so smooth you realy feel like you're in the middle of things. It's realy amazing and it runs fine on older pc's. If other gaming companies would implement this type of fighting in their games.....every gamer's wet dream. The mechanics would be great for a lot of Marvell Super heroes games. I'm wondering why they're not out there. I would play each and every one of them and I know for sure that all you serious gamers out there would be dying to join in.  Shadow of Mordor's fighting mechanics should be a standard for these kind of games today. There's nothing bettter out there at this moment. Very good game and worth your time and money.			"

												I played the game for ten hours so I know what it's like. Anyway the game is a great mix of the Batman Arkham games with Assassin's Creed climbing and campaign mission mechanics, which I wish were a little more varied than just following someone. The music is great, the nemesis system is awesome, haven't seen this much innovation in years, also haven't seen Monolith make a game of this Quality since Fear. So welcome back Monolith. Buy this game if you like Lord Of The Rings and if you like Arkham combat.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is an open world third person action game based on the Lord of the Rings franchise. The events take place after the Hobbit but before Fellowship, and the player controls Talion, a ranger of Gondor. Talion and his family are killed by Sauron's Orcs, but instead of dying, Talion joins with the spirit of an ancient Elf, gains magical powers, and swears revenge.The combat system is fantastic, and its very similar to the Batman Arkham series. You have normal sword attacks, counters, stuns and ground finishers, and when you get a hit streak you can perform an instant kill melee execution or a radial magic attack. You also have a bow that can instant kill with a headshot (it can be used effectively at close range because time slows down while you aim). The bow also allows you to teleport to the enemy's location instead of firing an arrow. The action is fast and fluid, and when you get into a good rhythm, chaining together all these moves feels badass. Its easily as good as, perhaps even better than, the Batman combat.There's also a pretty good stealth system. The level design allows plenty of opportunities to sneak up close and kill with the dagger, or climb up tall buildings and use the bow. There are usually a few ways to use the environment to your advantage, such as using your bow to shoot an exploding barrel, free a Caragor (an animal similar to a Warg) from its cage to attack nearby Orcs, or drop a hornet's nest to make them swarm the Orcs. You can ride Caragors into battle, and in the second half of the game you gain the ability to ""brand"" Orcs which forces them to fight for you against other Orcs.The other key gameplay mechanic is the nemesis system. There are dozens of Orc captains spread around the map, and each time you encounter them they have a couple of lines of dialogue before you fight. They'll taunt you if they killed you before, or they might call you a coward if you've used alot of stealth or ranged attacks, which gives these captains alot of personality.As you would expect, they're tougher to kill in direct combat than regular Orcs, but if you interrogate a minion first you can learn a captain's strengths and weaknesses, which will then allow you to plan how to fight them. I especially enjoyed taking advantage of any opportunity for an instant kill. Sneaking into an Orc stronghold, locating the captain and positioning myself for a backstab or a headshot, all while remaining unseen, made me feel more like a master assassin than I ever did in Assassins Creed.The player has alot of freedom to devise their own plans. For example - how to kill a top level warchief. These Orcs usually have one or two captains as their bodyguards. If you want, you could fight them all together. Its tough, but doable. Alternatively, you could kill the bodyguards first, then fight the warchief on his own. Or, you could brand a bodyguard and order him to attack the warchief for you. This game doesn't force you to follow a script. It gives you an objective, a range of abilities, and lets you find your own solution.The story is okay, but I always find prequels to be less exciting, because I already know what happens next. Having said that, there are some interesting characters and very good voice acting. It took me 22 hours to finish the main storyline and all the interesting side quests, so value for money is excellent.The graphics are great and my framerate was very smooth even with lots of enemies on screen. My PC has an i7 2600k @ 3.4Ghz, 8GB Ram and a GTX 770 with 4GB VRam, and I was able to run most settings at high in 1080p. I did have an issue with screen tearing even when Vsync was on, and the solution I found from the forums was to disable Vsync and run in borderless windowed mode. After making that change I had no problems whatsoever. I used my Xbox 360 gamepad because of the similarity to Batman/AC, and this worked perfectly.Shadow of Mordor is one of the best games I've played in 2014 and I definitely recommend it as a full price purchase. The gameplay is so good that I don't think you need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy it.			"

												Open-world games got along without gimmicks for a long time. The appeal of mindlessly squashing pedestrians in Grand Theft Auto or stealing a village blind in Morrowind carried those titles for years, despite their shortcomings. But times have changed and we expect more from established genres, and Shadow of Mordor understands this. While its core is a very familiar blend of stealth, combat, and collection, its unique offering gives it an impressive new level of interactivity.In the much-storied land of Middle-earth you find yourself in the riding boots of Talion, a skilled ranger and family man. He's also commander of the Black Gate of Mordor, an auspicious structure that definitely isn't holding any sort of evil at bay. That evil that definitely does not exists murders Talion and his family, yet he finds himself returned to life by a mysterious elven phantom. With his newfound immortality, Talion and his ghost buddy embark on a fantastic journey to kill literally every orc in existence.The pace of ShMordor will be instantly familiar to fans of the Assassin's Creed or Arkham games. Talion is a versatile badass with blade, bow, and beast, but risks being overwhelmed if he calls too much attention to himself. This places stealth at a premium, encouraging you to mantle up walls, skulk across rooftops, and disappear orcs with a dagger to the throat. You will always have options in your approach of course, between the flowing combos of the sword, the silent takedowns of the dagger, and the unerring shot of the bow, so don't worry about being pigeonholed into a particular style (outside of specific challenges).This is only scratching the surface of your considerable abilities, mind you. Talion can tap into a sort of ghost vision to spot enemies through walls or interactables like exploding barrels. He can mount and attack from beasts. He can learn to throw daggers and force choke. His weapons can be upgraded with runes that give new bonuses and abilities. There's super speed for crossing expanses, fast travel for skipping around further, and even a literal teleport that gets unlocked late in the game. Every possible skill and gimmick for a third-person brawler is here, to the point that you'll start forgetting them all.All of these powers are used not to find collectibles or pass troublesome roadblocks, but to abuse the intricate power structure your foes have established. Shadow of Mordor's big claim to fame is the Nemesis system, which models specific enemies and their relationships to you and each other. Each of these figures has attributes, like weaknesses, immunities, and special powers that make every encounter a little bit different, along with unique personalities and appearances to match. And these aren't just procedural bosses, they're constant figures in the world. You can track them, harass them, foil their plans, and set them against each other. There's a key power you sadly don't get until the back half of the game that lets you mind-control orcs, and this one ability opens up a previously unseen world of political strategizing. Really, there's so much to appreciate in the Nemesis system, there's really only one way to explain it fully.Kaka was a simple uruk, trained in the art of spear-throwing. I ran afoul of him one late night when my reflexes were dulled, and he struck the blow that killed me. This catapulted him to the rank of captain, something he was terribly unprepared for seeing as how he was weak to just about every form of combat there is. Nevertheless, he set about celebrating his promotion with a feast. I wasn't about to let him get away with that, so I crashed the party, murdered his men one by one, and left him drinking poisoned grog all by himself in the rain. Something about this struck me as incredibly sad, so I took pity on the poor out-of-depth fellow and branded him, enslaving him to my will.From that point on I was out to see Kaka succeed. I helped him murder a veteran captain whom he quarreled with, I opened a spot as a warchief's bodyguard for him, and I rigged the test of endurance to get him promoted. I even branded the other bodyguards to give him a better chance on the fateful day he betrayed his new boss. My preparations had been so far-reaching that Kaka struck down the warchief himself before I could even raise my sword. He stood triumphant on that sunny plateau, bragging to his new army, as I triggered the brands on him, his bodyguards, and his followers to all explode.Astute readers will have picked up the fact that I died early on in that story. Unlike just about every other game out there, death is not a failure state in ShMordor, it is a necessary mechanic. There is no penalty for dying and in fact, you are awarded extra experience and influence every time you perish. Dying also advances time (something you can do manually if you are averse to death) which resolves certain events and allows movement of orcs within the army. This means that playing a perfect game and murdering every orc you see is not going to be nearly as fun as letting them grow strong off your defeats and pitting them against each other. The many quests and events and collectibles are plenty enjoyable but the real joy here has to be found, and depends on the creativity of the player.As if all of that wasn't enough, Middle-earth is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Forget the ash fields and crags of the Lord of the Rings movies, you'll get some of that but Mordor is a diverse and colorful land, with grassy plains, rolling coastlines, and eerie ruins. The characters are fantastically detailed to the point that you'll remember your favorite orcs by their scars or headgear. And best of all, the game includes an incredible dynamic camera that can pause the game at any moment to pose screenshots, with a full suite of photographic and filtering options. I've gone on long enough about how great this game is, and honestly I could keep going. Shadow of Mordor does so much right that it's sure to overlap with any gaming interest you have in open-world or action titles, and should stand near the top of any Best Of list.			"

												This is a review which I have struggled to write as I am very divided about the game. To make the review easier to read I have separated the good and bad points of the game.The good1. The graphics very realistic (mine are on the highest setting) and the atmosphere is perfect for the game2. Dying isn't a big deal, but you will restart at the nearest tower, same with quitting missions3. The gameplay and map is open, giving you freedom to play how you like4. The upgrade system is good, giving you chance to upgrade what you want depending on your playing style. I highly recommend health at first.5. Gaining intel (explained in the game) is very handy for learning about your enemies.6. Poison is very handy at times, best of all your enemies blame each other!7. You can use enemies as a shield, great if you are being attacked by multiple enemies. 8. The check points during the missions are very handy, if you fail a section then you can restart that section. If you leave the game you need to start from the beginning of the mission.9. The story line is great with lots of detail. I have never read lord of the rings or watched the films so I don't know how the game ties in.10. Fast travel is very handy.11. The wraiths abilities are awesome and essential to the game.12. You can customise the skins / appearance of the character, most are gained from dlcs13. There are lots of missions, collectables and side quests to keep you busy. In addition all the dlc. The bad1. The game is very stealth orientated, which is negative for me as it's not my natural playing style. I have learned pretty quickly as it's the only way to stay alive but it's not my preferred approach. This is a game similar to assassins creed, thief and the batman games.2. Killing enemies, even chiefs etc doesn't make a difference to the game. There are always more and more to kill. The only ones which seem to make a difference are the war-chiefs.3. Enemies are every spawning and like to mob you.4. Kills with the bow aren't counted as stealth kills.5. Health is gained from herbs, there are lots of the map but you can't take them with you. If your health is low during a fight your only option is to run (if you don't have upgrades and ruins to give you health).6. No game difficulty setting, some people find it too easy, others too hard. Others are lucky and find it just right.7. Protection missions are extremely difficult as if your ally takes one hit he is dead and you have to restart.8. There is only one choice of female skin / appearance. However, you still have the same male voice.9. The mouth movements are really weird when your character is talking to someone.10. The only character to appear in the cut scenes is the default character.Would I recommend?Short answer, yes. BUT only if you enjoy stealth games and aren't bothered that your actions and kills basically amount to nothing in the game.I got the game and all the dlc for £20 which was a great deal but I wished I had waited. The game is good but there are better games out there.On a side note, this game is unlikely to run on a laptop. It needs around 40GB of space. If you manage to get it to open then there is a high possibility you will be running the game on a low graphics and it'll be chuggy			"

												Don't hate me for not recommending. I have my reasons for it.This is my first review ever. Please read and rate it as a review.26 hours and 8 minutes, 100% playthrough. 51/51 achievements.For such a great game, that is too short playtime for 100%. I don't like the idea of games being unfinished when published. Game itself costs 50€ (bought it for half the price) and the rest is unlocked by buying a season pass or buying all the DLCs separatedly.The game basically has unlimited amount of ""boss fights"" with the nemesis system. Once you face an enemy captain with a great set of strengths, you're going to be screwed. Cutting casually through hordes of normal enemies is enjoyable up to some point. Facing a boss enemy who can actually kill you with one strike if you mess up gives me the vibes.The good:+ Nemesis system.+ Gameplay is awesomesauce+ Music+ Nemesis system.+ Graphics+ Worked great with mouse and keyboard while I hated to play Assassin's Creeds without a gamepad.+ Nemesis system.The bad:- Story- Short main questline (though I wouldn't see that as that bad thing when the story was mediocre)- Clearly unfinished in my opinion- The additional stuff starts repeating itself, bonus objectives counter that a little (I think I failed one bonus objective during the whole game)- Out of lore monsters. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy battling graugs. I'm not 100% sure about this since I've only read the three LotR books and The Hobbit, but I don't think caragors, ghûls and graugs are part of the LotR lore. I had this feeling in the back of my head for the whole duration of the game.- The final boss fight. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING:  Hit spacebar twice, click Sauron's knee once. Watch cutscene. See credits. LITERALLY.Were they even trying?I enjoyed the game. I wouldn't have played it for 26 hours if I didn't. I just wouldn't recommend it (especially for that full price) when the game feels unfinished. This is the first time ever I'm feeling like complaining about DLCs. I've bought Borderlands 2 season pass gladly, I've had premium for BF3 and BF4. Those felt like complete games when I played them. From my point of view DLCs should be supposed to add additional content to the game. Not to finish it or fix it.In short: Great game, definitely worth playing. Just don't buy it for full price. It's not worth the money.			"

												On the surface, this game comes across as a competent but somewhat uninspired combination of Arkham-style brawling and a mix of stealth mechanics and freedom of movement reminiscent of Assassin's Creed. Fluid animations and appropriately responsive controls ensure that these basic mechanics do their job effectively, but they're just the glue holding together a much more interesting whole. This game is all about the Nemesis System. It's about the rivalries you form with Captains and Warchiefs as you fight them, exploit their weaknesses, defeat them, and/or get killed by them. It's about grooming and getting to know the Orcs you've brainwashed as they rise through the ranks of Sauron's army. It's about the wonderful amount of freedom as you toy and experiment with the system, ruining Sauron's day one dead/terrified/enslaved Orc at a time.I beat the story dozens of hours ago, and yet I've kept coming back. With over 300 hours logged, I still find things that keep me interested. Whether it's deliberately allowing a weak Captain to seize power, finding new ways to torment my enemies, or meticulously building up my own army of Orc sleeper agents, I've always found something to do.To provide an example of what sets this game apart, let me tell you the story of a Hunter Captain by the name of Makû the Wicked.One day, I was casually sneaking and murdering my way through the Nûrnen Fishery. I scouted out a couple of Captains in the area, among which was Makû. From the intel I gathered earlier, Makû could be damaged by stealth attacks, but wouldn't necessarily die instantly from one. Among his other traits were Fear of Burning and Throat Grab. At this point I had learned that Uruks apparently can't swim, as knocking them off of a cliff or dock into the water would kill them instantly. When planning out how to kill Makû, I remembered that stealth-killing an Uruk from a ledge involves stabbing him in the gut, then pulling him over the edge. I reasoned that, if I hit Makû with a stealth attack from a ledge hanging over the water, I would be able to finish him off by pulling him into the abyss.I chose to kill Makû from a ledge of an octagonal platform near the northernmost point of the fishery. I carefully combined my Attract ability with well-timed ledge kills to clear out the nearby soldiers who might witness the murder. Then I proceeded to do the same to Makû. Once he got close enough to the edge, I reached up and sunk my dagger into his belly. Just when I thought I was about to pull him into his watery grave, he did something I never anticipated. With my dagger still embedded in his gut, he reached down with one hand and lifted me up by my throat so that my head was level with his. For about a second or two, I found myself struggling against his grasp, before he theatrically dropped me into the sea below. It was at this moment that I learned that I was just as water-soluble as the Uruks. And so, with a single motion, Makû killed me and rose in the ranks.It just so happened that my opportunity for revenge came in the form of a feast that he was holding with his followers, presumably to celebrate my defeat and his promotion. Upon arriving at the feast, I made haste in finding and poisoning a barrel of Grog, just barely avoiding detection. From the cover of a nearby bush, I watched in sadistic glee as Makû and his lackeys gathered and took hearty swigs of the stuff I had laced. Makû was the first to feel the effects, as he and others began violently regurgitating. The poison harmed him, but he was left alive to engage in the brawl that ensued as the Uruks blamed each other for my trick. Not wanting my kill to be stolen, I shot an arrow at the poisoned grog, alighting Makû and his troops in the resulting explosion. Thanks to his fear of being burned alive, Makû immediately fled in terror, cutting through the camp of confused Uruks. Unfortunately for him, he mistakenly ran next to one of the campfires, which I happily detonated to slow him down. The effort was not enough, as Makû continued to flee and jumped down a nearby ledge, right next to yet another campfire for me to ignite him with. I did so, and was finally able to catch my prey. I decided to seize the opportunity to use Makû to gain intel on one of the other captains that had shown up while I was busy being dead, so I dominated Makû, learned what I wanted, and chose to kill him.However, that is not the end. At the time, I didn't yet have the Brand ability, and choosing to kill a dominated Captain doesn't make his head burst as it does with a soldier. So, despite having been stabbed, poisoned, set on fire three consecutive times, and undergone having his mind forcefully opened with Wraith magic, Makû still managed to survive. Not long after the incident at the feast, I was out and about, casually fighting some Uruks when one of my attacks was suddenly and unexpectedly blocked by Makû's spear. His once dark gray skin had now turned a pale, splotchy gray-and-white. He greeted me by hissing about how his burns still hurt, and hinting at his anticipation of living up to his title, ""the Wicked"". Sadly, this story now came to a close, as the brief scuffle that followed ended with Makû's head rolling in the mud. That's  what this game is about.			"

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor follows a ranger named Talion stationed at the Black Gate, which soon becomes overrun with orcs as Sauron makes his return. Talion dies in the conflict, but due to a blood ritual is unable to pass on and instead merges with a wraith named Celebrimbor. This ""brings him back to life"", so to speak, and sets him on a path of vengeance to kill The Black Hand of Sauron for reasons I won't spoil. (It happens right at the beginning, but still!)The story is not the game's strong point. In fact, Tolkien purists will be mostly upset with it, especially with any events relating to the Second Age, due to the developers taking some ridiculous dramatic liberties with the source material. Gollum is also randomly squeezed in and plays a surprisingly sizeable part in the story. Even Saruman is briefly up to no good with yet another possession of a monarch, though he does not ever appear directly. Both of these sort of scream 'fan service' to me, but whatever, I rolled with it. It's still an enjoyable story, just not as much as it could be.This is fine, however. Not every game needs a good story if it has the game mechanics to back it up, and Shadow of Mordor has those in spades.First of all: the Nemesis system. Never have I seen something quite like the Nemesis system in a game of this genre. It is absolutely fantastically designed. It is a dynamic AI system that populates the world with a hierarchy of orc war chiefs and captains who freely roam around the map taking part in their own missions to gain power, and in the case of captains, move further up the hierarchy. Each of them comes with a long list of strengths and weaknesses that change how you fight them completely every single time. One might be resistant to all forms of attack, but has a fear of mounted beasts. So, you mount up atop a caragor beast, which you can find trapped within cages or freely roaming the wilds, and chase that cowardly orc captain down as he runs from you in abject terror. Others require that you kill them with stealth takedowns or combat finishers or any other of the dozen or so options due to most of them having immunities and strengths to counter you.As you progress further in the game and unlock more abilities, you will find more and more ways to fight your enemy and mess with the system, such as branding war chiefs and captains, commanding them to betray each other or aid you in the assassination of other captains, or instead you can send them death threats which will dramatically increase their power ratings, reducing their weaknesses and increasing their strengths for the chance of better loot. This is almost essential as war chiefs recruit captains to be their personal bodyguards, which will often turn a one on one fight into a one on five, unless you use the Nemesis system to your advantage. You can even brand captains mid-combat to turn them against their war chiefs right in the thick of it, which is something that can quickly turn the tide of a battle that is proving overwhelming (and many of them will).The war chiefs and captains are captivating. They are ALL fully voiced with their own personalities, names and unique appearances. There is an endless supply of them due to the random generation, but it is so well designed. Every time you run into one, a small cutscene plays as they howl some insult at you or personal challenge in their grotesque yet strangely loveable accents. They also react to and remember past events. If you beat one to near death and he escapes, he will remember the next time you meet and angrily comment on it or any facial scars you gave him. Another cool feature is the way death is handled. Because you’re a wraith, you can’t truly die, you just revive at a nearby tower. However, if an orc kills you, he will be promoted. This includes the lowly grunts, who will receive promotions to captain if they succeed at finishing you off. This means that with every death, your enemy gets stronger. If you run into a captain or war chief who is too difficult for you, he is just going to keep getting stronger and stronger. This can also turn certain orcs into your nemesis (can also happen if you beat a captain and they survive their injuries), which will power them up even further. They will also actively hunt you down while you’re minding your own business and attempt to kill you. This can be used to your advantage however, as the more power an enemy has, the better and higher level the loot they drop will be.The combat. It is an identical system to what the Arkham games have, BUT I found it to be an even more satisfying and seamless experience when going from move to move (mostly thanks to being able to cancel any animation at any time), and also better animated, if you can believe that. There are a variety of executions and takedowns that, though I saw them repeating often, I never tired of. Some of these are things of gory beauty. Orc heads flinging all over the place as you blink around with Shadow Strike (a move that allows you to aim your bow and teleport next to your target) executing enemy after enemy, with most of them running in horror before your terrifying wraith powers, becomes a very common and satisfying sight. You are equipped with a sword, a bow and another sword, but with a broken blade which Talion uses as a dagger for stealth kills, and each of them can be upgraded with runes, which provide decent and varied buffs to your attacks. You eventually also unlock throwing knives, which can be used to keep an attack chain going, but are also surprisingly deadly at times. Outside of weapons, there are a surprising number of ways to distract your enemies. You can drop fly nests on top of them which will send them fleeing, explode campfires or barrels, poison containers of grog to kill them or fight amongst themselves, free caragor beasts (wargs) to wreak havoc (and even brand and mount them), stealthily brand enemies and then order them to turn on the others, and more. All of this combined with the fact that there are often dozens upon dozens of enemies on screen at once, with the chance of other wild animals jumping into the action at any time, results in dynamic, chaotic and thrilling battles.There are a decent number of missions here. The ones related to the story are interesting, but nothing special and the side missions are more like challenges than anything else. However, they all mix in with the Nemesis system in some way or another, which is enough to keep them exciting and worth doing. There are also missions called Power Struggles, which involve orc captains attempting to increase their own power and get promoted, whether it be challenging other captains to duels, finding new recruits for themselves, holding a feast in celebration of their accomplishments or a variety of other things. You have the choice of helping them succeed, to make them more powerful or to help an orc under your control gain a promotion, or intervene to prevent them from becoming a powerful enemy.Overall, I’d say the game will last you roughly 15 – 20 hours or maybe even 30 hours if you do everything and mess around with the Nemesis system. If you just rush the story and consider yourself done, then it’ll only last 6-10 hours, but I don’t recommend this.Even without the Nemesis system this would be a great game of mashed up ideas from other franchises, but with it, it becomes something special. Everything is built around this AI system and tied together so well and it provides a near endless cycle of content. Expect to see something similar to it popping up in future titles. It is without a doubt an innovative idea.For the time being, Shadow of Mordor is my favourite game of the year. I was very sceptical of it at first, but I’m so glad I bought it. It was a crazy ride.Score: 9/10			"

												This game is probably the most underrated game of 2014. Is it like Batman Arkham and Assassins Creed? Yes, but those are not bad things at all and the game still manages to keep its identity. You play as Talion, a ranger of the black gate guarding Mordor, when your wife and child are tragically murderd (not a spoiler, since its the very first thing that happens in the game). Talion is left for dead but is strangely revived and bonded to a powerful wraith spirit. The two try to find out the past memory of the wraith (who has lost it) and gain revenge on those who killed thier familes and denied them death. The story (which I havent finished yet) is very very good so far. Its not a Bioschock or Last of Us story, but it will definitly keep your attention. My favorite part of the game, however, is the combat. At first its actually very difficult to fully grasp, but in about 2-3 hours of play you will have it down. The combat is like Batman, but much more bloody and violent (which I love) The Uruks (or Orcs) are all procedurally generated, meaning each one has a name, a personality and a list of strengths and weaknesses. Think Watch Dogs and the citizens in that game. The cool part however is the nemesis system which is something I've never really seen before. OK, imagine you are in battle and you begin to lose the fight, and you are killed by a random NPC. In most games nothing would happen, but in this that random NPC will now level up and become a captain. When you are revived you can try to exact revenge, but if you are killed again, then he rises in the ranks again and so on and so forth. You will eventually find yourself building personal vendetta's and rivalies with different Uruks. The Uruks will even remember you the last time and with sometimes have scars that you gave them in a past encouter. This system is unique, fun and challeging and will certainly get you addicted to killing Uruks fast.The Open world is not the biggest, but you wont really mind all that much. The game is split up into two seperate maps, one being the ""ugly"" dead looking part of Mordor. And the other being the much greener and brighter side of Mordor. The graphics are absolutly stunning and the architecture of the Uruk strongholds is really something to marvel at. I havent even really scratched the surface of this game and I could tell you much more, but I'm currently suffering withdrawls from not playing the game right now, so I must go. But seriously, buy this game now, like RIGHT NOW, im not kidding. 9.4/10			"

												I have completed the main story now and have finished 50% of the game after 23 hours. I still have not done all of the legendary weapon missions, and have barely collected any trophies. Furthermore I have not yet touched the Trials mode. So in my opinion, this game has still tons of content that you can explore.I'll do an overview of all positive and negative aspects first for those who do not like to read too much:+ Great story+ Challenging, fun & varied combat+ Mounted combat+ Brilliant animation quality+ Lots of skills, runes, passives to unlock+ Many side missions+ Nemesis system is awesome+ Great character & orc detail(lots of variety)+ Awesome music & sound effects+ Awesome dialog & voice overs+ Gollum+ Runs very smoothly @ 70+ fps, 1080p+ Very bugfree+ Tons of replayability+ Awesome climbing, works better than Assassins Creed Black Flag's climbing... :P+ Good graphics & immersive world+ The Game is actually quite difficult(except the ending)- Endboss is a quick time event spam fest...(though the story ending is nice!)- Side missions become repetitive after a while- Textures could be better- Lousy AI at times- Lack of difficulty slider- The big battle before you kill the endboss is way too easy, my orc minions killed all units within minutes, all without my help...Overall score: 9.0/10* Story(Mostly Spoilerfree):The core idea of the wraith is genious. It basicly gives Talion an extra layer of complexity and mistery that you unveil piece by piece during your adventure. What I found to be very well done is how non generic Talion is . I sympathized a lot with him when he lost everything he cared about. Till now the characters have proven to be interesting, well animated and full of expression.Characters I realy liked where Ratbag the Orc and Trovin the Dwarf.I have to mention the orcs aswell. Their detail is incredible and all of them have tons of dialog, fully voiced.* Combat:This is where Shadow of Mordor shines very brightly. It manages to combine awesome and brutal action combat, packed with skills and combos with the quiet stealth gameplay of a Splinter Cell.You have a bow, a sword and a dagger at your disposal and have to fight your way through hundreds of orc types and other creatures, like trolls for example. The combat stays varied and you always find new and exciting ways to slaughter your next enemy.* Replayability:The nemesis system makes this game nearly infinitely playable. What it does is create unique orc chiefs that you can hunt. Win against them and be rewared with new runes, etc. Lose and they rank up and start challenging other orc chiefs . The best part is if you meet any chief again that you lost against the previous time, they recognize you and say something new and interesting before a though fight beginns.You can aswell make orcs fight for you wich opens so much different intrigue scenarios, were you tell your orc chief to ambush or challenge another to a duel.The game also comes with tons of side missions and you can collect a currency like thing to get powerfull spells and so forth.Then there is the trials mode which I have not touched yet but I'll update this review over time.* How does it run?:Well, unfortunately, I was plagued by a farely large amount of crashes until I found out that I had to turn of tessalation, which fixed it for me. Since then the game has been running super smooth. I'm always above 70 fps at max settings with my GTX 780. The game looks awesome, you realy get the feeling that you are alone in mordor, surrounded by orcs.			"

												Really enjoyed this game. Finished the story, I'd say the Bright Lord DLC is also a part of the story, a bit of a prelude to the Shadow of Mordor. Certainly one you wouldn't want to miss.-If you're familiar with Assassin's Creed or Batman, you won't even have to get used to the controls, with a few slight differences, it's practically the same. This game's also free roam with missions. Which is nice.So you can basically start off the game doing anything; start off with the main quest line, or just walk around a bit, find some sidequests, fight some uruks, do that roaming around thing.Levelling up seems to depend on power to get new skills, and killing chiefs to get weapon runes. Also has a type of ""currency"" for passive skills; you can either destroy weapon runes for this, or just do sidequests and missions.It's rather interesting that enemy chiefs can increase their power over time just the same, so you could search for a powerful chief, but you could also help them a bit with their rise to power, before striking them down. More than 1 way to get more power and better runes. Since you're immortal anyway, you could even just let them win for a while, time will pass when you're defeated, but the hero returns. Which is an interesting added mechanic.The looks of the game are grand, for a 40GB game, it better be. But that's not all; the animations are impressive too, everything flows quite nicely. From combat to cutscenes to the landscapes and creatures, it all looks quite grand and detailed.The story... well, c'mon now, this is Middle Earthen stuff, y'know, Lord of the Rings, there's a whole series of books on the story, what more is there to tell? In this game the story seems to revolve around finding out Celebrimbor's past, fighting the black hand, and of course figuring out how to end Talion's curse. Some interesting twists here and there.Anyway, if you enjoy Lord of the Rings, you might just love the fact you actually cán simply walk around in Mordor...Things I found particularly amusing was the ""Nemesis system""; having 'unique' chiefs as enemies, and the way the enemy chiefs introduce/announce themselves when they find you.They also remember any previous encounters and change the way they ""greet"" you on later encounters. It's quite amusing.Oh, Sméagul and Gollum are in the game too. And have a surprisingly important role.			"

												Really great game and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I spent many hours sneaking by the Orcs and stabbing them, battling the archenemies spawned by nemesis system. The story isn't that good, but gameplay and everything else is excellent. As I've mentioned, the game gives you the ability to create your own Nemesis, tailored by the encounters on the battlefield. To tell you the truth, I was worried that nemesis system would be bad, but it turned out that it was the highlight of this game and the one thing I really enjoyed. If I would compare  Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor to some other games, than my choice would be Batman Arkham (fighting style) and Assassins Creed (stealth) series. What's more, Shadow of Mordor improves on their fighting and stealth formula: decapitating the enemies is certainly better than punching them (Batman Arkham series). Sneaking and passing the enemies is enjoyable too, and sometimes you immerse yourself in hacking and slashing, sneaking and dodging, that you totally forget why did you come to that area of the map and what the hell do you need to do to solve your quest. Yeah, killing Orcs was never more fun!So, what is the weak point of this game?The story. It lacks the narrative, the thing that will hook you on, the depth you need to feel from a story presented in Lord of the Rings universe. Because of it, at least for me, the game isn't worth a second playthrough. But, all in all, it is a great sandbox third person action game with RPG elements I would recommend to everyone.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is an open-world action game in Lord of the Rings setting. I very much enjoyed the game  and think it's a very awesome game.Graphics:The graphics in this game are very good especially if you get the HD texture DLC which is available for  free from the Steam store. Don't mind the warning telling you to have 6gb of vram as it even ran buttery  smooth on my 2gb vram card. The setting itself is very interesting and full of gorgeous views and nice  terrain. The map is not very big but again it's big enough for a game like this. There's 2 different maps  one which you start in and later in the game there's a new much greener and better looking map in the  later part of the game. Game's performance was also very nice even on my weak system i was getting 60 FPS  on high settings.Sound:I think this game has one of the best voice acting in a game, ever. Voice acting was superb and music was  very nice as well. Every time you get to fight a captain or Warchief the name chanting music of that enemy  is also a pretty nice feature.Gameplay: This game plays very much like a combination of Assassin's creed and Batman. Think parkour movement like  Assassin's creed and the combat like Batman. Though the combat is much much forgiving in this game  compared to the Batman games. You get a nice set of upgrades on skills and weapons. Similar to Batman :  Arkham City and the games after it, You can virtually climb any building and that makes the game much  interesting and stealth becomes a very important and reliable feature. The whole nemesis system was  pretty neat aswell. It's fun watching what happens after say, you killed a captain. Captains/warchiefs  are very fun to challenge and finding out their weaknesses to kill them quicker made it even better.The story was very nice and kept me glued to the game till i finished it. Took me around 14 hours to  complete the story missions and i haven't done majority of the side missions or ""busy work"" missions i  call them. Just enough of them to unlock all the upgrade ranks. The side missions in my opinion do get  boring after a while. Side missions include Bow challenges, blade challenges, freeing the prisoners etc.  The game is very forgiving and too easy in my opinion. One of the easiest final boss battles in the  entire world. QTE's for a final boss, seriously? That was the only dissapointing part in my opinion.Talion has sword and can stealth kill Uruks, as well as Celebrimbor's bow comes in handy quite a lot.  Unlike most games with bows this one actually uses it pretty well and i loved headshotting Uruks from   far, combine those with the brutal kill finishers makes for some very nice looking kills in slow-mo.Conclusion:This game is very fun to play. If you like Assassin's creed series, batman series, even Mad Max then you  should get this game. You can easily spend 20+ hours in this game. Story's great,  graphics are great, sound is great and the combat is fun as hell. I got the GOTY version (which includes all the DLC) on sale and i think it's worth every penny.			"

Posted: April 21, 2016
													I looked down upon the Uruk before me. High atop the tower, the group of 6  Uruk below me was hardly a challenge, my blade was fresh with the blood of 4 captains and dozens of Uruk who fell with them. Still, the group was enticing, I knew more must lay in wait. In my eyes to the right I see a large three clawed symbol. A graug? No, a Dire Caragor. This would be it. I raised my hand high to instantly slaughter the dozen branded Uruk near me hiding in wait. This would be my party and mine alone. I aim my bow and flash a hundred meters to mount the Caragor instantly. I swiftly killed his hunting partners and stomped towards the camp. Just as I swung my sword into the skull of my first victim, I see a small figure shrink back as he runs off into the distance. Quickly I check his face. Kaka Troll-Born. He’s a sniveling little thing. I quickly grab an Uruk out of the 30 that are now around me and ask about his captain.Weaknesses: Fear of Caragors, Vulnerable to Ranged, Vulnerable to Combat Finishers, Vulnerable to Stealth, Clumsy, Fear of Burning. Strengths: Humiliator, Hate of Ghuls, Vault Breaker.His puny skills and weaknesses would make this easy. I took aim at his head, a fully charged shot would make quick work of this. My focus was draining as I held trained on his head. I couldn’t do it. It felt wrong. I shot his foot, sticking him in the ground, and quickly drained the souls of the Uruks around me. I walked over to the sniveling wimp before me, ready to brand him and learn about the warchief above him. No. This would be special. He was tiny, had but a few spears, and inspired almost no emotion whatsoever. He would be my work of art.I left him, and with time his power level raised to 4 for surviving the slaughter I left behind him. With a little more confidence, he challenged another Captain above him. Ukbûk. Power level 11. It would be an execution, I had to stop this. I rode to the site of the battle. Just in time, it was underway. As Ukbûk raised his sword, I let fly an arrow straight to his head.“Invulnerable to Ranged”No matter, this would be tough, but it was worth it if it saved Kaka’s life. I fought long and hard, strategically blowing Kaka away so I wouldn’t so much as draw blood from him. That there was the true challenge, but with time I had taken out every other Uruk, only Kaka stood, his new power level of 5 seemingly bolstering his resolve. I let him strike me down, but twice he refused to kill me. Why was he playing these games? Killing me would surely help his reputation, and I had the feeling he could use it. Finally, he throws a spear and kills me. Power level up. Excellent.The next day he tries to prove his worth by challenging a caragor. He immediately runs screaming. Why was he doing his? Was he trying to overcome his weaknesses? Perhaps. Two arrows and the caragor was dead, and his standing rose. Time and time again, Kaka fought and tooth and nail to be taken seriously by his brethren, and time and time again I was there to help him, and be killed by him soon after him. His power level was nearing 20 now, and the sight of him happy with his followers drinking put a smile on my face. But we weren’t done. It took a constant flow of dead Uruk, but eventually, my child had made it to warchief. Funny how easy it is to get promoted when no one else is alive. I branded 5 of the toughest Uruk and put them around Kaka. My son would be safe with them, until the end was to come. And come it did.I walked into the blue circle. Kaka Troll-Born. Warchief. This would be it. I killed the snipers around the camp and watched my progeny walk onto his turf to defend his honor. I could kill him with one arrow to the head. But that wouldn’t be right. I fought hard, the bodyguards I had posted were tough as nails, none had particularly exploitable weaknesses and had powerful strengths. All 5 kills were massive challenges unto themselves, but I did it. With the camp cleared and his bodyguards, it was only me and Kaka. He goaded me, asked me if I thought this would be any different than the previous times. I took a moment to breathe. I would do it. I steeled myself and fought. I wouldn’t exploit any of his weaknesses. This would be done with honor. Counter, slash, dodge, counter. A wild swing every 5 hits to avoid killing him with a finisher. I would do this right. Finally, Kaka stood before me, health green, on one knee. “Get it over with, Shrakh” he said. I wept a single tear, that my young Uruk had come so far. That my child was the most powerful warchief there was, albeit the only one. And he knew about nothing. None of my help, not the hours I put into his success. He was the favor of the Black Hand certainly. But it was time for it to end. I plunged the sword into his chest, feeling pain in my own chest as I watched him double over in pain. With a quick swing, his head was removed, and an epic rune was there in his place. I stood alone over his body, dead Uruk everywhere around me. But his was the only one that mattered. In my catalog of Sauron’s Army, I saw Kaka’s head there upon the pike. Warchief Kaka lived a long successful life, but he was dead now.	I haven’t played the game since.			"

												Excellent Game, Fun gameplay, Interesting things in the game such as if you die to a normal uruk they will be promoted to captain and you can get revenge for your friends if they have died to someone. It lasts longer than 8 hours just to play not to mention the things you will get caught up in such as finding artifacts and the ithildin. Game that is worth the money.			"

												I interrogated an orc to gain Intel on a new low-level captain to hunt from the dozen or so potential targets I had available. I was told he was half way across the map, so I switched my target to someone else. Two minutes later I hear a deafening scream while hiding in the bushes, ""I'VE FOUND YOU!"" The captain whom the orc ratted out had tracked me down, and an intense swordfight ensued. After nearly falling to his sword, I sliced the captain down and defeated his hunting troop. Upon researching his traits, I discovered why he was so far away from his home: ""Sneaky: Sometimes shows up unexpectedly.”Yes. This game is the ♥♥♥♥ing best. "

												I hit the character limit for this review so I will write more on the comments. TL;DR version: Cool game, its just fun to fight multitude of orcs and the personality\diversity of captains will keep you entertained.Story: I am not a LOTR fan, read the first book and stopped in the middle of the second due to having so many characters and couldnt remember who was who. Eventually watched the movie and liked, but still not really a huge thing to me as it is to some people.The game has some classic characters from the series, and I think they fit the story well. But after all said and done, I wasnt really impressed with it, and after two lame battles with quick time events, the ending left me confused since it didnt answer my question, and was a cliffhanger.The voice acting of the characters in the story is good, but they really excel as you listen to the random orc banter in game, they are very varied and fun, the writers and voice actors did a great job in making them interesting.Gameplay: I am going to separate this part in multiple sections.First of all, if you want a challenge, disable all Runes DLC that you may have gotten, they are really overpowered. Granting a chance of avoiding a fatal blow, increasing slow-motion time when aiming with a bow or doing extra damage when you have a hit-streak can help a lot in the beginning, theres even one that makes the character immune to poison, eliminating a game mechanic right from start. Another one that grants those unbalanced runes is the free Defiance DLC, but it also includes a game trial mode and a new character skin. So just avoid using those runes and earn your own.Most of the game you fight Uruks and it starts off frighteningly simple and easy, you just have a attack and parry button and use them all the time. When a ranged enemy attacks, you do a roll (which I fail to do often, and the vast majority of my deaths were due to ranged captains who have an attack that removes 70% of your health striking me as I was focused on the enemies nearby). Eventually the captains you find with certain invulnerabilities and new kinds of soldiers that appear some time later will require a little more diversity in your moves.One of the interesting points in the game is the amount of foes you will face at the same time. As you battle with a small group of orcs, the ones nearby will investigate the noise and join the fray. If you invade a fortress and let them sound the alarm, be ready to fight 30 or more enemies and more will keep coming. At the beginning this will be a little difficult and time consuming, but as you unlock skills it becomes easier since they allow you defeat multiple foes in a short amount of time.Talking about special skills, one you acquire later in the game allows you to command the enemy orcs, by branding them. You can easily build a army by conquering them and making them fight the enemy for you. It also plays an important part in the plot.-Nemesis: The much talked about Nemesis system, is where random uruks assigned to be captains and warchiefs, the game equivalent of bosses, rise and fall in strength and rank due to your action or inaction.They all have different faces, strengths, weakness, armor (that improves as they raise in rank) and personality. There are more than 20 of them spread around the map and you will constantly find them even if you arent looking for it. Its very common for you to fight a random group of orcs, and they randomly appear and greet you before a fight. You can even be hunting for a specific captain, and in the middle of combat one or two more show up to make things harder.They can also be only available to fight in specific missions. When they are recruiting orcs, having a feast, battling a beast to prove his worth or fight another captain he isnt fond of. You can interrupt those events or just watch them unfold, with them gaining strength if they succeed.Some are bodyguards of the Warchiefs, the top bosses who answer to Sauron, who will only appear when special conditions are met, such as making a orc he is fond of squeal, or killing multiple followers with fire to get his attention.The lines of captains and warchiefs can be menacing, sophisticated or just plain crazy, and they all have unique speech for each situation. They can remember if you run away from them calling you a coward, or if they ran from you, for a strategic retreat. They comment if you are surrounded by enemies, sneaked around to attack him or if you kept ""killing"" them but they came back (one captain I killed 3 times, the last fight removing his head. But he later appeared with a mask, swearing vengeance... surprising and amusing me to no end).They all have strengths and weakness that you should pay attention to, specially at high levels. You can find a captain\warchief who is afraid of nearly everything and make him a easy target exploiting his weakness, as a example by burning him, or insta-killing him with a stealth or ranged attack, or fight against one who is a warmaster with fire weapon and do a devastating grab attack and have a sequence of blows that you must parry each, coupled with invulnerability of stun or regular strikes. They can become stronger if you enrage them. One of the possibilities is a hate for a beast called Caragor, if you bring one to battle (or they accidentally appear), you will make him angry and stronger.They are a great addition to the game. In one case I fought a captain, almost beat him but he got enraged for ""fear of losing"" but  immediately started to run because a captain he dislikes appeared soon afterwards, triggering his ""fear of rival"". You can get a lot of unique situations that you cant predict due to this.Remember the special skill I mentioned before? With it you can dominate captains who are bodyguards of a warchief, and make them betray him and fight along your side when you finally meet him. And if you brand a warchief, you will be able to make him do a riot and along with the orcs he commands attack another warchief-Stealth: Stealth is another part of the game. Even if you dislike this, fret not. The ones that are essential to missions are rare and quite easy if you dont aim for the extra objectives. I found it to be a good way of dispatching Orcs in fortresses, but if you just prefer to go guns swords blazing, thats completely doable. The optional stealth missions can be a little challenging for people who arent used to sneaking around, but I find them to be fun and forgiving on the difficulty scale.Expansions: The game have some challenges (trials) and two expansions. The challenges are interesting but unfortunately they give a bonus if you are fast enough, and I hate fighting against the clock, so I didnt have much fun trying to hurry up and kill the captains and warchiefs as quickly as I could. My brief review of the expansions will be from memory of 3 years ago so I wont give much details on it, sorry. Look for them in the comments.Verdict: Overall this is just a fun game to play, and if you are a LOTR fan it will probably be even better. Like all games it will be repetitive, specially if you aim for doing everything available on it, but you dont care because you are just mowing down orcs and having fun finding the weakpoints of the captains\warchiefs. The expansions are nice but not something to write home about.			"

												UPDATE: This review seems to have made some people mad, so I feel like I should clarify something. When Steam asks the reviewer to give a thumbs up/thumbs down to a game, the question isn't ""Did you enjoy this game or not?"" It's ""Do you recommend that other people buy this game or not?"" There's a huge difference between these two things. I enjoyed the game, but I do not recommend it, for a number of admittedly nitpicky reasons, but ones that I think will prevent most gamers from enjoying it as much as I did.You're welcome ti disagree with that, but I felt like I needed to clarify what the ""thumbs down"" really means in this case.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have nearly 50 hours on record and have 100%ed this game. Obviously, I enjoyed it enough while I was playing it to get everything done.So why the thumbs down? It all has to do with the context in which I enjoyed it, and the game's design choices. Stay with me and I'll explain what I mean.TL:DR VERSION: Inessential stealth-based open world game that adds nothing to the genre except the Nemesis system, which is actually implemented rather poorly.LONG VERSIONMost of this game is OK but not great. It has good-to-great graphics and runs very well on most cards. The ground and foliage sometimes look so-so, but the character models (both in cutscenes and in the game engine) might be the best in any game to date. The core combat, stealth, and missions are about halfway between the Assassin's Creed model and the Arkham Asylum systems - better than the former but not as good as the latter. There's a decent variety of activities but nothing that you haven't done before in other games. Combat and stealth are both pretty easy and there's no option to increase the difficulty. Keep this in mind, we'll come back to it.The one thing the game does very well is the Nemesis system and manipulating the Orc army with the Brand ability. Here's how it works if you're not familiar: You have an in-menu diagram showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Captains and Warchiefs of Sauron's army, who are essentially the game's bosses. It also shows you their various rivalries and loyalties. If an Orc kills you, he can be promoted to captain and gain power, skill, and influence, or if he's already a captain, he'll be given more responsibility. He then becomes your Nemesis and will track you down and try to kill you again. Also, you can influence the evolution of the Orc hierarchy to your advantage, both through the elimination of certain captains and through the use of the Brand ability. This ability, which you gain about halfway through the main story, allows you to force an Orc (and his followers, if he's a captain) to do your bidding and you can instigate factional warfare within the Orc army. This can help you progress in the story more easily because you can fight battles by proxy rather than directly.Overall, the loyalty system and the Nemesis system are very cool ideas and an impressive display of AI programming. They bode well for the future of AI and story development in other games.But here's where the big problem lies: The game never pushes you to really take advantage of the Nemesis system. The development of the Nemesis system relies on you dying a lot, but the basic combat is so easy this doesn't happen. Without a decent number of deaths, the system just doesn't develop the way the game's makers intended it. Also, because the combat is easy, you never really need to actually take advantage of the faction warfare to progress through the game. There's no reason to go out of your way to create a showdown between two captains when it's so easy to kill them on your own.If the developers had made the combat more difficult, the player would have more reason to use the Nemesis system and the development of the game world would be much more interesting. If you died a lot and it caused the world to progress in unexpected ways, the game would be more like Dark Souls, a game that uses the consequences of dying in a very interesting way. Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system has the potential to have the same thing happen, but the ease of combat prevents the emergent gameplay from really occurring as much as it could.For the player, this means that the majority of the time you spend in Shadow of Mordor you are just doing the same old open world activities and third-person brawling that you've already done dozens of times in Arkham and AC games. This alone isn't particularly compelling if you're an experienced gamer. You have to actually intentionally die and intentionally avoid winnable fights to make the Nemesis system work the way it should, and that's not much fun.I played SoM before I played any AC or Arkham games and so I still enjoyed it quite a bit, but I've played about 20 games since then, including games from both of those series, and I can see how the core of SoM is just a rehash of those games. So, overall I think most experienced gamers will find that SoM is mostly just another familiar open world game that's probably not worth their time. The Nemesis system is cool, yes, but it can't make the game great on its own - it needs challenging combat to complement it. Since Shadow of Mordor lacks that combat challenge, the Nemesis system, and by extension the whole game, falls flat.			"

												This is one beautiful and fun game. The gameplay feels a lot like Assassin Creed with a bit of Batman thrown in. But the combat, which is the most important part of this game is done very well. It feels very satisfying to play and kill Uruks. Controls are solid, and at least with a keyboard and mouse I didn't have to change anything from the default controls. The game beginning is very engaging, but it slows down soon afterwards especially once you get stuck in the side quests, which are not very fun. The main story though is certainly fun, and towards the end it gets even better. The voice acting is top notch, especially for the Bright Lord. The cinematic are done very well and fit well with the game.The game maps are quite small so you will be doing a lot of fighting in the same areas. So it might get a bit repetitive after a few hours into the map. However, the game is paced very well and the frequent unlocks will introduce new concepts and keep things fresh somewhat throughout the game.I get 144+ FPS on my GTX 1080 and i7 4790K, so the game is very well optimised for PC. I think its important to note that from start to end I did not see a single bug or glitch anywhere. Only in the DLC, I saw a minor sound glitch that fixed itself in about 5 seconds.It took me about 30 hours to get everything 100% in the DLC and the main game. Considering I got this at a sale, I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I would highly rate this game even at full price. At the discount it goes to, its almost a steal.			"

												Well let me put it this way.Pros:-The Story is really good and fun to play.-The funniest midget of all times is in the game.-The characters and the environment are really well done.-When you die or you let time pass, many things change like the power of captains.Cons:-The Slave quests start to annoy you because its always the same routine.-You can literally just run through uruk camps and strongholds to a mission starting point and have like     50 uruks runing after you, then you press ""start mission"" and everybody is gone and you have full health   and ammo again.--------------This game is fun to play with many things to discover. In my opinion it deserves an 8/10. Have fun.Alpha  "

												Rating 10/10Well this is a fun game to play when you start getting to know the game. It can seem boring and slow at first, but that's actually good. It's not a high paced game where you have to go through one end of a level to another. It's an open world with different challenges that don't continue the storyline, but can give you XP and money to upgrade before you do hit level that advances the story line. You are in the land of Mordor and you are seeking revenge. This takes place before the rise of Sauron as in Mordor, everything is being built. It would be in your best interest as well to play the DLC content becasue it will help you unlock achievements that are not in the main story. All in all, you visit 2 lands, Mordor and the other Ill keep a surpise, after you compelete half of your storyline quest.So again, great game to play if you are chillaxing and don't want something high paced, and happy ORC hunting.BTW, I am still not finished the game, I am close though. But I felt it was a good time to make a review because I am really enjoying this game.PS. THERE is a HD version of this game which is FREE. Make sure you play that version.			"

												I'd heard good things about Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor ever since its release but was hesitant to play it until recently. I have to say this game is honestly just... great. This is some of the most fun I've had playing a third person action game in years. The stealth, combat and other elements are paced quite well and for the most part just work as intended. The ai is a bit dumb in parts but they're orcs, so what do you expect? The nemesis system also makes the world feel a lot more like a living, breathing ecosystem. For me, this game is a much better Assassins Creed. The open world of Assassins Creed always felt so limited and lifeless outside of the main missions because of the restrictions the game set on you. Shadow of Mordor has so much more freedom and that probably has a fair bit to do with its fantasy setting rather than history, but still. Shadow of Mordor is a great game and I'm really glad I finally got around to playing it. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good open world/action-adventure game.			"

												For the longest time I have been playing a game with the same genre like Assasin’s Creed, Batman Arkham series & Hitman series and there's only one main style that I use in the long run which is stealth for close perfect executions with patience. This is a slow process I know but that’s how I've been playing most of my gaming life on most games such as this one.But I took it back after playing the game for about 5 to 10 hours. The game strongly took me out from my comfort zone and encouraged me to play on almost any styles in the game other than stealth and that’s a great thing to me. What’s new? The Nemesis system you say???Well yeah I believe that its the highlight of this game and personally its an original feature that gave me something new to the table.How dose the nemesis system work?Imagine this one scenario where you accidentally got killed by an Uruk with no ranks & eventually made his place as a new captain. If he succeeds overtime be it some power struggles he may possibly make his way up to become one of the bodyguards of a War chief. If and if I successfully kill his leader he will have the possibility to become the next War chief and as each encounter you have with him he will remark the last encounter you had with him before engaging a fight. Although by ranking up means he will develop features and weaknesses will become more limited and much harder to take him down. Yes so that is how the nemesis system works in a way. They will get stronger and much harder to kill if you fail to either brand or kill them. As far as my experience goes, at the last mission I encountered many War chiefs and one of them was the Uruk who killed me for the first time when he was just a captain! Yes to me it got really personal and he was at the top level with epic rune drop, by that time I realize that this system is actually original and fun. I mean, it’s not a cake walk to brand all Uruks because of their different features and limited weaknesses so practicing patience is the key. How dose branding work?Well when you go a bit further to the game you will get an ability to “brand” Uruks & other mounted animals in the game. When branded, the Uruks will be under your command regardless if they’re from the lowest to the top ranks. One of the most interesting commands  I found was sending death threats to other enemy Uruks which can lead to rank themselves up to give more chance of of “Epic” rune drops after killing them despite of them being aware of your attempt. Yes they will be more cautious and alert but the drops will be worth the effort and patience if you will. Branded top ranked (war chiefs) Uruks will be useful in the future but that’s just a giveaway tip from my end. So both systems are actually fun and will make you busy if especially if you want to perfect your run. But here are the pros and cons about the games as I explain each point as follows:Pros:The nemesis system: it’s original and with the assistance of the branding system it will make you busy throughout the gameGraphically amazing: with all the bloody animations in the game on every finishing execution made. Good thing we’re seeing Uruk’s blood and not humans.Solid Combat & stealth mechanics: even though their styles are strongly familiar to known games it was mastered almost perfectly.Interesting Collectibles: Some will unlock important information not just the game’s world but also about the LOTR lore. Versatility: indeed that the game has encouraged me to become more adaptable to all styles and actually I’m usually not comfortable of not using my boring stealthy and slow approach. But on this game wasn't the case really and I’m very glad to use all of them hereMeh: Storyline: it’s not really strong and lengthy but it gave some more info about the LOTR lore.Apart from the new Nemesis system, most of the elements aren't new The storyline’s not really bigMap is big but not: well I thought that it was bigger but it turned out be okay Cons:Occasional glitchy angles: this isn't a new issue when in fact it happens to all third person view games I have played in many years so its still personally understandable. Obstacles can sometimes get in the way: Yes this is an irritating burden especially when doing stealth missions. I am a type of person who likes to use the wraith vision (like the detective vision on Batman Arkham series) a lot because I play stealth most of the time on this game but when things eventually prevents me to go towards my destination I end up off balanced or lose my motive and that sometimes lose my cover and start over again. Conclusion: So in the end, I can say that the game is for those who would like to get to know of the nemesis and branding system and also if they’re a fan of the LOTR lore. Other than that most of the mechanics of the game already done by previous well-known games but that’s not bad. If and when an IP like this successfully delivered a genre that has been around from previous IPs then it is a sign that they have a new competent contender and they need to come up with a new system to beat like the nemesis system. To me, this game isn't worth the full price. Some can wait for it till it goes on sale but I still recommend to everyone for the experience. Its fun, bloody, strategic and well executed at the most.			"

												Really good game. I am really enjoying the fluency between cinematic scenes and the actual gameplay.The story line is solid and there is always something to do in the land of Mordor, whether it be smashing Uruk's heads together or cutting herbs in Wraith mode to replemish your health.Amazing game so far.  10/10Only addition that could be added, is to add Gimli :PEDIT: I played only up to half way when I got this game before release and forgetting about it as I could not really understand the main objective of the game. After coming back a year later it has managed to completely change the way I play the game and I don't know how. Within about 2 weeks I have logged almost  25+ hours on the game.The DLCs are definitly worth the buy which you can get from♥♥♥♥♥for a cheap price. Espceially the Bright Lord DLC which gives you the ending to the game that you really wanted.The achievments are always soemthing that I intend to do when it comes to playing games like Shadow of Mordor and these were exceptionally fun to obtain even if some are generally easy and others are a bit more challenging.If you are still unsure on whether or not you would like to purchase this game then I would like to direct and recommend you to a YouTuber that I watch and you may have you heard of, 2/3kliksphilip who has done a in-depth and immaculate review of the game that actually got me into the game again and again after watching it.Video:

												This game is often praised for it's unique nemesis system, where you killing orc commanders (or being killed by a commander) will directly impact the whole hierarchy between orcs and make previously weak orcs become stronger and stronger. This makes that you are not the only character in the game that is evolving and becomming stronger. This combined with beautifull graphics and combat that feels like the batman games and parkour skills of assassins creed, I can see why so many people recommend this game. And I feel like i should as well.BUT,I was honestly dissapointed. I was bored, very soon. The combat, although satisfying at start, quickly becomes dull. When you learn how to counter attacks, you can fight 2 Orc commanders and an army of 20 orcs around you all simultaniously while drinking coffee. And on itself, I could forgive that. But there is no variation. You will always be the same character with the same swords and quickly flash your bow to shoot a quick arrow. There are a couple skills when you level up, but there is honestly no real character development, you just become more powerfull and combat becomes even easier as you continue. I want to play as an dwarf or an elf, I want to use an axe, a spear or a shield. But none of that is possible.I understand that in a scripted game with a lot of story focus, like in batman. you limit the players choices. But the story in this game is really not worth it. Except for one little funny orc, the characters lack charisma and personality. A linear journey of revenge, without heroism or morality.I feel like they didn't want to spend time on the story after creating this big beautifull open world, which is obviously enough too sell a game when people watch gameplay.So yeah: you like batman and assassins creed, you will have fun with it. But don't buy this game if you want a good Lord of the Rings story or create your own unique hero, because this is something this game doesn't have.			"

												Rûkdûg the Merciful had tormented me to no end.Our first encounter had been amongst some ruins where a pack of Uruk were roaming. I had rushed in, murdering many of the beasts until a filthy cannibal by the name of Ghâm challenged me, wretched sword in hand. He was a worthy foe, but in the end, the sight of fire turned him into a coward, and as he circled around to flee I stabbed him repeatedly so as to show the nearby brutes how weak they were. Then, as I reveled in my glory, Rûkdûg appeared wielding a filthy blade. He was swifter than any orc beast I had fought, and I was quickly losing control of the battle. I could hear more Uruks shrieking as they charged to join Rûkdûg, my strength was fading, and I could not run. Then as my eyes began to lose their sight, a sign of the coming quietness of death, Rûkdûg looked at me and told me that I was not worth the kill. He sheathed his blade and slowly walked away as a mad pack of Uruk swarmed around me and the world swirled into silence.Our encounters went on like this for days. As best as I could tally them, he had left me to die more times than could be counted on the fingers of my hand.Then, on the lonely edge of a hill, just past the plains where I had first met him, I ran into Rûkdûg and a group of Uruk.  I let loose my arrows, slaying some before they could raise their shields. Then my presence was made known and Rûkdûg asked me if I thought this battle would end any different from the last. I let a series of thrust and the beheading of his troops be my reply. With a few more slashes, all of his men fell and it was just us there on the edge of that cliff.We were equals in combat, that much was surely true. As I got a quick swipe in with my blade, he would return it back to me. With each stab and cut, we both painted each other with wounds and scars. Neither of us could clearly see a victory. He even continued to fight me as the death grew in my eyes, as the grasp of expiry weakened me. And that was his mistake. A well time dodged left me a hair's breadth away from his sword, and with this chance opening I let loose a series of nimble and blind slashes, carving into his body. He was deranged now, making dangerous mistakes with his weapon. I dashed quickly to the left as he threw his body into an overhead chop, leaving his back against the open air. With one deft blow, I sent him over the edge of the precipice. He let out a frightful cry just as I heard the ground receive his broken body. All of those times he had afforded me his mercy by leaving me to die by the hands of his underlings, Rûkdûg the Merciful now lay to rot in the sun.I climbed down to see the body of my worth foe. I looked at his lifeless eyes and stepped closer to the mangled face that had lost the calm composure it used to wear in battle. I stooped down, as one does to see the tracks that lay on the earth. Then I stood again. And again I crouched, then stood, and crouched again, and stood...---Seriously though, Shadow of Mordor is a pretty fun game. Combat follows along the rhythmic nature made famous by Rocksteady's Arkham series with a bounty of skills and upgrades to bolster the standard counter, dodge, stun, and attack found in contemporary action games. The speed and motion found in this game make traveling between missions and combat fun: there are some mounts, a quasi-teleport to unlock, and your character can skillfully traverse almost any obstacle. The stealth is rewarding enough for anyone to enjoy, even if the arsenal here pales in comparison to general combat. The skills you can unlock feel great, and there is a light looting elements with Runes that is not necessary to survive. The nemesis system is no doubt the highlight of the game. Dramatic cameras, names, and retorts all build up these little stories as you slay orcs. It’s a system that works excellently and highlights the games second strongest aspect (combat).  As someone who generally does not like open worlds (due to them feeling too empty for comfort), this was a really enjoyable game.The main plot and characters are so bland I had to put one hand in a blender to stay awake during cutscenes, but every other aspect of the game more than makes up for that. I do wish I still had a fully functional left hand, but that's the price I pay for being dramatic.			"

												2000 years after the happenings of the original Lord of the Rings, Mordor rises again and Sauron returns.You are a captain of the townguard, who seeks revenge for his family which was killed by the Uruks.A big open world of 2 areas is free explorable, a dynamic opponent system creates a perfect endless playability and this game is like a dream come true for Lord of the Rings fans, because you can slay down Saurons Officers and armies into eternity.The game impresses with the graphic engine, especially rain, the dynamic weather system is great....the sound and ambience is perfect, the overall difficulty decreases by mastering difficult competitions for expierence, this is a great balancing model.Rating:Graphic 10/10Sound: 9/10Gameplay 9/10			"

I did have a glitch where one orc kept coming back to life more powerful after killing him. By the tenth time I ran into him, he had a bag over his face and was quite upset about it.			"

												This is a hard review for me to write, largely because while Shadow of Mordor is a very innovative game it feels very stuck in traditional sandbox genre conventions.Stylistically the game is very rooted in the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings movies. From the characters, to the aesthetic of the wraith mode to the landscape of Mordor it's all very familiar if you've watched those movies. In this regard it's a very familiar game to look at, and it's also a very graphically pretty game.In terms of gameplay the game plays very similarly to Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham Asylum. The biggest thing that anyone talks about when it comes to this game is the Nemesis system. In Shadow of Mordor every Orc/Uruk captain has a name, a backstory, a different fighting style and addresses the player differently depending on whether you met them or not. For instance, if you die to a particular captain they not only increase in rank but they point it out if you meet them again. This makes the story seem much more gameplay driven than you're normally used to in sandbox titles. They also have their own political interplay between each other regardless of what the player does to try and influence it. The world feels much less static than the vast majority of sandbox games as a result.Indeed all of this stuff is great. However my biggest problem with the game is it feels trapped trying to mimic other popular games. The general control scheme is near identical to something like Batman Arkham City, and the wide open sandbox and laundry list style sidequests are very in-line with Assassin's Creed. However it feels very stripped down and streamlined compared to those two, and the general gameplay itself while familiar is very restrained. All you do in this game is kill orcs. And while that is a great idea for a game in-of itself I felt myself wishing it could've been about more.The storyline is also very derivative and I found myself enjoying the characterization of the Orcs/Uruks far more than the protagonists and human characters. Compared to the protagonists, the orcs go through arcs and have personalities that feel very interesting to influence. Indeed the generic storytelling feels like a victim of the Nemesis system. As you spend the vast majority of the game ignoring it to kill more orcs.The game's not bad, make no mistake. It's a very polished, streamlined and innovative title, and for the majority of players what I'm talking about won't seem like flaws at all. I just find myself wishing the game tried to innovate as much in the storytelling and general sandbox gameplay as it did with it's Nemesis system. Since it really does play it safe in those two areas.			"

												If it's okay with you to take a few steps away from the original LotR canon in favor of a good gaming experience, then search no more. Shadow of Mordor is the choice.The storyline doesn't matter much here, being very generic and trivial. It tells you about Talion, a Ranger of Gondor who got his family killed by Sauron's henchmen. During the attack, Talion is saved by an unknown Elven wraith with no memory of his past. As the Ranger learns about his unwanted immortality, he shares his body with the wraith to seek revenge. That's exactly what those 20 main missions are about.The best part, though, lies beyond the main story, for the sandbox offers you much more. Your adventures will inevitably lead you to one of the enemy generals, introducing you to Nemesis. This system builds a distinct dynamic hierarchy in Sauron's army that allows the in-game world to live its own life. There's always a bunch of Uruk commanders roaming around, and each of them has their own name, rank, unique appearance, personal features, motivation, and power level. You can try to bring one of them down at any time, but it's not always necessary considering their eagerness to randomly fight each other in order to prove their authority. These actions generate side missions of certain types that you can start or ignore. Either way, killing any general requires some intel on his behaviour, as the way you shall approach and act in the combat totally depends on it.The combat mechanics aren't too different from what we've seen in Assassin's Creed or Batman: Arkham series. LMB to attack, RMB for a counter move. The combo meter gets red after a set number of strikes, allowing you to perform special moves that can be learned for gaining experience points and are mostly the same as in Batman. That's pretty much it, but it still feels great thanks to the Nemesis system, so be sure you won't get bored after a few hours.Apart from everything above, there's also a lot of collectibles all over the place with tiny pieces of local history. Despite the game being uncanonical, it's an exciting chance for the LotR fans to explore the most uncertain period of the universe. Perhaps some might find it even more interesting than actually making progress in the story.To sum up, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is definitely a game worth playing. It looks modern, feels fresh enough to stay for at least 15-20 hours - and it brings a somewhat new experience. Even though I'd rather not see Nemesis combined with old mechanics, it's still sufficient as it is.			"

												Ok this game began very well but it became extremely boring and repetitive after a very short while. I really don't get how it was praised by the public in such a way....Graphics may look nice but to be precise the scenery has a very low poly geometry (flat surface, no parallax, very edgy stones). Characters and combat have excellent animations.Combat is as good as batman but very repetitive and well, you do that for the whole game so the skill tree and new powers don't make it any more interesting. The nemesis system was interesting at first, but after a while it becomes just as repetitive, with missions to grind on it nothing more.Side missions are horrible. You see the first, you have seen them all, they are basically challenges with one completion requisite and one bonus objective to gain more xp. Free the slaves, infiltrate the camp, kill the orcs and so on.The main story is quite short and it repeats itself as well. You do the same things and the poor design of the locations doesn't help doing the same things over and over.I am very sad about this game, I expected it to be a great game. It is not that bad, but it's just not interesting enough. How the batman games managed the game map, main story, side story and challenges is absolutely on another level. This is just some weird LOTR action game without any real sauce in it.I wished steam allowed to put ratings (or stars....). I am forced to choose between 'recommend' and 'not recommend'. Well, I will have to 'not recommend' this one although it is not a very true statement.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Middle-earth: Shadow of MordorDeveloper:  Monolith ProductionsPublisher:  WB GamesGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionSome of the better (if not the best) video games featured within Tolkien's legendarium are surprisingly the ones which take an auxiliary part during the timeline of the LOTR trilogy. Shadow of Mordor is no exception. It boasts an impressive map (divided in two zones), filled with details and areas to explore. The size of the map may not be as large as other open-world video games, but the excellent combat system which can be sprinkled with stealth sections, totally makes up for it. This is not a game that gets boring after the first few hours and I'm sure that along with its DLC, it is worth buying it. Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor manages to fill the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while providing a fun game even for new Tolkien fans, as it features plenty of lore of its own and a natural difficulty scale. It goes without saying that it is a gorgeous game at maxed-out detailling, though you will need a powerful system and 6GBs of VRAM for the best textures. It fully deserves the Game of the Year awards it has received from several publications.Strong Points+ Gorgeous graphics and level design.+ Excellent combat system.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Several glitches.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												One of the best games released in 2014 (in my humble opinion), I'd give this game a 8.5/10. If you like brutal action games, please do yourself a favor and get this game.Summary:+ Excellent, fluid combat+ Nemesis system keeps you engaged for hours and makes killing enemies a lot more personal+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Free DLC gives you a couple of more hours of fun- I didn't personally relate to the characters- It would've been awesome if the game had done more with the monster hunter ability- Final boss fight will literally disappoint every single gamer on the planet (seriously, how did that get approved?)I won't go much into the story since I am not a Lord of the Rings fan, so a lot of what happened in the game either didn't interest me or confused me. But if you're like me and you like a game with good, brutal combat, this is your game. It's similar to games like the Batman Arkham games or the AC series, but this game spices it up with brutal executions and other skills. In fact, I thought the gameplay was so much fun that I would just spend hours off-mission killing random enemies.In fact, the gameplay alone is why I'd recommend this game. I suspect LOTR fans love the whole mythology around the story, but I just wanted a solid action game and that's exactly what I got.The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I didn't really relate to the characters all that much. The story is one about revenge, which is as we all know the most original concept ever thought of. The only memorable scene I can remember is one near the end with Lithariel, where Talion finally gets an opportunity to show some emotion.SOM's biggest asset is definitely its nemesis system. Every player gets a different nemesis, and I got two different ones when I played it on PS4 and PC. I like how they call you out on dying that one time, or running away, this makes killing them much more satisfying. Plus, they have strengths and weaknesses to consider (weaknesses slowly fading if you fail to kill them during an attack) so it is not always wise to storm the castle, so to speak. Strategic planning by interrogating captains, for instance, is a much more sensible option.I played this game on PS4 first, then purchased it again on PC and I have to say I prefer playing it on PS4. But I won't go into details about that since I don't have a high-end PC, I just have a laptop and a mouse that was pretty much donated to me. It's probably due to that, that the graphics don't look as good and I have difficulties properly aiming while using the bow. Other than that, this game plays perfectly fine with a keyboard + mouse (though I still prefer to hook up my 360 controller).Oh, and a final note I want to add is that while in combat, the game seems to be a random button masher. An icon appears over an enemy's head when you can parry their attacks, which makes the combat feel easier. Once you're familiar with the game, I suggest you turn that off.			"

												Shadow of Mordor repurposes ideas to create an outstanding action game set in the Middle Earth universe. It takes the melee combat from Batman and mixes it with an open-world structure of Assassin’s Creed. Two large areas are populated with hilarious Orcs that are satisfying to kill and fight. The Nemesis system presents you with random Orc captains that have varied appearances and weaknesses. Gaining intel on these captains allows you to plan ahead and engage at your own choosing. You can even assume control over captains and help them ascend to the rank of Warchief, or just watch them fight amongst each other. Fighting dozens of Orcs in a stronghold is just as exciting as sneaking through ruins under the moonlight. The breadth and execution of mechanics ensures Mordor stands out from similar games and remains entertaining for dozens of hours.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a great game with high cinematic value. The overworld enemies (captains, warchiefs) proved to be a challenge given the right combination of strengths (and lack of weaknesses). The bosses were anti-climatic but that was redeemed by the beautiful cutscenes that came afterward. The challenges were a bit repetitive until you reach the second half of the game where it gives you some more advanced objectives or bonus objectives.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Monolith Productions, Feral InteractivePublishers: WB Games, Feral InteractiveInitial release: Sept 2014Genre: Action, Open World#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationWhat if you put Batman in an Animus? A story about revenge from a man denied death. Shadow of Mordor takes the combat mechanics from the Batman Arkham series and turns them lethal. You can climb real good as well. This game is pretty strait forward. You are a dude and you kill orcs or Uruk-hai for the lore folk out there because they are bad and they killed your family because they are bad. The game features a rather robust enemy ranking system known as the Nemesis system. Which is a fairly intricate hierarchy of Orcs; and just like proper Orc mentality there are plenty of power struggles within. So many that I actually lost track of who I was going after. Which brings me to my biggest complaint, being somewhat of a completionist I tried doing all the 'side missions' before starting up the main campaign missions as most of the time those missions lose their strength or potency after the main antagonist is dealt with. I did so many that I actually stopped playing the game completely and took a long hiatus. Only recently did I come back to finish it all up. The power struggles never actually cease. When I went on my hiatus from playing this game I had not even reached the section of the game that enabled you to brand Orcs, which as it turns out is a fairly essential element of playing the game. So if you are like me and try to do all the 'side missions' first just note that killing a leader just makes the inevitability of another Orc coming to take its place that much sooner; and this just repeats even up into the Warchief section. You earn ability points and runes which are applied to your weapons to varying effects and I had so many at the time I had stopped I had already pretty much maxed out the character. Essentially I am warning you to stay on the path and do your objectives, there are some weapon challenges that are okay but anything dealing with power struggles that are not something you directly want to deal with don't bother. One nice thing it does is if you fail to kill a leader they remember you and so say upon meeting them again. This is very effective at stirring up your emotions. As well as having the occasional Orc leader that killed someone on your friendslist and gives you a chance for revenge.  There are a plethora of other things you can do before hunting down your prey like gathering intel from lower orcs and issuing death threats to the higher ups or even branding lower orcs and ordering them to become a bodyguard of a higher orc so that you may have them turn against their charge against their will. Just keep in mind there is always another Orc so its best to keep the ones you have branded alive and in power. Which is the aspect I missed in my first foray. THE GISTMechanically sound action game, though tedious in spots, monotonous in others. Tautologies willing. With a story line that is not uninteresting set in what is a likely a familiar place to most. Killing Orcs doesn't ever really get boring but trying to play Orc politics sure does. An altogether decent product through to the end.Follow my curation for more "

												Middle Earth has become a very familiar world to us all over the past 15 – 20 years with blockbuster adaptations and numerous games filling the franchise library.  It’s games, however, are a little patchier in quality than most fans of the fictional world would like.  The official Lord of the Rings movie tie in games were just awful whilst obvious gaming genres for the franchise, such as tactical warfare (of the Total War style), have been woefully neglected and left to the modding community.  It’s fair to say that for such an epic and successful movie franchise, it is oddly lacking a gaming equivalent. It’s MMO counterpart provided the first gasp of relief and was a great offering in the classic MMO style.  It didn’t break much new ground but offered a well made, solid game with all the fun grinding any MMO player is familiar with and a lot of lore and ambience that made it distinctly feel like Middle Earth.  Along with Star Wars Galaxies, this was my MMO of choice for many years.  Many years later, LotR: War in the North provided another brief respite in this yawning chasm of missed opportunities and gave us a cracking ARPG that told a fantastic parallel story to the main events of the LotR trilogy.  It fell short, however, of giving us a well polished epic akin to the movies but it was definitely a step in the right direction and I for one loved the story that it told.It took until Monolith’s 2014 outing with Shadow of Mordor before we finally got the game we’d all been waiting for.  A well polished, innovative, slick and gritty game that was worth the wait. The first thing to note about SoM is that it offers a fresh take on the world of Middle Earth.  Thrust into the sparse lands of the Black Gate as a lone warrior against the inhabiting goblins, orcs and Uruks, you take on a role of ranger, warrior and assassin with a really enjoyable and satisfying marriage of mechanics and theme.  Chronologically, the game sits somewhere within the 60 odd years between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings and so it has a little wiggle room for a creative narrative, involving as it does some of the key protagonists in the overarching epic, notably Sauron and the One Ring.  In hindsight, I found the most interesting part of the narrative not being the present day story you play through, but rather the flashbacks of Celebrimbor’s story as the maker of the ring of power.  This was an element of the lore of Middle Earth which I knew little about other than the general details of the nine rings that corrupted men, seven for the dwarves, three for the elves and one to rule them all.  So to delve into it a little further through the game offered a fresh perspective and also worked quite neatly as a narrative device throughout the plot and as a reason for some of the supernatural powers in the game.As a ranger, Talion is both a proficient bowman and swordsman and these two primary combat skills are mapped really efficiently out on a game pad just as they are on a keyboard and mouse, making the choice of either play style an equal possibility.  Switching from bow to sword and vice versa is a simple key stroke or button press and the associated skills for each are just as easily called upon and unleashed.  These elegant controls result in some equally elegant combat, particularly swordplay, which chains together to produce some brutally absorbing combat that is almost identical in design to Batman: Arkham Asylum; compared to which it has some advantages and disadvantages. I always wish to critique games on their own merits and mistakes, but forgive me if you will in this instance as I feel the melee combat in both games is so similar in so many ways that it is, on this rare occasion, helpful to do so.  Starting with the disadvantages, the range of moves and use of additional gadgets isn’t quite as various as the Batman and so the combat can get a little repetitive at times.  This is, however, to be expected as the gadgetry of the batman is certainly unique to him and shouldn’t really be applied to a ranger of Middle Earth.  I also found that certain moves such as stunning targets and then following up with an unstoppable chain of attacks that finally culminated with their head exploding was so brutally effective that I kept returning to that move again and again.  Batman’s balancing of its variety of moves and combos didn’t offer that one definitive killer blow and so kept your options open.  Furthermore, whilst combat does flow really well and it plays very much akin to the batman, it doesn’t quite have the same bone crunching feedback and satisfaction that the batman does, and I can’t quite put my finger on why.  It just seems to lack that certain je ne sais quai.Returning to the advantages of SoM’s combat, fighting an army of goblins, orcs and Uruks means that there’s no real ethical quandary beheading numerous green-skinned beasties.  Whereas the Batman is tied to upholding his image of the lawful dark knight, being a stickler for the hero’s code and not “killing” anyone, a ranger of Middle Earth skulking around the fetid lands of Mordor, populated as it is by some of the most disgusting, evil filth in the land, has no such ethical concerns, and it’s quite liberating!  Additionally, Talion’s use of supernatural powers via the spirit of Celebrimbor, allow for some brilliant combat skills and techniques that the Batman could never hope to achieve, tethered as he is to the realms of a scientific world.  Slowing time, instantaneous attacks over distance, blocking two attacks simultaneously; these make up for the gadgets that Talion may lack in comparison to the Batman.  All in all, the combat of SoM has its pros and cons and whilst it does not quite reach the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman, Monolith’s offering is a triumphant runner-up.  The stealth mechanics are similarly overshadowed by the Batman but that really is the Batman’s forte and it’s probably an unfair comparison to make in any greater depth due to the overall differences in what the games are trying to achieve.  Both are ultimately fantastic examples of this combat system and I hope more games will aim to adopt and innovate these mechanics in the future as they are just incredible fun to use!One gripe I did have with the game was all the extra ‘finds’ that are located around the world.  For some reason unbeknown to me, this has become a staple of the open world genre popularised by Assassin’s Creed and virtually all Ubisoft games which turn exploration into a mind numbing chore.  SoM, with its towers to be unlocked, unfortunately falls into this category with these random trinkets adding next to nothing to story or lore.  A handful of the items provide a little bit of interesting insight but are really not worth the effort overall.  Thankfully, these can be skipped totally and are a tiny annoyance to an otherwise great game.  Perhaps adding to this drudgery is the rather homogeneous setting and scenery that lacks any defining landmarks other than the solitary Black Gate.  Traipsing backwards and forwards through this left me rather hopelessly lost and following the minimap and target markers as much as looking where I was going.  Orientating yourself from known landmarks and changes in surroundings can be some of the most satisfying aspects of open world games and SoM was sadly lacking.  Not wishing to dwell on negatives, however, the graphics, animation and atmosphere are fantastic.  Combat is smooth and flowing with some fantastic swordplay mocap, the setting, as homogeneous as it may be, is very well designed and the green skins are incredibly well modelled with the nemesis system adding fantastic personal touches to the captains and warlords that reflect your prior encounters with them.Read the full write up and final paragraph of my review at my website: https://wingedtankard.wordpress.com/2016/11/15/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/ "

												What a game. Honestly. It takes an already great combat system from the Arkham games and puts it in a fitting world. When the enemy hierarchy system was announced, I figured it would just be a small, irrelevant mechanic. I was wrong.  It is an innovative feature that will change the industry. Just get the game if you are on the fence.			"

												It's hard to make a game with an excellent story. It's harder to tie an original/classic story to something in Tolkien's world. And then, on top of that, to make an overall fun game to play (graphics, gameplay, etc..). WB Games pulled it off. Already preordered the sequel Shadow of War game since this one was so good.			"

												In the 24 hours that I played this game, I beat the campaign and completed a substantial amount of side content. I don't believe I touched any of the DLC content. I played it exclusively with a gamepad.Shadow Of Mordor is a game that starts very strong and slowly wanes in quality. On PC it's a technical accomplishment, the game looks gorgeous and runs like a dream on my high end PC, thanks to a broad selection of graphical settings.Have you played an Arkham game? Then you've played Shadow Of Mordor. The gameplay is a mixture of open combat and stealth takedowns, both of which are almost entirely cloned from the Rocksteady Batman games. The only differences are minor improvements: SoM allows you to run while crouched, to perform brutalisation attacks which terrify nearby enemies, and to drain health and energy from vulnerable enemies. It also lets you to include archery in your combos without losing your hit streak, which makes for a much more lenient hitstreak system than Arkham Knight.Early on, Shadow Of Mordor is a lot of fun. You're free to roam around the flat, desolate plains of the black lands and hunt enemy captains, who can be spotted from a long distance using this game's version of Detective Mode. The combat mostly consists of mashing X towards your chosen target, and then pressing A to hop over them when they try to guard or attack, but this becomes difficult over time. Each hit landed on you drains your energy, and if you don't manage to kill your target you're left to either flee (which often means catching a crossbow bolt in the spine) or to die in the attempt, which means your target gets a promotion and will be harder to kill next time.As intended, the Nemesis system encourages you to develop a personal rivalry with these randomly generated Uruks. Some of these fights were surprisingly challenging and required me to think strategically before I attacked, often interrogating orcs for information on my target and then baiting them to places where I could exploit their weaknesses. That aspect of the game is what people in other reviews have praised, and it deserves applause. It's a good first implementation of a very promising idea.Sadly it all becomes rather pointless once you start gaining XP and unlocking abilities. The Shadow of Mordor skill tree has the opposite problem of the Arkham Knight skill tree: instead of having 100 useless upgrades, it has roughly 20 game-breakingly useful ones. I think I can narrow down the problem to three really bad options: the ability to take a hit without losing your hit streak, the ability to stun enemies by jumping over them, and the ability to spend your hitstreak multiple times.With these I could jump into a group of powerful Uruks, leap over one, quickly kill him and then spend that killstreak to effortlessly kill two more. After you unlock these abilities, there's no more tension, no more strategy, no more use for intelligence and planning, no more investment in your nemesis. Everyone and everything becomes laughably pathetic compared to your skillset. It's disgustingly easy and, after the initial fun of being overpowered wears off, dreadfully boring.You'd hope the game would ramp up the difficulty to keep up with your new skills, but it never does. You remain overpowered for the rest of the campaign. The introduction of ""Branding"" as a late game ability only exacerbates the problem. What was once a fun adventure, suddenly becomes a repetitive slog through dirt brown levels. The game has 4 boss fights, and each of them showcase the limitations of Arkham-style combat as you repeat your most effective combo against endless goons and wait for the QTE button prompt that hurts the boss. It's horribly disappointing.The story has received a fair bit of praise, and I'm not sure why. In spite of paying attention to the dialogue and doing a lot of side missions, I honestly have no idea what happened in the end. My characters motivation was never clear: as a ""gravewalker"" he talks a lot about ending his curse and being ""at rest"" with his murdered family, but his existence doesn't seem particularly torturous, and he enjoys using his new undead abilities to pursue bloody revenge. Ostensibly the villain of the story is The Black Hand, but what exactly that is never gets clarified. In the last act of the story this problem reaches a fever pitch, where I found myself doing things without any context as to why they were being done and exactly what they symbolised. It's a frantic, hurried mess.This game has no difficulty settings, nor any potential for modding that might make it more difficult. Some people might recommend that you play with self-imposed restrictions, and I imagine that it might be fun to play the entire game without spending upgrade points, but I don't feel tempted to replay Shadow Of Mordor just to find out, nor I do want to play any of the DLC I got as part of the GOTY package. The lack of challenge is a huge problem, and no amount of graphical fidelity can make up for it.I bought this game for £10 during a sale, and it's currently available for £30. I'm going to recommend it based on the fun I had in the first 12 hours, but I'd discourage people from purchasing it at full price unless they absolutely love the Arkham games and don't have a problem with games that fail to challenge them. I think this game is sadly over-rated, I bought it based on the hype and while I agree that the Nemesis system is a great idea it only remains compelling for as long as the game is difficult, which isn't long at all.

												After years of SoM just sitting in my libary, I finally decided to finish it and came to the conclusion: I had been missing out. The game is fun from start to end and I enjoyed the RPG mechanics of it. Story was good but I highly doubt its canon. Overall the game is hands down up there in entertainment value and I cannot wait for the second one to come out.			"

												Imagine for a moment if Batman from Origins made love to Ezio from Assassins Creed and their love child grew up in Tolkien's Mordor that would be this game.throw in had a new vengence and leveling system as you carved/stealthed/arched/magiced/ghosted your way accross land leaving a trail of dead Uruk-Hai Warcheifs or loyal followers and you have got Shadow of Mordor.I have finished the main story and still enjoy going in and completing some of the challenges.  My only negitive would be is that the game slowly teaches you as you level making it feel a little like a tutorial, to counter this I enjoyed the sandbox feel where I was not limited to how I wanted to complete the objectives given to me, some of them I had to come back to as I had skilled up and learnt a new attack that made it easier.10 out of... wait a moment that ones running for help *hack slash murder* 10			"

												This is the story of Ratlûg Black-Blade and his ascension to power of the corpses of his enemies and one annoying person named Talion.Ratlûg wasn't always mean or power hungry... ok, maybe he was power hungry, but that's what made him lovable.To begin our story we will follow the annoying Talion person, who upon his descent into Mordor started out murdering Uruk's left and right because he liked it... That is until the hero of our story arrived! Ratlûg showed up and snickered at the person who was killing his comrades and then without much more warning, attacked in a flurry of stumbling and swinging that cut the pathetic Talion down where he stood, thus earning Ratlûg the title of Black-Blade. Next we once again follow Talion, as he stomps around Mordor crushing dust piles and throwing his weight around like he owns the place, trying to kill another Uruk, until out of nowhere our hero emerges once more! Ratlûg Black-Blade announces himself with a battle cry, charging and clashing with the severely outmatched Talion. With insults hurled the two battle for a few moments until... Talion is once again struck down, leaving Ratlûg victorious over his kill, making sure to take an ear this time to make sure he remains dead.Though remain dead he does not, as Talion awakens somewhere else, causing yet more trouble but no sooner could you utter the name than he would appear, Ratlûg Black-Blade to the rescue of his fellow Uruk's again! Charging into battle like the true Uruk hero he is, throwing the weak little pieces of Uruk turds to the side as he attacks Talion. An intense battle is fought and it looks like it will again be Ratlûg's victory, until Talion throws a fire pit at him as only a coward would, burning the face of our hero and causing him to retreat to regain his composure. This victory went to the villian of our story... For now.When next we find our hero he has recovered from his horrific burns that the villianous Talion has inflicted on him, and is once again stalking his prey, this time he's heard rumor that the villian is attacking a Warchief! The great and honorable Ratlûg Black-Blade couldn't let such a thing pass without action so he made haste, charging to the aide of the Warchief even if he wasn't worthy of the great Ratlûg's time. Upon arrival Ratlûg cries out his name, shaking Talion to his very core, now he had to deal with the pathetic Warchief and the great and powerful Ratlûg Black-Blade! There is no way he will know victory, Talion sees this and tries to run away... tries and fails that is. For Ratlûg Black-Blade isn't going to let him get away this time. When he's slain, the Warchief thanks Ratlûg for his service and offers to make him a bodyguard, though Ratlûg shrugs the offer off for he knows no greater honor than hunting down Talion every time he rises.Morale of the Story: Don't let one stupid F****** Uruk get away... They come back and they hurt like hell.Would let Ratlûg Black-Blade be my nemesis for life again, even if he does cheat by countering everything I do and shows no fear to any creature and somehow kills everything sent at him, including me in three hits... 10/10			"

												Let me tell you all a story:So I started this game and played for a few hours. Thats when I stumbled upon an Uruk Captain named Malmûg Black-Blade. He looked fairly normal for an uruk, but there was something different about him. He only spoke in grunts. The interesting thing is, even though he only spoke through grunts and other noises, you knew exactly what he meant. The first time I met him, he sounded as if he was laughing, he didn't think I could ever beat him.But I defeated him.So I thought that was that, and continued on my way, slaughtering Uruk like there's no tomorrow. But that was when an Uruk captain approached me. I soon realized it was Malmûg Black-Blade. He looked different in that he had a burn on his face. This time, he sounded more determined, like he was absolutely certain he could kill me, surely such a battle hardened Uruk like him couldn't be defeated a second time by this puny man!But I defeated him.Once again, I continued on my way, now using the rune Malmûg had dropped previously. Suddenly, I'm attacked from behind, it's Malmûg again, this time with a bag over his head, presumably to hide his destroyed facial features after his second defeat. He screamed at me, he was so angry that this weak human was able to defeat him not once, but twice! He came at me with a ferocity I haven't seen before. It was a difficult battle.But I defeated him.After doing a story mission, I was about to quit the game for the day, when I saw an Uruk Captain in the distance, slowly walking towards me. I figured ""hey, one more couldn't hurt."" so I went to meet him. Thats when I realized, it was Malmûg Black-Blade. This final time, he didn't scream, he didn't make much noise at all actually. It was as if he had accepted his fate, that this was to be the last time he was to fight me. The battle was just as difficult as the last.But I defeated him.So after that encounter, I left the game, came on the next day. I looked at the roster of enemies and saw that Malmûg's body was no longer there. He's gone. He was replaced by another. Uruk are evil creatures and deserved nothing more than death, but here I was, feeling sad that I had killed this Uruk, who had been with me for a few hours of the game.And this whole story I just described was not scripted. This is just the stuff that happens in this game. It isn't a perfect game by any means, but a game doesn't have to be perfect to be memorable.Rating: 8/10			"

												Shadow of Mordor was very close ot being my game of the year. The first thing I noticed is that the free running, climing, and combat are all very smooth and satisfying. And that's what you'll be doing for most of the time.The meat of the game lies in the nemesis system. I spent more time hunting down orcs that killed me than I did doing the main quests. There's nothing more satisfying than getting revenge on an orc that has killed you countless times while you were in the middle of a mission. That organic style of storytelling is far more intriguing than the actual campaign story. This made Shadow of Mordor feel more innovative than any game in recent memory. The graphics are also decently pretty. Textures and lighting look good. The character models for Talion and the orcs also look great. The geometry and level design leave something to be desired however. For a setting as interesting as Mordor, there's not a lot going on. There are no landmarks or setpieces. Just ruins scattered around a relatively featureless map. It still manages to be a fun arena for hunting orcs.I took several high resolution screenshots of this game. You can find them on my Flickr, as well as a gallery on PC Gamer.Flickr album[www.flickr.com]PC Gamer gallery (full resolution 8Kimages)			"

												At first i much disliked this game. It looked like a shameless copycat of all major titles that sold well.On a second impression that is no bad thing at all. Take the best elements of ""Asassin's Creed"", ""FarCry"" or ""Watch_Dogs"" combined with lots of achievements, challenges, sidemissions, a nice fighting-system and mash them all together.The good Beautiful graphics, enough options to tweak performance to your machine. It even supports Ultra-HD-Textures that need at least 6gb VRAM Borderless windowed-mode Excellent soundtrack and excellent SFX. MUCH variety in Uruks. Even after countless slain Chiefs, I still hear new phrases to insult me A living, breathing open world. You can't move a meter without anything living there. Uruks blabber of how great they are, how they'd kill you blindfolded, tell each other if they heard the player killed <insert name of story-boss here> and stuff like that. Even though there is not much variety in side-missions, they still manage to stay entertaining. Fighting feels fun and can be challenging depending on your enemies Collecting money to pay for skills, finding runes to pimp your weapons and simply killing to level up another set of skills does not get boring fast. And unlocking every skill sure takes some time and commitment. If you at least try to get most of the skills, the playtime is rather long. I'm at 30hrs and i've not even touched the DLCs or finished the mainstory Good UI, helpful tutorials without being annoying, lots of lore to discoverThe bad Sometimes it's damn annoying you have no real ""free"" movement. In hectic moments it's often hard to do what exactly you plan to do. Main story can be considered quite short. So if you rush through the game you'll be dissapointed. With all skills unlocked the game becomes pretty easy. Add the right set of epic runes and you're quite the god. But it's still fun mowing through hordes of Uruks.ConclusionVery much recommended if you enjoyed ""Assasin's Creed"" or ""FarCry X"" or ""Watch_Dogs"" or any Stealth-RPG (you don't HAVE to use stealth though) like ""Deus EX HR"" or even (a dumbed down version of) ""Thief"". Or just if you love ""Lord of the Rings"" (i'm not even a fan and i like it)Being a (very good) console-port often shows in clumsy movement, but the game overall makes up for it.Sneaking through an Uruk-Fortress, gathering Intel on a Captain's weak spots to quickly get rid of him to be able to face his Bosss is quite awesome. Or even let the chief get away (no loot) but therefore issue a death-treat to another chief to raise his power and chance for an epic rune-drop?Or poison the grog-barrels and wait for Uruks to die of their grog, accusing each other of that and then kill each other?Or brand (charm=they're your friend and enemies won't notice until you issue the final turn-ally-now-order) key-figures like archers and some nasty fighters and then use an army against an army?Whatever floats your boat.

												Shadow of Mordor is easily recommendable. It features excellent, fluid combat with high animation quality and brutal executions, imparting a real sense of power to the player. The highlight of the game is the rather unique Nemesis system, a system that tracks the rankings of every Orc captain and sets up many possibilities for organic storytelling. Furthermore, in large part due to the excellent audio quality (great voice acting, music & combat sounds) the game does a solid job at feeling like a Middle-earth game. The one downside is the repetitive nature of the game, due to the lacking difficulty and unvaried environmental design, but if you are looking for an excellent action game that's all about massacring Orcs and toying around with their political status... then Shadow of Mordor isn't one to miss.

												This'll be a bit more of a 'Should you buy' rather than a review. It is a great game and I really enjoyed it but there are a few things that really grind my gears that are, in retrospect, massive turn offs. I'll cover the good things first, then the bad things, then provide a 'should you buy' in my opinion.The good things:+ The game allows you to create some hella mad unscripted sequences entirely of your own initiative and decisions outside of your missions. I won't give an example for the sake of leaving it to your own experience if you do play Shadow of Mordor but it is simply excellent. + The 'nemesis' system and all the intrigue, tracking, killing, backstabbing, setups and everything else within was amazing. Defiantly an element I'd love to see more that Shadow of Mordor executed really well. Two things about this especially was how Captains and Warchiefs would get stronger every time they killed you and could, if you weren't careful with how you went about things, become nigh-on-invincible wrecking machines that you're smarter to avoid born entirely of your own fault, and I love it; another thing is how, if a random Uruk NPC kills you, they get named and are promoted to Captain where they can become an antagonist within the nemesis system. + The game, 9 times out of 10, found something to do with the loading sequences. One of my favorite things percisely was how, during the loading screen to enter the game from the main menu, there would be dialogue on backstory.+ Mordor has simply stunning visuals. Although I had to drop my graphics to lowest in the end for my good'ish computer, what I experienced of even low was great and what I've seen of the higher-end settings are astounding. The animations are also excellent - I looked at the sword drawing and sheating animations in slow motion during pop-up bits in the game and they had such a great attention to detail and modeling; something they defiantly looked into in real life. The bad things:- The story felt rather short. I logged 16 hours on Steam before completing the game and, for what the game is, I was expecting at least 22-24. Although I wasn't being by any extent of the word a perfectionist with my completion I was being very thorough with the Captains and Warchiefs. To put it into another prespective, three of the upgrades required 2.5K points each and I figured I'd get at least half way to the second one whilst saving for them but I only got about 1K away from the first at the very most. For yet another perspective, I predicted that the ending would be a bit of a 'false ending' where the story would continue on as it felt far too soon and not led up to, however it was, indeed, the ending.- The last two boss fights are incredibly undercooked; I mean Halo 4 Didact boss fight undercooked except arguably a bit worse due to the setting and higher tension; I mean, just... terrible, just astoundingly terrible. The first major boss fight was very well done with the perfect difficulty for the point in the game and kept me on my toes and the second with the 'creature' was excellent; the standard dropped so much come the third and fourth and it's just.. morbidly dissapointing. They also fall on their own sword a bit here as they get you so psyched up to fight the last two bosses with grand battles beforehand and then just... that. - Although the story was good it was still a bit of a let down. I would have loved to and, quite frankly, expected much more character development and fleshing from the story. More intraparty conflict, a bit more than hints and implications towards a love interest, backstory on the Black Captains, etc etc. On this note, one thing that ticked me off especially was the relationship between the two main protagonists. It felt really unorganic - they were just kinda thrown together with a minimalistic and severely unfleshed approach to the relationship between the two of them and the development of it. - Come later in the game you have the ability to put Captains and Warchiefs into your own 'Army' as covered in the previews for the game. Using this to control the Uruks from the inside and playing some hella mad intrigue was excellent but, once you got control of it all, there was nothing unscripted that you could do with your Army. Why couldn't I call my men to arms and march on some Captain or something like that, let alone something larger scale for the last two boss fights like in the final flashback cutscenes? That would've been hella rad. Should you play Shadow of Mordor? No, not for the price it's at now. Clear out a weekend, buy excesses of unhealthy food, go hire it from your local video rental shop and lock yourself in your house for a weekend. Between the lack fo multiplayer, high price for a mediocre-to-good experience and short story, you'd probably feel much better doing it that way. The most I would pay for Shadow of Mordor is 40 dollars.			"

												Warning: playing this game if a massive Tolkien fan may give you an aneurysm.Otherwise, I give the game credit for basically spacing itself out well, not going too insane with forced content, the Nemesis system is pretty fun if you're willing to die on occasion, and it continues to change up how to make itself difficult without nullifying your skillset the whole game long. This is a pretty solid if not amazing title that is definitely worth playing, and the Bright Lord DLC is a wonderful capstone to your skills at the end.			"

												Having bought Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor on the strength of reviews comparing its gameplay to that of the Batman series (games which I've all enjoyed and recommend, even Batman: Origins), I can definitely say that although not on such level of quality, this game does produce enough enjoyable mechanics on its own so as to justify purchase.You should recognize most of the traditional Batman combat features: hit streaks, counter prompts, vault over an opponent to evade, beatdown attacks and Executions instead of Batman's instant takedowns. What's new is the addition of a bow. You whip your bow out, use Focus to slow the game down, do a headshot and that's an instant kill. So why bother with fighting orcs in the first place? Because midway throughout the game, the focus becomes less about killing orcs than it is about using orcs to achieve various goals; whether it's replenishing your stock of arrows and Focus, gathering information, sending out Death Threats or even to dominate them.Instead of the strategic approach to combat developed in the Batman series (disable guns and gunboxes, batarangs to temporarily reduce number of opponents, comedy smokebomb in dense room of foes), Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, treats enemies as a means to an end, even if that end is to kill more enemies. Strategic fighting comes from hunting the various orc Captains and Warchiefs, who have their own hidden information sheets listing strengths, weaknesses and special attacks to discover. Thinking up a plan of attack is where the funs at, and taking advantage of the orc's weaknesses is a necessary part of getting higher level weapon runes, which are special bonuses for your weapons. This game rewards proper planning, at the cost of treating random encounters as pest-clearing chores.Sadly, a slew of randomly generated orc chieftans is no substitute for a true end-level boss. The writing is the weakest aspect as you're aimlessly wandering about an open map with a whole bunch of mission icons strewn everywhere. You're Talion; your family is dead, you're somehow undead but looking fleshy, you have an amnesiac ghost elf haunting you and you're wandering around Mordor trying to figure things out and making orcs pay. Meanwhile this game is well-padded with weapon missions, human rescue missions, sigil and artifact collection and even the odd fantasy wildlife hunt with your new found dwarven friend! It's the Assassin's Creed world map device right down to the guard tower/quick travel unlocks, but with even less story structure.Not having level structures means you're as likely to get bum-rushed by the same 20 orcs early on as you would later but without any of the tools to help dispose of 'em properly. If the Batman series can be chided for too much hand-holding, what with Batman constantly telling you what and how to do everything, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor undeniably has too little. I didn't learn about interrogations until searching for it on the internet. The grab options, similar story. Which missions to prioritize? Hell, if an encounter was too hard I just did something else.Sometimes you uncover some neat synergy. Brutalize is a stealth takedown variant in which you deliver five fatal blows upon an unlucky victim instead of one. Five is the magic number that unlocks special moves (at least midgame), so you can shoot a special flaming arrow into a fire for a huge explosion kill. Killed five? Use another special move: crowd stun, combat brand, takedowns on fallen foes... your pick! Talion has access to a lot of end game goodies: chain executions, twenty seconds of invisibility, multiple arrow-based teleport-executions! Ride a giant troll-like monster and assault an orc fort Godzilla style! Turn high-level orc bodyguards against their master in the middle of combat! Suffer through the early parts and you'll have no end of fun terrorizing orc chieftains!Just because a game isn't as good as Batman doesn't mean it's bad, even if it does borrow a ton of mechanics from the Batman series. I bought this on Humble Bundle, maybe got overcharged but no regrets. Play the game, start by doing a bunch of non-essential non-story white missions and if you have any questions about anything, check the internet! You should be having fun about two to three hours in.			"

												The works of JRR Tolkien have seen numerous adaptations across multiple mediums over the years, but none more so than games and more often than not, these have been a blundering Unexpected Journey, rather than a triumphal Return of the King. Monolith’s first adventure in Middle-earth, Guardians of Middle-earth, was less than stellar, but the developer has rediscovered its mojo. Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game, one worthy of standing alongside such classics as Shogo, Alien vs Predator 2, and the No One Lives Forever series.Shadow of Mordor is set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The game opens with the death of protagonist Talion, a Gondorian Ranger stationed at the Black Gate. After being attacked by Sauron’s forces and bearing witness to the ritual sacrifice of his family, Talion's soul is joined with the spirit of an elvish wraith who grants him extraordinary powers, and apparent immortality. Driven by a desire for revenge, and by a coupling to his mysterious incorporeal companion, Talion ventures in to Mordor.The fairly basic set-up is elevated immensely by some superb performances. Talion’s mission for revenge never feels forced, and the slow revelation of his elven companion's identity and past is genuinely engaging. Even the addition of Gollum fits neatly within the narrative, and gives Shadow of Mordor a solid link to the film adaptations without forcing it and smacking players like they were a fish on a rock.Voice acting across the board is impressive. Orc and uruk captains throughout the game get noteworthy attention. Each feels unique and has his own distinct personality, and considering the huge number of them that’s an impressive feat.Tolkien purists will no doubt take issue with the lore portrayed in the game but it works well and fits in perfectly with Peter Jackson’s interpretation of Tolkien’s works.Much has been made of the lineage of the combat and navigation mechanics used in Shadow of Mordor, and Talion did at first appear to be Assassin's Creed's Ezio. Free running and climbing is clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed, but it feels tighter and has more weight and momentum. The addition of some superhuman wraith abilities also mixes things up, and helps the navigation system to be distinguishable from others. Similarly, the combat emulates the core of what makes the Arkham games so fun, but it adds more depth, responsiveness and visceral flair. Exploring the land of Mordor is where the game really shows its quality, and is highly recommended. Collectables, upgrades, side quests, weapon upgrade quests, artefacts, and hunting missions are littered throughout the world. They're a completionist's dream, adding more flavour and some interesting rewards.Talion has multiple upgrade paths available to him. Not only can he upgrade his martial skills, and his ranged and stealth based wraith abilities, he also can modify each of three weapons with runes, which alter their effects when used.Everything in Shadow of Mordor is in orbit around its central mechanic, the Nemesis system. As orcs and uruk increase in power they can be promoted to captains. Captains are unique minibosses that can be found throughout the world, and each has his own agenda. They will fight among themselves to gain power, or bribe and bully other orcs into paying them fealty. All of this can be tracked in game using the Sauron’s Army screen, which shows all known captains and warchiefs, their conflicts, levels, and any intel Talion may have gathered about them in-game. Where the system really shines is how these captains interact with Talion. A grunt will automatically be promoted to captain status should he defeat Talion in combat. This will allow him to gain new skills and strengths. He will also remember Talion when they meet again. Each defeat at the hand of a captain increases their power.Every captain will remember and remark on their previous encounters with Talion, be it victory, defeat, or if they fled. All of it adds another dimension to their personality and further individualises them. What's truly remarkable is how organic it all feels. Each and every encounter seems fresh and completely unique. With Nemesis, Monolith has what might fairly be considered the best emergent videogame system ever made.The core story in Shadow of Mordor could feasibly be hurried through in a dozen or so hours, but the constantly evolving and escalating conflict within the Nemesis system and the huge number of side quests can easily double or triple that. In any case, the joy in Shadow of Mordor is not measured in hours played, but in the accumulated swords of defeated orc captains. Shadow of Mordor is a triumph, and even a slightly flat ending and some repetition cannot diminish the overall quality of the game.			"

												A head whacking, orc face stabbing good time this is. Gameplay is like a combination of Assassins Creed, Dishonored, and Tomb Raider but set in the Tolkien universe. There are a large variety of missions and quests to do most of which involve killing orcs which while repetitive I just can't seem to get enough of. Orc captains level up and become your Nemesis if they defeat you in battle and they remember you and taunt you at your next encounter. Nicely done cutscenes tell the story as you complete main quests.You gain power and ability points to spend by completing missions and you can of course upgrade your weapons and choose your abilities care of one those multi-branch skill trees. Graphics and sounds are superb as is the voice acting.The built in photo/screenshot editor is the best I've ever seen in a game. It's almost a mini game itself and lets you really dress up and add dramatic cinematic effects to your screenshots.I definitely recommend this one if you like any or all of the below:A. Stealth gamesB. Mercilessly slaughtering orcsC. Are a fan of the Tolkien's Lord of The RingsD. Like fighting games or action RPGs			"

TL;DR: Good game all around, well optimized; don't need to be a LOTR fanatic to enjoy it.Shadow of Mordor does many things right and has few drawbacks for gameplay. As many people have referenced, the gameplay is eerily similar to Assassin's Creed + Far Cry in terms of stealth tactics, parkour traversing, and stronghold warfare. Combat is very fluid; fighting huge groups of enemies at once is enjoyable as you slice them back and forth while trying to avoid getting hit and maintaining a hit streak in order to unleash special combat finishers and executions. My only gripe about the combat is that the final boss encounter is a QTE sequence. The visuals and graphics are very nice. Game looks beautiful in pretty much any situation whether it is sunny, raining, or nighttime. Cutscene video packages are well done and execution scenes are gorily satisfying.As for the story, (from the perspective of someone who knows next to nothing about LOTR) the main storyline doesn't feel very fulfilling as time progresses. I expected a story of revenge to end on a more satisfying note, but that is my personal opinion. The DLC stories expand upon the main campaign through expeditions with the other characters as seen in the main story. If game is on sale, I would recommend a try at Shadow of Mordor.			"

												Where to start with this game? There are a lot of things I like about it.The open world aspect is really great. There is always a place to go and something to do, mainly kill everything in your path though after I got the brand ability, I just ended up branding half of Mordor instead of killing them. Seeing half of Udun or the Sea of Nurnen having more blue markers than red ones made my day, especially when I either a.) made them all attack the other bad guys or b.) killed them all with a button press. The scenery was also beautiful even though I had most of my textures on low (this game made me realize that my once beastly PC needs an upgrade). Its a pretty intensive game, so you'd need some decent/good hardware to run this at maximum settings. The gameplay is pretty good, its easy to pick up and its not convoluted either. Its like Assassain's Creed, but, imo, better and not so annoying since you are, basically, a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off warrior who is out to slaughter everything for VENGENCE. Killing everything and almost everyone you meet is a very fun/good option. Fighting captains and warchiefs was pretty cool, but I really liked how I could make an ordinary orc into a warchief by simply dying to them and then directly (or indirectly) helping them in their challeges and freeing up spots in the the Uruk ranks, making them the strongest baddie in all of Mordor and then getting them promoted to warchief. You don't even need to brand them to do this, they can still be an enemy and there is some sick satisfaction with making them the top dog then breaking them.I also liked the Nemesis system and how some orcs would come back from being ""dead"" just to fight me. Although this was more prominent at the begining of the game (mainly due to the skills I acquired later on that, I guess, made it impossible for this to happen) but it was awesome. There were a few orcs that followed me in an attempt to avenge their disgrace, but the one I remember vividly was Duraga the Poet. This one orc was pretty much following me around and attacking me at every chance it had. I fought this orc about 15 or so times before I finally beheaded the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it never bothered me again (I guess having no head kinda kills the aspiration for vengence). But it was cool because it made the game more interesting. Yeah, you can expect some orc captains to hunt you down, but these ones came out of nowhere and ambushed you at the worst of times. I was in a city and the alarm was sounded when Duraga attacked me once and it was a nightmare trying to escape and fight him at the same time, lol.With all the good things to say about the game, I do have my complaints:1.) There needs to be a difficulty setting for the game. At first, it wasn't as easy just starting out, but it became far too easy to kill and wreck everything by the end of the game due to the abilities you can unlock. Stealth was just easy mode and, aside from captains/warchiefs who were immune to it, stealth attacks are basically a one shot kill for everything or do a significant amount of damage. While it is nice to reward the player for not going in swords blazing, I also think that I should have a challenge outside of the warchiefs by the end of the game. I would like to see more aggressive AI in regards to this so that it keeps things more interesting as I could easily get into an area and NOBODY was hunting me down or trying to find me. I just went to them and killed everyone.2.) More content. You mainly go into two big areas throughout the game. The main quest is really short and also necessary to unlock certain abilities. By the time you have unlocked all quest abilities, you are pretty much 75% through with the game. Most of my time in this game was spent killing things and causing havoc. If I had went for the main quests first and not bothered with the optional quests (there are a lot more optional quests), I would have been really disappointed in the game. There just needs to be more content added to this game, more areas, more missions, maybe even more bad guys with different abilities that kept me from being so stealthy and such.3.) Nemesis sytem needs to keep up with the player. Above I had stated I was getting harassed by orcs that came back from the dead and some orcs would also come after me/try to find me in order to kill me. But that pretty much stopped not very long after I unlocked a few abilities. I want more Duraga the Poets coming back♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at me because I humiliated them so much. I would also like to see them come back stronger as well. 4.) More aggressive AI behavior. In point 1, I stated this, but I really think that the AI should be trying to seek me out as well. In the beginning, sure, you aren't well known and you are just this silly ""Tark"" to the orcs. However, by the end of the game, these guys are practically telling stories about you, yet there are no hunting parties of orcs looking for you and no captains trying to claim you head for fame and fortune. Why is that? Shouldn't they be at least trying if you are that amazing? I guess I'm too scary to find by the end game to actually come after...Aside from those complaints, I feel this game is still great and very deserving of the praise it has gotten so far. This game is basically one of the fabled ""good"" games that spring up every so often and actually keeps you entertained. If you liked Assassains Creed, enjoyed the Lord of the Rings books/movies,  or like open world game where you kill things, you'll most likely enjoy this game.			"

												Wow, I was really worried that this game was going to be a dissapointment, but it turned out to be so much more than I ever imagined it could be. The graphics are lush and beautiful and I didn't see any glitches throughout my entire playthrough. The fighting is fun and you can switch things up on the fly and kill an entire fort's worth of never ending spawning orcs once you get the hang of utilizing all of your moves, and there are a bunch of moves. I love the super powered talent for each tree (3 total) of fighting styles. 15 seconds of mayhem once you have killed enough orcs using the style you are charging the bar for (3 seperate bars), and the bar stays charged until you use it. Within those 15 seconds you have unlimited:- normal and fire arrows (once you unlock the fire arrow talent) and focus, which slows time down to a crawl- dispatch (execution), combat drain/brand, wraith flash, and wraith stun- stealth with non detectable invisibility with ability to dispatch and drain.The nemesis system is deep enough to keep you working on it to figure out what killing a captain will due versus using him to send a death threat, versus using him to become a bodyguard to a warchief, versus using him to try to kill that warchief and possibly losing him and his men if he is killed. There is enough story to keep you wanting to play and complete each type of side quest, with the slave quests culminating in a nice coup d'état against the orcs. The more slaves you rescue from enslavement, the more are willing to help you fight in an area where you rescued others previously. They and your branded orc do tend to get in the way of your strikes seldomly, but it is easy enough to overlook a few hits to your allies while fighting off a captain or warchief or band of roving orcs. I really like the two mounts you can use, carragor (a dog like lion that can kill you pretty dang fast) and the two types of graugs (a 30 foot tall cave beast that can stomp and swipe and pick orcs up and eat them for health). I strongly advise unlocking the ability to use shadow strike to insta-mount them instead of doing the quick time event to mount them. You can use shadow strike from pretty dang far away. The only way to unlock that though is to go through almost all of the Hunter quest line with the dwarf. The animation for the CG movies are impessive and well done, drawing and fleshing out the characters with enough talent to make you feel a connection with them. I would have prefered a little more to the last fight, something along the lines of the Fate/Zero anime to really give the struggle to reach the end game and the act of besting the generals of Sauron a little more emotion and impact. I feel like if I was to show this game to a 16 year old me, I would probably think the future is amazing and I would have my mind blown. Even against todays best titles, this is one to cherish and share. Going into my top 10 favorites list of all time.			"

The main story is a little bit short but the dlc's make it ""longer"" (the dlc supposed to be included to the main game but you know). The story itself is pretty good and you don't have to be LoTR fans to enjoy it.The cons is, this game is kinda repetitive. But if you enjoy kills and decapitating uruks, it will be a plus point.Overall: 8/10			"

GOTY ReviewShadow of Mordor is a great game but enjoyable only for couple of hours. As I started it I had tons of fun, the world seemed huge and full of surprises. However, in no time, it became repetitive and I've lost my interest in it. I was eager to finish the game and all the achievements quickly and be done with it. Story wasn't bad but it sure lacked something to keep the player immersed. I disliked that couple of characters seemed to be forced into the story and then ignored the rest of the game. Maybe that's just me..Gameplay is extremely fun but not for long as I've mentioned above. Combat system is the best aspect of this game. It's similar to Assassin's Creed, Batman, and Mad Max which is a big plus. Talion/Celebrimbor wields a sword, a dagger and a bow, which can be enhanced with runes. They also possess different skills in both Human and Wraith modes. Abilities vary from branding beasts and riding them to flashy wraith's shockwave and teleporting assassinations.Your main objective in this game is to kill Uruks, then kill some more and, finally, kill a Captain or a Warchief (Uruk too). This is a huge letdown since, if I'm not mistaken, you only get to fight like 3 other types of enemies and a few beasts (including DLCs).Pros:● Open world.● Brutal and wide combat system.● Huge skill tree.● Perfect stealth.● Nemesis system[shadowofmordor.wikia.com]● Decent graphics.● Immersive music and voice acting.● Runs good, has a sufficient amount of options and no noticeable bugs.● Screenshot mode.● Challenging trials.● Nice additional content, especially The Bright Lord campaign.● LOTR feel.● Gollum.Cons:● Weak and short story. Feels unfinished and includes forgettable supporting characters.● Very repetitive gameplay.● Not much variety in side activities.● Fairly small map.● Awful final boss fight.● Enemies spawn almost instantly right before your eyes in the area you just cleared.● Lack of different enemies (species).● It's hard to hit your wanted target (captain) with an execution in the middle of a huge battle as other uruks get in your way.Summary: Buy it on sale or from third-party sellers. I grabbed it for ~4€ which is totally worth it.7/10 "

												This season of Orc Politics will rival any Trump and Hillary stuff you can throw at it.I've died so many times. And while that might be tedious for some, the salivating THIRST FOR REVENGE it creates feels amazing. The Nemesis system truly sets it apart from other games; starting to really hate the sh|theads that kills and taunts you is an intrinsic part of the game, and boy does it EVER feel super satisfying to absolutely CRUSH that guy when you finally get the chance.Taking to heart the advice of not getting the health upgrades, or using the overpowered elvish runes, was a must for me. It makes the game as balanced as can be, seeing it has no other difficulty settings. And if you get downed a lot, sure, play on ""easy"" if you like - with health upgrades and OP runes. But you would rob yourself of the best game villain system ever. I actually took the first two health upgrades and regretted it a few minutes later, starting a new game without them, because it was way more engaging that way.In other words: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO DIE. You are meant to, it's the whole point. The game is centered around you being a RETURNING ghostly avenger, not a hero never getting hurt. Even the Orcs you kill comment on this when you dual them and it contributes to the fun.You want to play this, you need to play this. And - short exaggeration - the Nemesis system needs to be analyzed, studied and implemented in anything from Super Mario Bros to your favorite puzzle game. For, sans VR, this has the potential to truly revolutionize the game industry.			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise for me. I was simply expecting Assassin's Creed in Mordor but this game is so much more than that. In Shadow of Mordor you take on the role of Talion, a ranger who, along with his family, was killed by the Black Hand of Sauron. You eventually come back paired to Celebrimbor's spirit to take vengeance upon those who wronged you. Game play wise this game plays like a combination of Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games. Climbing objects and moving around will feel familiar to any Assassin's Creed veteran, and the combat will be easy to pick up for those who have played the Batman games. While the influences are clear and direct, they don't make the game any less original overall. One of the hooks of this game is the nemesis system involved with the Orc warlords. There are a ton of options for how to lure out and dispose of these warlords and while you'll be dealing with most outside of the story there are some that are saved for special story related events. This doesn't take away the feeling of this being an open world game, however, as there is almost always something to collect or a side mission to complete.From a production standpoint the game shines. The voice acting is great all around and the game looks phenomenal (especially the Orcs). My only complaint is that the color palette is pretty much static throughout the game (although this was likely intentional to make you feel like you are in the hopeless land or Mordor). Achievement wise this game is pretty easy. There are special kill achievements, achievements related to the nemesis system, and DLC achievements that will truly challenge you. Even though each DLC comes with a super pain in the butt achievement they do flesh out the story a bit more and are worth picking up as well.Overall, Middle-earth: Shadow or Mordor doesn't fail to entertain and is a great action-adventure game that looks, sounds, and plays great.9/10			"

												Already finished the main campaign. Thankfully, there's 3 more campaigns that come with the DLC.The gameplay has ups and downs. Combat is incredibly satisfying and really makes you feel like a badass. The wall climbing gets really annoying. You'll find yourself constantly climbing on crap you never meant to or jumping off walls and alerting a whole camp of Uruk. At first I was upset with the map size, then I learned there's 2 maps, both of which are very well made.Don't let the beginning grind turn you off, this is necessary to learn the game since things can get pretty complicated, especially when you start messing with the politics of Sauron's army. So satisfying.The main story started out really amazing and emotional, but the ending is totally rushed. The final battle is against 2 of the most powerful forces in Mordor and they're fricken QTE events. It's anti-climatic and very dissapointing.Still, the game is so much fun and I can't wait to weild the One Ring and fight Sauron in the DLC.			"

												Alright, Shadow of Mordor. For starters, if you can run it on its highest settings, it is a beautiful game. The game mechanics and physics are wonderful. It is like Assassin's Creed meets The Lord of the Rings universe. You can stealth the game or run in swords-a-swingin'; you choose your playstyle, for the most part. The skill/perk tree reminds me a lot of Farcry's perks, especially in Farcry 3, which I really like. It's an easy-to-play game, fairly simple controls, and really easy to learn. It only gets as complicated as you want to make it. And for the completionist players out there, there is a lot to collect and a lot of side missions to complete. I still have not done it all. The optional challenges are cool too. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes LOTR and Assassin's Creed.			"

												Shadow of Mordor isn't a unique title. It is mostly inspired by Assasins' Creed movement and Batman series fights. But its a good thing because it takes what's best from those games. The main thing about game which is special is new Nemezis system. It creates orcs with randomly generated skins, bodies, faces and equipment. Each of them got goals and motivations. Some want apreciation of warchiefs and become their loyal bodyguards. Others feel lust for power and by killing other captains go up in orc hierarchy. There are many kinds of mission like feasts, ambushes, recruitments or hunts. Player can intervene in them or just be a simple spectator.The world looks great and it feels really alive. Some orcs go on patrols, others feed at campfires, hunt monsters, etc. Game got day and night system, so its possible to sneak around orcish stronghold when Tallion becomes less visible. There are plenty of options to play stealthy game, so players who like silent hunting will be satisfied. Locations are nicely done, and aren't repetitive so every stronghold will look different. This game is excellent for people who like making their own story. There is nothing better then got enemy with whom you got a long history of encounters. Even killed orcs captains can get back to game if you didn't decapitated him so some of them could irritate players because of their immortality. But I like this feature, and whole rune, upgrades, ability tree. If you like fighting in different styles (open combat and stealth), sandbox games it will surely give you many hours of satisfying play. Maybe it lacks few things in history and some people may criticize Middle-earth game for not being too much depth in fabular way, but I'm very fond of this title.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action/adventure game in the style of the ‘Batman Arkham Series’ but in the Middle-earth world.You play as a ranger who is possessed by an Elf (how this happens is the story, so no further spoilers in this review). This means you have the powers of a ranger and an Elf.The story is very well told and is a sort of prequel to the Lord of The Rings. In the game, you must complete different quest to follow the story. As I have told the fight system is in the style of the Batman series and is very well done and gives a lot of satisfaction. You play with sword/dagger/bow so you can imagine that the game is very bloody with impressive finishing moves. The more you play and complete quests and tasks the more points and experience you gain to level up your character.The game also has what is called the ‘nemesis system’. This is something unique to this type of game. It means that by the way you play captains and war chiefs (they are bosses in the game) are randomly generated and climb up in the ranks of Sauron’s army. It’s your task to kill them or to turn them over to your side.The graphics, music and sound effects are very impressive. I can confirm that the game supports ultrawide resolutions and the 21:9 aspect ratio. I tested with 2560*1080.In game, everything is 21:9 but the movies are letterboxed.I have bought the premium edition with all the DLC. Having played the DLC I would not recommend buying these separately. I highly recommend this game, it’s a lot of fun and very satisfying to play.			"

""Oh, you think darkness is your ally. But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING!""The NEMESIS system molds the orcs of mordor into terrifying villians. When some random orc with a bow takes a lucky potshot at you and is promoted to Captain, you can begin to watch that captain's notoriety grow. At every turn, you can witness that captain recuit followers, hunt beasts, struggle with other captains for power, and duel his way to the top. Anything you do to him will become a part of your ongoing history with him. It can even alter his strengths, fears and personality.You set him on fire, feed him to wild beasts, poison him, throw him off a cliff, shock him with magic, pelt him with arrows or knives, or leave him for dead with a grievous wound, he will come back with a vengence until you chop off his head. You can run into any of a number of these orcs at any time. Sometimes, many at once. Rather than just telling you that your nemesis was molded by darkness, Shadow of Mordor shows you.			"

												if you liked Batman: Arkham, Assassin's Creed, the Witcher, or are a Tolkien fan - get it. The gameplay is a phenomenal amount of fun, with the mix of stealth, supernatural abilities, and extremely satisfying hack-and-slash. You will get to kill a lot of orcs, will be given a lot of ways to do it, and will have to think of the best one. I've spent a few nights telling myself "" just one... more... warchief.""The main story is a bit of a letdown and Mordor itself is not the most visually stunning place, but the game is instead carried by very thorough lore scattered through the maps and a monumental, arching backstory which slowly reveals itself. There are a lot of conversations across the map, and lots of well-placed snark in the cut-scenes. Voice acting deserves a separate praise. Sad Murder Dads wrecking their way through Mordor on a journey of vengeance and self-discovery. 8.5/10			"

												Game of the year, For me anywayThe last game that kept me this engrossed was Dragon's Dogma, Even though ive been playing for 5 hours ive only done one story mission, because im having too much fun hunting Uruks, Ive heard the story can be completed in about 12 hours which is about average for a game of this type, but this game is like grand theft auto in the fact there is so much else to do, just hunting Uruk captains is amazing fun with the nemesis system, the ones who survive your encounter by playing possum are the best, they gain scars and burns depending on what you did to them, only way to make sure is to cut their head off, I thought i had killed one 4 times and he kept coming back each time abit more messed up and hating me abit more.The control system is a mix of Batman series of games and assassins creed and works perfect, make sure to use all 3 weapons as i tried to ignore the bow and suffered for it on many occasion.I cant see any game beating this for a good while, perhaps Bioware can get back to their old standard with the new Dragon age,but after their last 3 titles il wait for players response,rather than payed reviewers.If you like fantasy style games, you cant go wrong here, the game is perfect and will last anyone who likes to explore and just have fun hunting ages.

												26 hours to 100% the main story. Just about to tuck into the DLC.Best LOTR game out there by a country mile. Authentic music and sounds like they're straight out of the movies. The voice acting and dialogue is a particular treat. Its quite 'grown up' compared to the movies... Some of the cutscenes surprisingly more brutal than I expected.Similar combat mechanics as the Batman games, hit, counter, dodge, quick throw but much more forgiving as most moves can be interupted after you have commited to them and there is even a combat upgrade to allow to get hit once and not break your combo, which saddend me a little, as I pride on not being hit at all in combat games like this but in the end it doesn't really matter...Once you get a few of the combat upgrades anyway you are pretty much an unstoppable Uruk head popping / cutting machine. Even on the hardest difficulty the game becomes noticeably very easy, but chopping up orcs somehow never seems to get old.Stealth is odd, all the Uruks should have gone to Specsavers as they can't see you a few feet away and even then you can stealth run up to them and take them out quietly (or not) and there is a bit of AssCred climbing you can do too to position yourself above your foes so you can jump on them and literally traumatise everyone around them.To be honest you really end up not using stealth at all because any enemy within radius will be dead in a matter of seconds once you arrive. Stealth is forced on a few of the missions though.There are some really nice unique game mechanics when it comes to the mini-bosses like the Uruk captains and warlords that I'm not going to bore you with explaining but it makes this game stand out even more.Highly recommended experience.

												Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a third person action-adventure game set in the Lord of the Rings universe.The Great:- Incredibly satisfying combat akin to the Arkham series but with swordplay, stealth, and ranged- The combat is brutal (against orcs) but ultimately more satisfying as a result- Combat is fluid, dynamic, and intuitive- Stealth mechanics feel great (and I don't like stealth generally)- Traversal mechanics are enjoyable in their own right- Game design allows and encourages multiple different types of play-styles with RPG mechanics and environmental variables- Extremely compelling open world that is woven very well into the story quests and narrative- Has three completely viable playstyles (combat with a sword, ranged with a bow, and stealth with a dagger) that are each effortless to move between- Villain interaction (Nemesis system) is the new standard in encounter design- Randomization of villain design (strengths and weaknesses) and setting encourages creativity in solutions- The open world sidequests are spectacularly crafted- The setting is generally beautiful, and the game plays very smoothly- The sheer number of options for catering the game to your preferred playstyle is unmatchedThe Good:- The nemesis system creates almost a strategy mini-game within the game itself that is also very satisfying to navigateThe Bad:- The entire game is so enjoyable that at times the number of things you want to do can be overwhelming (not all that bad maybe?)- In a number of situations (e.g. near walls), you can have some difficulty moving due to contextual problems, but that only stands out because everything else is so smooth and polishedConclusion:This is the best action game to come out in years.  It takes the best of the action games to come before it (Batman, Assassin's Creed) and adds on a level of depth in villain design and encounters that is rarely seen.  Regardless of the type of games you like most, you should play this game.			"

												If Assassin's Creed and The Batman Arkham games had a love child, this would be it. The game takes place in the fantasy world of Middle-Earth, which is of course the same world in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit books and movies. Firstly, if you're thinking that you need to have read/seen the material BEFORE playing this game, you needn't worry. There are definitely references, or characters you may not appreciate as much going in with no or little knowledge, but you won't mind as the story explains it pretty well, and you can of course just look something up if you want to know more. The core gameplay is, as I said, like Assassin's Creed/Batman Arkham games. You'll be climbing, sneaking, avoiding detection much like Assassin's Creed, and the combat system is definitely like the Arkham games, but you're not knocking out baddies, you're here to kill some Orcs! The world is semi-open world, by that I mean the map isn't HUGE (there are actually TWO maps in the game), but there always is something going on. The world also doesn't demand you do something right away, so if you want to begin just killing some orcs in a camp, or getting some collectables, you CAN.When you complete quests, or get collectable, you get an in-game currency wherein you can buy upgrades such as more health or rune slots for your weapon (more on that in a moment). You will also earn XP from these things, or just killing orcs.Now, as I mentioned the game lets you augment your weapons (sword/bow/dagger) with runes! Each rune varies depending on level and rarity. Some let you get health from a stealth kill, or have a chance to get some more arrows with a certain type of kill, and so on. You can sell them for money if you don't want to use them, and switch them out as you like. One of the most amazing, if not THE most amazing thing, is Sauron's Army and the random generation of enemies. Throughout the world, there are regular grunt Orcs, and then there's higher level ones. Now, you may run into any of these at any given time, story missions not withstanding. For example, you might be going after some orcs in a camp, and then suddenly one of them yells ""MAN FILTH!"" at you, followed by a mini-exchange where he taunts you, and you realize this is captain or general, and you had NO idea. Each special orc has their own strengths and weakenesses, which you can use to your advantage, meaning you can't always go in sword swinging.For instance, one captain may be immune to arrows, so you can't snipe him off, so it must be up close...but he also be immune to stealth, so you can't sneak up on him either, meaning you'll have to confront him directly, and he mah not be alone. This is just ONE example. I've had many times where I went after ONE captain, and suddenly THREE more appeared out of nowhere! Then this small fight you were starting turns into a massacre if you don't get away. These moments are both frustrating and exciting. Another thing with this system is that if a grunt orc, with no name previously, kills you, he ranks up becoming a captain, and if a ranked orc kills you over and over, he becomes even MORE powerful, and his weaknesses get less, and he has more strengths, constantly making you want to kill him, he'll even taunt you over having failed to kill him! The collectables are mostly backstory, or side stories to give you a bit of flavor for the world. You get about 50 monies for  each one you pick up, along with achievements if you're interested. The game constantly challenges you, and the more you die, the more challenging it can get, but you also can level up yourself with new abilities so you can level the playing field. There is certainly more, but even getting all the collectables, I have over 20 hours into it, and I'm not done with it either, and I haven't even begun the DLC. So, if you're looking for a really amazing game where you can play so many different ways, and even replaying it will be different, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an excellent choice, one you won't regret. If you know nothing about the world, you'll love it all the same, and if you enjoy Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, you can appreciate references here and there as well. So, get out there, and to quote Aragorn: ""Let's hunt some orc!""			"

												As a big fan of Tolkien's work I find this very satisfying. About the lore The story contextualization on Arda's space and time is really well made, the temporary line presented respects the chronology of the Tolkien's production (In fact we could place the events a little before Bilbo's adventure). The characters who are directly taken from the book are truly characterized (Except Sauron who is represented as a Sindarin elf, however in the Silmarillion his appearance is described mostly like a Noldor), the little changes that were made to the characters stories like Sauron and Celebrimbor to make them fit to the lore aren't abrupt, actually as I said they're almost insignificant and fit perfectly.  [SPOILER ALERT:]   Although in the books Celebrimbor initially doesn't know the existance of the One Ring, it's known that he dies by its influence.  About the game Talking about the game, graphics, mechanics and soundtrack are just perfect; I love the combat style, because it requies some grade ability, being not so hard neither so easy (As Assasin's Creed, but not as easy). There're some little problems in the movement like getting stuck easily with allies and torches or other things... This may seem like trifles, but when you're on a fortress fighting an army, it can make you fail the mission. In summary I love this game, I've just finish the campaing and I still have so many hours left to play. (I have to acquire all the Steam achivements).

												This game is one of my favorite for a reason, The combat is amazing and the orcs haves different personalities which I love, some of them can chase you all over Mordor just to kill you, some of them wants to eat you, some of them wants to torture you, some of them wants to kill you over and over again, some of them just wants to fight you because they're bored.The story isnt that long so I recommended you to buy the dlc's they're great and gives you the full story that you want like the bright lord, fun and challenging and you get to fight Sauron.Its almost like Assassin's creed but better.

												So, Shadow of Mordor... I'll keep it short, sweet and succinct.1)  I'm a die-hard LotR and Middle-Earth fanboy and lore-buff in general.2)  I've been known to be infamous for picking at lore inconsistincies/unneeded additions in games such as this.My conclusion; Shadow of Mordor, while rather liberal in its creation of entirely new species of beast  (Caragor, Graugs, Ghuls et al) as well as its primary characters (the three bad boys that are the Black Captains being a prime example) manages to stay entertaining, immersive and downright satisfying enough that not only am I willing to readily overlook these newly invented additions to Tolkien's universe, I actually applaud the way in which they were rather seamlessly  - in my opinion anyway - inserted and intermingled with already present Middle-Earth history and lore.Verdict: 9/10 at the very least, one of my favourite games in my library.  I shall be looking feverishly forward to going blade-to-blade with the Witch-King, his Nazgul chums and that admittedly damn fiiine looking Balrog come Shadow of War's release.			"

												One does not simply make a good Middle-Earth game. Even though the world of Middle-Earth is large and rich in detail, its lore is also incredibly fragile, and bringing certain parts of this world to life can be both challenging and daring. Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ gently takes and respects what fans of Tolkien's work love and puts it in a higly enjoyable action-adventure game that will certainly satisfy fans of the genre and give Middle-Earth fans a more than what they could ever ask for in this jaw-droppingly epic experience. THE PROS:· The combat is very fluid and satisfyingly brutal. Seperating an Uruk's head from his shoulders and seeing his black blood gush out of his every wound is both entertaining to behold and amusing to perform.· Stealth mechanics work surprisingly well. You won't find anything incredibly deep or revolutionairy here, but attempting to take out a Warchief without letting anyone know you're there can be equally satisfying as slashing your way through the hordes of orcs. If you're in to stealth, it's definately worth investigating!· I had my doubts about the Nemesis System at first, but honestly, it more than delivers. Any Uruk, any enemy AI you come across, can move their way up through the system in various ways. They can kill other Warchiefs, take the place of fallen Warchiefs, startt recruiting lesser orcs etc. To me this really felt authentic and right in its place in Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ as it beautifully brings the vast world of Middle-Earth come to life, where even the smallest nobody can become Mordor's biggest threat.· There is always something to do in Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™, partially thanks to the Nemesis System. Warchiefs will always be causing trouble you can interfere with, but there are also a variety of collectibles and entertaining side missions and challenges to do. I found myself unable to go from point A to point B without being attracted to one of the events or optional quests around me. · The story is good, but it's not a game seller. In short: you're a dead man banished from death who is now bound to a Wraith, and their only option is to find out why they are bound together and do something about it. Sounds dull and cliché, but the story will take quite a lot of twists and turns accompanied with epic and gorgeous cutscenes to keep you entertained.THE CONS:· The combat can sometimes get repetetive and your weapon's runes won't ever really change the way you'll engage fight. Just like in Batman: Arkham City or Arkham Origins you'll try to get high combos and perform brutal and cool finishing moves. It's by no means bad - hell no, it's awesome - but when you're just running through Mordor and decide to battle large groups of orcs, you'll pretty much be able to see it all before the last severed head hits the ground.· While the climbing and running mechanics work great, they often conflict each other. Sometimes you'll accidentally climb a wall because you were sprinting close to it, or sometimes, while climbing, you can't get Talion to go where you want him to go. It can be a bit frustrating, but those moments are few and far between.THE VISUALS:· Although it's a demanding game, Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is absolutely gorgeous. The world of Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a lively and detailed one, and its visuals do a fantastic job in enforcing this feeling. Definately one of the prettiest games you will play in late 2014.FINAL VERDICT:· If you're a fan of the Middle-Earth lore, open-world action, enjoyable combat and/or fantasy epics, this one is a must. This is by far the best Middle-Earth game I have ever played, and it definately scratches that itch all of us Lord of the Rings-fans who have been waiting for a good Middle-Earth game. Overal Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is a great open-world action experience that allows for hours upon hours of endless fun. 9,5/10			"

												GAMERS! Allow me to present you...URUK-HAI: Gotta Brand Them AllThe first part of the game you train yourself to handle all manners of Sauron's cronies with 3 distinct tools: Your sword, Your broken sword and Your bow. Wield these with master-stroke capabilities, you will be deemed the unbeatable pokem- I mean Uruk-Hai/Orcs/Caragors/All manner of wild untamed creatures master. Sword: If you do not fancy sneaky-beaky procedure to dispatch a horde of these creatures, your chance to die will increased greatly, but there is where fun is. You, as a trainer are equipped with an array of head chopping, heart stabbing, gut spewing and many more abilities to counter their onslaught for your pink-skin guts. Do lots of combos and you will be rewarded with wide choices of insta-killing skills to satisfy your bloodlust.Broken-sword: I know what you are thinking, ""Why would I bring a broken weapon to a slaughterfest?"". Well, you could still stab their craniums and slit their throats with it like a dagger, thats right a DAGGER! No dagger is as badass as a broken sword treated like a dagger! Oh look some Uruks having a cooking up some smores around their campfire, NOPE! Use your brutalize skill on one of the poor sod in front of their comrades and watch them drop their half-cooked marshmellows and flee in terror as you repeatedly stab him in each and every part of their vital organs.Bow: So, trainer, you are the center of attention of a blood hungry horde and tired of some cowardly Uruks throwing spears at you and breaking your combo? Fret not, enter the Matrix and you will have a vision of everything that tries to kill you. With this you will be able to spot ranged cowards and dispatch them in slowww-motioooon. And what is that? The campfire is not burning hot enough for their marshmellows? Shoot the campfire and it will burn as bright as the sun and the Uruks will not need anymore heat for the rest of their living life.""But what about this training creatures I heard?""This is where the fun really gets funner. As you battle throughout the blooddrench lands, you will find yourself encountering Captains and Warchiefs(Tougher and deadlier than captains). These guys have varied strength and weaknesses for you to be aware of and to exploit. They control the horde groups around them as well. In the 2nd half part of the game, your wraith companion will allow you to brand them and bend to your will afterwards.Brand the captains once you had weaken them in combat and you will see and help them rise through the ranks. Troublesome Warchief with a handful of captains of bodyguards? No problem, brand them and the warchief wont see 3 axes coming from behind them. Once the chief had been defeated, your pokem- damn it, branded captains will take their place as a warchief. So what are you waiting for? RULE MIDDLE-EARTH, BRAND THEM ALL!			"

												5/7. Just like the Arkham games except you're Talion not Batman, and you kill orcs instead of knocking out criminals and you're actually part spirit elf thing and you're not like Batman at all except for the combat style and the story is completly different and it's nothing like being Batman.

												Easily the best game based on the Lord of The Rings books/movies that I've played in my life.  Main game review; I haven't played the DLCs yet.Pros: -Fluid gameplay-A rather easy combat system that echoes Batman Arkham style-Vibrant open world-Skills and weapon modding to tailor your play style-Story and lore is pretty good-Every captains or higher rank has unique advantages and disadvantages makes each of them a unique mini boss to play with-Sauron's Army including Nemesis/Rivalry makes each almost every enemy unique. (Those normal orcs that kill you can 'rank up' and could possibly be your new nemesis)Cons:-Not enough enemy types.  Sure there are captains or higher rank and spear throwers or big cats, but honestly i expected a lot more types to challenge myself.-Boss battles doesn't really appeal or feel very unique.  That fight with the legendary graug is a too typical 'dodge and hit' fight and the black captains, tower of sauron oh god they feel like the normal sauron army captains.  The hammer of sauron is pretty good for the first time you do it and the black hand/Sauron final boss was just too bland.  It was all reduced to quick-time events button clicking.  I expected A LOT MORE when freaking Sauron is fighting you.Overall though, the awards and critic review it has proves that this is indeed a good game if not your own experiences.			"

												This game has only one original thing about it: The Nemesis system. It's really, really interesting, and I can't wait to see other games steal it and use it. Everything else is cribbed from other games, most notably the Assassin's Creed and Arkham franchises. I want to be clear, though, that I don't think that's a bad thing. Everything here works together well, and was very enjoyable. This is probably in my top ten for 2014, and I really wasn't expecting more than mediocrity. My only complaints are plot/story based. I'm not a huge fan of the main character, and the closed system of the LotR cycle makes me feel like a real payoff isn't possible. What I'd really like to see in a sequel is treating it like Rocksteady's Arkham games, where the world and characters are obviously Batman, etc, but it's not beholden to the continuity of any particular movies or comics or whatever. Also, for the love of god some character development for Talion. Please. I'm not saying 'forget about your tragedies and go out wenching', but time should begin to heal wounds.			"

												Great game. Takes my favorite aspects from Assassin's Creed, adds a great combat system and perks/abilities that make killing orcs so much fun.  Very immersive story and bosses.  Great voice acting, and a nice soundtrack.  If you pay attention to the lore as well, it can immerse you. If you just wander around it can be boring at times otherwise it's great. ☆☆☆☆☆ 5/5			"

												A really fun game, gameplay is similar to the assassin's creed series, but it just seems more fun than that. The enemy captain / nemesis system is amazing and adds depth and flavour to the game (♥♥♥♥ The Poet). There's a lot of lore and backstory in the game, and even if some of it isn't canon, it's still a treat for any LoTR fan.Main campaign is about 25 to 30 hours long and there's 2 other shorter campaigns you can play. 2 NPC's and the uruk captains stand out, every other character is kinda forgettable. Overall a good game that's worth getting on a sale.			"

												If you're a Lord of the Rings fan. Just get it.Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is basically if LotR had a new generation of movies, like Star Wars does, except as a video game. It is tons of Uruk-slaying, but that means it's always action packed. The DLCs act as extra quest lines, but in a new game.Medium 100%10/10 Cute Graugs			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is definitely one of the best games I've ever played. The combat system is a mix of the free flowwing combat of the Arkham series and the ability to slaughter you foes. The stealth system is an improvement of the already good Assassin's Creed series. There is lots of parkour and your character (Talion) moves with ease. And who could forget to mention the nemesis system which makes each playthrough and encounter with a captain/warchief a unique one. Now, plot wise, don't go expecting too much, but the world itself makes up for this. There are two maps in the game and both are very different from each other, although I don't want to say much more than that so if you buy the game you can discover it for yourself. Overall, if you love Lord of the Rings, the Arkham series, the Assassin's Creed series, or are just looking for something new, than you should try this game.			"

												Shadow of Mordor has been the game that I have been waiting for for years.  In my old game collection I had Lord of the Rings: War in the North, Battle for Middle Earth II and Conquest. I am a Lord of the Rings fan for almost a decade and after War in the North I was excitedly waiting for a new game.In general it is very well portrayed with a good intro and with good features such as showing battery level. The game plot is very linear but it keeps interesting with the 'history lessons'. Due to the linear story replaying the story is not really worth to do, unless you are a big fan like me. The other gamemodes, 2 of which require you to buy DLC, are probably worth digging into (I don't have those DLC). The free ones are objective where you have to kill a certain amount of warchiefs and captians. Certain goals give you bonus score and the amount of score is posted on an online leaderboard. Gives a little competitive feeling but it wasn't a necessity. The stealth in this game is almost the same from assassins creed, which makes sense because it is published by Ubisoft.The story starts off very sad and dark to somewhat heroic. I find the main character to be both an hero and an anti-hero. Once you play enough story you'll discover why I make this statement. The story gives an intresting approach on how they made the one ring. If it is the true version I don't know, I need to read the books, but I doubt it is the real version.EDIT: 9gag to save the day! http://9gag.com/gag/aPMDBBP?ref=9d Also notice that golum is in the story. He's more of a side character here and it's not really clear how he got into mordor. (I'll be connecting a bit with the LOTR story here). I think that he got here because he got captured by the orcs for torture, in the beginning of the first movie they tortured him to know the whereabouts of the ring, after the torture they released him and that's maybe the reason that we encounter him. It also gives an idea when the story is in the Middle-Earth history.The killing captians and warchiefs is different due to a new system, they call it the nemesis system, it is pretty fun and keeps the game exciting. The captians  themselfs are trying to climb up the ladders by trying to gain power by recruiting, feasting, trials in combat or beast hunts. Or they can try to kill each other for a position. Every captain or warchief has it own strengts and weaknesses so they are not as killed easily as general orcs. There is also a chance that random captians return once you killed them, this is based on how you kill them if you chop off their head they are really dead but they can survive a kill by arrows or a stealth takedown of some sort. Talking about arrows I'll give an example of a captain that I was fighting. There was this captain that could be killed by a charged headshot. I killed him like that from afar. He then returned to the spot I was at and almost one shot me but one of his abilities is that they ignore you when you are in last chance struggle, means they won't kill you, he then returned to the same guarding spot I killed him from earlier and I did the same thing because his weakness was the same. After that he did the same thing but he now literally was unkillable. He became a Defender which you can't jump on, can't be damaged by stealth, can't be damaged by arrows, and the ignoring while he almost killed you.  In the second to last mission you have to battle your nemesis, that certain captain, with your orc army versus his orc army and I could kill him thanks to my orcs. Overall a good 3th person fighting game with a decent story, it is a bonus when you are a Lord of the Rings fan to pick this up otherwise I wouldn't recommend this if it isn't your kind of game.			"

												Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor is one of the biggest surprises of the year as it provides a very lore filled experience to any Lord of the Rings fan coupled with great gameplay and setting.GameplayThe gameplay is where SoM shines with its combo based action. The combat is all about timing and someone who reacts to prompts faster will survive a lot longer. There are a few QTE scenarios but they aren't overplayed to the point where it gets annoying. You can go full stealth or go in and rampage as you slice and dice and chop the heads off of those orcs. It is extremely satisfying with its exection system and the upgrades and skill trees provide a nice buff to your abilities without making you completely overpowered. Travelling across the game isn't hard as there are mounts as well as fast travel.GraphicsThe graphics of this game are pretty good. It isn't anything that'll blow your socks off but the landscape are nice enough. The characters are extremely high in resolution compared to the rest of the game world but that is ok as fast travel load speeds (for me) were always less than 2 seconds.Sound/MusicThe soundtrack in this game is amazing. Many times when music was playing I was reminded of the music in the LORT movies. The voice acting is superb from the humans and especially the orcs, their voice actors definitely did a good job portraying the voices. The sounds of executions as your blade carves the head off an orc to the sounds of animals are all really well done.ContentThere is enough content in this game to keep you going even to 100% (which is what I'm striving for). The content is all there, simple but challenging enough to make you want to finish the game. The main story isn't as long as I thought it would be as some have said they've finished it in 15 hours but I finished mine in around 10, but regardless of the story, the game's content with the nemesis system will keep you going for a ways to come.SummaryMiddle-earth Shadow of Mordor is definitely a game you should be looking to get this year as it's one of the biggest surprises of the year providing me with more fun than I've had in the last few months. It is one of the best LOTR games and is a definite must buy for any LOTR fan.9/10			"

												License or no license, this is one of the greatest games I've played in many years.You are the ranger Talion, whose lovely wife Ioreth and son Dirhael are slain right in front of him--just before he himself is.  Now bonded with a mysterious wraith, the two undead set off to hunt hundreds of Orcs (or ""Uruks"") in their endeavor to bring down the dark lord Sauron before the same evil influence that cost Talion his life and family brings ruin to all of Middle-earth.Welcome to the shadow of Mordor.In this game, your fights and upgrades will work like the brawling system does in Arkham, but to my delight this game feels much harder--Uruks are sturdy foes, and Talion can't just strike and evade his enemies one at a time like I all too often did in that series.  Foes will commonly rush you all at once, such that one of the first things you must learn is how to counter multiple attacks at the same time.  The numerous ruined ""strongholds"" within the game's open world are large, and they have plenty of spaces to climb around and hide in.  The game map itself is not really all that small when one considers that these buildings make for some excellent *vertical* level design instead of leading to endless flat space.  Fans of yanking people off of high places in the Splinter Cell games will be right at home.The game's centerpiece feature is its Nemesis system.  Every Uruk you fight can potentially have a name and his own set of strengths, weaknesses, and even fears.  Basic enemies can usually be defeated traditionally but can also end up dealing amounts of damage that would make Dark Souls proud, especially in the early game when you have few health upgrades.  Mordor has a power hierarchy similar to the ""Deck of 52"" arrangement of VIP targets from an older game called Mercenaries.  In this game, however, it's not a scripted arrangement.  If you kill an established Captain in this hierarchy, another will eventually take his place.  If an enemy 'kills' you, you don't get a game-over screen, since you're technically already dead.  Time passes, more Captains fill vacant ranks or try to attack one another for power and influence, and you resurrect at one of a few locations around the map.  These also serve as fast-travel points, keeping you from having to run everywhere while also keeping the world large since you can't just warp to any given location in an instant.This is not a game that opens with a bang and spends the rest of its story desperately trying to match its starting level of greatness.  Most of Shadow of Mordor's best features don't come until the later hours of the game, but without wanting to say too much, you can eventually gain more and more influence over Mordor's central power structure and reach the point where the game feels like a simple simulator.  Want to take over the mind of a Captain (or possibly his Captain--an elite known as a Warchief) and have him attack someone else?  You can eventually learn to do that, and you sort of end up creating your own missions, for which the game doesn't usually have hard-and-fast failure states.  Want to pit one Orc against another and then decide you want the second one's help and the first one's head?  Speaking of heads, the game puts its gore to an actual use, since several means of restoring your health revolve around making your enemies' heads explode.  As with the excellent system in The Darkness II, this game doesn't let you recover from all of your mistakes simply by hiding, but you also don't have to worry about where to regain health, which you can regain from your enemies.  Mordor also has a variety of plant life, which can be used for restoration and is given enough paragraphs of lore to feel like it fits in the setting.  Yes, there is pipe-weed.Captains add a strong variety of challenge that Arkham and Assassin's Creed really could have used more of.  Some of these are immune to stealth attacks or your arrows--or can be killed instantly by them--and some even shrug off your sword altogether.  You can find all this out using the game's version of Detective Mode, provided you've gathered enough ""intel"" (from items or from interrogating certain enemies) to learn this information.  Going back to the level design, it's fantastic--the strongholds give you a very wide variety of options for how to take control of a situation.  Want to shoot an arrow at a campfire and detonate it like a bomb?  Why not shoot a bag of predator bait and unleash wild beasts upon your Orc foes?  Or jump on the back of one of these beasts and ride it?  Or cause a swarm of angry flies to terrorize them?  Or silently dominate the minds of the archers and turn them against their new foes?  Likewise, the game knows how to keep you on your own toes--if you simply want to brawl, take care that certain enemies don't run off and activate a stronghold's alarm contraptions.  Otherwise, THIS happens -- 


NOPE 
A Screenshot of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
By: dracosummoner




 -- and you end up with a few dozen enemies, their bosses, and THEIR boss angrily calling for your head.You'll notice that the Captains each have their own one-liners before engaging (or after defeating) you, making them feel even more like actual characters even though their appearances usually aren't pre-determined.  Over the course of the entire game, I think I heard the same line maybe twice.  Unless you're very good at stealth, enemies are often smart enough to react to you no matter what you're doing.  If you grab enemies, for example, their fellows will shout a warning to keep out of your reach.  The voice acting for nearly everyone in the game is absolutely fantastic, and considering I've been ""inverse-spoiled"" by games like Mortal Kombat 9 and Mass Effect 3, I'd almost forgotten what excellent acting really sounds like.  When they're not fighting you, the Orcs have their own conversations, which can repeat but are still extremely well done.  They complain.  They insult each other.  They talk, in a sort of reverence, about your actions around Mordor.  They even have their own drinking songs, which are hilarious (and you can learn to poison their drink).The game also has other things to do, most of which involve finding special items that, as with the plants, have their own paragraphs of lore and do a great job of developing some of the characters.  The ""challenge maps"" take place within the larger environment, but their borders are clearly marked on your map so you know where not to go if you don't want these special missions to reset.  If you want to feel like a real hero, you can also run around freeing slaves, and if you ever played Morrowind and thought, ""I wish I could actually join the Twin Lamps and be an abolitionist of death,"" this may be something for you to notice.  The slave missions actually have their own subplot and are given in an order, such that their ending is arguably more epic and satisfying than the nonetheless fine conclusion the main quest has.  The main plot, of just the right length, isn't hugely necessary to The Lord of the Rings, and if you want to ignore it and just run around killing Orcs, feel free.I saw a commenter on Polygon complain about not seeing enough women in one of the trailers, so to relieve that all-important worry, they are in the game, they're interesting, only one of them gets a damsel-in-distress mission, and she's so strong even during that point that she almost doesn't need the help.  At one point, Talion reunites another man with his own wife, who is safe and sound, and Talion doesn't need to say, ""I miss Ioreth.""  It's written plainly on his face, and the game as a whole does a wonderful job of this less-is-more presentation.I'm out of room.  This game is an absolute treat, it feels downright special, and I hope it proves widely influential in the years to come.			"

												Don't play for the story. Play for the enjoyment of slaying hordes of orcs and looking stylish while doing it. Seriously though, something about the way you fight is very satisfying and if running around Mordor and Nurnen gracefully slashing at every orc and beast you see sounds like fun, then don't hesitate on buying this game. If you are looking for a more in-depth LOTR game to live out your adventure fantasies of exploring Middle Earth and completing a diverse array of activities and battles, I would wait for a sale and still probably pass on this one.

												Ever since this game was released I couldn't wait to play it. I love games that have great fighting systems (notably Batman Arkham series) where you can rack up huge combo's based on your technique and attention to hits coming at you. Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor has taken the crown for fighting! Not only is it impressive, the gore is outrageously entertaining. The main character is a complete badass and has clear intentions of ripping through his enemies in seek of retribution. You only need proof through looking at the hundreds of screenshots I took during Shadow of Mordor - which brings me onto the next point - the camera. Throughout any point in the game (including in-game cutscenes) you are able to freeze time and take pictures. Through a variation of angles, distance, styles and effects, Shadow of Mordor provides countless moments of pure entertainment in capturing ""The best kill"" / ""The best environment"" / ""The best death"" and so on. Its an incredible feature within the game, something which I have loved through games such as Fifa and Pro Evolution Soccer, being able to freeze time and take memorable images. Does the HUD annoy you being in every picture? A simple toggle button to turn it off when taking a screenshot prevents distraction. It really, really is fun.Another really strong focal point to the game is its enemy ranking system. You will always get the weaker orcs, wildly flapping around Mordor being frightened of near everything within earshot - but they always have the opportunity to strengthen and rank up. This depends entirely on their ability to kill you. Without giving anything away story-related,  your character will respawn & respawn & respawn, each time getting stronger per death. As you fall to an Orc, it gains power. Through power comes strength, and that measely Orc that is scared of everything and pushes its body weight around Mordor waiting to be killed - changes. His armor changes, his attitude changes, he isn't scared anymore. He now has bodyguards and roams around Mordor feeling tougher then the Dark Lord himself. This is a common situation within the game, and outlines the quality of enemy progression. Orcs have their own unique personalities & traits, what they are bad at and what they excel at.. you will find this out for yourself through scouting. But no matter what traits they have - Orcs are deadly in numbers. No matter what level you get to or how good you think you are - they can still kill you. Using a combination of tactics & skills will maintain your capability to overhaul the b*$t@!*s and take victory!There is so much more to go into but I will leave it down to you to find that out through your own gameplay. Its an absolute diamond of a game and I would recommend every single person to play - think of a combination of Hitman/Assassins Creed/Batman Arkham Series, then cover that combination with buckets of gore. I am loving this game.			"

												Summary: OK, but heavily overrated. Buy if it's on sale so you can see what the nemesis system is all about. Suffers from boring main story, and being way, way too easy (with no difficulty settings!) Also, no mod scene. Basically, it's a light-weight murder rampage simulator that hasn't been adapted for the PC in any noticible way.---This game has been praised to the high heavens by the gaming press for what they did with the captain system (the nemesis system as they call it), where the leaders of Saurons orc army are randomly generated, and react in a dynamic fashion to your behavior. That part is actually quite novel. Unfortunately the rest of the game falls pretty flat. Yes, combat feels fun to start with. It's Assassins Creed/Batman but in Mordor. With Orcs! You still aren't that powerful right at the beginning, and now and then you actually need to run away from fights to save your life. As a result the first few hours were quite engaging. Unfortunately though it all starts to fall apart as you quickly become a walking killing machine. A lot of the game mechanics are about stealth. Sneaking here, sneaking there. But the orcs have terrible vision, making any tension drop away as you realise you will never be seen. And then later you give up even sneaking anyway because you can charge into a camp, slaughter 50 orcs, and walk out the other side with barely a scratch. Yes its fun taking out some of the orc captains. It's a laugh fighting dozens of foes at once and doing real damage, feeling strong. But it soon becomes repetetive as you realize that the AI is not up to the task. Meanwhile any captains you kill are soon replaced with new captains, the orcs you slay replaced with new orcs, and the slaves you free replaced with new slaves. The landscape doesn't really adjust, and the world doesn't really react. It's actually quite easy and static. This game will entertain you pretty handily for the first five or six hours. Enough so that you probably wont regret buying it on sale. But I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. I can't help but get the impression that people enjoy it so much because it is actually very violent (but still manages to get a pass because orcs are evil, and their blood is black.) That's fine and dandy. The problem is mistaking the enjoyment you derive from your rampage for good game design. There actually isn't much of that to see here, unfortunately.			"

												Playing through for the second time and still taking me ages, not because I'm crap but because it's so easy to go off the reservation when attempting any missions. I get so wrapped up in the combat i'm like a weasle frenzying in a chicken coup (laughing at the orc running to sound the alarm to bring in more orcs to my slaughter party). I still marvel at the crisp graphics and amazing life of the evolving orc hierarchy. You can literaly keep dying on purpose in order to increase difficulty. Dying in this game has a unique purpose when you hunt for the orc that you want to gain from your death so you can kill him later for greater rewards and entertaining insults from the orc that stands before your revenge.Brilliant entertaining game that keeps me coming back again and again. 10/10			"

												Combines the best parts of Assassins' Creed, Batman and Lord of the Rings into a polished standard AAA experience. What truly sets it apart however, is the Nemesis system. Generating Uruk captain and warchief strengths, weaknesses and appearences really demonstrates the value of emergent unscripted gameplay. My only major complaint is the story, way too sparse for my liking, with story scenes few and far between countless dismembered heads. What is there is well voiced and written however, which makes it even more frustrating. Additionally some of the more traditional side content is repetitive and bland, although it takes the backseat thankfully. This game effortlessly gets an 8/10 from me, I think it's worth buying on the Nemesis System alone, which surprisingly still hasn't been used anywhere else to this day.			"

												Genre - Fantasy Action/RPGThis game is set in Tolkien's world and is brave enough to add a new story. The story seems to tie in well thus far and the characters/monster you meet seem true tio the universe, otherwise I'd be an angry fan boy! The gameplay is a cross between Batman (smooth stylised fighting with skill unlocks) and Dynasty Warriors (battlling armies and their leaders). This actually works quite well and you will be hunting Orc Chiefs across athe open map before you know it. There are also challenges and items scattered across the map to find and complete,  The fighting flows and you unlock various skills to use in combat that are useful and also look cool. The world is fairly dark and savage (you are in Mordor) but there is still some nice stuff going on (poncy Elves etc.). This is one of only four LOTR games I would recommend, including War in Middle Earth, The Third Age, and War in the North.			"

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an Action/Stealth game in the same likeness of Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham Games. You play as Talion, a Ranger of Gondor, who, along with his family, were slain by the Black Hand of Sauron. But Talion is banished from death thanks to the elven spirt of Celebrimbor, whose actually pretty important to the story of the Middle Earth franchise. United by their goal to kill the Black Hand, Talion and Celebrimbor ascend upon the land of Mordor and annihilate the Orc armies of Sauron. The story has a typical revenge scheme premise, and the occurence of events is just as predictable. Though I'm sure any Lord of the Rings fan will find it interesting, it's definitely not what you'll remember about playing this game. What you'll remember about Shadow of Mordor is the amazing combat system. It's a mix of the free-flow system of Arkham and the sword-play of Assassin's Creed but it's better than both. Sweeping through hordes of Orcs will never, ever get tiring or dissatisfying. Through some of the combo abilities you're able to pull off, you can brand orcs to help you, drain their health, or flat out swing your sword into their neck. The addition of gore and decapitation physics is just the icing on the cake. As astounding as the combat system is, it's made even better by the Nemisis System, probably one of the most original ideas in any recent video game. It's basically an active hierarchy of orcs that will level up and be promoted as they complete quests of their own within Mordor. You can choose to intervene on some of those quests, and if not, you risk that Orc being promoted. The higher up an Orc gets, the harder he is to kill, though that doesn't mean he won't have a weakness. Every Orc in the nemesis system is for the most part, unique, and will even remember you if you died in combat to them. It adds an unexpected monivation to not die or pursue certain targets, because if you're not careful about which orcs are promoted you are going to regret it.Everything else in the game is pretty good. Stealth is as good as you can expect, beast-riding is superfun, bow and arrow combat works well, and the open world is filled with a good variety of content without being overwhelmingly filled with things to do. Overall, Shadow of Mordor is an awesome orc-slaying simulator that's worth playing not for the story, but for the pile of bodies you're going to produce once you're done.8.5/10 - Not quite full price, but definitely worth it any discount.

												Unfortunately Shadow of Mordor is the best Middle-Earth game available right now. It takes the best aspects of both games, Assassin's Creed and Arkham City; has it's own unique feature - the Nemesis system; but for some reason (queue in the song ""We're in the Money"") the developers wanted to make such game in the world of Lord of the Rings - they could've just created a different setting and there wouldn't be any difference.This game is great for the gaming community, but if you're a Tolkien fan, who is waiting for a game that gives justice to the lore and world, then keep waiting (though understand that because of legal reasons such game won't be created soon). As soon as they provide an expansion where the player can be an Orc and take part in Orc society, this game will be one of my top 5 favorite games!

												Shadow of Mordor,You can see this game as a combination between the movement of Assassin's Creed + the Combat of the Batman Arkham series. That combined with a pretty solid storyline. The PC port is a lot better than I espected it to be. With my GTX 770 I can run everything on high/ultra and still get 70-80+ fps @1080p.The combat is is really well done but what impressed me the most is the characters. All the Orcs/Uruk + The protagonist are really well made and you really make a connection to them... Before you F*CKING SLICE THEIR HEAD OFF. OH MY GOD THE KILL ANIMATIONS ARE SO AWESOME! I would rate this game a: 8.4/10 (Which is really good)Also... It has Golum in it... What do you want more?			"

												You're a Ranger. You're Dead. So, you're a spirit. A shadow. Trapped in Mordor, with an Elf. A dead Elf. A wraith Elf. So there's you, a dead Ranger, and your Wraith Elf, and thousands upon thousands or Orcs, Uruks, Uruk-Hai and other nasty beasties. You don't know why you're trapped in Mordor as a walking undead. Your Wraith Elf friend doesn't know why He is trapped their either. You have to do stuff to find out why you and your elf are stuck here, neither alive nor dead.The combat is more fluid that any of the Batman Arkham whatsits, and the animations are incredible. The graphics are fantastic too. I'm, running this on a GTX980 and it's sensational, and the benchmarks show betweek 65 and 95 FPS, which is awesome!It's a fantastic looking, fantastic sounding and fantastic to play, hack and slash and THINK game.

												In years to come, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is probably a game most people will remember for its single distinguishing mechanic.  In some ways it’s a shame, because while Mordor does invent a refreshing spin on the open-world genre, it also does a lot of the small things right to create an overall polished and enjoyable experience.  Mordor is an open-world game developed by Monolith Productions, a long-time -- but rarely noteworthy -- developer from the Pacific NW.  This time Monolith has created an outstanding Lord of the Rings action game which hits all the right notes.After a brief and well-executed tutorial, the player is quickly thrust into the land of Mordor; the evil wasteland wherein the main villain of Lord of the Rings, Sauron, makes his home.  Besides Sauron, there’s also orcs -- a lot of orcs.  You have a sword, dagger, and bow at your disposal, and the majority of the game is spent fighting through swaths of Sauron's brutish pawns.  Combat in Mordor is pretty much a straight copy from the Rocksteady Batman games.  It’s an excellent system that works well in this environment, and Monolith did a great job of nailing the aspects of what makes that system work; animations are fluid for practically every scenario, timing feels precise, and you always feel in control.  What’s more, combat kills in Mordor are executed with a bone-crunching, heads-flying brutality you won’t find in the Batman games, and it’s really satisfying.  Even after 30 hours of slaying orcs, a slow-motion zoom in shot of me lopping off an orc’s head never got old.  Stealth is actually done pretty well too, and the bow mechanics feel tight.  Mordor never feels like it’s getting in your way; they make some smart tradeoffs with character movement and climbing, making them easy and quick in lieu of realism.  As the game progresses, you’ll unlock ways to make your character more powerful and more dynamic.  By the end, there are tons of approaches to every situation, and even more impressive is that I was actually *using* the large variety of skills available to me. The different methods of combat and infiltration are so accessible and easy that it encourages experimentation until the very end of the game.  I did feel as though the late game abilities were so powerful that it made the last few hours of the game too easy, but in some ways it was fun just to shred through hundreds of orcs in dynamite fashion.My exposure to Lord of the Rings is admittedly mostly based on the movies; I’ve read the hobbit and parts of the trilogy, but it was clear even to me that much of the story is structured to disturb as small of the lore as possible.  The story is bland and uninspired and the small cast of characters feel pretty one-note.  But the story here is not the main attraction, and in fact, the real fun comes from the narrative that you frequently will spin yourself using the Nemesis system.The Nemesis system is an inventive mechanic wherein strong and noteworthy orcs are added to a constantly rotating pool of captains.  Each captain is given a name, VO, personal strengths and weaknesses, and a ranking in the pecking order, which creates a depth to each individual orc.  Orcs who manage to kill you are rewarded with greater power, and you can be sure that they’ll taunt you the next time they see you.  The result is that you end up creating your own narrative with the orcs from your story, which is often more entertaining than the ones the writers create for you.  There’s no doubt that the Nemesis system makes Shadow of Mordor stick out from the open-world masses, but it deserves a lot of credit for being an all-around outstanding game.  It’s true that it wouldn’t be as remarkable without it, but Mordor still impresses with a very tight combat system which is great fun and does an impressive job of encouraging experimentation.  The beauty of this fusion of polished, inspired mechanics with it’s own unique ideas is that Shadow of Mordor feels bigger and better than the games which inspired it.  I highly recommend it.			"

												Its a good game and very well polished. However, I don't know if I can recommend it. Its kind of boring and a bit monotone. The Nemesis system seriously doesn't do anything, at least in my game's playthrough because the game was so mindnumbingly easy. I rarely EVER failed to kill an NPC that I wanted to kill so I never really see it being a big issue. (Note: I literally killed the warchief and all of his bodyguards without the whole backstabbing/dominating/etc. In fact, I killed ALL the warchiefs without even having to dominate a single person.)The good:The game is very well polished and it shows. The combat is excellent. Its very much like the Batman series. Counters, combos, etc. Its very smooth and fluid and is a pleasure to play. You feel epic and powerful when you do the things correctly. The characters are well sketched out, predominately the orcs that you play against and the voice acting is literally some of the best work I've heard in a long, long time.The cape is nice?The meh:The Nemesis System isn't that impressive. I get what they were trying to do and it is a good foundation, but it is not nearly where it should be or what people think it is.               - Let me get to the point. The nemesis system is the selling point for this game and it doesn't sell very well. It is hardly memorable. The problem lies I guess with the game's core/fundamental failure which I will get to in a  moment.The graphics are good, but they're not spectular. Honestly, its sort of like Batman or Sleeping Dogs with HD Texture packs.Nothing groundbreaking from a high-end gaming PC perspective.The bad:The biggest failure of this game is the game is too bloody easy. Literally. On a scale of 1-10 with ten being the most difficult game and 1 being easy, I rank this at a solid 3. I plowed through this game with minimal effort. The game has no harder difficulty setting that I could find.I mean I guess I could intentionally die and power-up the orc chiefs/captains/warchiefs to get stronger, but I feel like that's a cop-out. Really, I should be rewarded with playing well, but the game gets way too easy. I died maybe 3 times the ENTIRE game and that was because I was being stupid and running around blowing up barrels to see what I can do in the middle of a fortress with the ENTIRE fortress coming down on me.The fact that you can buy the last level powerups (the sword, bow, and dagger, unlimited executions without a skill tree requirement or prerequisite) basically meant that all I had to do was save up for that single powerup and then the game went into mind-numbing easy  mode.The music was also very bland and forgetable.Also, the storyline is simply forgetable. (I am aware it was intentional so that people who have no exposure to LOTR may play the game and like it and LOTR fans will like it also because of the nodding of the head at various plot points.) However, the game's script and pacing is just boring and awful. Eventually, I felt like I was just plodding through the game just to finish. I could care less about the ending or what happened. The voice acting may be top-notch, but literally the writing is god-awful. Sleeping Dogs had a MUCH better script and storyline, in my opinion.I forgot to mention, I think I know why the game's story was so boring. Basically I thought about it today after work and came to the realization that the majority of the major storyline is basically GIGANTIC tutorials. They simply are tutorials on how to use a skill. Case in point a lot of your skills are locked until you progress through the story/mission and all of them can be named as such: (1) How to tame a gaugr; (2) How to Poison Grog barrels; (3) How to Brand an Orc; (4) How to Dominate an Orc; (5) How to Make an Orc a bodyguard; etc. There is no real emotional development or plot/story development, which results in you not caring because in the player's mind its ""Oh another tutorial, time to zone out and follow directions/instructions and just do what the button queues tell me to do.""That is hardly a good way for you to make the player engaged in the story when you train them to think that the storyline is basically a tutorial. All in all, the game is well done and well polished. I think its an excellent entry/new IP but honestly, its only about 60-70% of the way there.I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.Updates for comments/clarification:I am not saying the game isn't fun or it isn't a good game. I'm saying for what the game producers and makers goals and what they were going for it isn't simply there yet. It is sort of like the very first Assassin's Creed vs. Black Flag (which I believe is arguably the best title in their series). Black Flag or AC Brotherhood was a much better polished, developed, and I guess more matured/well defined game. This game is an excellent IP don't get me wrong, but the bar it tries to reach wasn't reached in this game.I think its worth a buy (but honestly not at its full price at the moment). I got it on sale because of a screw up at $29.99. So yes. I think its still worth a play but not at the full price at the moment.Finally, I am not a 15 year gamer. I'm just a veteran gamer? So basically, a game should have a good curve of fun/difficulty and I should feel like I got value out of the money that I spent on the game. Currently, I feel that the fun/difficulty curve is too shallow and the value I got out of the game is moderate to mediocre at best. The fact that the game doesn't have a difficulty setting that can be adjusted makes me kind of cringe. Yes you could manually try to make the game harder, but I don't see the point in intentionally dying. (I already have the HUD turned off...)Final Update:I played this game to 100% completion (I.E. All survival missions, all hunting missions, all outcast missions, fully upgraded, etc.) I would recommend this game if it was on sale. Its a good game and overall I would recommend people to play it but not at the current full price. There's way too many things that make this game a good game and not a great one. Granted, its probably the best currently in this new generation of games, but I would say its simply a good game and not a great game and stand by my review at 3.5 out of 5.The TL;DR version to clarify on why so many people might be upset that I played this game throughly and still wouldn't recommend it at the moment.The game is fun and is good, but there is a serious problem with the game overall. The game's primary selling point is the Nemesis System. The game's reward curve and overall lack of control/customization on the difficulty level of the game, results in an over-abundance in rewards and a lack of challenges. This results in the game no longer being challenging, which causes the player never/rarely to die, which in turn causes the game's PRIMARY SALES POINT (the Nemesis system) to be a secondary characteristic.Basic questions I asked.Why did I buy this game? Nemesis system and how it looks.Is the game fun? Yes.Should you play it? Probably.Is it worth the hype and the money for the Nemesis System? No.Is the Nemesis great or impressive? Don't know, the game's difficulty level (or lack thereof) made it pretty much a non-existent factor in my playthrough.			"

												You should play this game because of Pushkrimp Dwarf-Killer.  He is undoubtedly the most evil, vindictive, horrible, nasty villain ever to grace a video game.  He'll adapt himself to your every weakness.  He'll strike you down just as you thought you were about to savour victory.  He'll ruin you, he'll destroy you.  He'll hunt you.  And every time he kills you he gets stronger.  You'll slaughter other Orcs to try to weaken him.  You'll hone your skills in the hope of besting him.  But it won't matter.  You might catch him unaware and off guard, but he has trained harder than you, killed more than you.  And he will kill you.  Again.So you'll hide, but he'll find you.  You'll try to complete quests but he'll foil you.  You'll try to kill his henchmen, but he'll intervene... and you will die.You will NEED to gain vengeance.  But he is born to defeat you.  The one orc who has risen above the rest with the sole focus of being better that you.He is your nemesis.He is not a villain crafted by a design studio.  He is procedurally generated.  A child of the nemesis system, and a child of your own failure.  He exists only for you, and only because of you, and only to defeat you.  And he will.And then one day.  One sweet sweet day, you will do everything just right, and with one beautiful final click you will have a revenge more triumphant than any gaming kill you have ever had before.  You will shout with glee, for finally, finally you have defeated Pushkrimp Dwarf-Killer......Until he comes back....And kills you again. "

												9/10 Pros: 1. The gameplay is off the hook. It's basically Assassin's Creed marrying Batman:Arkham with some magic thrown in. The whole point of finding weaknesses before killing the enemy helps a LOT and gets much much more XP which again, helps when encountering later characters and major bosses. 2. The story, though taking Talion as the protagonist, an unknown ranger in Middle Earth, is really about Celebrimbor, the creator of the rings of power and the story gets more and more interesting as we know how he came to be part of this plot, though I do wish the fellowship would have shown up somewhere.Cons: 1. The ending of the story was weak and that alone made me give it a point less. 2. Though it's an open world game, with forge towers around, I for one was too lazy to run around instead of simply teleporting and finding shortcuts because for me, the story is the most important aspect. Also, most places in Mordor look quite similar. Definitely recommend.			"

												Finally an open world game that doesn't want to drown you in side activities and meaningless quests.Sure there are some of those, but the fact that I was able to 100% this game doesn't mean that it's short, I enjoyed every second of it, and at the very end I feel very satisfied with the experience.Some games try to add too much content and ends up creating a grinding experience, this felt just right.The combat is fun and rewarding and looks fantastic, the gameplay although very close to another known franchise, still finds a way to feel fresh and different enough to enjoy. The nemesis system is really a great new mechanic that I hope many more games will feature in the future.The story was enjoyeable although not spectacular, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.

												I am a fan of The Lord Of The Rings and this game gives me recall of this tremendous novel!  The playing method of this game combined the way of playing assassin creed and batman but in the world of middle-earth.  It is really fun to stealth the Orcs and use the upgrade system to upgrade yourself to keep you fighting. The nemesis system makes this game more realistic as each time u are killed by Orcs or enemies, those enemies will be powerful than before. In other words, you need to strengthen yourself before encountering them next time if you want to secure a victory. Overally this game has a epic and historic game setting which can make you indulge in it. I would recommend this game to the Fan of the lord of the rings!			"

												NOTE: Long Review. Sorry.If you’re a fan of the great Batman Arkham titles, you will love this one. The functionality is very nice, and one of the cleanest I’ve seen in a while. The main combat is a lot like Batman, so if you’re a retired Batman Veteran like myself, you will have no problem switching  to this game.The open world is also very neat. It gives a Mordor feel, as if you’re right outside Mordor in the   Haradrim area.  For the most part, I feel like most of the map is the same, but it doesn’t bother me too much.This game also has a handful of difficult creatures that you can hunt for and defeat. The trolls are extremely hard to kill at first, due to your skills not being upgraded enough to defeat it. It also has some other creatures that can be a challenge at first. The leveling up in this game is also very fun. You can get xp to level up your character’s moves, battle attacks, health and weapons. You will find that your character is really weak to begin with, but will be invincible at the end.Now I’d like to point this out. Coming from someone who has read the Lord of the Rings books, this does not follow the books. It’s a Lord of the Rings influenced story, with Lord of the Rings Characters, in a Lord of the Rings game. It does but it doesn’t feel like Lord of the Rings. But I feel like I can say that for almost every Lord of the Rings game. No one, has been able to pull off an image that Petter Jackson designed after making the Trilogy movies, you just can’t beat them. However, it does follow Tolkien's ideas, in fact I own a LOTR book which has a bio on everything in Middle Earth, and the story of Celebrimbor is true, and follow's accurately.  The campaign was enjoyable. I’ve always wanted to know more about Sauron which this game explained more. The game wasn’t as campaign influenced like the Batman games. They’re more like quests that build off another to build a story. After playing some hours, I recommend playing more than one campaign quest at a time, so that it feel more like a whole story. Instead of one here and there.Also, this game goes on sale almost every major Steam sale there is. It’s been as low as $12.49, on more than one sale. And, that it’s the GOTY edition, meaning all DLC, which gives more to the game and more replay ability. I highly recommend this game, it’s been one of the better games I’ve played in a while. I’d also like to mention this. There are lots of people saying its optimized bad. It isn’t. People also say its GPU demanding. It isn’t. You just need decent gaming specs. My specs are listed below and I was getting 40fps-60fps on medium render resolution.  Hope you liked this review, and again, sorry it was a little long. It was just too hard to say everything I wanted to in a short review. As for this game deserves a good review. Thanks for reading and I hope you’ll like the game! See you in the forums ;) Specs:Intel ® Core ™ i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz-2.60GhzAMD Radeon R9 M275X 2GB8GB of RAMWindows 10NOTE: This game will not run on anything lower then DirectX 11!			"

												A very brutal open world game that takes part before LOR and dlc that is even before that during the creation of the rings. I liked it have to master skills and plan attacks watching ranks of the Uruks and Orcs to topple Mordor. The cut scenes are pretty great and I looked forward to them as a LOR nerd. Being able to convert the enemy that was a game changer and glad saved for near end. Long story short its pretty much Assassins Creed Middle Earth that has Batman Arhkam Series Batvision. Only downsides are the Bright Lord DLC you can not see anything and need to keep Raith Vision on to see targets and the fact that I have twin Radeon 7770 that render majestic graphics but make the game lag like hell so I can play on High graphics with delay or low-normal with really good screen rate other than that nothing else negative.

												This game is not perfect, there is a fair bit wrong with it, but there is sooo much good. So, I'll do a pros/consPros:-Beautiful-Voice acting-Combat is smooth and interesting-End game is very empowering-Length, lots of stuff to do-The enemy's revenge and power system is so interesting and forces tactical thinking, planning, and execution-Animation -Plot is interesting and does serve its purpose to drive the narritive forward.Cons:-Stealth is stupidly easy-Stealth is pretty much a joke-Somewhat repeptitive when doing side missions, but it's not too bad-Plot, as in there is (according to LoTR fanboys) plot holes in lore; casually though, probably won't notice-In certain areas the world seems too empty-FOV is not the best, but this isn't a deal breakerThe only thing that really affects the game is stealth being so easy, AI in this game is very smart... until it comes to stealth. But this can be overlooked by just about everything else.			"

												I´m playing this game for two days now (PC Windows version). And I really like it. It´s challenging and the fighting animations are well done. Some might say, this game is just a clone of other games like Assassins Creed etc - but the setting and the atmosphere are absolutely convincing. Graphics and performance are fine (GTX770, i7-4770, 16 GB RAM, no lags at all) And the cinematic cutscenes are beyond awesome. Playing it with a gamepad is recommended, i couldn´t get along with the mouse/keyboard setup. But maybe thats just me.Further i like the Nemesis-System - Orcs who kill you (yes, this happens a lot in the beginning, if you are a noob like me ;) - will be promoted to captains and become stronger. When you meet them again, you will face a tougher challenge. Once killed, they stay dead of course... Give it a try. It´s fun.Cheers, Wolf			"

 What's better than killing ton of uruks? Branding them and make them fight each other!  Shadow of Mordor is an action-adventure game that mixes Assassin's Creed movement with Batman's combat and your goal is to ..... kill uruks all day long because there is nothing else to do Even though the gameplay is fun, there are a few things that ruined the game for me ... at the start. Story and the protagonist Your family got killed ... you are also dead... but then you got ressurected by a Wraith and now you seek vengeance. And while you see vengeance you are working together with some NPCs to fight Sauron. Most of characters are so bland and forgetable that you may end up not paying much attention to them. At least they manage to make two quite fun characters in this grim and dark game : Ratbag, a cowardly uruk who wants to become a warchief. and Torvin, dwarf-hunter that wants to kill every living beast in Mordor... or send the said beasts against the uruks. Hell, even a lot of uruk captains got more personality in there taunts than the protagonist!Story seems to serve as tutorial.. why else some of the cool skills like branding uruks or taming monsters will be locked behind it? And the overall goal in your revenge is to : kill the chieftains on first map and brand them on 2nd map(and then the same happens in DLCs) . Difficulty Now this truly depends on the player. If you are familiar with the gameplay you may start looking at ways to handicap yourself if you want to have a challenging time. Oh, and lets not forget the rune's DLCs that gives you handy epic runes... that make killing captains for runes quite pointless ... Stale World You can quite easily run out of uruk captains to kills unless you : 1. Die a lot 2. Manually advance the time.If you complete the game and get back to urun slaughter you prolly gonna need to Advance the time quite a lot. You may kill all uruks on one of the maps, then go on the 2nd and kill them there, come back to 1st map and notice only 1-2 new captains while everybody else is dead. Now if there was a little time advancing after every event you take part in then it would be better. Enough about the things that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.. lets see the good stuff now Gameplay  Moving and Combat Both are fluent.. at least for me. As said game got the Assassin's Creed movement(or pick any other game that got the same stuff) : You can run,sprint, move silent,hide in bushes, climb on almost everything(if you face it in the right way) and you can jump from heights without dying. Sadly uruks arent athletic as you are so you can run away from them with climbing with an ease.And combat is Batman(insert any other video game title with same stuff)like : attack,block,counter,dodge and special moves. And the special moves are thanks to the wraith because Talion is a mere human. Upgrades As every big game nowadays, there are upgrades in here. The design is well made but sooner or later you will unlock everything. For special attacks you need to do missions for XP and kill captains for Battle points. XP gives you points to unlock, Battle points unlocks higher tier skills.If this isnt enough then there is also attributes which increase your HP,Arrow count, Focus(for when using bow) and unlocking rune slots on your weapons and later on the active skill on your weapons.Last but not least, Runes. You can get runes by killing captains.. or by buying(or both) the GOTY edition... Sadly some of DLC runes are pure cheat(allows you to use your weapon skill right away? dafuq) . Runes got levels, high level = better stats. The level of the dropped rune depends on the power rating of the target. Max rune level is 25(though you can also get 26 but its no different than 25 in terms of bonuses) . There are also epic runes which are rare and got no levels. Runes offer you some kind of a playstyle but their variety is low. Uruk hunting Now this is trully the fun part. Intel Intel is good to be obtained before you engage a captain. It reveals you his strength and weaknesses (Weak to stealth? Jump from high,1 shot stealth kill, collect the run and hit the road while Uruks wonder what dafuq just happened).For more challenging you can do it and without intel but then you will get lower level rune. If bored some weakness can add quite a lot of fun, like setting the captain on fire. Events  You can find captains either in free roam or in an event they planned. In free-roam you play hide and seek with the Uruks but during event you can either make them success so they can raise in power or just kill them. There are only a handful of events but still adds a bit to the game. Warchiefs and Strongholds If you want to aim high.. aim for the warchiefs.. which you can find in their stronghold ... and appear only if you annoy them enough by killing their supporters or destroy stuff... and when they appear you better be fast on your feets.Strongholds can be alarmed if you let the uruks reach the alarm ... when they do you will end up with endless stream of uruks to kill (jolly good!) . Then you have warchief that appear with his guards(if you didnt kill them before that).Warchiefs + Alarmed Stronghold = Intense action. You can eithe run or kill the warchief... and then run :D or kill slaughter everything until you get tired. Branding As said earlier, its  funnier to make ppl uruk fights each other than killing them all by yourself. So later in the story you will learn to brand enemies aka corrupting them aka they will follow your order which is , kill everything not branded.You can brand anything in the game. If you brand a captain you can send death threats to other captains, or you can brand a captain and make it a bodyguard to a warchief.. do it 2-3 times.. face the warchief and turn his BGs against him(one time one of the captains just 1shoted the warchief!).Or you can send warchieves to fight each other. Overall Its a fun game but trying to find something else in it might be hard at times. I envy you if you can spend more than 4-5 hours at once without getting bored.			"

												this game is totally amazing - and its pretty hard too - but - its never so hard that you think I cant do it theres always that itch that says yeah I can do it if I dont act like a noob this time - It has a control system sismilar to batman, mad max and most WB games BUT - it reaslly really works well in this - and the movements are so much more fluid than any other WB game and you will soon be seamlessly linking moves. There are a hell of a lot of button combos to remember initially BUT - the game makes it easy to learn them and is structured so that you can play at your own pace. Graphically the game is beautiful and here in lies one of the absolute gems in this game - PHOTO MODE - let me say it again - PHOTO FREAKING MODE - its awesome - you can pause the action at any point with all the particle effects and chars poised timelessly whilst you pan around get the angle right add a few filters and BOOOOM -

By: gullyDJ




oh yeah also it has this awesome combat system where the enemies that kill you actually level up - and if they kill you again they keep levelling up - and it works too - I managed to pickup the GOTY edition for 4£ and is an absolute gem - cant believe i totally missed it - but then most movie games are totally crap - Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor im really glad to say bucks that trend - maybe cos it doesnt follow the film or books exactly but it is a freaking awesome game.

												Absolutely amazing! Proof that not all stealth games are boring. Combat is fantastic, the graphics are superb and the gameplay is adaptive and addicting. The world looks and feels great, marking targets and hunting down captains can consume you for hours, nevermind the side missions and collectables. Perfectly combines Hand to Hand, Ranged and Stealth combat with a nice selection of skills and abilities  to make combat fluid and cinematic. I particularly like the vendetta missions where you are given an oppurtunity to avenge one of your online friends,adds an extended play/replay value. Highly recommend!			"

												Probably one of the best games based on a Tolkien license to date!Before this game got released, I had high doubts about their promised Nemesis system. No way this would work as described. But it totally does! This creates highly individual stories of revenge and vendetta for everyone. What else can you expect? One of the finest re-creations of the Arkham battle system, a lot of stealth, things to find, beasts to ride and orcs to kill. And don't let the first hours fool you. There's an entire second map to explore later on. Pretty great open world game!			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.This game, while it has just an ok story, and it can become a little bit repetitive, has an amazing combat system with a lot of great abilities and combos that you unlock throughout the game, and most importantly, the nemesis system which makes it stand out. The nemesis system is amazing. It makes the game more personal, you fight for own vengence. I really like it. So, I'll list the pros and cons, because I like lists:Pros:1. Great combat, extremely fun. 2. The nemesis system. Simply amazing.3. Great graphics, still looks good after 2 years.4. Great performance. 5. Large map, lots of things to do. 6. Good controls, best played with the Steam Controller, since you need to aim a lot and normal controllers suck♥♥♥♥♥for aiming. KB/M is good too but I think controller is better for the kind of combat this game has.7. Great voice work.8. Good score.9. Lots of fun abilities to unlock.Cons:1. Kind of a VRAM hog.2. Uninspiring boss fights. The combat is great... but the boss fights were really underwhelming.3. Not that lore-friendly to Lord of The Rings, but that's just being nitpicky.4. Can become a tiny bit repetitive. Thankfully killing orcs is so much fun.It's well worth the current full asking price of 40$, which also includes all the DLCs, but as of this review, it's on sale for 10$, which is a steal! Go for it!Highly recommended!			"

												Feel like a lore character!The combat is the best element of the gameplay. You can choose stealth, archery or sword and all three are fine, enjoyable and make you feel like you truly are an epic hero of songsThe game is flawless in graphics, but i never though them beautiful. I never had that moment of reflection where i felt i just wanted to stand and marvel at the landscape.The plot is very good and goes well with the lore so you should like it regardless of whether you know the lord of the rings world or not.However, while the main missions are interesting, the secondary missions lack variety and get boring very quickly.The game is also quite short. It took me only 24h or a weekend and a bit to finish up the game completely, inculding every achievment, collectable and everything else there was to do.There are two elements which deserve honorable mention. One is the orc politics. The orcs constatly fight amongst themselves, you can alter and influence these politics and later on you can use them to get ""your man"" in power.The second are the collectibles. Each items holds a story. These are interesting and worth collecting.Overall i recommend the game. It's won't last you for a long time, but it is still good enough that you should try it.			"

												strange... I really enjoyed War in the North and was expecting something similar, instead I have what can best be described as assassins creed in mordor.  It takes a little getting use to but once you've got the hang of attack and run you can slaughter your way across the map with impunity. Ride those caragors into battle for extra firepower and stealth kill with wild abandon.In its own way its a fun game, and some of the missions can be tricky, but as you grow in strength and abilities they get easier. Fire pits that explode and of course the nicely stacked barrels all make for good diversions and equally good killing zones. Swordplay is simply and effective, with the animation of the attacks initially quite entertaining.Its a good game in its own right and i'm having fun with it, but somehow its not quite as compelling as War in the North. Admittedly you have a more open environment and you can scale walls with ease and jump from ridiculous heights but part of the magic is the story line and although there is one, it just doesn't catch me the same way.Will play to completion, but to be honest unlikely to pick it up again afterwards, certainly wouldn't play it through again multiple times..  Its a good game, don't get me wrong, just less than I guess I'd been hoping for.			"

												One of the Best Games in a Long Time. Shadow of Mordor has a Very Good StoryLine, Eye Pleasing Environment where you just want to stroll around enjoying the scenery. That said it has a Very Fluidic Battle Style with a SeamLess Animation and Very Bloody Kills/Executions. The Quest can be fulfilled in multiple ways thus providing us(players/gamers) good feeling upon the completion of the Quest.The Graphic Standard is Pretty High as its a NextGen Game. Evem with High Texture Quality(All Other Settings Set to Ultra;Except Texture Quality) Set which requires a 3GB or Higher Video Memory The Texture Details are Very good. I just have to imagine the Ultra Texture Quality.The Story is Very Well Made except some missing information or to be said Less Introduced Boss Battles .Nevertheless Great Game. Must Play.    +1    Cheers! "

												This game is FUN. If Monolith was going to hit a homerun with any one aspect of the game, they certainly did with the combat along with the touted nemesis system. I never got bored of killing orcs, even after finishing off the map objectives and the various achievements. I find this was partially due to the progression of combat upgrades as you go through the game. It is immediately obvious how every new ability or rune is going to help the player in an engagement. By the end of the game previously dangerous multi-captain encounters become a lot more viable to survive through, and the number of risks the player can take dramatically increases. The level of difficulty decreases significantly, but I feel that the game never got easy enough to be boring. Especially true if you change your mindset to “can I survive this battle” to “how stylishly can I win this battle?” That all said, once fully powered with all of the upgrades, there isn’t much the game can throw at the player to really pose much challenge.The addictive combat carries the game through the bland story missions of the game. The voice acting and cutscene animation feel like wasted efforts on this game which really doesn’t seem to want to know what it wants to tell in terms of a plot. The missions just feel like excuses to kill orcs, which for the most part is all I really needed from them, I suppose. Most of the time you’re just given an npc to follow and a general objective to do x of y things while killing orcs. It would have been nice to have a little more variety and a stronger finish to the plot. The game certainly ends on less than a whimper. The ending is so quiet and abrupt that it’s hard to even be mad. But still certainly something that should be much improved in a future entry. The side missions suffer from a similar problem, but I feel that the limited scope of those tasks was generally more acceptable. Specifically, the slight difference in focus of the sword, bow, and dagger side objectives were interesting enough to make me want to complete all of them without it ever really feeling like a chore. The slave-rescue missions did, however, get a little long in the tooth and I found myself counting down how many more I had to do to finish out the bar. Never a good sign. The colored plant collecting also seemed like an undercooked concept. By late game all the plants were just a health restore and the color and type hardly ever mattered.The size of the maps in the game are also limited, but I didn’t really feel that the scope of the maps was strictly an issue. They were compact enough to not be tedious to cross or explore, but more damning was that they were lacking in interesting landmarks and came across as a somewhat bland. The general aesthetic of the areas were good and some of the vistas in the second map especially were really quite beautiful. It just feels like a waste to pepper the land with same-y looking ruined buildings and strongholds that felt like they could have been randomly generated. It felt like they started with a blank plot of land and took too few passes adding and subtracting from the template. On the other side of the coin, the orcs found within the nemesis system were highly varied and interesting. Not only that, but the emergent personal storytelling between the various players and their nemeses help to supplement the weakly written story of the game itself. The sharing of unique experiences among the various players is proof enough that the nemesis system, to some extent, provides a more interesting narrative (or at least collection of stories) than what is explicitly written. In fact, I feel like the greatest ‘story missions’ of the game were ones that simply let the player have full control and allowed any method to complete an open-ended goal involving the warchiefs. The game also does a great job in transitioning the player from participant within the nemesis system to director of the orc armies throughout the course of the game. Moving from simply experiencing being hunted by a specific orc or some such and going to manipulating the system through branding was really neat, and I only wish that branding opened up sooner. The late unlock of this ability didn’t really bother me, but I also saved a lot of the side-objectives for the very end of the game and likely didn’t have to wait as long as players that began completing those sorts of things much earlier than I did.Truly a game that is narrowly focused on its primary gameplay mechanics. The tertiary components are, as a whole, somewhat lacking. Depending on how much you value the aspects of storytelling and world building, that could significantly affect how you take to the game as a complete product. Even the music seemed a bit like an afterthought. The extent to which one enjoys the game's central combat and orc army manipulation systems will determine the extent that they forgive the other shortcomings.			"

												Cough.  *clears throat*.Nemesis.  Yes, nemesis.  Usually I just sit back and grind through a batman style game with a bit of ho-hum and my feet up on a chair.  It's a cinematic enjoyment.  I don't get too deep into it.  Sort of like how my 6 year old girl binge watches My Little Pony, it's hard to stop watching even if it gets kinda cheesy.  Often, I need some enticement to get into these type of games. Maybe a bit of craft beer - which paraphrasing a facebook post I saw is just an excuse to call my drinking problem a neat hobby.  Again, I have to reiterate that word - nemesis.What happened?  I died...and to my shock an Orc...what looks like a level 7 archer...has leveled up on me.  Over me to be exact.  That was wholly unexpected.And it happens again and again.  This is nemesis.  You don't just get to start over, there are consequences.  Revenges.  And some tedious S.O.B's who not only level up, but level up SEVERAL TIMES on me with no open attack option whatsoever until you get some intel on them or happen upon their weakness by accident.  This is what makes  Shadow of Mordor great.  There is a love to this grind.  And now, I honestly doubt I can play another batman game without it.Beyond that, there is a good - and I am no Tolkien scholar here - storyline of  a fellow by the name of Talion who is vulcan mind melded into a Elf-Human-Not-Quite-Dead captain that goes on a quest to take down the armies of Mordor single handedly ( although with a twist ).  We also get a few cameo quests with Gollum and a few bosses.  Yep, you heard that right.  A FEW bosses.  And not really tough bosses at that, yet I love this game nonetheless.  There are also giant thundercat-sidekick looking animals called caragors and some Rancor monster wannabes called graugs that after some questing are available for both riding and mayhem pleasures.  Plus, a great character named Torvin who is a dwarf of what sounds like Scottish decent and a crack up orc named Ratbag who makes a potty joke.The storyline can be completed linearly if you like, or not at all which is the way I played.  After only 3-4 quests I just starting taking on every single side quest for...um...10 hrs before I went back to the story.  It was that much fun killing orcs.  Except when I lost. Then all my hard work disappeared in a flash as the entire orc army I had decimated filled up the ranks all over again. Yet, by the time I was halfway through the story quests I had max health and 3-4 runes on my sword, dagger, and bow.  Good fun all in all.Later in the game you have the option of sabotaging the ranks by brain washing...ahem *branding*.. and that is a happy happy joy joy time if I have ever had one.  I think I preferred sneaking around and branding orcs more than killing them. If done well enough, victories were very fast too. And then you have to take over the whole army.  Sneaky style with the branding of the captains.  This can be easy or hard, depending on how you wish to do it.  I did a mix of both.  And in the end, messed up as I branded so many orcs that the last warchief I was supposed to brand got killed in battle and I had lost all the branded captains in the process.  No quest completion! I had to brand a new captain, promote him through the ranks, and prove himself in battle to fellow orcs.  And yet I did not complain.  Well.....whined a little, but no complaints.So, it's a great game.  Is it perfect? Absolutely not.  The last two story quests are super easy and there are not enough bosses.  Yet, this game is probably the way I want to play a batman style game for the rest of my life. I still have the season pass DLC to finish, and the Bright Lord story is playing great so far, but still working on it.  Will save that for a different review.  Cheers. "

												This game deserves the ""AAA"" title. It's one of the few games in the last years i do not regret spending good money on it. It does not invent something super new, but it combines a lot of proven game mechanics together.Haven't had so much fun with combat in a long time.Now with the brilliant ""photo mode"" update you can really capture some awesome moments in this beautiful built enviroment.Looking for some Batman: Arkham City + Assassins Creed blend, in the Lord of the Rings setting ?Go for it !   10/10			"

												This has to one of the best games that I've played. Sure after 100% and all the DLC it may get a little bit repetitive but the achievement hunting is one of the best parts some are easy some take time and thats what I like about the game.There's a level cap and not as many skills as there could be but that's a game for you. If I had a job I would buy it at the $30 price tag that it sits at but since I don't I would wait for spring sale (is that a thing?) or summer just because 50% off is a big deal you could go get another 1-3 games with that leftover cash.

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor: Road Warrior: Judgement Day: The Hunt for the Red October is kind of cool I guess.You play as Troy Baker pretending to be Talion, a Ranger of Gondor who lives on the Black Gate of Mordor with his wife and son where absolutely nothing can go wrong. Oh no, everything went wrong! The Black Gate is attacked by, surprise surprise, the forces of Sauron and Trayvon and his family are murdered, then the game ends. Okay no, I'm just yanking your chain. It turns out that Talion and his family were sacrificed to bring back a wraith to the waking world. A wraith that was probably enjoying it's nap before some jerk who looks like my heroin dealer killed a few shmucks to try and... I don't know, catch him in a bottle or something. The wraith, having been reading JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and playing Persona games on his down time, thought it would be super cool to roleplay as his favorite Stand by possessing one of the dead people and refusing them the embrace of death. And so begins the journey of Troyion and Spookyface as they exact their revenge on the orcs of Mordor.But these aren't your typical orcs, no sir. These are the Senior year High School Rugby Team equivalent  of orcs. Uruks are supposed to be larger, angrier, and all around ruder than their rank and file counterparts, though you probably wouldn't be able to tell considering how easily Tony tears them to pieces. And since the average Uruk goes down the same way I go down for 20 dollars whenever Terry is in their view, it's kind of hard to imagine that these guys will someday lead Sauron's black army through the gates of Mordor. Well that's where the big thing that was advertised comes into play. Basically the game randomly generates some named officer Uruk's that serve as mini-bosses for Terrance to fight, such as Otrek the brain-damaged or Twerky the Goblin. Each one of these mooks has a set power level and abilities that make them differ from your average Uruk, they also have this novelty where they remember who Tron 2.0 is and what he did to them if they manage to survive an encounter with him. Though the novelty wears off after a few hours, especially later on when you're bottle necked into fighting them a certain way considering they have more abilities the higher their power level is (Or at least that's what I figured.). Okay now I'm going to say some bad things about this game. As overplayed as J.R.R. Tolkien's works are in modern times, Middle-earth itself is a very magical place (No, not that kind of magic, stupid, the other kind). Through the books, yes I can read, the movies, and even other video games, Middle-earth always felt like a real place, with it's own history and people and cultures. It's a place that, even with all it's dangers, you would want to explore and visit, see it's people and locations. That magic just isn't there for Shadow of Mordor. I know it's based in the one place in Middle-earth that looks like my bathroom, and it's supposed to be much more grim than it's counter parts, but it almost feels like a cop out, like it cheated and just slapped on the Middle-earth name for brand recognition. It doesn't feel like a game set in Middle-earth, it's far too isolated and lonely for me to care about the settings and characters of the story. I can't say much about the combat, I mean, it worked for me in the Batman games, and the saving grace for it here is just how vicious Talion uses his weapons on his enemies. It's like somebody killed his family or something. But should you play Central-hearth: House of Trogdor? I say get it on the cheap. If you can ignore all of it's story and play it like some sort of heavy metal inspired fan fiction, then you'll probably get a few hyucks out of it. I would like to see the nemesis system make it's return in another game, though, it seems cool enough for people to do neat things with it.

												Bought this game for 5€ and it was definitely worth it.It's a good game. The orc leader system is fun and I spent the first few hours of my game time just killing the leaders.Well optimised, good graphics. Characters are beautiful and well animated. I had some weird FPS hiccups ever now-and-then but it wasn't anything serious.The levelling system is very bland. It felt more like ""gathering the necessary"" than actual progression.Weapon upgrades even more. You cannot swap your weapons, you're stuck with a sword, dagger and a bow for the rest of the game. No axes or maces, no shields or sabres, and upgrades just alter the stats of your weapons.Very good game in general, but the beginning hours were much better than the mid/late game.As soon as orcs with shields started spawning, the game became annoying. Due to poor controls, it was hard to control my character's moves and many times I ended up slashing the wrong enemy, killing a person who has information or orcs, but most of all I kept stunning the wrong enemies and/or not killing stunned enemies (but attacking an enemy who is immune against regular sword attacks INSTEAD of attacking a stunned enemy who is right in front of me).Or an orc who is mind-controlled and is helping you, mind-controlled orcs are not excluded from the randomised attack targeting and I think I accidentally killed quite a lot of them because of this.Even worse, the berserk enemies who revert all your front melee attacks towards you - my character keeps attacking those even though I'm pressing keys to attack enemies who are in a different direction. It's very wierd because you are getting punished for attacking a wrong enemy, yet you have no control over the targeting.Another feature I didn't like is the hunting. Animals are impossible to block and you must jump away from their attacks. However, the game seemed to lock me away from controls as soon as the ""jump away"" button appeared, and it never actually did anything and I recieved damage even though I did press what I had to.Side missions (slave rescue and challanges) feel very unsatisfying and repetetive.The final fight was very disappointing aswell, but I don't want to spoil anything more.Overall, good game. Feels and plays like Assassin's Creed, but actually fixes many problems I hated about the AC series. Very good story and visuals, satisfying combat. Suffers from bad controls just like Assassin's Creed.Plays best with a gamepad by the way.			"

MIDDLE-EARTH: SHADOW OF MORDORREVIEWEveryone had some hype about this game. But no one expected that it would become the game it is today. The 2014 Game of the Year so far. Shadow of Mordor show mastery in all aspects of the game, with an amazing setting in Tolkien's Middle Earth, taking place in Mordor, with RPG elements, open world, a lot of quests and minor things,amazing graphics. good story taking place before LOTR. It's the ultimate Tolkien game experience so far. And there is the Nemesis System, which is amazing and is a pretty good new mechanic to gaming. The combat is acrobatic, gory and cool, there is a good satisfaction in ripping off a orc head. There is parkour too. The tooks 30 hour to complete 100%. The only problem about it is that it becomes a repetitive,but until the last moment is still fun.+Good graphics+Amazing, gory and acrobatic combat+Open World in Mordor+A lot of types of enemies+Good challenges and side quests+Good story set before LOTR+Epic Soundtrack+Decent characters+Nemesis System+Ending points a sequel+The ultimate Tolkien gaming experience so far+Monster Mounts are epic cool+A lot of abilities to your weapons, like runes+Troy Baker+Photo mode+Free skins -Repetitive Amazing technical spetacle with loads of fun.

												Game's a lot of fun, if a little repetitive (in the same way that most open world games can get after you've been playing them for fifteen hours or more). Extremely polished combat system that is just ripped right off from the Batman Arkham games, but then slightly improved for maximum smoothness and fluidity. It's entirely possible to fight a group as big as the game can handle rendering, and if you're on the ball it'll look easy. Really enjoyable gameplay elements, not too obnoxious on the collectables, and some RPG elements as many games of this sort now have to give you a sense of reward for time spent and a sense of progression.Definitely recommend it on a sale, might even be worth full price if it were still the month it came out :)			"

												There are plenty of professional and other types of reviews of the game out there. But in a short summary it's an open world action rpg with activities to do similar to the batman games. It does feel repetitive after 30 minutes of playing even but if you like this type of combat and this type of gameplay you won't mind the repetitiveness. After all you are a warrior within the LoTR universe out to seek revenge on those who killed you and you need to do anything to disrupt their work so this implies limit to the gameplay, you won't be flying in space or w/e. I'm giving it thumbs up because I'm enjoying the game and I recommend playing it on the hardest difficulty possible else it will be too easy. Also wait for a sale as well, even though it is a good game in my opinion it's not worth the full price unless you swim in money.			"

												Why do all the Orks sound like cockneys?On a serious note this game is excellent, the nemesis system in particular. Been able to manipulate and control the Ork hierarchy is awesome creating some of the finest situations/conflicts with a multitude of Ork captains. Each Ork will remember each encounter you've had with them. This game is worth getting just for this mechanic alone. Also it's combat mechanic is based on the FreeFlow combat of the Arkham series. So it's a combat system that's easy to learn but hard to master. Talion has many different means of attacks to dispatch the Ork menace: Like getting into the thick of things then you can build up your combo and instantly kill orks with some flashy kills.Stealth kills your thing, then you can hide in some bushes and wait for an unassuming Ork to come across your path giving you the perfect oppurtunity to slit their throat.Don't like been touched or have issues with personal space then you're in luck you can fire a rain of arrows upon thine enemy at a safe distance. Or just attract some caragors to rend Ork flesh from bone.Too lazy to lift a finger? Then you can dominate your foe's to have them fight for you. How efficient is that! There's also a story in there about a dead man and a dead elf joining forces to take down the Dark Lord Sauron's Black Hand.			"

												This review is coming from someone who knows absolutely nothing about Lord of the Rings or it's magnates. In short, I recommend this game as there is amble enough to keep one busy. On the contrary, the game doesn't really try to break any new grounds regarding gameplay but is inclusive about different styles of play within it's approach. I feel like Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham games were slapped really hard together.  There is to me what feels two modes to the gameplay, the exploring/sneaking scenario and the attacking/under attack scenario. The exploring stage the player is allowed to choose their own mission (which many are available throughout). One can continue the storyline, explore side stories about the wraith for example, go on missions to slay captains and weaken Sauron's army, or missions to build up RPG elements of your character. A neat feature is going after orc captains. As you kill captains you gain power, but as captains kill you they gain recognition for their efforts. There is a pause menu that gives information about these individuals. The other menus consistent of runes that power up your sword, bow, or dagger are also easy to navigate. To add a cherry on top, the player has the ability to improve their skills in certain areas, such as being able to run faster or do certain attack combinations. There is a lot to do, but when it comes down to doing it I find the game play can be a lot of pressing x followed by countering with y. The fight system is good, just lacking I feel at times. The scenes where the player kills the opponent are nice schematics to watch, but can feel repetitive over time. The graphics are spectacular as the environment immerses you in the game. Guards that watch over slaves are heard interacting with them or even chasing them. These graphics can demand quite the work from your graphics card.The game is good and would recommend purchase on sale. As stated before, it is a good game and offers some neat elements, however it's failure to go over and above sort of limits it's rating. What saves it's rating in some aspects is that it did slap multiple game-styles together.

												So i played this game first on the ps4 and i really enjoyed it so much that i bought it for the pc aswell this game is basically if Assassin's creed and Batman Arkham games had a baby this game is a joy to play and heres why:Story: you are a ranger watching the black gate ? i think ? while having some family issues the right hand of Sauron attacks you and sacrifices you to summon a spirit that died with the ring the spirit gets into you instead and revives you from the dead so you can have your revenge against the right hand of Sauron.In my opinion the story is the weak part in this game because you wont be caring about any characters they introduce to you Gameplay: so the gameplay is the fun part you will be slaying orcs or as they call them uruks a stronger version of orcs and their leaders the combat is a complete copy from batman but there is stealth like in assasins creed and parkour as well this game has a special system called the nemesis system in which the uruks will remember what you have done and if you kill someone and he survives that uruk will come back for revenge your main goal in this game is to win up the 5 warchiefs and make them your minions from the skills youll get as being a host of a spirit pros: great gameplay really brutal and satisfying the nemesis system works  awesome of course it takes time in the lord of the rings universe so you nerds will enjoy it cons: poor story and characters THE STORY BOSSES NOT COUTING THE FIRST ONE WHICH IS THE ONLY ONE WHO IS AWESOME ARE AWFULLcombat can get rapatative after 30 hours of gameplay XDDmy final score for this game is 8.5/10 i really enjoyed this game and i hope you all will			"

												This Open World Title is absolutly amazing to say the least.... Shadow of Mordor is a continued story based on where the Lord of the Rings finnished off. The story is really good and being a fan of the Lord of the Rings, Shadow of Mordor really made sense stroy wise and I really enjoyed the new characters that were introduced and how they refer back to old characters from Lord of the Rings. Overall 10/10 for the story line. The action and combat system is unreal and I felt at home just after a little while playing. The combos are insane and you can really rank your abilities to draw one mean♥♥♥♥♥combo that will destroy an entire Uruk army! The ranking system is broken into two sections which require different tasks to rank them up and unlock new abilities. How to unlock new abilities is really straight forward to understand and really fun to do. The side quests are really enjoyable and take some time to complete which in my book is great because if you want to take a slight break from the story then you can try out some challenging side quests before carrying on with the main stroy. Some of the side quests are hard so prepare yourself and hold on to your paitence levels. The maps are great and there is a lot of exploring to do and the layout allows you to use the enviroment to your advantage during combat which I really liked a lot. The creatures that dwell around are amazing too and really add a great impact to the general map feel. Overall the game felt like a 10/10 for me and I am really looking forward to the follow up on the Shadow of Mordor in the Future.			"

												Some of the better (if not the best) video games featured within Tolkien's legendarium are surprisingly the ones which take an auxiliary part during the timeline of the LOTR trilogy. Shadow of Mordor is no exception. It boasts an impressive map (divided in two zones), filled with details and areas to explore. The size of the map may not be as large as other open-world video games, but the excellent combat system which can be sprinkled with stealth sections, totally makes up for it. This is not a game that gets boring after the first few hours and I'm sure that along with it's DLC, it is worth buying it. Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor manages to fill the gap between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while providing a fun game even for new Tolkien fans, as it features plenty of lore of it's own and a natural difficulty scale. It goes without saying that it is a gorgeous game at maxed-out detailling, though you will need a powerful system and 6GBs of VRAM for the best textures. It fully deserves the Game of the Year awards it has received from several publications.			"

												Well, I did enjoyed the whole game through-and-through, completed the campaign and then went for the DLCs, ended up getting every achievement too so I'd 100% the heck of it! :DNice graphics even for today's standards, decent voice acting, both original in english and dubbed to latinoamerican spanish. Animations were good, just sometimes somewhat goofy due to box interactions and whatnot, not a problem more like an amusement. I played it with an xbox one pad, the controls were fine BUT I did had some problems with quick turns, aiming (and firing) with the arch and the QTE with last chance scenes; the damn stick was too slow to reach the center circle, compared to some videos gameplays I saw from other people. Maybe there was an option for setting sensitivity but I thought changing those would make it harder to control while Talion turning left or right, I mean I didn't see an option to change JUST the sensitivity of QTE death chances and similar events WITHOUT changing aiming with arrows or overall controls..I know and hope that when and IF you're playing with keyboard and mouse, you HAVE to AND SHOULD aim with your mouse, your aiming skills, like in an FPS or tps, but with a gamepad, well, it's known you'd be using auto aim, which before buying a pad I always thought console gamers bragging about headshots where it was always auto-aim not really their skills... after trying it for myself, it was difficult, specially with the wraith (Celebrimbor) which doesn't have ""bullet-time"", you're supposed to move the analog sticks to do headshots on moving targets on real time, with a stick.. so yeah.Sometimes -and this is something many games do WRONG- the camera skews or moves to weird angles and you're thrown off for a second, at least I do because controls are tied to the cam view, what I mean by this is that you plan your way and actions based on what you're seeing, if the cam AWKWARDLY switches in the middle of something, or if you're about to fight and the enemy gets outside the camera OR YOU ARE, then that's F'ed up and throws me off from the moment, from the game. I need it to be constant, precise, either the cam should follow the player from distance and NEVER EVER come so near that'd you only see your character and nothing else! WTF?! I get so mad when that happened, M. E. Shadow of Mordor wasn't and isn't the only game that does this, I don't know why or how it doesn't get picked up by testers if they even test it before releasing it, if they play it in PC where you're sit at certain distance from your monitor, PROBABLY not on a couch at 6 mts (12 ft?) from your 42'' TV so maybe in that case it doesn't bother that much.Still, camera & controls are the one thing I hold against this (and others) game that uses it, I pure and simply hate it when you're ""caged-in"" with the cam on your char's face, it makes it even worse if the game has no lock-on or target system. Why oh Lord why?!Did you know the Legacy of Kain saga? specially Soul Reaver ones, you were pretty much screwed if the cam decided to change while you were platforming; you'd fall to the void and die, ALOT! imagine what would Dark Souls be with bad camera, you can't simply move from point A to B if the camera switches mid-air or when you had to do a quick turn, not even mention it during fights with no lock on enemies, what a fun happy time! (sarcasm btw).I've played Resident Evil back in the day, it has fixed camera angles, sometimes it was too weird, but if you kept pushing the same stick or key from certain direction, despite the camera changing you'd still get there, it required some getting used to that, like if you'd tried it now, today, after playing free-cam or follow camera, you'd need to adjust to it, but it was still doable because camera NEVER EVER CAGED YOU IN!! you'd know what's around you, right?Middle earth Shadow of Mordor is a cool game, an enjoyable one, but it has its caveats. Despite being mostly a sword (and dagger) fighting game, with stealth touches which I liked, still needs some coherence when fighting close quarter combat or CQC as MGS calls it :P you'd need a proper cam and responsive controllers. That's it.Sometimes it flat fails with this, sometimes is alright and you still manage, sometimes it costs you the mission, or sidequest, because it's against the clock and that fall there or that delay over there took the few seconds you needed to reach the spot in time. Well, you're screwed buddy. Though luck. Deal with it.TL;DR: good game, some say it's an Assassins Creed on mordor, slaughtering orcs and uruks.Nemesis system is quite good and a good innovation we hope to see in other games too.It has upgrade system and lots to items to collect, some serve to fill in the story a bit more, which is nice.liveaction quality was good too, it's WB after all!Graphics and sound are pretty good and still aged well after a few years.Controls and cam need some work, but after GOTY version (heck even at launch) nobody is going to fix it, so..By now you'd played this game, specially because you can get it for like 5 US dollars the GOTY version, it's a great game which will entertain you for like 60 hs to get everything, collection items, DLC, and achievements.Thumbs up!

												This is such a satisfying game in so many ways. NO SPOILERS HERE. :)Pros:+Story is great with some great characters.+17 hours to complete the main story, all major side objectives, and find all the collectibles.+Stealth is so much fun and the game gives you so many ways to approach objectives. +Combat is Solid and the hitstreak abilities are super awesome.+Wraith abilities are SO cool!+Nemesis system is amazing. This is how you incorporate procedural generation in games properly. More games need to follow Shadow of Mordor's lead on this. +The collectibles have purpose (bonus M currency which allows you to unlock certain upgrades and bonus backstory/lore tidbits).+Branding orcs and having them fight for you is the coolest thing in any game ever. Killing a warchief with his own bodyguards! HA!Cons:-Some of the collectibles that give voice acted dialogue backstory force you to stay in the menu if you want to hear it. No walking around with it playing in the background. -Final boss is a quick time event, but there were 2 big battles and a stealth boss fight just before it though so this isn't a huge issue really. I was just a little disappointed by it. -If you rush through the main missions and ignore everything else you're gonna have a hard time. Plan your attack by doing the side missions and killing/branding the right orcs though and its pretty easy.Tips:+Intel is your friend! Know your enemies strengths/weaknesses! This can save you a LOT of frustration. Every Uruk is different.+Listen to the Uruks idle conversations, they comment on stuff the player does and provide subtle tips to the player. +ALWAYS brand or kill a warchief's bodyguards before you face him by hunting them down beforehand.+DO NOT LET THEM LIGHT THE BEACON!

												A cool action game, with nice graphics and most important, fun gameplay. Combining the basic elements of Batman and AC games turns out just fine. Also the Nemesis system is interesting as an idea, pitty that it goes useless after half-way through the game because you become overpowered. Certainly worths a try (especially on a sale period, it's almost free).P.S.   -----SPOILER ALERT-----The semi-final and final boss fights are in my opinion the worst things of the game and definately top-3 of the worst boss fights in my 25 year gaming experience. Developers probably ran out of time :)			"

												It's pretty good, but be warned that the story is kind of short and not that great. The Nemesis system is fun and improves through the course of the game. There's not a lot to do when you finish besides getting the achievements. You end up killing orcs over and over again until they're all under your control, then you have to kill them all and start over. Having said all this, the game is fun and I'd say it is worth the £30.7.5/10			"

												Disclaimer: Mixed review. Didn't feel like it deserved a Recommendation.Have actually read the books. Seen all the films. Im passionate about this, so criticism isn't done to ""hate on"" the game. I just want to see something like this but better done.Positives-Beautiful Setting -Beautiful graphics-World building is great through the collecteable artefacts which help flesh out Mordor as a once pure land.-Planning assassinations. The game is perfect in terms of a sandbox. You have various ways to approach objectives (through climbing up to the tops of ruins or fighting through hordes of enemies with the combat system)Neutrals / Negatives. (Most of these are borderline negative)-""Arkham"" style combat. Some may enjoy this, but others will be sick of it. Having only ever had experience with it in this game, I hate it. Its love or hate really. I personally found it repetetive, dull and unengaging-""Nemesis"" system. As a selling point for the game, its really rather poorly done. The first few Uruk Hai who kill you will be memoreable. They'll make thay introductory experience great. The problem is the system loses its charm for various reasons...1) A kill ""Nemesis"" can come back from the dead. This completley ruins the experience as it takes away that satisfaction of having killed that Nemesis. It makes them seem like a regular enemy.2) Being constantly killed by one Nemesis can make him so strong that he literally becomes unkilleable. Throwing spears that kill you in 1 hit AND the enemy is invulnerable to being stealth killed OR an arrow to the head? The system needs some kind of limiter to make a nemesis seem challenging, but not the Lord of bloody Mordor.-The map areas are split. The game has 2 separate open world areas. It would have been better to have 1 large one ; no loading times between zones, better game flow and itd make the Nemesi seem more... ""Alive"". Both map zones have different Nemesi ; the whole point of the system is to make enemies memoreable, yet all this does is make you forget them.-Poor story. Generic ""avenge your family"" story. So much more could have been done based on the source material at hand.-Bland main character. Why should I care about Talion? He isnt developed in any way. One could argue that this is to allow us to ""impose ourselves onto him"". Rubbish. If so, make him voiceless and fix the story. We're apparently meant to care about his family having been murdered.-Repetetive. Some may like this. I certainly don't. The ""challenges"" arent challenging (dull if anything). The combat is samey, the Nemesis system loses value after a while.-Huge download. It was at 42.1 GIGABYTES. Why? Prerendered cutscenes are included, inflating the file size. Why not just have in game ones? The graphics are already fantastic.-Doesn't stay true to lore. Although the setting does stay true to the lore (not ALL of Mordor is a blasted hellscape), the insertion of some creatures (namely Ghuls) is not lore friendly.Final CommentsIt feels like an Assassins Creed game set in Arda. Thats probably the best way to sum it up honestly. I can't recommend a dull, repetetive game that has a ""Novelty"" system that wears thin after a while. Save your money for something of better quality.EDIT 1: Clarity issues.			"

												At first, I was pretty dissapointed. I felt like it thrown us into the open world way too soon. This game is really not relying on his story much but more on his gameplay.You'll get short (very well done) cutscenes in most main missions and that's about it story wise.It's short but has very interesting pieces of lore that was never mentionned in LOTR or the Hobbit.So to sums this upStory : Would have taken more but what we had was good!Gameplay : Perfect! The battles are extremely fluid, I'd say even more than Assassin's Creed!Graphics : Awesome and also well optimised! Always had 60+FPS with a GTX980 and i5 4690k!Difficulty : Waaaaaay too easy! If you played AC before, this will be a piece of cake for you! No difficuly settings either...Lenght : Kinda short, especially if you rush main quests a bit. Tons of collectibles if you are into that.I would really recommend if the game is around 15-30$ LOTR fans will love this!			"

												Literally a mash-up between Assassin's Creed (stealth mechanics\parkour) and Batman (combat system). For some reasons, it works really good. Pros: Gameplay it's FABULOUS, one of the funniest game I've played recently (in terms of gameplay).Nice musics, some voices are flawless.Nice graphics the game runs on a 760 without problems Nemesis system is lovely AWESOME screenshot tool integratedThe story isn't bad, but... (look down)LOTR universe Bright Lord\Lord of the Hunt DLC are greatmore than 30h (base game + dlcs) ""Nan iChîr Gelair Mordor"" - ""I am The Bright Lord of Mordor"" yes, you'll learn elvish Cons:I said that some voices are flawless, well it's true, but some of them are pretty badsome times blood effects are a bit weird and some textures are not that awesome.It could be repetitive, it's personal, I found the game funny anyway.The story is pretty ""simple"" and tbh it didn't get me that much.Bright Lord DLC it's not perfectly polished Orcs are slightly stupids, but well, at the end of the day they can't be scientists  "

												As a huge fan of LOTR i found the storyline very interesting and how it delves deep into a not fully known time period in Middle Earth history. And even if you're not a particular fan of LOTR you can still play this game as it differs from the time period in which LOTR is set. This game does a good job of explaining the story line too so you don't get lost at any point.The visual quality of this game is fantastic and all the models and textures of characters, creatures and other wild life are great.The game is split into two maps which are both very large and open to exploration/free roaming. There are some side missions/challenges that are fun to do. You can also create your own missions by targeting certain Uruk captains or warchiefs and killing them off.The combat style of this game really impressed me, some compare it to assassins creed and I can see why. However, it is much broader than that as you have loads of extra abilities to unlock and you can use surroundings and distractions to your advantage. There is a great stealth and tactical element to the game and you can, most of the time, stealth your way to anywhere you want if you play it right. The game will tell you how to use these distractions but its up to you how well you use them. You are also able to ride certain beasts which is always fun!The ""sauron's army"" section is really cool too as it shows you how an Uruk army might work, there is lots to do thre as well once you are able to ""brand"" or ""dominate"" uruk captains and warchiefs.I haven't encountered any sorts of lag AT ALL while playing this game which i was very happy with.My PC has 8GB of RAM, 4GB 770 GTX Windforce GPU and a i-3575k CPU just to put the ""no lag"" into perspective.Playing about 24 hours of this game I have encountered 1 map glitch and another very minor glitch during one ""legend of Urfael"" (side)mission. Both were easy to solve as one was falling inside a wall, all i had to do was teleport back to the wraith tower and the other one is more complex to explain but it involved me having to distance myself from ""branded"" uruks in order to allow me to kill other ""branded"" uruks lol. Lastly, I have tried two of the DLCs so far and again the storylines of those are great and they delve deeper into Middle Earth Lore as I expected. There is actually quite a lot of extra content as they provide you with lots of extra missions. However, they don't bring any new map locations to the game, but that isn't disappointing really as i didn't expect new locations.Overall the game quality is amazing and the missions are very varied in objective, i recommend this game to everyone who enjoys free-roaming and also loads of combat stealth or not. The cut-scenes in this game are also great and enjoyable to watch, some are semi-interactive. To those who like LOTR and its lore this is a game for you!			"

												Some will say this game doesn't do much of anything new. Well, this is true. It does one thing I don't see in any other game, and that one thing doesn't show up until about two-thirds of the main story is complete. BUT, everything this game borrows from other games is done so well it's a blast to play. It looks great (especially at night when there's heavy rain), runs great, and the controls are *mostly* up to the task. There's a lot to do here and a lot of freedom over how to do them. My one regret is that I bought this game when it launched but waited over a year to actually play it. It's a gem and I should have played it sooner.			"

												It's fun.If you like this type of beat-em-up (or whatever) style game then pick up the GOTY edition during the holiday or summer sale. Some advice for fun: Just do the main quest line until after you get to the second area and gain the ability to mind control orcs.I beat the main campaign at around 37 hours having done almost all of the side quests and messed around for a good while just killing and/or marking orcs for fun. It controls well.			"

												This definitely is the best game set in Lord of the Rings universe. I played Return of the King on PS2 and that was really fun at the time, and War in the North was an ok game but certainly lacking in many areas. So being the best LotR game isn't exactly a hard thing to do, though Shadow of Mordor is actually a very good game.A lot of people have compared this to Assassin's Creed but I'd say this is much closer to Batman Arkham games, though all these games do share a lot of similarities but still are very unique and do what they do really well.What SoM does extremely well is the Arkham style sneaking and combat, and at parts even better thanks to nemesis system and how it changes the game. You counter with Y(played on controller) like in Arkham, and you also can do instant takedowns once hit streak is high enough. Talion also has a cool bow that later on gets the ability to teleport to the target and kill the orc instantly, this is really fun to do. Stealth also works like in AC, you can climb stuff, take down enemies etc.Nemesis system is the innovative part of the game. Orcs have kind of this hierarchy with chiefs at the top. Later on when you get all the powers at your disposal, you can really start taking down this hierarchy and through branding, taking over enemy orcs, you can infiltrate the enemy and build your own army. This is really interesting as every encounter is different, I was genuinely surprised how much variation there is, as in no repetition at all as every orc I encountered was different, had different skills and the way to approach them was different. You can also buff the enemies up by issuing death threat through one of the orcs, the orc you death threat powers up significantly but also gives chance to drop a epic rune that you can fit in your bow, sword and dagger to power them up with different perks.There is a lot more to the nemesis system and how it works, it's really something that has to be experienced as it's different from anything else, some true innovation and something other devs most likely will be taking note of, at least I hope so.SoM is solid game and I do recommend playing it just for the nemesis system and combat/stealth elements. But the story, world, characters etc. just left me disappointed, I didn't really care for anything happening and the interactions between characters were awkward and not well build. I wanted so much more from this as this is set in Lord of the Rings universe. There was so much more they could've done and made something much bigger, but I just feel like they played it way too safely.			"

Warner Brothers spin on Middle Earth was not as bad as I thought it would be, but if you studied the movies and books you can easily find their changes from J. R. R. Tolkien's timeline.			"

												As many have before me, I cannot reiterate how Shadow of Mordor combines the best of two great fanchises, Assassin's Creed and Batman's Arkham series. Stunning graphics, fun gameplay, great controls, the fact it's open world, and the new nemesis system all make this game fantastic. This game is far from perfect however, as the gameplay can get repetetive after a while, and the lack of a difficulty setting makes the game harder to replay.The nemesis system works great on paper, but in practice, it is rarely utilized. I remember when I was first starting out, I managed to die to a random no name Uruk while trying to bush assassinate him, promoting him to captain and making him far stronger than any foe I had previously faced. While great and all, I finally was able to kill him after realizing he died instantly from stealth finishers... The problem however, is that it is fairly hard to die. The only real reason I actually died to my former nemesis in the first place was because I was new to the game and didn't fully understand the last chance system where when brought to fatal health, you are given what seems to be at least 3 or 4 seconds to move your mouse into a circle and press the shown button. First of all, there is a rune (modification for your weapon) that gives you a second last chance, and second of all, you are given way to much time to execute this action, and once completed you regenerate around maybe half your health? Usually in these situations, I would simply run away and collect an herb (health kit basically) to regenerate to full.The game also goes from being a challenge to being fairly easy midway through the story which isn't too bad. That brings up the main story, which to me, seems a bit short (around 16 hours to complete for me) based on the nature of this game. Of course the length really depends on how much exploration or side quests (which there are plenty of) you do. However, this opinion may be somewhat biased as I am currently playing through Arkham Origins and Skyrim. This is not that bad however, as the DLC included in the GOTY edition adds much more unique content (I am guilty of not actually playing this content, so I can't fully review it). By the end of the main story, I still had at least 8 or so abilities not yet leveled and many upgrades not yet purchased. The many side quests ultimately are not necessary for completing the main story.The story itself however, was very interesting to me (a semi avid Lord of the Rings fan). This game in fact, taught me the difference between skipping cutscenes and not. The voice acting, sound effects and AI overall are just amazing.After all those negative remarks you may be doubting this purchase. That however is not what I meant to convey. Though not perfect (as no game is) this game was a blast and is definitely worth your while. One of the best games I have played so far, and I would definitely reccomend this game to others. There are definitely things the game could have improved upon, but overall, I would rate this game 8.5/10To put this in perspective, if a harder difficulty were introduced, this would probably be a 9.5/10			"

												So in this game you play as a Middle Earth version of a forum troll. You spend your time wandering the lands of others and inflicting misery upon them either directly showing up to ruin other people's fun or getting something else to do it for you. There is considerable diversity in the options available to you to help in this goal, and as a whole it is quite fun and well-designed. You can be sneaky, learn more about your targets, and then exploit that knowledge by capitalizing upon the weaknesses of others. Or you can just go in swinging and planning to cause as much mayhem as possible, though this can sometimes prove dangerous as you are in a land hostile to your intentions and there is always a danger of being overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Both methods are great fun, and of course random occurances in an open world can allow for some quite amusing and unplanned encounters.In short, you spend your time in this game spreading misery to others for the sake of your own pleasure and amusement. I suppose you could follow what passes as the story, but ultimately you will likely find yourself distracted as you come up with new and interesting ways to cause mayhem and chaos.I think I'm gonna play this for a while.

												Slick controls, tons of optional challenges and collectibles, a few innovative game  mechanics and multiple progression systems make this is very fun game. It stays mostly true to Tolkien's mythology, though it takes a few liberties in order to tell its story properly. I especially liked the collectibles that gave you a voice-acted glimpse into the past.My biggest problem is that the combat becomes crazy easy once you unlock certain abilities and Runes. Even the hardest warchiefs and their bodyguards become easy to defeat if you know how to chain your abilities right.All in alI highly recommend this game, though the DLC is a bit of a mixed bag.			"

tl;dr -> Play as Batman an assassin agent of Good before the events of The Lord of the Rings. 11/10 orc-killing simulator.I got this game on launch and was so excited to play because I love the Middle Earth universe and Assassin's Creed/Arkham playstyle. I absolutely adored my gameplay experience - to the point that I gave SoM the #1 spot in my Top 5 games of 2014. The aesthetics are beautiful - the amount of detail in the characters and game world are very well-done. When it rains for the first time, you will be in for a nice treat - the raindrops flicking off of your feet and body have a nice effect. The blood and gore come in copious amounts, enough to satisfy anyone who enjoys mutilation and flying body parts (in slow-motion too). The sounds, music, and voice acting are superb and add to the immersion into the ME universe. The story is satisfactory - your typical quest for ultimate vengeance - but there definitely is a lot of lore to be found within (especially in the numerous side missions).The controls are not too difficult to familiarize yourself with, especially if you've played any games in the Assassin's Creed/Batman Arkham franchises. The keyboard and mouse combo work perfectly, but I personally prefer the controller. There is a helpful tutorial that will show you the beginning mechanics you need to know, and more are provided whenever a new element is introduced to the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with open-world action RPGs. I would recommend anyone with experience to play on the hardest difficulty to increase immersion - I found that mid/late-game the game took a big dive in difficulty. The game has a certain way intended for you to play - interrogating enemies to find the weaknesses of stronger chiefs - however, I found that after ~10 or so hours of playing, I could just blitz through and go straight for the orc chiefs (brute-forcing them even if I was using an ineffective strategy). From what I've seen in the online community, many people will actually let themselves die to force enemy leaders to level up (even then it wasn't too challenging). I will admit, the journey to achieving a god-like character is fun and gruelling - in my first few hours, I would run away if I ever encountered 2 or more leaders simultaneously, now, I will purposely run into as many level 15+ (20 is the max) chieftains as possible (and still barely break a sweat).Gameplay consists of you doing a variety of different missions throughout the kingdom of Mordor. There are  two main map locations you will be frequenting, the second typically providing higher level enemies. Like most open-world RPGs, there are a large variety of side quests available, each having a bit of text flavor explaining something to do with your player character (ex: how he snuck into an encampment and assassinated everyone; the flavor for a stealth-oriented mission). If you are familiar with any of the Assassin's Creed/Batman Arkham games, then gameplay will feel very similar. You can usually choose to use violence or stealth when traversing through areas/missions, but be aware that you will face a sea of enemies should the alarm be raised. To avoid this, a good strategy is to move toward the alarm and kill anyone attempting to raise it (even hitting them will stop the alarm process). Combat is very, very fluid and looks fantastic. You have a heavy and quick attack, counter, dodge, and can use a bow and arrow. Later, you will be able to unlock new abilities when you gain enough experience to level up. Abilities include throwing a set of daggers, phase rushing (can upgrade to phase insta-kills that you can chain), and mounting special creatures. Combat while mounted is also a lot of fun. Stronger enemies will drop item runes that you can use to augment your equipment.One of the nicest, unique features in this game is the Nemesis system. The orc armies have a hierarchy, and each individual will make different plays to try to climb the ranks. If a normal orc kills you, they will immediately be promoted into the hierarchy (orcs already in the hierarchy will become promoted). If you continue to die to the same orc, they will gain strength and levels - they will also make comments whenever you reappear to fight them, ranging from confident taunts to sheer horror at you refusing to stay dead. Sometimes, an orc leader you kill will come back after being defeated (yes, even from getting their head cut off). They will usually have a battle scar related to the injuries you gave them (scratches, bandages, etc) and will make a comment. Personally, the Nemesis system seemed a bit lacking for me because I very rarely gained a nemesis - even when I purposely died to enemies. Perhaps I was just killing everyone too quickly, I am not sure. The most times I've seen the same orc leader come back (from death, not just from retreating) was twice. As you progress in the story, you will unlock the ability to ""brand"" enemies. Branding orcs will cause them to fight for you when you activate them, causing them to go hostile to any nearby unbranded individuals. You can even brand orc leaders, and this is typically a very popular way to farm top tier runes. For example, you interrogate a normal orc and identify an orc leader with a weakness that is very easy to exploit (like weakness to fire). You then brand this orc and get him to rise all the way to orc warlord (highest rank) and help him with missions until he is level 20. After summoning him, you can insta-kill him by grabbing him or activating his suicide mode, most likely causing him to drop a top-tier equipment rune. Personally, I just liked finding the coolest looking orcs and making them my warchiefs. They will even have different ways of speaking - my absolute favorite orcs do not even talk, they just laugh, or breath menacingly. Orcs will also vary in appearance, attack preference (heavy shield, ranged, poison, etc), strengths, and weaknesses.The highest-ranked orc leaders will generally have other orcs in the hierarchy as officers - these individuals will appear alongside the leader should he be summoned. To make confrontations easier, it is advised that you either kill or brand all of a leaders' officers first. Regarding the difficulty, I eventually would just go straight for leaders without touching their officers to make the battle more challenging. After a time (like when you die or the next day arrives), orcs will move in and replace empty spots in the hierarchy. If you are quick enough, it is very possible to (temporarily) eliminate the entire hierarchy. Orcs will conduct missions against one another, which can you can interrupt by activating the respective mission waypoint. An example of a mission is a duel between two orcs - the winner gaining power and the loser usually dying (unless they retreat). If you wish, you can help one side, or just kill both combatants. Be advised, an orc that successfully retreats will increase in power. When you have a branded orc, you can interrogate it to learn weaknesses of hierarchy members (the warlords require interrogation of ranked orcs), or order it to conduct a mission against another orc. You can even command warlords to fight other members of the hierarchy - and they will bring along any of their officers.The missions you play also have an effect on Mordor. For example, liberating captive humans will slowly cause overall resistance to increase. As a result, humans will be more likely to help you fight the enemy. Overall, the game plays very smoothly and does not demand an unreasonable amount of skill or concentration to be enjoyable. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												One of the best games i have played to this day, and i have played many. I was first sceptical to buying the game as i have seen plenty of other similar sequels to big series, but after watching different gameplay videos, i decided to buy it on PC.As it was controller supported, i managed to convert my PS3 controller into a Xbox Controller playing the game with Xbox Buttons but it was still fun.Reading some reviews they talk about newer Assasins Creed and Batman games where a lot of combat and if i can say parkour system is taken from, as i have not played Assasins Creed for many years from Assasin's Creed 2, and i have never played Batman games, i really enjoyed the gameplay.I initially made a save slot and played for roughly ten hours, during this gameplay a lot of time went to try to eliminate all orc Captain's, which in fact the system is brilliant, as you challenge different orc leaders or captain's, when they die someone else take their place, as well with a lot of frustration from getting killed on my first try, it also introduces something completely new to me the nemesis system which is awesome. If you get killed in the game, the time advances and you can see Captain's challenge eachother and take higher positions, you feel the game progresses by the actions you do. As for other gameplay aspects i really enjoyed the jumping, climbing and combat which took me back several years when i enjoyed the Assasin's Creed Series. Stealth killing orcs from ledges, awesome combat with cool combat finishers really made the game cool.I started a 2nd save with more of a serious gameplay where i wanted to collect everything, and now after playing trough the whole game, i have around 17 hours on my save two, where i now have 100%, just collecting, roaming trough and killing orcs, doing side-missions, unlock abilities and upgrades just made the game complete. Exept the final boss-fight, i really enjoyed the game, and i would recommend it to others, buy it. It's worth its money.9/10			"

												Let's be honest, the storyline is a bit tedious, and the open world map isn't anything thrilling to navigate.But, if you like Arkham series style combat and you've always dreamt of a game in which you'd be swinging and twirling a sword while zooming through dozen enemies at a time like Mad Martigan from the movie ""Willow"", this is definetly the game for you.Also the Nemesis system does a great job of making these fights feel personal.

												I bought this game on sale with little expectations. I had played previous LOTR games and was mildly amused by them. Buying this game, I expected the same mild amusement.... until I played it.This game turned out to be far more amazing then I expected it to be. The fighting in the game is easy to just hack and slash your way around, but difficult to truly master - with effective and rewarding bonuses when you master your timing. Many of the negative views I've read complain about how easy the fighting is, but those folks apparently didn't take the time to try to master it, or invest in the bonuses. It was extremely fun.What makes this game truly great is how it adds to the story line. I am one of the sad, unfortunate souls who has never taken the time to read all the Tolkein books - I've only seen the extended releases of all the LOTR and Hobbit movies multiple times because I enjoy them so much. This game adds to those stories, by giving you insight into the great war, the black gate, and other known points of interest in the movies.The mission system is easy to use and understand, the various 'generals' in the orc amies and all the various collectiables give you lots of variety - there is always something to do. The missions also employ different play styles. You can be ranged DPS with your bow, mele dps with your sword, or stealth with your bow and dagger - with great bonuses for all styles that you could invest your experience into.I read another negative review complaining that the black gate area was too small, but it should be noted that there are 2 other 'lands' that you get to progress to. So, if you get board in the first area (the black gate area), do the gold missions, and progress the story to visit the new lands. The story is quite good and progressing it gives you access to new, exceptionally fun powers (mind control anyone?) as well as new missions and mission types.10/10 for a job extremely well done. Thank you!			"

												Both Tolkien diehards and fans of the films will find something precious in Monolith's latest and greatest. An open world masterpiece that rings in the next generation of gaming with its intricate AI systems and fine tuned combat taken lock stock and barrel from the finest examples of its genre. The story is serviceable, and there is plenty of room for expansion in the no doubt forthcoming installments in this new series. Play this game.Need to know more?

 It's fun to kill orcs! It's fun to stab them from behind, like death from the shadows.It's fun to slit their throats, and watch them bleed to death.It's fun to behead them, without mercy and no guilt.It's fun to shot them from the shadows, and designing traps for them.It's fun to put them on fire, and watch them flee in terror.It's fun to poisen their grog supply, like it's a sign of bad omen to come.It's fun to let them be eaten by released caragors, a vicious beast of Mordor.It's fun to trample them while riding a graug, one of the oldest species in Mordor.It's fun to unleash a flurry of strikes at them, and watch their head explode.It's fun to let them kill each other, branded for life, with your will as will.It's fun to kill them, from the front, from behind, from above, from below, from the left, from the right, from a distance, from the back on a beast, and from the wraith world.Killing is fun, fun, fun. And it's allways fun to hear an orc inspecting a dead orc: ""there has been a murder"".			"

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a gritty, action adventure game that has great production values, excellent gameplay, and a solid story that is worth your time and money.Running this game on a i5 2500k @ 4 Ghz, and a GTX 780 ti, I ran everything at ultra with the exception of textures which I ran at high.  Visually speaking, the game is impressive with high quality animations, texture work, and long draw distances.  Only on occasions did I leave my target frame rate of 60 FPS @ 1080p.  Overall, I would rate the quality of this port as very high.Now that the technical details are out of the way let’s get into what makes this game so great.  First, the game play is very much in the style of Batman Arkham Asylum.  Which, if you are fan of that style of game play, you will find that this is the best implementation of that system outside of the Batman games.  The game makes you feel powerful in every way, and killing hordes of orcs is common place and richly satisfying.  The first time you are surrounded by 20+ enemies and you managed to execute the whole lot of them without breaking a chain is an amazing feeling.  The level up progression is well executed, as each unlock is interesting and helpful regardless of your play style.It is a Warner Brother’s open world game in the same vein of the Batman Arkham series, and Mad Max.  There are towers, you have to scale them to see all the missions and collectibles in an area.  At first, I just moaned when I first noticed that this was the way the game was going to progress.  However, the action and the story are tight enough, and more importantly, while the game is big, it isn’t too big.  As a result, the feeling of déjà vu that you get from other games of the type, is lessened.  Overall the mission structure feels tight, and the game is very well paced.  Much has been made of the Nemesis system in the game, a system where you try to kill the chain of command of Orcs.  I found this system to be both rewarding, and controller spiking frustrating all that the same time.  I will say that I liked the system enough that if it was introduced in another game with some tweaks made, I would love to see it return.The story is excellent, albeit simple.  It’s all about revenge, and a few subplots thrown in for good measure.  It simplicity works to the game’s advantage as it doesn’t try to do too much with the plot, which allows you to really appreciate the character development of the main characters.The soundtrack is worth mentioning in its own section.  Quite frankly, it is perfection.  Brooding, full orchestral, and emotional at all the right times, the music sucks you into the game a never let’s go.  It really is that good, and if you are into video game soundtracks, it is worth tracking down a copy, it’s that good.  It really could come from a Triple A movie production.Considering it has been out for a good amount of time now, getting this game at 50% off or greater is a steal.  There is easy 30 hours of gameplay here, and more if you get every single secret, and continue playing the nemesis system.  So go ahead and by this game, and kill some orcs it is the right thing to do. "

												I just beat this game for the second time, the first was on a Playstation 3, the second was on Steam.  I spent at least 30 hours each time I played it. So let's just think about that, I spent 60 hours playing this game.  Can I end my review with that?   You betcha. But I'll continue, what I really like about this game is it is based in a ""movie"" world (Yes I know it's a book as well) and yet really has one connection to the movie.  I won't spoil it but with in the first couple hours you see a character that's also in the movie.  And everything else is new and beautiful lore.  The game offers a very special system, called the nemesis system.  From this you get random autogenerated enemies.  I believe even the first set of enemies (outside of some VERY specific enemies for a few missions) is randomly generated.  And by random I mean fully random, not just ""different name"" a lot of characters have similar make ups (some enemies can't be attacked by some moves) but for the most part you're thrown against enemies that no one else will see unless they have to get revenge for you.  (Sadly the game has been out a long enough time that the revenge feature doesn't appear that often). And what's beyond that, if you die to a random grunt, they actually will raise up the ranks, even the enemies you fight normally gain power just from killing you. What this means is you have a very dynamic world that only you will see. It moves beyond just ""the enemies you face"".  What they say when they attack you the first time, versus the third or fourth time will keep changing depending on what happened previously.  Sometimes enemies will return from the dead with new ""injuries"" and they'll make reference to the fact that you gave them the injury.  Sometimes they'll insult you that you either ran away or died to them before.   It all is brilliant, giving random enemies a life that even heavily scripted games miss.The story is a great affair, recounting a written account of a character long forgotten.  As much gets revealed over time, I won't spoil that.   However I will say that the core is a story written by Tolkein, and adapted by the studio.  One thing that does work though is the fact the player dies and revives is part of the story.  This isn't a situation where the player is just magically revived with no reason, but rather the main character is unable to die, and thus able to continue to return to life.   The only real negative I have with the game is the ending is a touch abrupt.  You will fight a final boss, however by that part of the game, the fights before it are more fun and better.  The player gains a HELL of a lot of power near the end of the game  to the point that it's only in huge melees is there even a chance of the player losing (and not that much chance at that).  So the final boss isn't disappointing, but just not a challenge.  However the ending of the game is perhaps its weakest moment.  A shame. That being said the game does leave the player wanting more.  And hopefully WB and Monolith Productions gives the audience a sequel because while it's not a perfect game, this game did win a number of game of the year awards, because it's such a refreshing game. So for all of that it's a recommendation.  I'd have trouble trusting anyone who gave this game a low score, because while opinions are subjective, the fact is this is the freshest breath of air in the video game in industry in probably a decade.

												Finally a AAA game that feels like a budget well spent! On top of the gameplay being fun and fresh, everything feels perfectly polished.It plays a lot like the recent Batman games with a mix of stealth and melee combos. Over time you gain super powers which allow you to scrap with large hordes of enemies. Moment-to-moment the game is fun whether you’re sneaking, fighting, or running to your next objective of choice. The side quests sometimes feel grindy, but a for the most part fun challenges that can get you to try out a different play style.The innovative system that constructs unique bosses that build a history with the player is a Holy Grail that game designers have been chasing for decades and now it’s finally working! In the coming years you’re going to see this idea stolen all over the place. Between the randomized strengths/weaknesses, shuffled cosmetics, and huge array of vocal responses they become personal and interesting enemies.I’m not usually a fan of cut scenes, but these are quick, well written, and beautiful. I don’t know the historic difference between the words ‘orc’ and ‘uruk’, but I know that uruk is annoying to say and not recognized by spellchecker. The writing and acting in the chatter/barks has a great sense of humor. You can still hear a little of old Monolith’s No One Live’s Forever in the dialog.The only gripe I have is that the many systems and upgrade paths feel overly complex at first. I wish they were introduced one at a time, but eventually it comes together and makes sense. The arc of the story feel like it falls short of being epic, but I’m not huge on Tolkien so most of the backstory is lost on me. Or maybe it will get bigger in the upcoming DLCs. Either way I’m excited for more.			"

												Open world third-person action-adventure game.The game is mostly about parkouring through Middle-Earth slaughtering orcs. Game has some RPG elements, but more wouldn't hurt. Usually I don't like games that I can't save when I want, but in this case dying isn't that bad and is handled very well. I recommend this game if you like action-adventure games and Batman like combat style (as that's what you are going to do a lot).Pros:- Nemesis system.- Stunning looking.- Combat system (Batman in Middle-Earth).- Stealth is an option.- Voice acting.Cons:- Not that challenging (except the challenges them self).- Bit lacking in RPG elements.- Repetitiveness, you are fighting orcs from start to end.Recommend DLC's: Lord of the Hunt & The Bright Lord the rest are really not needed. You can play these DLC's after you have finished the main story and they have no effects to it.			"

												84/100I bought this looking to get a deep and rich story set in an amazing universe, but was pretty disappointed in the end even as an above average fan of the franchise.As someone who's never played 'Assassin's Creed' or the 'Batman: Arkham' series, once you got used to the combat (which was still very fluid and varied), the challenge was gone. The repetitiveness of the game also makes me not want to play any of the story DLC. The Nemesis System and multitude of dialogue were some of the few things that set this apart from an average action/adventure game.In short, fun, but not worth the full price by any stretch.			"

												One of the best open world game ive had the pleasure of playing.Mordor is perhaps the only game to sucessfully replicate the arkham style of combat and it does it pretty well.The visuals are very good even till this day.I havent had a single technical issue with this game which i cant say for a lot of games as of late.There are plenty of side activties to do and depending upon how many of you complete them your complete playthrough would be anywhere between 20-40 hours. The Nemesis System is really neat as if you die/fastforward time uruks will rankup/get promoted/get killed,etc.This system really adds a lot of value as you can sent death threats which will imrpove an warchiefs protection but you will have greater chances of getting epic runes, runes are items which adds special stats or even in some cases even immunity against certain things or just new ability in genrel.My only complain would be the story is pretty meh, the voice acting is really on point and cutscenes are few and skippable.

												This Review contains minor spoilers about the final scenes of the game, read at your own risk.Shadow of Mordor is a game about killing orcs. It it also known as a mix of the Arkham Series and Assassin's Creed. Many people call this a ripoff, but it is in many ways better than both of these games, but it still has it's own small problems. The Story is quite good and has a few twists and turns. It has many references to the Lord of the Rings series and it's lore is very accurate. The game plays and looks amazing. The combat is hard when you start off,  but further down the line you will only lose fights in unbeatable odds. It has a lot more variety than the Arkham series, but it is quite easy when you get some of the higher tier powers. The stealth system is nothing unusual, but it is not emphasised enough on. You crouch and take your opponents out. With the Arkham games you have many different foes and you have the ability to approach nearly every situation in your own way, but Shadow of Mordor dosen't have that, and it is not a bad thing. It is it's own game, and it does what it does well. It is better than Assassin's Creed though because it actually has a crouch button. The climbing is exactly like Assassin's Creed but it is much faster and you can climb up almost anything in a few grabs. The game also offers many side quests and the amazing nemesis system. I have literally not seen anything like it before. It is unique and it feels like what the orcs would be trying to accomplish with their power struggles. It has a high risk reward system with the runes that can make you overpowered as hell. The mounts in the game, while limited, offer a nice form of travel compared to simple fast travelling and can be used to kill orcs as well. However, there is one thing this game did not execute well; The ending. The first battle brought back your worst nemesis and it was awesome. Then the next battle was a easy stealth section where you had to stealth attack your opponent 3 times, then hold a button to finish him off. Then it picks up with a fast pace battle near the Black Gate. You charge through with a Caragor and kill 5 captains with the help of your branded orcs. Then the final part is a 5 button QTE. This was just lazy and I expected a lot more. However, the rest of the game is amazing. I am looking forward to the content in the Season Pass and I hope Monolith do not do that to the ending of a game again. Overall: 9.5/10			"

												An interesting take on the Ubisoft open world genre, made special with it's great world and characters, addictive gameplay and unique systems that set it apart from other games. You do not need to have a deep knowledge of Tolkien lore to enjoy this game, but the more you know, the better.			"

												Amazingly varied and fluid Arkham-like combat system with the stealth and movement of AssCreed, horde brawl melee, powerful ranged attacks, mind control and mountable beasts, and surprise environmental traps such as bait that draws Carragors who devour every Orc in sight. Too easy? Don't get any health upgrades and turn combat indicators off. The innovative Nemesis System crafts  foes worth killing, some Uruk Captains surviving your battles with scars, some ending up as heads on pikes, some growing in power and deadliness after killing you (you are reborn with a thirst for revenge each time you die) and some secretly serving you, waiting for your signal to stab their War Chief in the back as you shoot out their eye with a ghostly arrow from the front. I went in expecting a shallow rip off and instead emerged on the other side from a shallow grave as the legendary Gravewalker, cleansing fire of all Orc-kind. A fun, quick-paced, pretty romp that tries new things instead of playing it safe all the time. 9/10			"

												Totally brilliant!!! Its like being in your own sparticus movie only with orcs and orcs are just tew kewl.Love the way they all seem to have different personalities, some even track you across the lands and turn up to ambush you where you are in trouble.Graphics are ace, new abilities actually change the game, eg you can learn to convert orcs to create your own army or ride giant ogre type creatures.While its new it will probably be the best gaming experience you have had this year, but you can currently complete the game in about 50 hours and then there seems little point in continuing.Needs some sort of longer term goal, more maps, more abilities, just MORE....

												I'll sum this one up in a haiku:Killing stuff is fun,but when that stuff gets bigger,the game won't change much.Honestly, a very good game, story is quite sparse and feels a little like it was put together in an afternoon, but, as I've said, killing stuff is fun. At first, getting used to the gameplay is slightly challenging for like five minutes, but very soon your avatar is extremely OP, and although mindless killing is surprisingly cathartic, one does tire very soon.The orc ranking mechanic is actually a nice touch and I did enjoy the branding feature to raise my own army but not enough to salvage a mediocre game.Still pretty fun.

												Shadow of Mordor is what you get when you cross Batman Arkham with Assassin's Creed and wrap it up in the Lord of the Rings universe.  While lore purists may scoff at the prospect, the game actually does a very good job incorporating existing lore while paving its own way forward.  You play as a wraith-posessed ranger out to take revenge on the Black Hand while learning about the wraith's past.  It's a bit of an odd situation but it adds a lot of gameplay variety.The game takes place on 2 reasonably-sized maps which you have free reign of.  There is never any shortage or orcs to kill since they respawn extremely quickly, sometimes visibly on your minimap before an area is out of range.  Even considering this, the map rarely feels cluttered but there is still plenty to do with a wide range of missions, side missions, collectibles, and challenges.Shadow of Mordor uses a freeflow combat system very similar to the Batman Arkham games and pulls it off quite well.  While it does not have quite as much variety due to a lack of combat gadgets, the combat feels great especially thanks to some impressive animation work and responsive controls.  Overall the combat is pretty easy especially after obtaining a few upgrades, though the game makes it quite difficult to defend against ranged attacks due to only vague indicators of the attack.  Controls are very responsive except for the dodge, which will not interrupt attacks like countering does making enemies with uncounterable attacks difficult to deal with.  Orc captains, however, can be very dangerous especially with ranged attacks.The main strength of the game is the Nemesis system, which surprised me since going in I was expecting it to be one of the weaker aspects of the game.  This system procedurally generates the leadership of the orc army giving each captain and warchief a name, strengths, weaknesses, and dynamic conflicts between them that you can interfere with as missions.  Any orc who kills you will also receive a name and be promoted to a captain.  While I was expecting this system to quickly become repetitive, it actually produces a lot of variety.  Each named orc will taunt or boast at you when you encounter them and I did not have a single line repeated through the entire game.  While the conflict missions themselves are fairly limited, they are mostly optional.Graphically, Shdaow of Mordor is a bit of a mixed bag.  While the animation work is very impressive and there is a large variety of orc appearances that removes the common ""hey I've seen that enemy before"" feeling that most games have, texture quality is not very good and it requires 3 GB of VRAM to run on high textures.  There is also an ultra texture pack that requires 6 GB but it apparently hardly changes anything.  Thankfully the game runs extremely smoothly and performs quite well.  The only other open world-type game I can remember running this smoothly is Tomb Raider.The only big problem I had with the game is the mouse support.  Mouse control is very inconsistent with some mouse smoothing applied and the mouse sensitivity varying wildly in different situations.  Thankfully this is not a shooter so it doesn't interfere with gameplay much.  The one place where this really would interfere is when you are aiming with the bow, though the mouse seems to behave itself there.I highly recommend Shadow of Mordor.  It is definitely one of the best games to come out in 2014 and probably the best Lord of the Rings game to date even though WB is trying to separate it from canon by not using ""Lord of the Rings"" in its name.  Now, back to killing orcs.			"

 Do you know the best rpg an action open world i have played ?i never knew that i would love this game as much as other RPG games !the Size of game 42 GB and deserves that.  IN SOME   missions required you to stealth only  without detected alarm.- reminded ME of Thief game , Because the two characters are  alike . * Positive things : + Awesome HIGH Graphics.+ The Coolest thing you can run the game if you have good enough pc in  lowest settings 30-60 fps smoothly. +  STEALTHY game. + You Can put a point for who's killed you , and you can revenge.+ Photo mode to be a good photography. :) + Full Controller Support. *Negative things :  - Some  bugs come in mid of mission this is annoy , but you can repeat the mission as well- You Can't Choose the specific resolution what you want it only has 33% - 60% - 100 % so it effects the   quality  of the game.  no whether negatives or positives maybe, this what i saw for now, anything else will be added here. # Overall : the Gameplay is actually normal not hard and not complicated you can finish the game with main missions 30+ hrs. total rate 9.8/10 from me highly recommended if you want this game and fearful of your pc couldnt run it.:)  "

												In all honesty, this game should be renamed to Orc Slaying Simulator or something similar. Shadow of Mordor is a very interesting take on the events that occur between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, and I enjoy how the story fits in with Tolkien's world. However, the story itself was somewhat short for my liking, maybe only taking 10 hours or so of my total gameplay; the rest as I before mentioned, orc slaying. The story follows, Talion, a ranger living with his family and others in Mordor, who are overrun by Sauron's forces, leaving Talion on a quest to fight back against Sauron. The story then follows Talion and a Wraith who he is paired with as they quest across mordor in seek of answers and salvation. Like I said, an interesting story, yet a little short for my liking.The gameplay is excellent, and there are many things to do in the game: kill Orcs, ride beasts, kill Orcs, find collectables, kill Orcs, etc. And even though I keep talking about the game simple being about Orc slaying, it's still very enjoyable in the many ways you can kill Orcs, and even use Orcs to kill other Orcs. My only issue was I found the controls a bit clunky (I use a keyboard and mouse), but when playing with a controller that problem was removed; therefore, if you have a controller, use it.There are only two other issues I have with the game, one being that it's too easy (in my opinion anyway), and the other being that the fact you can choose your character somewhat ruins the game. The hardest part of the game I have to say is taking on high power orc warchiefs who are immune to ranged and stealth attacks, making fighting them in the field the only way to kill them, however even then, I can simply manipulate all the other Orcs into fighting him, and basically get all them to do the work instead. This may be a bit picky of me, as you could say I could just not use the other Orcs, and yes that would certainly make it harder, but even in the strongholds, I can easily escape a fight without dying. I'd just like to see the game being a bit more challenging that's all. The other problem is the character selector the game has, in which I can choose to play as one of the female characters who appears in the late game, which just sort of breaks the game when you're doing missions with her, as there are two of her then. It also sort of ruins the cutscenes, as you're Talion in the cutscenes but then this girl in the game. Maybe again I'm being too picky, but it just seems like a completly unecessary feature. Anyhow, I certainly enjoy the main game, and I'm looking forward to the DLC. I recommend all of you RPG, Stealth, Slasher, and Tolkien fans out there buy this game up.Peace.			"

Shadow of Mordor (SoM) is, hands-down, my game of 2014 so far; I loved every minute of it!SoM is a sandbox game of combat & stealth, infiltration, manipulation and assassination, set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. It's been described as Assassin's Creed with the combat of the Batman series, but it has some original and innovative features. It's an AAA game so the graphics are as good as you'd expect and they don't seem to have forgotten about the PC; we have enough video options to push our most powerful graphical cards to the brink.My favourite aspects:True Sandbox: finally, a sandbox game that actually really lets you do your own thing all the time! The missions are instanced but even the scripted storyline missions never try to rein you in; you're always allowed to do it your way! As a bonus, instead of having entire missions dedicated to force you to learn how to use this or that minor new trick, those types of things are usually set as occasional (and fully optional) secondary objectives that you can achieve without deviating much from the approach you really feel like taking.Difficulty, part 1: SoM hits my sweet spot. A single enemy mook is easy to kill, sure, but an entire crowd can quickly become overwhelming. Some enemies are easier to fight than others so things stay pretty challenging because there's always a mix of opponents around. Unlike other games, SoM doesn't ""cheat"" by magically levelling-up the enemies at the same time you do, so you actually feel like you're getting more and more powerful. Things do become easier bit by bit as you get more practice at playing and gain more powers and options to take down your enemies, but death can still come quickly and swiftly if you don't stay on your toes.Difficulty, part 2: Dying is fun in this game! You still won't like getting killed, sure, but you'll have fun! For one, you won't feel like you're being punished for making a mistake: you won't lose progress, XP or equipment or anything; in fact you'll get a small experience reward for coming back from the dead. What happens when you die is the enemy captains and warchiefs will grow stronger; interestingly, this is all fully transparent to you: you get to watch the results as several individuals rise violently through the ranks of Sauron's army and accumulate more power and experience. The guy who did you in will of course get a big boost to his reputation and career, and it will feel personal to you that he did so at your expense! The game doesn't let you forget it either, so it's even more satisfying when you finally manage to lop his head off the next time around.Dynamic Campaign: the ranks of Sauron's army shift and evolve over time and you have a big hand in shaping this process. Enemy rivals face each other off, ambush or imprison each other, or try to progress by raising their reputation through several means, and you can interfere as you wish, from simply ruining their plans to actually culling them off the face of Middle-Earth to turning them over to your side. You can even to go as far as helping them along the way only to make their fall bigger (and the rewards more juicy). These Captains and Warchiefs are created randomly and have different names, personalities, strengths, weaknesses and, just as important, very different looks. This makes the opposition feel very dynamic and very much alive, even if part of that is just illusion (mechanically speaking there's only so much variety possible between fighting different dudes). Unfortunately, not many other games out there can claim the same.Recon & Intel: the game brings home the value of doing recon and getting good intel on the Captains and Warchiefs you're facing. Some of their strengths can really ruin your day while their weaknesses can turn a very difficult assassination into a simple job. And you want to check if they're nearby least you end up surprised when one (or worse, a few) of them joins the fray you just started. Mechanically speaking, you also get slightly better rewards if you have intel on a Captain/Warchief before you kill them. This seems very well balanced, intel doesn't simply pop out of thin air, but it's also not hard or boring to chase after. As appropriate for a game placing so much importance on stealth it is easy to tell where enemies are, but not so easy that you don't even have to take your eyes off the mini-map to waltz past them.Middle-Earth: there's a reason the setting is so enduringly popular, and it's very well used here; Tolkien Estate wouldn't let it happen otherwise. The two different regions of Mordor available are not very big and there isn't much variety in each of the settings, but they feel just right for a tighter, more focused experience than in your usual sprawling sandbox game. You won't have to get bored out of your skull traversing several kilometres to reach the next mission or hunting hundreds of collectibles the designers placed all over just so you'd have an excuse to actually see all those thousands of square kilometres of map they created presumably for you to chase hundreds of collectibles across.Multiplayer ""aware"": this is a single-player game, so I was surprised when one of the dynamic mission that popped up asked me to avenge the recent death of one of my steam comrades. This game sure likes to make it personal! Don't worry, Roberto, I got Latbag the Corrupt nice and good for you already!Minor Annoyances:The control scheme for keyboard and mouse feels awkward, at least at first. There's many different keys and combinations of keys to press if you want to trigger different powers; my fingers weren't used to having to do so much gymnastics to trigger different combos/powers, especially in the middle of fights when you're already trying your best to move and dodge and strike. It took some getting used to it, but I'm liking it more now; it adds some complexity and challenge to the mix. My only complain is really about those rare times when the character seems to get stuck for precious seconds against some piece of scenery, or when you wish he'd just let go of the damn ledge and jump down to the ground instead of only descending the cliff/wall one tiny step a time.After the promising short intro with Galadriel's chilling voice, the story starts off like an 80s revenge flick: our hero has his wife and son killed in cold blood right in front of his eyes and is left for dead by the enemy only to now come back seeking vengeance. It's the kind of stuff you used to love when you were a rebellious teenager of limited taste set to give the world a lesson. At least the revenge plot is thematically very consistent with the mechanics of the game so that's a bonus. Also, the story soon distracts you with much more interesting things, like figuring out who's that elf wraith who gives you power and denies you from true death, and all that yummy Middle-Earth background starts pouring in, so... yay!

8.5/10""A bit of everything plus LOTR."" Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a 3rd person action rpg with ""freedom"", but don't expect a massive ""open-world"" like in Skyrim/TheWitcher3. It's recipe for fun: a lil' bit of Batman, a lil' bit of AssassinsCreed and a tiny-tiny lil' bit of Skyrim plus a big pinch of LOTR. The good story line closes the gap between the Hobbit and LOTR. You're Talion a ranger who's stuck between life&death - will you bring him brutal peace?! Pros:+ great fights+ very good gameplay+ very good graphics (but not everything looks ""new"")+ very good story+ good atmosphere+ good sound&ost+ good voice-acting+ good Orc personalities+ good controls(controls don't feel as ""scripted"" as in AC)=> U can jump down wherever U like!+ dynamic nemesis system (Sauron's Army)+ side quests don't feel as loveliness as in AC/Batman+ the Vendetta integration (to revenge fallen friends)+ the feeling of: ""I am He-Man on BattleCat""+ recommend a x360 pad for full fighting experience+ a 2nd map, what a relief!Cons:- not a large open-world- repetetive locations- still some few control ""♥♥♥♥-ups""- if it's not 90degrees = not climb-able- no SLI support => SLI Fix- 2 too easy story boss battles- a coop campaign wouldn't have hurtIt's not a 9.4 IGN, but Splatter & LOTR fans can definately go for it & the rest should wait for a sale...

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8 Shadow of Mordor isn't the prettiest game out there, and the HD texture pack makes almost no difference. But, that being said, the graphics overall are very well done, with nothing jarring sticking out. But it's certainly no Crysis.   Gameplay 9 This game almost shines flawlessly. You can spend countless hours killing orcs, and every moment is satisfying. The only downfall of the gamplay is the lack of mission diversity, and the fact that eventually, if you want to get an orc promoted, you're going to just have to stand there and do nothing. Because frankly you get a bit too powerful, and captains/warchiefs really pose no threat to you anymore, even in groups. Other than that, you will not find a better, more fluid combat game out there. The diversity of skills and abilities is fantastic, allowing you to fight the way you want to fight.   Story 5 This game has a pretty mediocre story. It's not terrible, but it really isn't good. It's just...there. It takes a backseat to all the killing and joy you will find in the game. Shadow of Mordor attempts to bridge the gap between the events of ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings."" It seems like a silly grab-all, but Shadow of Mordor makes it work. The Lore in the game that you can gather is more interesting, in my opinion.   Replayability 8.5 As fun as it is, you can only kill so many orcs, and again the game's rating is hit by a lack of mission diversity, and things to do other than kill orcs. But that being said, you will spend a LOT of time controlling, murdering, shooting and crushing orcs.    Overall 8/10 Overall, Shadow of Mordor is a must buy for any gamer, anywhere. With extremely satisfying combat, darn good graphics, and fluid gameplay, the only drawback is the lack of solid story. But you will find few other games that will suck your time away so joyfully, and reward you for every minute of it.

												Let me get the negative out of the way.  The portrayal of women in this game is beyond terrible.  It is, across the board, the worst representation of women in games I have ever seen.  Developers need to do so much better than this.  Now, that aside, this is the best action game I have ever played.  The dynamic enemy hierarchies are brilliant, as are their randomly generated strengths, weaknesses, and personalities.  The first time an Uruk I thought I had killed came back with an appropriately changed visual and a burning desire for revenge was amazing.  I think the ability to manipulate the enemies came too late in the game, but it definitely changed how I played the game.The combat system is the best fluid-combo system I have ever seen.  Finally a system where countering takes precedence over everything else, so you aren't constantly getting cheap-shotted in the middle of an animation.  This system is clever, builds well upon itself, and is a tremendous joy to use.  I never got tired of the many various ways I had to murder orcs, and all the ways to use the environment in support of your battle was very good.Story-wise, asides from the portrayal of women, I found the game to be very solid.  I enjoyed the story, I found it interesting and I genuinely wanted to learn more about what was happening. I highly recommend this game, and it is the metric by which I will be comparing all future action games.			"

												+ Advantages :- Polished graphics- Controlling Talion is a pleasure, especially in combat- We could spend her days to blow up orc heads- Subtle references to Tolkienian mythology - A staging polished- A good lifetime- The die-and-retry hand, entertaining and thought- More an orc kill you, more you will find it to get your revenge- Nemesis System: we come to know and hate some enemies !- Good PC optimization- The ""Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul ..."" from the main menu ... OMG- We find some voices of Peter Jackson's films- Drawbacks :- The evolution of Talion pushes the player to solve everything with swords- Nemesis System hasn't a great influence on the game finally- Too close to Assassin's Creed places- Repetitive- Low varied scenery and uninspired- Some situations are overly difficult because badly thoughts- The script, a bit empty finally- We would have liked to get a lock-on for fights- Captains and warlords who simply disappear from the screen when they are fleeing the fight, even if you pursue them. One would like to do the same.Summary :Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is fairly complete, rather long, has a terribly addictive combat system and nice graphics. We just regret the lack of inspiration for the sets, bad AI and repetitive nature of the adventure, spent ten hours of play. Nevertheless, the title should appeal to fans of Tolkien, who will enjoy more on Talion, his teammate elf and Sauron returned to Mordor. Others will find an action-adventure open world game well done and quite demanding, which should put their talent to the test. While waiting for a Shadow of Mordor 2 most successful ?			"

												The gameplay is amazing with combat feeling fluid and free flowing, there is so much to do and a very large world to explore, the campaign is relatively short but there is more than enough extra content to keep you entertained. The nemesis  engine makes it feel like the story really is yours, very fun to play with a lot of interesting features.			"

												Fantastic game. The combat and stealth of a mix of Batman Arkham and Assassin's Creed. Story is interesting. The nemesys system is so amazing, I heard they're copying it into the next game in the Batman Arkham series! I wish it were longer though. The bossfiight was far too easy, I went into the mission terrified but then felt dissapointed when it ended, the two maps were tiny. However I feel the positives outway the negatives and I had lots of fun. Definitly purchase if you're a JRR Tolkien fan!It needs a sequel with a bigger map, perhaps most of Middle Earth as sections to travel to, like Rohan and Gondor, The Blue Mountains, The Shire.			"

												Pros/cons at the bottom of review.Beat the game in about 20 hours and got to say it was a solid experience for the most part. In terms of my play time I did a very hefty portion of the side missions/challenges, I wouldn't be surprised if you could beat this game in 5/10 hours if not less but hey the batman games have been the same even skyrim's main quest line so i guess this isn't too out of the norm.  The combat in my opinion surpasses the batman games in smoothness and obviously brutality which is a nice switch up from the fist fighting batarang wielding hero i've loved for the past three games.  The brutality of this game is probs one of my favorite things it had to offer. The lord of the rings movies have always been violent but this game takes it to a whole new level i've always wanted to see. Another great feature that I didn't really expect was the ability to mount the monsters in the game and unleash chaos on your enemies, graugs destroy everything and I love picking up a brave orc commander and biting his head off.... good stuff. One thing that did get me (and i was expecting to see this the whole game) is that none of the orcs manage to mount these beasts especially the caragor which is kinda weird because on more than a few occasions I thought i heard them talking/boasting about mounting these things, guess none of them actually have the balls that our boy talion does. What this game really lacks, something that they should have taken from the batman games, is a line up of real bosses. Yes the nemesis system is cool as well as the lineup of orc commanders but in my opinion most of these guys are like mini bosses at best, unless three or more of these commanders jump you at once they don't really pose that much of a threat especially if you go the extra mile and get the intel on them or mind control a few of his boys. You get one of these commanders in a one on one situation and no matter how strong they are you can take them down with a little planning and common sense (yes this is a rare situation but it happened to me more than a few times in my play through).  The games actual bosses go really south after the first of the black hand you face in mordor, even him I beat on the first try, but the other guy and then sauron are just complete jokes....This game had some alright characters and a good story but the moment you fight the second boss of the black hand I feel like the story goes south and is abit rushed to the conclusion. The game does offer two areas to explore and while they are different in layout I can't help but feel the second area is a grassy reskin of alot of the areas in Mordor, especially how everything is setup in the same plato layout.Pros-runs real smooth (I had no issues with graphic setup or game crashing)-amazing combat system-lots of brutality-solid graphics-runes/upgrade system (abit too easy to get ability points and such but still a good system)-pretty good characters (especially tallion)-caragors and graugs!-good story (until the end)-smooth stealth/climbing-warchiefs /nemesis (even if they are abit too easy I thought this was a very innovative idea)Cons-too easy/lacks difficulty settings-abit too short-lack of ""real"" bosses-story is ""rushed"" near the end (in my opinion)-first area and second area feel very similar-some characters are really underdeveloped (again my opnion)-once you gain the abilities to cause fear in orcs through your brutality moves (as cool as they may be) the game becomes drastically easier-lots of quick time events ( I personally dont mind them and rarely found any challenging but I know most people dont care for them)My verdict 8/10All in all I think this games a fun experience and worth playing, I don't really know about the 50$ price tag for 20 hours I got out of it so I would recommend waiting for a sale but its still a great game worth playing through.

												Definitely not the best game ever, but it's a damn good game nonetheless.It looks fantastic, even on the lower graphics settings (but, honestly, if you're buying a game because of the graphics you're an idiot), the music is great, the voice acting is great, and everything ties together nicely to make a really good-looking Mordor.The Nemesis system, being the focal point of the game, is obviously done really well. It gets repetitive at times, but overall it was executed fantastically. You can do pretty much whatever you want. You could turn all the Ork captains in an area into your own slaves if you wanted to. You could murder every Orc in the game. That's the beauty of open-world, you can do whatever you want and nobody's going to stop you. It's especially interesting when you get deeper into the game. In my case, I found a nemesis Orc who had existed from the start of the game. This guy killed me several times and had absolutely no weaknesses. After he became a Warchief, I killed him for what I thought would be the final time. And then he returned in one of the final missions as what could be considered one of the final bosses. You'd better believe I felt immense satisfaction in lobbing his head off for the final time.The only detriment to being open-world is that, in most cases, one tends to sacrifice quality of storyline in exchange for the opportunity to roam around and do whatever you want. Only a few games have had good story along with being open-world. Skyrim comes to mind. This, unfortunately, is not one of those games. The story isn't bad, but it really isn't interesting, and the final boss is just a bunch of quick-time events, not actually a battle as one would expect. It does set up nicely for a sequel, which hopefully will actually come around, unlike some games that promised a sequel that never happened (I'm looking at you, Rayman 3).But, point is, there's a hell of a lot to do, everything works nicely, for once death isn't actually a failure state, and all things considered it's a damn good game. Would I pay 50 bucks for it? Hell no, but honestly I wouldn't pay 50 bucks for anything anyways. Grab it on sale when the next sale comes around. Or grab it when it's at full-price if that's your thing. I don't care. But it's a great game, and it would be a shame to not have it.			"

												(ภาษาไทย ด้านล่าง)One Dead man to Rule them All. Overwhelm Sauron's Army with the power of Wraith.Plus a bit of stories from Middle-Earth.Arkham Style Combat, the Animations, the Sounds and Graphics are very very good.These make fighting very fun and satisfying. And you'll be fighting A LOT.The Nemesis System is Outstanding and very interesting. It keeps me looking for new enemy to fight without getting bored. (at least not yet at 40-ish hrs-in)The Pre-Rendered Cinematic Cutscenes looks fine. But i'd prefer more in-game cinematic cutscenes.There's No Difficulty Options in the game but There are ways to make the game more Challanging. (but still quite easy)The Controls are pretty good. But the Multi-purpose Buttons sometimes do what you did not intended to do.It would be great to have options to bind them seperately. Sadly there isn't at the moment.About the game It's an Open-World Action game.

												Let me get the negative out of the way.  The portrayal of women in this game is beyond terrible.  It is, across the board, the worst representation of women in games I have ever seen.  Developers need to do so much better than this.  Now, that aside, this is the best action game I have ever played.  The dynamic enemy hierarchies are brilliant, as are their randomly generated strengths, weaknesses, and personalities.  The first time an Uruk I thought I had killed came back with an appropriately changed visual and a burning desire for revenge was amazing.  I think the ability to manipulate the enemies came too late in the game, but it definitely changed how I played the game.The combat system is the best fluid-combo system I have ever seen.  Finally a system where countering takes precedence over everything else, so you aren't constantly getting cheap-shotted in the middle of an animation.  This system is clever, builds well upon itself, and is a tremendous joy to use.  I never got tired of the many various ways I had to murder orcs, and all the ways to use the environment in support of your battle was very good.Story-wise, asides from the portrayal of women, I found the game to be very solid.  I enjoyed the story, I found it interesting and I genuinely wanted to learn more about what was happening. I highly recommend this game, and it is the metric by which I will be comparing all future action games.			"

Rumor grew of a Shadow in the East...whispers of a great game in the land of Mordor.Even to a newcomer, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is comfortably familiar. It is not a sequel, but it feels like one. Most who play this game will have seen the Lord of the Rings films, or read the books, or played either the Assassin's Creed series or the Batman Arkham series. Shadow of Mordor is greatly influenced by these popular sources. From its gameplay, to its story, to its visual style and soundtrack, this game makes you feel like you're returning to a land that you love. It is, however, this same familiarity that cuts into its longevity.The big innovation that Shadow of Mordor brings to the table is its Nemesis system. Much praise has been heaped upon it. In my view, it works very well in an open world game but it is not without its weaknesses. For example, it is enthralling to cross blades with orc captains when each one feels unique from the others. Yet it also seems impossible for a pseudo-randomly generated boss to match that of a static, hand crafted boss like you'd find in other games. The Nemesis system has quantity on its side and is more true to life but tends not to be as memorable or as fun to fight as those bosses you find in games like Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus. To its credit, Shadow of Mordor also has a handful of standard boss  fights throughout its main missions. Unfortunately, the final one is a major letdown in the form of a short series of quick time events.Tolkien's Middle-earth is immensely rich in history. Shadow of Mordor's story utilizes that history mostly for the game's setting, and then makes up the actual plot as its own alternative history. As someone who has seen all the movies but never read the books, I was very pleased that the story was both new to me and still connected to the epic tale we all love. With the exceptions of Gollum, Sauron and a couple brief cameos that I won't spoil, the cast is composed of characters not seen in the films. Not until writing this did I look up to see how close the game sticks to lore and it seems the consensus is that it largely doesn't. Yet this doesn't bother me and, if anything, I wish the game had had more story and was less gameplay centric. This was definitely written more for fans of the movies than for scholars of the Silmarillion.Artistically this game takes most of its cues from the original movie trilogy. Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and Men look and sound as they do in the films. I see that as a good quality. The voice acting is very well done, particularly for video game standards (though those have been rising in recent years). The soundtrack is mostly befitting of the orcs. The heavy percussion, deep horns, cellos and warlike chants can actually become too imposing at times, making me wish for a brief respite.Environmental design I found to be somewhat weak, though it was obviously catered more to gameplay than visual spectacle. Some of that is hard to escape with the first half of the game taking place in the barren, rocky wastes of Udûn. The second half's setting along the Sea of Núrnen is more lush and interesting to look at. Both areas, however, feel relatively small. This is less an artistry complaint and more a wish for greater real estate in which to battle the orcs and beasts of Mordor. The game is never able to imitate the movies' epic, sweeping vistas.At around 30 hours for 100% completion of the main game, Shadow of Mordor is not as long as many similar games out there. Yet in the waning hours I still found myself growing bored. Many of the side quests and a few of the primary missions I could have done without. In particular, the 24 Outcast quests are painfully repetitive and have no business being so numerous other than to pad out play time. It doesn't help that, aside from The Bright Lord DLC, I found this game to be considerably easier than I anticipated.I would list both major DLCs, Lord of the Hunt and The Bright Lord, as disappointing as well. Neither introduces any new areas to explore nor deepens the story in any appreciable way. I will say that the final battle of The Bright Lord is like the end boss we never got in the main campaign. Even still, I wouldn't recommend either outside of the Game of the Year bundle. For some, Shadow of Mordor's familiarity will hurt it sooner than it will for others. For me, it never bred contempt but it did darken an otherwise compelling game.			"

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in recent memory. Every aspect of the game encourages different styles of play & rewards how YOU want to play. Players can use thier Wraith powered bow to mow down enemies before giving them a good smackdown in the excellent melee combat. The combat that has many similarities to the Arkham games, with a more lethal edge to it. Either way I 100% recommend this game to fans of LOTR or action adventure games.			"

												Definitely this year's best BACBMOTPDG! (Batmassin's Arkham Creed Black Metal Orcémon Tribal Politics Decapitation Game)If you win a fight, you're a badass, if you lose a fight the orcs become more badass and the next time you beat them you'll feel even more like a badass (and probably behead them). I'm not even a fan of Tolkien's stuff and I enjoyed this all the way through, even though the story is discardable and you can make up your own excuse to impale more orcs and meddle in their chain of command. Elven poetry and halflings are kept to a minimum.			"

												Refreshingly entertaining. Worth a buy for sure, if you like action, stealth, magic, customization, leveling, type games. A bit annoyed that most missions are save 3 guys, it gets old fast. It also feels grindy at time. Once you get the hang of it and it's easy to do it's a lot of fun. Great moves, combos, and finishers. Good pace and fun to play. Not overly difficult and story is engaging. It's pretty linear story with an open world type mechanic but all in all I like it.You basically play a ranger who has 3 types of weapons and two trees of skill. Sword, Dagger, and Bow. As well as Ranger and Wraith. Interesting blend of concepts and alot like the arkham games if you've played those. You can pick where you level up your abilities and what you want to focus on. The bad guys keep coming so you can't really kill them all, this is both good and bad. You can grind for powers or just play, I did a bit of both.			"

												This game is intricate, complex, and all around really fun. Its a great experience. The gameplay is lots of fun, really exciting, and it doesnt get boring. On the outside it may seem repetetive, but it never feels that way. Every fight you get into, and just any action in general always feels like you are fighting for something. Its like you have a greater purpose and every ork you kill or brand or interrogate is all going towards your cause to liberate Mordor. The story isn't very complex, its simple. This is good though, because its just simple enough to still be very interesting and engaging without taking away from the rest of the game. I just played Assassin's Creed Unity and I found its story to be very lacking, making it hard to enjoy the game because the whoe time I didn't know what was going on. This is not the case in Mordor. On that same note, this has been accused of being an Assassin's Creed clone, it is not in any way. It may look similar due to the parkour and assassination style missions, but after playing ACU and every single other Assassin's Creed I can confidently say these games are all diverse and different.Bottom Line: This game is worth your money and your time, it is a fun, interesting, and fresh experience. I loved every moment of it.			"

Would you look at that, a game I preordered that I actually enjoyed immediately and without one of the infamous ""day-one update""'s!All joking aside, this game is a blast. The soundtrack is great and the cutscenes are very well done to the point where at times it is almost passable as a movie on it's own. I own a controller and have tried playing with both keymaps (You can switch interchangeably with a button press of either the keyboard or controller, Bonus points!) and I prefer the keyboard controls but can fluidly play with either one.So far the combat system seems a little repetitive and slightly easy at times where I have ran into a group of around eight uruks and picked them off one by one. Definitely not regretting buying this game and can highly recommend to anyone looking for a great single player RPG experience.Edit: The combat system has definitely gotten harder as the game progressed, so my statement about it being easy was taken off.Rating: 9/10TLDR: Great game with interesting characters, awesome combat system, amazing visuals, and hasn't gotten boring yet. Definitely worth buying or renting even if you have to resort to console peasantryEdit: Have died many times now and it doesn't seem to matter how many captains I kill, they keep getting promoted. Currently stuck trying to kill the #$%^ing gul matron because it keeps killing me every time. Probably the most agitating side quest I've done so far in this game.Edit 2: 12.5 hours into the game, killed all the warchiefs except Ratbag and killed the Black Hammer, and am now in the second part of the map that is set near the sea of Nurnen and it looks breathtaking. I'm on medium graphics and am stunned at how good this game looks. Hopefully these quests I have left will be as fun as the first.Edit 3: Just beat the game earlier today and am working towards getting the rest of the collectibles and finishing the side quests. The story mode was fairly short and the ending ""Time to forge a new ring"" just paves the way for DLC. Still a solid game and still recommend buying. "

												This game is like the Rogue One of LoTR, except with LOTS of actionThere is a definate learning curve, but the game teaches you how to play well. The story is absolutely thrilling, and, to avid fans, highly emotional. Achievements give multiple moderately challenging objectives, and there is an individual mode designated for competing against other players (by killing more warchieves, dealing more damage, etc.). The DLCs are fantastic additions to the game, and you will never feel like there is a dull moment.			"

What's good:+ Graphics+ Visual effects+ Executions and various fight systemWhat's bad:- Lack of a content- Very short and boring storyline- ""Open world"" is cutted with opportunities before storyline completion- Absolutely no challenge in the game (and no difficulty settings)- Bugged AI, bugged as hell caragor's riding- 2 clicks ""bosses""- DLC with ""runes"" and ""skins"", season pass for upcoming ""runes"" to beat the online scoreboard with cheaters and abusers?- Price for current game state (2 little maps and 10-15 hours of actual gameplay)			"

												This game is very derivative. And I mean that in the BEST KIND OF WAY POSSIBLE. The developers (Monolith) shamelessly borrowed successful mechanics from other high-profile video games, and combined them into some kind of amazing all-star supergame. In this case, they took: The exploration and movement system of Assassin's Creed; the combat of Batman; and the enemy design of Warhammer 40K: Space Marine. Brew that all together, add in a pinch of Sleeping Dogs and Far Cry 3, and you have one of the most ridiculously good open-world action games ever made. Ridiculously fun.

												At first I was not very impressed with the limited tutorial in this game. But after watching a couple youtube videos, I dove right in and became fully immersed. The melee combat is quite responsive and fluid, and offers a fair amount of excitement. No shortage of gore and carnage!The story and voice acting are top notch. The content is plentiful and satisfactory. The challenge of some of the quests and objectives are not a simple walk in the park, but not impossible either. Which is exactly how I like them to be. Being able to take control of beasts and orcs as well as using environmental objects and traps to hurt and manipulate the enemy was particularly entertaining to me. There really aren't enough of this caliber of hack & slash games for PC out there and I'd like to see a lot more of them. I tip my hat to Monolith and will be paying close attention to their future releases.			"

												Aside from a few glitches I throughly enjoyed my time with this game.The combat is nice and once you've grow accustomed to the combos it's very satisfying to mow down entire garrisons of orcs by tackling them head on or slaughering them from the shadows. Over time the game throws more advanced enemies in your path giving your a feeling of power as well as challenge.The nemesis system is rather clever - letting you play Vendettas and Klingon politics among the ranks of orcs.The progression system is good enough for a game like this. I've not found it tedious to hunt down the artifacts and experience points to unlock pretty much everything.The only gripes I have with the game are the controls which sometimes glitch out. I've found it very difficult to use bite attacks on any mount and my attempts to block an attack often put me into ranged mode instead. A handful of times I had my character get stuck on some ledge or something and once I was unable to finish a mission. Finally I found the story a bit hard to follow since there's often much time between snippets of story and the format of disjointed flashbacks doesn't help either.But over all I'm still very much glad I played this game. The closest two games I can compare it with are Assassins Creed and Far Cry 3, both of which I consider significantly inferior games to Shadow of Mordor.			"

												Nan iChîr Gelair Mordor!This game is remarkable. It does so many things well. It's a half-step towards bringing life to AAA games.Half, since I wish perhaps that it relied more on the strategic layer more than the story progression. I've heard DLC's do exactly that (much like State of Decay's then) and were it so, I would like to get back to them. But the story is good too. It almost makes sense within the broader canon, which isn't a small thing. There are timeline issues and other ones; yet it can be seen as a legend from expanded and retold mythology like Tolkien wished (?) ...Well at least Black Speech dialogues are top-notch. :)			"

												This game is intricate, complex, and all around really fun. Its a great experience. The gameplay is lots of fun, really exciting, and it doesnt get boring. On the outside it may seem repetetive, but it never feels that way. Every fight you get into, and just any action in general always feels like you are fighting for something. Its like you have a greater purpose and every ork you kill or brand or interrogate is all going towards your cause to liberate Mordor. The story isn't very complex, its simple. This is good though, because its just simple enough to still be very interesting and engaging without taking away from the rest of the game. I just played Assassin's Creed Unity and I found its story to be very lacking, making it hard to enjoy the game because the whoe time I didn't know what was going on. This is not the case in Mordor. On that same note, this has been accused of being an Assassin's Creed clone, it is not in any way. It may look similar due to the parkour and assassination style missions, but after playing ACU and every single other Assassin's Creed I can confidently say these games are all diverse and different.Bottom Line: This game is worth your money and your time, it is a fun, interesting, and fresh experience. I loved every moment of it.			"

												This game has very smooth combat encounters and enjoyable boss fights. There are lots of objectives you can do in addition to the main missions. You can hunt animals and sneak kill some uruks in stealth missions, for example. So the gameplay is pretty good in this game.It can be irritating to fight some bosses when there are many other bosses nearby. I tried to encounter one captain and suddenly there were 2-3 other captains and enormous horde of minions all around me. That can be a good thing if you are looking for challenge (like me).The plot in this one left a lot to be desired. I wasn't impressed by the first cutscene and did pretty much skip the rest. And the main missions' objectives were not that interesting.All in all I would recommend this game because the lack of top notch storyline isn't that much of a problem when you have many hours of very enjoyable gameplay ahead of you.

												The combat system is fluid and great to behold (being based on the same system as Batman) and the options for tackling the open world are huge; from brainwashing an ork captain to attack his superior to teleport-executing a sentry from 100s feet away. Viceral, solid entertainment and the kind of game I pick up not to make further progress or level up, but simply because it's fun. I can spend ages just hunting for large groups of orks to jump into the middle of and dispatch without taking a hit; lobbing one through a camp fire, skewering another through the throat, leaping over another to stun them before making their head explode - all the while effortlessly parrying and ducking.Great fun and an excellent title to show off your graphics processor!

												This is by far one of the best LOTR games out there, up there with the LOTR: The Battle for Middle-earth series (an RTS).  This game makes some massive changes from any games set in Tolkien's world.  It takes place between The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, with an entirely new story set in and around Mordor, and all new characters.  It does a fairly decent job of not messing with any kind of lore in a bad way too.  New characters, as well as familiar ones are in the game.  You play as Talion, a man who should have died but for reasons unknown to him has come back to the world of the living, and has been connected to a wraith of an ancient and dead elf.  This will provide you with many cool powers, and the fact that you can't truely die makes the nemesis system even more interesting.The combat is akin to that of the Batman: Arkham games, and Assassin's Creed.  You have multiple weapons at your disposal, each with their own rune slots, as well as a skill tree to level up.  Take a stealthy approach with bow and dagger, as well as environmental weapons you can trigger, or run in and make some heads roll with your sword.  The nemesis system is a really amazing thing as well.  Orcs get promoted for killing you, or just randomly if a space is open, and eventually can become warchiefs.  Captains and warchiefs all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and different kinds of attacks and weapons as well.  There's a lot of cool stuff you can do with that as the game goes on.  Also, you can ""kill"" captains only to have them come back later a bit more mutilated than before.  If you met them before, they will remember you.  Things like this make the enemies you encounter a bit more interesting.  I have encountered some weird bugs that forced me to end missions and teleport to a tower.  Getting stuck inside walls and glitching through some buildings to areas I can't get out of.  Not a ton of that stuff, but it's there.  The only thing I can not speak for is the DLC.  So far, I have not heard much about what has so far been released.  What I have heard of so far doesn't sound bad...but maybe overpriced.Overall, a really great game and definitely worth playing.  Especially if you like LOTR.			"

												Rating: 9/10Overview: Open World Third Person RPGThe Good:+ Very well optimized, plenty of graphical options + Story and characters are well thought out. You don't need to be Lord of the Rings fan to understand what's going on. Cut scenes are really well done. + The nemesis system is a random boss generator. Enemies that kill you get promoted to captain making them much tougher.  By collecting intel either by finding or interrogating enemies you can discover randomized strengths and weaknesses for captains and warchiefs that you can exploit. The system itself is decent but the way its implemented in the game is what sets it apart.   + The orcs in the game are the best representation of orcs in a Lord of the Rings game I've ever played. They gang up on you in numbers, run in terror when you kill a captain or warchief etc. Everything about them make it feel like your battling a huge orc army.+ The combat is a near replica of Rocksteadys Batman games. You have a strike, dodge, stun and counter. By combing these together and getting your combo meter high enough you can then unleash more devastating moves.  + Lots of side quests, collectables, missions etc that are varied and provide a nice distraction from the main quest. + A well balanced upgrade system. Most open world games either have an upgrade system that is pointless or one where you become way too powerful early on. This is one of the first times where the upgrade system is well balanced so that you don't get too powerful too early on, but makes each individual upgrade feel like you are making real progress. + Stealth is a big component of the game and is handled incredibly well. Again it's a near identical system to Rocksteadys Batman games. + Killing Captains or Warchiefs drop runes which can then be slotted to upgrade either your sword, bow or dagger. Plenty of different runes to fit your play style. + Both DLC and Trials of War add a lot of extra content to the game. Trials of War is a series of different trails with requirements, complete them and see how you do on the leader boards. + SoundtrackThe Average:The game can be a bit frustrating in the early sections. Some missions send too many enemies at you making it very frustrating if not impossible to complete. In these situations your only option is to run away and try the mission again.  Conclusion:Shadow of Mordor is a great game that borrows heavily from different games and puts it together in one complete package. Take the combat and stealth from batman with the traversal of assassins creed add in the lord or the rings universe and you have what is essentially Shadow of Mordor. I consider this a great open world game but I wouldn't put it in the same ranks as a ""Game of the Year"" contender. This is not a fault on the game per se but open world fatigue is starting to set in for me. The game has all the prerequisites of a great game but doesn't push the boundaries in the genre. If anything I think its biggest problem is that it plays it too safe. The nemesis system is cool but not enough to elevate it to a higher status. "

												The good, the bad and the ugly.The good... Combat mechanics. A perfect blend of some of the best fighting elements borrowed from recent Batman games flavoured with a decent amount of Assasin’s Creed parkour. Slashing, bashing and trashing, its all there in a perfect Uruk discrimination package filled with disemboweling, cutting off limbs, bone crushing and of course tons and tons of whatever stuff runs though orc veines. Need some tutoring on how many ways there are to kill an orc? Look no further. This game will provide you with more than enough insight on that particular topic. The combat is generally very responsive, it feels right no matter what type of controls you are using, gamepad or mouse/keyboard combo. Whatever you do, combat will probably never be the reason for any of the problems you might experience in the game.Ingame cinematics. Oh boy… Some of the cinematics made for this game are pretty much movie theater material, going on par with LotR movies themselves. They are also the main source of the game’s narrative so it would be pretty unwise to skip them unless you are only after some orc blood.The bad…If you are after some decent story from the expanded LotR universe you will probably be heavily disappointed. Yes there are some interesting plot twists which fit nicely with the original LotR lore but the buildup and the anticlimactic conclusion leave much to desire. There is also a huge amount of pointless story missions which pretty much only serve to add some effective game time and bore the player to death in the process. Poisoning Uruks with grog and destroying Mordor’s cultural heritage as main storyline quests!? Cmon! Give me a break.“Though you shall have no meaningful UI” was probably what the publisher said prior to releasing this game for PC. Having to leave the game and open up the main menu every time there is need to adjust weapon runes or simply pick up an orc target in the Uruk hierarchy is pretty time consuming and frustrating.Environmental interaction. As much as the controls themselves are fine, for both gamepads and keyboard/mouse combos, interaction with the environment can be often pretty frustrating. Picking up a perfect path to reach a fleeing boos often ends in a total disaster just because the main character likes to stick to every damn thing that comes even remotely close to his path. This effectively means that instead of jumping off from a high vantage point in order to pin down a boss to the ground you will find yourself suddenly hanging from a wooden beam which just happened to be near the jump path halfway through the jump. There are also some problems with the controls which change their behavior depending on the situation. The best example would probably be “drop down” which is usually reserved for “E”, however if you are on a ledge or a line of rope it suddenly changes to down (“S”) which can often lead to situations where players don’t actually know which “down” they should use.The skill progression system. Its not that skill progression is bad. Its simply that some of the most interesting skills are unlocked almost at the very end of the main story line. Branding, chained mass executions, caragorn mounting… Those are all skills that greatly add to the experience but require access to top skill tiers which on the other hand require a lot of side mission grinding. Players will probably feel unnecessarily locked out of stuff that they should have been able to use from a more reasonable moment in the game.The ugly…The graphics. It would probably be unfair to call the game ugly but its surprisingly shocking to see how little effort was put into creating imaginative levels which even remotely represent the quality we got used to from other LotR games or even movies. The map feels bland with repetitive sections which feel like a simple copy/paste from the terrain seen just a minute before. It doesn’t help that it got divided into two distinctive parts because the second part also feels like the first one just with added vegetation. There is simply no diversity and no “wow” effect we got used to for anything LotR related. In all honesty I haven’t been able to test any of the graphics modes which require more than 2GB VRAM but I highly doubt that any texture pack could resolve the problem of bad level design and lack of imagination while creating the map for this game.The overall lack of gameplay diversity. Aside from the main story, a couple of types of challenge missions and some collectables there is actually nothing to do in the game. Challenge missions are picked from a poll of three or four mission types which seem to repeat endlessly. Simply put, if hacking and slashing orcs for hours isn’t something you get easily entertained with then chances are you will get bored to death in Shadow of Mordor.Would I recommend this game? Yes I would. But its important to make a note about the target audience which will enjoy it. Players which expect some deep meaningful LotR experience with huge amount of RPG elements will be disappointed. On the other hand players that don’t mind killing orcs for hours in a GTA mission style oriented game will probably enjoy it.If there wasn’t for an interesting combat system the lack of any meaningful story and bad level design would have probably made me rate this game 6/10. However, short-term enjoyment of the combat system earns this game a 8/10 from me. "

												Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor is the new game based on Lord of the Rings series but will you want to play this ? In Middle Earth Shadow of Modor we play as Talion. One day Talion and his family is killed by the black hand to summon the wraith but gets himself fused with Celebrimbor who is suffering amnesia. So him and Talion try to find out who is Celebrimbor and to avenge the death of Talion's family. So how is this game ? This game is a fantastic game and everyone who needs to play through this game at least once. The game is like Assasins Creed and Batman Arham games fused together to create this. You can freely roam around the map and do what you like. Theres tons of stuff to do and lots of stuff to see. The game also looks really good maxed out. The gameplay is smooth and is really satisfying. Stealth is also really fun. The game is never too easy but never unfair and is a blast to play through. The game's story is fantastic and you get attached to the charecters and you do want to make it to the end which is not good. Yeah the ending to this game was dissapoiting and is sequel/dlc bait. The game also has bugs. Sometimes when jumping and grabbing onto the ledge my charecter wouldnt let go no matter what i did. The game is one of the best games i played in a while and i definetly reccomend getting this game and playing through it once. I give Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor a 9/10			"

												At first I wasn't really interested - it looked like it's going to be AssCreed or hack'n'slash, which I find boring.  But then it turns out to be like a Batman and now I'm having lots of fun. And all I know about Middle-earth is that Tolkien wrote something about it and someone made some popular movies.			"

												After watching The hobbit the battle of the five armies I really wanted to play a game related to LOTR, So I played The Battle for Middle-earth II. After being desecrated by an army of Ents Orcs and Nazgûls I rage-unistalled the game and looked for a differant LOTR game. I found this, after downloading 40 ♥♥♥♥ING GIGABYTES worth of game I started to play. The whole game is a hack and slash Orc holocaust simulator. The Orcs might aswell be nazis with no redeemable qualities: All the chatter you hear from them include ""I really like killing things"" and ""Living things better watch out becasue I might kill them!"" It actually makes the Orcs seem really insecure with every silence being filled in with thier own version of small talk. Now onto combat the whole combat system was probably ctrl+c ctrl+v from Batman to Shadow of Mordor with the standard counter attack stun combo system, However that isn't a bad thing: I personally think its better that a game has a working, established and old combat system. Rather than trying to create its own which will most likely end up feeling like darksouls with polio. *NOTE* They cleverly renamed batmans gadgets to wraith powers.Size, The map is small-ish. It  never really feels vast but it also never feels small. I think considering what the player has in terms of travel and what the game offers the map is an ideal size. Story, I honestly found it hard to care for the protagonist or the problems he faces, but I don't think the game was made with story as a high priority.Conclusion, If you like any of the following: LOTR, Batman, Mindless slaughter, Mud, People Talking about axes and killing then I'd recommend looking into this game, its a really fun mindless hack and slash. 8 Orc WarLords/10			"

												First i thought this game was huge disappointment but later i realized it was a bit weird and it turned out to be a good game but i must say it comes with some downsides like any games but they are probably minor but first of all its a good game because its playable after the campaign is done even within the campaign its such you can just look around and see uruks everywhere but who to kill first. Oh i know the guy with a ranged weapon then sneak up to others and gain so much XP even in their fortresses its so fun to release animals free to see them tear them all apart but aside all this slaughtering i say the campaign was a little disappointing because some of them were a bit too easy and some boss fights reminds me of captain fight but in the end the bosses in the game was easier than any captains or warchiefs it could have been a bit more faces so it could be a bit more scarier so to me its a bit weird but i guess that how it is. It was kinda lacking some customization choices that came with 1 free DLC i didn't like it that much but i really hope this game comes with a ton of DLC packs that allowing players to custom their characther even allowing new weapon choices maybe allowing orcs be a little more savage.Pros:Nice combo system.Playable after campaign after.Lots of fun killing orcs even when raising them in ranks.Watching the best orc rise in power or fall.Solid gameplay without question.Cons:Easy predictable fights even campaign bosses.needed a bit more work around captains and warchiefs.Branding enemies to vicory unless its a captain.Could use more weapon choices and customization.Expensive DLC packs.Well that actually my insight of the game and i probably would give the game 8.4/10 in rating.

												I played this game through doing all the main game quest, meaning all of the main quest, Outcast rescues, Ithildin collection and artifact collection. I also did all the survival challenges and nearly every hunting challenge. I used some time to grind a few specific achievements. All of this took me about 26 hours.The game seems pretty well optimised, with the FPS staying confidently at and over 60 on my GTX 960 and high settings (if I remember right). The game looks great and the animations are smooth and they vary enough to instill gasps of delight even after many hours of playing. At least with me the game didn't crash at any point and I did not encounter any bugs or glitches whatsoever.Even though I am somewhat sceptical about open world games these days (open world seems to be an excuse to put soulless collection-/busywork-ish sidequests without any other real thought process what makes open world interesting) I think it worked out pretty well with Shadow of Mordor. The world (= the two main quest areas) are large enough so that you don't have to look at the same valleys and mountains all the time, but it's small enough so that empty travel does not take too much time. Eventually when you unlock all the necessary skills the world is full of exciting stuff to sink your time in. You can stalk orcs, listen to their jammering, then drop a fly nest on their heads and go gut the lot. You can interfere in the internal politics via simple automatically generated quests that show you the everyday life of an evil guy warhost commander. These mechanics also play a big part in the actual main quest, which I find was executed pretty nicely. In a way it might seem at times unnecessarily grindy and repetitive, but more often than not it is interesting to raise an interesting and cool orc captain. Help him rise through the ranks to eventually become a warchief, then arrange a fight to the death with this thing that is practically your own child by now. In the long run the system starts to shift in to the dull side. The training of captains isn't really necessary for other things besides your own enjoyment and the main quest (you also get more powerful runes if you kill high level captains, but at least I found the runes to be nice and helpful bonuses, but not something that need to be farmed in order to get through the game).Orc captain/warchief system is adequately large enough so that you probably won't encounter two similar boss-orcs during one play through. The somewhat-emergent gameplay system helps you to form a kind of personal connection with the enemies and they actually seem to have a personality every now and then. All the different names and outfits the orcs wear are not probably too canon, but they make for a good game.The story in Shadow of Mordor is a let down. It is a basic vengeance quest with the protagonist avenging the death of his family and trying to save the world in the meantime. Whereas the orcs you encounter might occasionally have an interesting personality, the supporting friendly characters are pretty soulless and uninteresting, the only possible exception being a certain hunter dwarf. Boss fights seem a bit forced and are too simple considering how fun and engaging the captain system is. Especially the main boss was a let down in many senses, ranging from the story to the execution.There is no question that Shadow of Mordor is a wonderful game with unique gameplay systems, awesome visuals and enough gameplay to keep you engaged but not too much that one would get bored. In the long run the nemesis system starts to lose its edge and might become a chore, but you will probably finish the game before that happens. Only real downside is the lackluster story, which fortunately is not too large a focus. It seems that in many ways this game has managed to dodge several pitfalls: you can see that the potential of crappiness is there, but it has been artfully averted with right design decisions and systems that far outweigh the downfalls.

												★★☆☆☆A functional, but uninspired blend of Assassin's Creed and Arkham City, with a weak LotR theme, limited mostly to name dropping, and even weaker graphics.  Expect to die, a lot, until endgame, when you can take on every orc in the world at once.  + Combat mounts+ I got the Season Pass somehow?+ Hunting & Gatherting mini quests+- Fast travel, rather spread out+- Arkham Combat, but Arkham City did it better+- Assassins Creed free running, but ACB did it better+- Weapon runes add minor stat customization, can buy more OP ones in DLC+- Varying performance on a 970, sometimes 90+ FPS, other times sub30.  This seems to be due to ultra Shadows.+- Branding.  Mind control enemies.  The best feature in SoM, but they save unlocking it until halfway through the story.  On top of that, its not unlocked for any meaningful reason, just ""OK, lets brand now!""+- Sauron's Army.  Enemy rival system, over hyped.  Hardly has an effect, especially later in the game, when you're unlikely to die and/or brand them all.  The way it only updates when you die isn't enjoyable either.  Its also required for story progress, which makes it feel even less like a natural and dynamic part of the world.  The way orcs visually upgrade, and remember you if you and/or they die (but somehow survive) is interesting, and it gives you the option to take out captains before going for the warchief to make things easier.  Could be a much better system if integrated better, instead of as a punishment for death.  - No multiplayer/coop- Can't replay missions- Clunky camera angles- Insta-fail stealth missions- Seperate zones to load between- Jump dodge rarely works, if ever- Weak graphics, even with the HD pack- Progression has no impact on the world- Some interactions only work in ghost mode- The only character customization is pay2dlc skins- Poorly written story, with practically no relation to LotR- Combat lacks the quickfire gadget variety of Arkham City- Mid-combat healing is handled very oddly, picking flowers- Attacks in combat don't knock down enemies in a single hit- Flurry finisher animation has no iframes until you upgrade it- Never visit any memorable, recognizable, or interesting locations- Expect to die, a lot, as an integrated part of the game and progression- Being low on health has an annoying mute + heartbeat effect on sound- Open world is mostly empty nature space, with non-stop enemies to kill- Upgrades are locked behind multiple gates and split between multiple currencies- You play as not-Aragorn.  This replacement is unlikeable, selfish, and poorly written- Inaccurate sloppy combat.  Counter inputs can fail, finisher inputs can fail, finishers can hit the wrong target, fury strikes can hit the wrong target, target friendlies, timing on the combo system doesn't feel right, etc* Controller required			"

Everything is made well: Modern graphics, geat optimization, great gameplay, many challenges, leveling system presence, stealth elements... Killing the Orcs was never so pleasurable. Everything is perfect. This game should be in every RPG lover's collection. I'm giving it 10/10.			"

												I enjoyed my time with Shadow of Mordor. The combat is ""Arkham-esque"" in a good way. The feeling of being powerful is a lot of fun. The nemesis system has to be experienced to be appreciated but it adds a interesting element of love/hate to the enemies who would be otherwise nameless grunts being mowed down under your sword. If you don't already know the nemesis system is the hierarchy of the Uruks (orcs) and as you defeat a higher ranking soldier, or if they defeat you, they will rise in the ranks of the army gaining power. Later in the game you obtain the ability to brand Uruks and they will join you in your fight and you will protect them as they go through challenges to become more powerfull. I do have some criticism to the game. It is an open world game but the world feels mostly empty of everything but enemies and an occasional NPC. There was a fair amount of button prompt kills which are overplayed. The story is interesting but without giving anything away....I felt the ending was somewhat hollow. The graphics are wonderful, but the color pallate is somehat bland. Enemy AI is acceptable, if a little lackluster and although I still had fun with the sneak kills, it was perhaps overly generous with stealth detection.All that being said, I had a lot of fun and I would certainly recomend it if you like the fast over the top combat of Arkham Asylum but with swords, gory executions, and orcs.

												I just picked up this game on Christmas and I have to say I'm genuinely impressed with the Nemesis system.I have no problem admitting when I was wrong, and I was definitely wrong when I claimed ""it will be just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level scaling under a new marketing name"". It's not, not even close.It's an interesting system that I can't wait to see expanded even more in future (eventual?) titles.Of course, it has its limitations and in the long run you'll start noticing some repetition, but it's still noteworthy. Uruk's dynamic hierarchy, an *enormous* amount of aesthetic differentiation and their ability to memorize their previous interactions with you (in a simplified way, of course, but it works) all contribute together to make mooks feel like real characters who play a part in your story. Sometimes even a memorable one.Before I familiarized with the system enough to learn how to exploit every single weakness the game even manage to give me my actual nemesis.This ♥♥♥♥er of a hunter captain started as immune to melee attacks (which were at first the only subsystem I was somewhat familiar with) and opened his way into becoming a virtually un-killable beast just kicking me on my teeth every single time.He wasn't just hard to kill, he also dealt a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of damage with his poisonous spear, and he turned constantly out of nowhere even when I was facing other commanders.He became my nightmare until I had a chance to exploit his only actual weakness, which was fire and explosive stuff.And of course he never stopped remembering me how many times he already kicked my♥♥♥♥♥or forced me to retreat.When I finally got how to deal with him and managed to kill the sucker I cheered, then I had to stop for a moment to realize ""Goddammit, how cool was that?"".Now, for the bad parts. What I liked the least about the game (beside the dull plot and the long-term sense of repetition, which to be fair is almost inevitable) was the Assassin's Creed-inspired collect-a-thon garbage.I get it's optional stuff, but Jesus Christ, when you are designing a world and your idea to fill the map is ""We should totally put in dozens and dozens of shiny spots that reward you with 50 exp each one"", you need to stop and reconsider what you are doing.Coming just out of Dragon Age: Inquisition forced me to think how much this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to design content is becoming popular for some inexplicable reasons.The worst part: not a single one of these boring activities lead to any climax with a final reward. They are literally there just to be there.Here's my suggestion, dear game designers: the next time you feel like you need to hide ""treasures"" in the game map, don't bother with hundreds. Put in ten-twenty of them at most, but be sure that finding them is a bit more challenging/interesting and the reward a bit more exciting (alternate weapons?, unique upgrades? alternate outfits, maybe even with their unique bonus/malus? etc).You'll be surprised by how much more ""filled with cool stuff"" the world will actually feel, even if there is factually more empty space.Anyway, I'm overall pleased with the purchase and I would recommend the game.P.S. In case you are on the fence because of the similarities, it'w worth noting that I can't stand Assassin's Creed games and I still enjoyed this a lot.			"

												Shadow of Mordor feels similar to the Assassins Creed and Batman games in the way that it plays. I enjoyed this more than both of those games however, mostly due to the excellent fluid sword combat. The Orc hierarchy system, in which Orcs who kill you rise through the ranks becoming increasingly powerful, is also unique and interesting. The world at first felt somewhat sparse, but plenty going on once you start exploring. Be warned, the game has a steep learning curve at times, but you can find a way to progress without too much difficult if you think laterally. For example, whilst I never really got stuck, I did encounter a particular Orc Captain who was practically invincible. Luckily none of the actual War Chiefs were quite so tough, so it didn't prevent me from progressing to the second greener setting in the game. Overall it's a fun experience with an okay story, pleasing graphics and presentation, that you will certainly enjoy if you are looking for an open world game of this type.			"

												Definitely one of THE BEST Harry Potter games ever made.However, it doesn't really fit in to the whole story-line, but I guess it's okay that they try to go their own way.I'm not sure how they've managed to make this storyline, without mentioning the Harry, Ron or Katniss, but it works out fine.The protagonist in the game is schizophrenic and has two personalities, one is Dumbledore as the elf who actually resembles something from Peter Pan more than anything from the HP universe, and then there is Sirius Black who is the brutal, but humble, leader of the army.10/10, although the game seems like a rip-off of the LOTR universe.

												This game stays true to its Genre, an open-world/action/adventure game. Being a bit different combat wise, it did take some time to get used to it. The combat system though a bit glitchy at times, is one of the best things about the game. For first couple hours strategies to kill uruks would be better but once you advance through the story the combat becomes relatively easy. The graphics are fine and the side missions are good too. Although the story is just average the best thing about the game itself is that when you die, the story still advances and the uruk who kills you gets promoted. :DLast but not the least hunting is good too, but limited to 2 creatures. And because the map is not that big you can run through the whole map in no time so hunting doesn't make too much of a difference. Till the end you keep getting new skills so the game doesn't get repetitive and because the storyline is not that long even if you get bored you can take a couple of hours and finish the game. I would recommend this game, but only on sale, doesnt justify the full price being single plater.			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameShadow of Mordor is quite good adventure-action game and, let's face it, if you want to freeroam a bit in LOTR universe, it's one of a kind game for now. Gameplay is not best one around, yet alot of games could learn thing or two from this game about its mechanics. As a LOTR devotee, with all those simple and old or LEGO games placed in this universe, i had to play it. Personally, I recommend it to everyone who finds tons of orks somehow sexy and finds enjoyment in running around behind enemy lines where everyone wants You dead.Advantages - Graphics really amazed and surpriced me, I really wasn't expecting that many details to be polished - Sounds in games are pretty good with variety of snarls, mumbles and roars, although voicing of characters could be done a little bit better - Story in game is good and well told, somewhat short but still good - Pretty good combination of stealth and action with really nicely done mechanics of movementDisadvantages - Gameplay quite disappointed me. It was fun for the first 2-3 hours where you get to know with what was going on etc. but after that you can clearly see that it's REALLY repetetive but you know, personal preferences here, most people probably would enjoy that after all. - Combat system is simillar or even same as in Batman: Arkham Origins. Enemies are slow, attack you one by one and it's really, really easy to dodge / counter them. - Gets annoyingly repetitive after few hours of fighting hordes of UruksIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												THIS IS STORY SPOILER FREE REVIEW (I'll limit the story to tutorial)Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is TPP Assassin's Creed like action game. You play as a Talion - ranger banned from death, seeking the one who refused death to him. His family is getting killed with him but he managed to hmm ""respawn"". He's connected to weird ghost who's name I won't reveal. This allows Talion to read minds, use slow motion and Azkâr bow, and further on he gains abillity to make orcs fight on his side, and some other cool stuff. Talion is also equipped with Urfael sword and Acham dagger. The game mostly allows you to choose if you want to sneak into somewhere, bring death to all of enemies on your path or create a little distraction releasing caragors etc. This game is pretty much about killing orcs or making them kill each other. There's a very deep nemesis system which allows orc thatkilled you to become captain, and if he's a captain already he can gain Power. Captains fight each other, go hunting, recruit other orcs, set traps, betray themselves, participate in executions etc. Captains can become Warchief's bodyguards. Warchief is highest tier in Sauron's Army. If you want to kill Warchief you've gotta lure him out doing something game asks you to for instance killing X of Y in stealth, releasing Z caragors. If you haven't killed Warchief's bodyguards they'll be with him to help him fight with you. If you dominated one of them before and left your mark on them they can start fight just on the press of an button. You can upgrade your arsenal with runes dropped by Captains and Warchiefs. The higher the Power they have the higher level of runes. You can buy up to 5 slots for runes on every weapon. There are a lot of side activities in this game and they're pretty fun, e.g. Vandetta, where you have to kill certain captain that killed your friend or if you don't have any friends (well, dead friends) it'll choose outside your friend list. You can also release slaves, do legend missions for all of your three weapons, help your orc captains in a hunt, duel and other things, search for artifacts, etc. Little warning here: the story is pretty short. I would not advise you buying this game for full price if you are not going to do ""at least"" a lot of side activities. I bought AC4 for similiar price and it kept me in for much longer. That doesn't mean I did not enjoyed wandering around Mordor. If you want to do this game at least on 70% and you would like to play Assassin's Creed with Batman combat in Tolkien's world - go for it.79/100Awaiting 2nd game with MUUUUCH longer storyline and more difficulty levels (there's only 1 in this game and it gets super easy quite fast considering it's short which makes it not as fun).

												First of all: Great graphics and awesome combat system! But F me it is boring after just a few hours.The waves of enemies just keeps on coming and it turns the game in to a snooze fest. Evertything feels like a chore and i just can't help finding myself in the same situation over and over again.			"

												I played my first 5-6 hours in a game where I made no progress, not knowing the game mechanics well enough, I got stuck and stopped playing the game.Coming back, and do a complete playthough, wow, I missed out on a lot. What a great game. Especially near the end, the story was awesome, boss fights were awesome, combat was awesome. A very good game. I highly recommend using a controller with vibration though, makes combat much more fun.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor has been one of the best games I've played, this is one of the best or THE best LoTR game that exists. You play as Talion a ranger in charge of guarding the Black gate until an attack overruns the guard and you are sacrificed with your family in an attempt to bring an ancient elf lord (Celebrimbor), yet in this attempt the wraith binds with Talion and thus you emerge as The Gravewalker.  The events of the game take place between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. I have to be honest, if you are in any way a fan of TLoTR franchise either by books or movies this is a game that you must own. Really. In the game you will face against Saurons armies. The nemesis system of the game remembers the player's interactions with specific types of characters they encounter and adjusts the manner in which these characters react to the player throughout the game. As I mentioned: If youre a fan you'll have tons of fun slicing thru waves of Orcs and Uruks and using the weapons and abilities to their fullest to experience the game in every way. If youre not a fan then I'd still recomend the game since it is so much fun.The graphics in this game are beautiful. For me, they really captured what I imagine Mordor would look and feel like. Enemies and creatures sprawl the lands that you can choose to fight, sneak or run past.There are only three things that irked me in this game: 1. the controlls are sometimes clunky (note* only in some places where you want to jump or drop and Talion either gets stuck or jumps or drops the wrong way)2. The end fell a bit short to me. 3. Game sometimes felt a bit too easy, yet you are bound to the wraith so that explains the power that you wield against the enemy (think: maybe around the same or greater power than the Nazgûl)Honestly this has been a great game that had me to the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Never thought it would be so much fun to slay waves upon waves of orcs and uruks, destroying the armies of the dark lord of Mordor. Obviously fighting the captains and warchiefs is the most fun and rewarding of all.EDIT for DLC- The Bright lord & Lord of the HuntIn the Bright Lord you play as Celebrimbor, the wraith that took into Talion in the main game but also the famous Elven Lord Smith form the Simarillion, it starts before the events of Talion (a couple hundred years) and sets you right after Celebrimbor has stolen The One Ring from Sauron. The meat of the DLC is the twin of the main game. brand the warchiefs and force them to a fight with Sauron.In Lord of the Hunt the DLC introduces the new Beastmaster Warchiefs into the game, and involves Talion joining with Torvin using his powers of Domination to turn these new beasts against the Warchiefs, proving that Mordor cannot be tamed. The creatures you fight in this DLC are well done and a challenge to overcome.IMHO: 9/10 Increadibly fun game with a great system that fits to you and what you do. Hardcore LoTR fans: this is a MUST buy.			"

												The first thing to ask with this game is quite simply: Is it the 3rd-person Assassin's Creed/Arkham/etc that it looks like? Answer... yes. And yes, the majority of the game touches on nothing new or exciting there. HOWEVER. There is the nemesis system.The Nemesis sytem does exactly what it says it will - it makes you enemies. Some of these enemies will give you a brutal makeover everytime you meet them. Some of them are so easy you barely notice they're harder than normal mobs. However, the brilliant thing with this is that you don't need a constantly changing landscape or storyline to progress - your enemies and THEIR rivalries and development ARE the changing landscape. You will hear normal mobs discussing their captains and their progress as you wander around in stealth. You'll hear rumors being spread of the times when you go in and slaughter billions of orcs one day, and you'll hear them asking their captains 'how they beat that ranger'. THAT is awesome, and this kind of developing characters is the future for this kind of gaming.When I first saw Assassin's Creed, I remember thinking 'Now, these boss scenes are amazing, you go into huge techincal planning, and a bit of fly-by-ear in approach, but it's a shame the boss fights themselves are so frigging dull.' Nemesis answers this, and answers it well.I remember the horror in looking at a particular foe I'd accidently died a couple of times to and realising that he no longer HAD a weakness. Worse, he was immune to pretty much everything - no missiles. No stealth. No battle combos. No finishers. I couldn't jump over him. He blocked normal attacks from the front. All I had left was chipping away very slowly at his health using finishers and wraith moves. Oh, and did I also mention that he lived in one of the forts, so there were usually at least two other captains near him 90% of the time?So I tried ignoring him. But he had a taste for my blood, and actively went out in hunting groups for me with other captains! I lost count to how many times he'd killed me. The satisfaction of FINALLY killing him came when I managed to set him on fire, and, for the first time ever, saw him running, all immunities forgotten. I beat the bejesus outta him, and felt immensely satisfied for doing so. Then I realised. This wasn't a stunningly hard boss that someone had intricately created to puzzle and perplex me. This was a boss that I had made (albeit by screwing up and very bad luck on his random rolls), but this enemy I'd just got such satisfaction out of finally figuring out and defeating - this guy had started out a normal mob who'd happened to get lucky and stabbed me. Damn. Now THAT is progress - this game makes real, tough enemies, and not because they're OP. not because they're some ingenius plan that neds exactly the right combo to beat, but because you're fighting an inexorable army that grows and progresses as you do.I would've liked to see more from the game in terms of a greater range of difficulty in it's enemies (I genuinely would like foes that are genuinely lacking in weaknesses, or where you have to combine more than one weakness to make it plausible to beat them ordinarily (or even force you to use the special events to try and weaken them a bit before pouncing on them) - I'd have liked more types of foes at times, and other portions of Sauron's army of darkness to go up against, more of a range similar to the critters you get - Ghul, etc, and more different location types for the orks to live in - condensed, claustrophobic tunnels full of them would be fun alternatives; but these are probably coming up in expansions, and I KNOW this will be covered by other, future games built on a similar premise. In fact, I can already see the next step of Nemesis systems - the stage when the whole systems learns from you. When it works out which traits tend to utterly screw you up and will be capable of keeping the pressure at a constant high by making you develop your skills to suit, whether it be to power up the harder parts of your skills, a piece at a time, or by progressing like a seesaw - underuse one item or skill type purposefully so that suddenly, you can drop back into it to dominate for a time against foes too used to massacreing you in one way, just to switch to another.I also respect the skill and precision in making all things potential flaws in enemies or potentially lethal to you - the Hatreds is a brilliant answer to things that might otherwise just squish every ork out there. I remember the horror on realising that the Graug, my ultimate weapon at the time, was being killed by a single ork because, hey, he hated them and beat the crap out of them. Worse, i couldn't kill him because A) it might kill me easily, and B) Hatred was on him, so he was on full regen and pummel-inducing adrenaline.So I've got to hand it to the makers - this game will be the root of a generation of games, and I cannot wait to see them.

												Finally we have a LoTR game worthy of many hours of our time! Shadow of Mordor brings free roaming adventure and game changing new features together to make one amazing game. One of those games where you get lost in its mechanics and find yourself putting the story on the back burner. For me that's a good sign of a game with good longevity.Nemesis system is great, combat is satisfying and gory to boot. Story is there but I find myself making my own story to enhance the main one. RPG elements are there. I especially like how the weapons upgrade with ruins you collect off of war chiefs or other notable enemies. Graphics are great. There is not much tediousness that comes with the open world genre. You can fast travel pretty readily conveniently. But this is one of those worlds where I prefer to get lost in and take that short cut threw the woods.Even if you are not a fan of Lord of the Rings check this game out. It is an amazing game on its own.If you are a die hard Tolkeinite the lore should not be that blasphemous to you either.			"

												Shadow or Mordor is simply a fun and well-made action game. You will fight, slash, stab, shoot, throw. Sometimes you will devour while mounted on a beast. Other times you will mind control. Some other times again you will mind control a captain to kill another captain.  The game ultimately ends up as a sandbox experience, an uruk-manipulation-simulator where you have tons of fun trying to come up with new ways to mess with and kill these silly not very smart, yet tough creatures. Best part of the game is the personal touch it gets when an orc kills you and mocks you afterwards. He gets a name, a promotion, a mental and physical personality, and you can seek him out for revenge. If you don’t succeed, you will be farther mocked an insulted, which feels great!The game succeeds in letting you feel as an ultimate bad♥♥♥♥♥ especially as your skills grow during the game. You end up so insanely overpowered after a while, that only a few enemies remain a challenge. But at this point the game is still very fun to play, as you will be toying around with the above mentioned uruk-manipulation. The fighting looks and feels really great (played with a controller), and the amount of graphic detail is outstanding. The open world offers lots of content, and I especially enjoyed collecting all the artifacts as they provided smaller stories, related to the lore of Lord of The Rings itself. I even liked collecting all the mushrooms and flowers. Cozy.It amazes me however that the main story of this game is so shallow, when everything else is pretty great. The cinematics of the game are top notch and really fun to watch. The voice acting is superb. Certain smaller sub-quests aren’t that bad either, while the main story simply isn’t very interesting and appears unengaging and below average. It’s strange, when the game otherwise shines, developers obviously knew what they were doing regarding everything else in the game. Despite the unmotivating main story, I still highly recommend this game for its great action and the orc manipulation system. The latter is something entirely new in the modern world of gaming. "

Product received for free
												This game stays true to its Genre, an open-world/action/adventure game. Being a bit different combat wise, it did take some time to get used to it. The combat system though a bit glitchy at times, is one of the best things about the game. For first couple hours strategies to kill uruks would be better but once you advance through the story the combat becomes relatively easy. The graphics are fine and the side missions are good too. Although the story is just average the best thing about the game itself is that when you die, the story still advances and the uruk who kills you gets promoted. :DLast but not the least hunting is good too, but limited to 2 creatures. And because the map is not that big you can run through the whole map in no time so hunting doesn't make too much of a difference. Till the end you keep getting new skills so the game doesn't get repetitive and because the storyline is not that long even if you get bored you can take a couple of hours and finish the game. I would recommend this game, but only on sale, doesnt justify the full price being single plater.			"

												THIS IS STORY SPOILER FREE REVIEW (I'll limit the story to tutorial)Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is TPP Assassin's Creed like action game. You play as a Talion - ranger banned from death, seeking the one who refused death to him. His family is getting killed with him but he managed to hmm ""respawn"". He's connected to weird ghost who's name I won't reveal. This allows Talion to read minds, use slow motion and Azkâr bow, and further on he gains abillity to make orcs fight on his side, and some other cool stuff. Talion is also equipped with Urfael sword and Acham dagger. The game mostly allows you to choose if you want to sneak into somewhere, bring death to all of enemies on your path or create a little distraction releasing caragors etc. This game is pretty much about killing orcs or making them kill each other. There's a very deep nemesis system which allows orc thatkilled you to become captain, and if he's a captain already he can gain Power. Captains fight each other, go hunting, recruit other orcs, set traps, betray themselves, participate in executions etc. Captains can become Warchief's bodyguards. Warchief is highest tier in Sauron's Army. If you want to kill Warchief you've gotta lure him out doing something game asks you to for instance killing X of Y in stealth, releasing Z caragors. If you haven't killed Warchief's bodyguards they'll be with him to help him fight with you. If you dominated one of them before and left your mark on them they can start fight just on the press of an button. You can upgrade your arsenal with runes dropped by Captains and Warchiefs. The higher the Power they have the higher level of runes. You can buy up to 5 slots for runes on every weapon. There are a lot of side activities in this game and they're pretty fun, e.g. Vandetta, where you have to kill certain captain that killed your friend or if you don't have any friends (well, dead friends) it'll choose outside your friend list. You can also release slaves, do legend missions for all of your three weapons, help your orc captains in a hunt, duel and other things, search for artifacts, etc. Little warning here: the story is pretty short. I would not advise you buying this game for full price if you are not going to do ""at least"" a lot of side activities. I bought AC4 for similiar price and it kept me in for much longer. That doesn't mean I did not enjoyed wandering around Mordor. If you want to do this game at least on 70% and you would like to play Assassin's Creed with Batman combat in Tolkien's world - go for it.79/100Awaiting 2nd game with MUUUUCH longer storyline and more difficulty levels (there's only 1 in this game and it gets super easy quite fast considering it's short which makes it not as fun).

												This game was something I admittedly didn't think would be very good, but after playing it through 100%, I can honestly say it was worth the time.The combat alone was worth the price to play, and even though there are side quests and things to do, they tend to get a little tedious, so the combat helps to keep it fresh.The game plays like Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games. There's bonuses given for freeflowing moves (there's only one attack button for melee) but this means simply not getting hit and stunning your enemies to keep the combo meter counting. As you unlock abilities, you get to spend points on abilities that allow you to perform special moves every time you get 8 uninterrupted hits (5 with an upgrade). The combat is just hard enough to keep you on your toes, but not so hard that you want to quit. Every now and then you get hit with a QTE that takes you by surprise, but there's nothing crazy (like God of War or Casltevania Lords of Shadow).The ability system is two-fold, and veterans to any series that puts RPG elements with hack-n-slash knows that the primary system for becoming stronger is to spend some sort of currency. In this game, there's both. A currency system is used to buy health and focus upgrades, carry more arrows, add slots to your weapons for runes, etc. While an XP system is used to unlock various abilities. The abilities will generally unlock over the course of the game, but there's also incentive to go off and maul orcs on your own... the higher tiers are unlocked as you earn Power. Power is earned by killing orc captains and warchiefs, settling power struggles, or even avenging the death of your friends. As you complete these missions you will gain access to stronger abilities that don't outright OP your character, but make battles where you are clearly outnumbered a little easier.The ranking system for Sauron's army is a little tedious and repetetive, but it's so in a very pleasing way. As you progress, you will gain access to ""intel"" which allows you to get information about the captains in Sauron's army, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Killing captains will affect the state of the army and allow you access to some of the more powerful warchiefs, each which drop their own special prizes. As you progress, you can even command your own orcs and have them battle each other. When an orc kills you, he gets promoted and is identified in the army so you can exact your revenge. The possibilities are endless... literall, as the army can never be fully wiped out.There's much more to say, and I've said a lot already, so you should just go play the game already!			"

												Perfect combo between Asassins Creed + Batman franchise. The story is somewhat compelling, mainly because a lot of people (me included) like the vengeance themed stories. About the gameplay, the combat is really like Batman's, with cool and bloody executions (stabbing, beheading, etc) and the map is like the Assassins Creed's one (you have to climb up high towers to set a checkpoint on the map). It's really replayable, as long as you like to do orc chop suey.To play it in ultra 1080p you need a very high end graphics card, but the game is really optimized, i play in medium/high and the graphics still awesome.

												Great game, possibly the best of the past 2014. For me better than the AC saga in more than one aspect, in fact before buying that game I was doubting between both, finally I´m happy with my decision.Positive aspects: The game have the best gameplay combat I´ve ever played, many people says like Batman Arkham series. The incredible environment makes you put in the role in the JRR fantasy like no other game in sale. Even being under license to Warner Bros the game contains brutal scenes and hundreds of heads flying away the neck.Negative aspects: storyline too short, or that really occurs is that I would like to have more and more from this game.

												A year later and I finally finished Shadow of Mordor.  I also purchased and finished all the DLC.   As a father with limited time, this is saying a lot.  This was hands down one of the best games I've played in a long time. The graphics, story line, and voice acting were top notch.  A great all round production!  My favorite game of 2015.			"

												I am HIGHLY critical about everything I hear or see, even if it may not always seem like it.Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is brilliance. Everything you could ask of a game within it's genre exists in the game, very interactive and agile movement, stealth, ranged combat, but not powerful to the point of making the game easy, in fact, most of the significant foes can't be taken down using ranged combat. Very interactive combat, excellent AI-coordination from what I have experienced, swarming-combat, 1 v 50, yet you can, if excelling in the gameplay, walk out of the fight without a scratch. A very clear storyline, which still branches off, to part, at some places here and there, not to mention the never-ending recurring missions, every time you clear out the entire rank-line of the orcs, all you have to do is progress time, and newly promoted orks have taken their slain brethrens place. Simply speaking, you never run out of things to do, and every fight is different from the other.Do I recommend the game? Well as clear as the sky at a cloudless night...YES! Looking for a great story? This game has it. Looking for excellent gameplay? This game has it.Looking for open-world gameplay? Oh it's there, alright.Looking for neverending gameplay? It's all in there.This game is worth every penny when it comes to extended entertainment.  Hopefully you find this review helpful and that you'll consider getting the game, if you do not have it already, because it's certainly worth it :)			"

												Great Game...Nice Balance of stealth and action!!Pros:1. Amazing fighting animation smooth as Batman Arkham series.2. Compnents like Assasins Creed where you can find more info about your target Uruks and then plot sensetional kills.3. Next Gen Graphics...still not that heavy on system...but HD pack can bend you card to knees.4. Enemy remembers your last fight (if he has survired or killed you) and taunt you or threat you based on that.5. Excellent moves and cool finishing animations and some Wraith moves are really innovative.6. Entire game world of Mordor is living and breathing and event in mordor impact game like captains can die in animal attack or other Uruk ambush.7. Game becomes incrementaly tough as story progress and especially when Talion unlocks more power.8. Some bosses are really though nut to crack and may have only one weakness if at all.9. Fun in giving Death threat and then killing Uruk captains or War Chiefs but it also is though as they get protection of though uruks after death threat.10. Lots of side mission and endless gametime.Even character death alters game so die carefully ;)Lord of Hunt:More twist but story lacks depth1. New Beasts are cool.2. War Chiefs have some Wraith capabilities like they can control Ghuls like Talion.3. Some missions are unique. Cons:1. You really cant kills all captains as game will periodically replenish the ranks (I can't have sadistic satisfaction of clearing all Captions while you can kill all War chiefs if you can)2. Some side missions are too tough and time consuming than main story mission.3. Some of the Uruks are near impossible to kill, I got killed by same War chief more than 9 times.4. Sometimes especially in Stronghold killed enemy spawn even though you have not left area or still doing same mission or story.Lord of Hunt:1. Its still in same map.2. All Caragors are replaced,3. Looks like original developer concept only released as DLC			"

												TL;dr? This is effectively Batman, Arkham Asylum set in the Lord of the Rings 'verse.This isn't something bad. This is, to be honest, quite fantastic as the combat mechanics from the Batman games (Barring the latest one) is fantastic. The combat may not be perfect (there are peices of the terrain that will abruptly stop you from moving when the majority of other structures makes you parkour around like a man on speed and crack. For those of you who are mechanically gifted, as in you can keep all your keys in your head and not get confused with what buttons do what, you near literally can not be stopped. The captains are a nice mechanic to fight and them being able to level up is a fascinating mechanic that is fun to fight against. even if you fail and they finish you off, they come back stronger, giving you more rewards if you kill them. Leading to an interesting dynamic of letting them kill you to make yourself more powerful. If they kill people from your friends list, you can even avenge their deaths. Everything about them gears you up to becoming more powerful and dangerous.The last stand mechanic, letting you recover yourself even if you ♥♥♥♥ up or miss-press a button, is nicely difficult without being overly stressful and damaging your enjoyment of the game over soemthing cheap seeming. This game continuously aims to reward you if you can pull yourself out of a bad situation. Coupled with an excellent feat/abililty system that empowers you without giving you an 'I win button', instead making you stronger while expecting you to still use skill or finesse. I again seriously can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor chooses its own path outside the regular ""Lord of the Rings"" move-game chum we've been fed over the years. The main story is interesting, but it failed to unravel as smoothly as the mechanical aspects of the game.Game mechanics - combat, stealth & movementThe combat, stealth and movement systems are a direct rip from the Batman: Arkham series of games (sans batarang of course). This was a smart move on the developer's part given the focus of the game. The difference being that the team opted for a slightly less stringent stealth implementation. This ""nerf"" to the Batman level of stealth isn't a bad thing. I found it a great middle ground compared to other more stealth-focused games (Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, etc.). Movement, more specifically parkour movement, was much less fluid and tended to be less forgiving than other games. After I taught myself to be a little more deliberate in my movements this tended to become less of a problem.Skills, runes & other progression stuffsGame mechanics such as skill systems and gear upgrades exist. There is a rune system designed to enhance specific aspects of your weapons. While the runes were fairly diverse, I found that once I had specific types I rarely changed them out and merely chose to upgrade them. This is more than likely a result of my play-style, but I would've liked to have seem even more diversity with runes and/or ways to ""upgrade"" them myself. As far as skill progression I actually found this aspect quite enjoyable and rather than sticking to ""what I knew"" I found experimentation with new abilities and skills to be very rewarding. My one wish is that ""Nemesis system"" skills would not be directly locked to the story missions.Nemesis systemThe Nemesis system was a big focus of the game. The system allows you to view and manipulate, in some ways, the Uruk leadership in the two major areas in which the game takes place. While there was much ado about the system, I found it a little sad that I was forced to progress deep into the game to get into the really neat aspects of the Nemesis system. I feel like there could've been considerably more depth to my overall game if I had been able to unlock those skills sooner. How does the Nemesis system play?In the beginning and even mid-way through the game it just isn't all that interesting. It wasn't until the end after unlocking key skills that I got to really mess around with it. That being said it is not nearly as expansive as the developer's try to make it out to be. There were a few Uruk's I wound up despising towards the end, but mostly I found my desire for vengeance to be quite satiated with the rivers of Uruk blood that flowed in the wake of my wrath. Monolith take this from me (Monolyth), if you choose to add a sequel to this game you need to greatly expand the Nemesis system and allow greater interaction with it sooner rather than later in the game.Story timeSwitching gears now, lets talk about the story. First of all I would have to say that Tolkien purists may do well to steer clear of the game (as many do the movies). The game takes many liberties with the Tolkien universe that might not be as appreciated. While I was able to follow the story easily enough I found in most cases I could not engage emotionally with the primary protagonist(s). Talion and his (trusty?) wraith sidekick family flashbacks served little more purpose than to push the story a long. I found that I cared more for some of the secondary characters than I did the primary...yeah. Overall the story takes a slightly different approach to the battle against Sauron and his minions than what we are all used to seeing. It is a refreshing viewpoint to see and could set the stage for even more aggressive ""based on"" Middle-earth lore.Just one more before bed...Another failing point in the story is its brevity. We are treated to some very cool ideas and concepts that if further explored could've provide some solid content. This wasn't necessarily an overall negative for my experience, I tend to focus heavily on side-quests and other content in the game. My overall game time is probably much higher than someone who wouldn't. Anyone expecting the main story content to take more than 8 hours if you focus on nothing but that will probably be a little bit disappointed.So what's the verdict?The game played very well for me and while some game mechanics suffered from a lack of options, I found the combat to be fluid and very rewarding. The much touted Nemesis system lacked depth until late in the game. The plight of the progranist(s) was fairly forgettable especially when compared against the much more interesting story elements overall.TLDRIf you like Batman style fighting games, are a completionist (or even like to do a few side quests here & there) and appreciate Middle-earth based stories I think you'll find your money well-spent.

Posted: November 10, 2014
												Welcome to my first review in a long time! During this review  I will be addressing the games elements which include: Gameplay, Graphics, Sound/Music, Story, along with the things that make it unique. I will also along give my thoughts and feelings on the game. Be warned there are VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD! Gameplay: 9/10 When I started this game the first two games I thought of (and many others agree) were Assassin's Creed and the recent Batman Arkham games. The game takes the parkour and stealth system of Assassin's Creed and combines it with the timed button pressing combat of Batman. While many will say this is a complete rip-off of the two, it simply is far from it. It takes the elements from these games tosses them into a polisher to polish the mechanics and refines them so that it can flow almost seamlessly. Each mission uses different elements of these mechanics by utilizing different challenges in each mission such as getting stealth kills, executions, and others which give you bonus points for abilities and so on.The reason why I did not give this a 10 was due to the slight lag in the counter system. It was not as fluid as Arkhams system but it is damn close to it! Graphics: 8/10 I can’t really say much about the graphics as I only played it on PC. They are nice enough to get you immersed into the game. However where it really shines is on the 4k resolution. Sadly you need at least a 4GB card for this to happen. From what I have seen from the PS4/Xbox One versions they barely push the systems to their limits. I will update this section when I know more about the PS3/360 versions. Sorry Wii U fans no version for you unfortunately. I will say that the ambient effect are nice like getting soaked in water or mud and the wind mechanics and adds more realism to the games. There isn’t really anything EYEPOPPING here at the moment.  Sound/Music 10/10: I CAN PERSONALLY SAY THAT ONE THING OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE MUSIC! Though there aren’t any tracks recognizable from the Lord of The Rings/Hobbit Movies. The musical score is fantastic and very well done in my opinion. The sounds of swords clanking off metal armor, shields cracking, and the voice acting is fantastic. I can't praise it any more. Story 6/10: The story is pretty simple. Your character and the games protagonist Talion is killed, along with his wife and son, by servants of Sauron called the Black Hand. You are then possessed by a wraith who is also seeking revenge on the Armies of Mordor which makes you become an undying Ranger to claim your revenge. And that's all that's all that is explained to you to start. I won't spoil any more. Though the story has some weak points the interaction between the characters is enough to keep you wondering what’s next even though the story is rather one dimensional when it comes to the main subject of it (Revenge!) Unique Elements 8/10: One thing I can say about the game is that it has quite a few unique features that have kept other players and myself engaged. The leveling system is slightly different from others where as you gain XP, you learn new abilities to make your character better at combat, stealth and bow attacks. You can also learn new finishing moves, and combos which will help you in battle. There are also side missions that can be done to acquire a currency which is then spent on upgrading your total health, ammo, and slow motion focus time.  The most engaging part of the game is the ""Nemesis System."" As you play through the game, various Uruks, captains, and chiefs in Sauron's Army willA look at the nemesis systemA look at the nemesis system by battling each other for power within the army. Most of the time can be to your advantage but can also be your downfall. One instance can be they will be dueling each other for positions of power while moving about in the ranks on their own. However, let's say you attempt to kill off one of these Captains. If you defeat him, his position will be left over in the army for a new enemy to fill the space. If you are slain in battle, the enemy who killed you will gain reputation, called power, and be promoted to Captain, gaining special abilities and weaknesses. The game does not hold your hand as it punishes failure, which is something we haven't seen in a lot in recent games at all which also makes it more rewarding.  In conclusion, that Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a great game to pick up; even if you aren't a fan of Lord of the Rings it has a lot to offer a gamer who is looking for something new. I think that is part of the reason why the decided to not use the Lord of the Rings trademark name. They wanted to make this game a game that anyone could pick up and enjoy without knowing the lore if they wanted to. However for fans of the lore there are plenty of references to the books and films within the achievements/trophies, (Like ""Fly, you fools” which is obtained by making 20 Uruks flee by dropping Morgai fly nest on them). Should you play this game. YES! YES YOU SHOULD! Overall: 8/10			"

Like getting the elven swiftness shut down by a bag of grain or riding a graug and get blocked by -everything-, or grabbing on to every ledge ever when you're on a timer. Or just getting a cutscene for every captain ever without being able to disable it. It's alright for the most part.

												Very fun game. Engaging combat, good traversal, great political system, terrible AI but some say that's part of the fun. Skill Tree is pretty awesome too. Being able to shadow mount from dog to dog and brand them all along the way feels satisfying as hell. Story was satisfying but I felt there should have been ring wraiths somewhere in this game considering the themes, and the final battle(s) were a little simple. Expected a little more out of the ending too.In any case, a solid 8/10. Well worth playing once through.			"

Its price has become very low unlike other titles of the same age but of worse quality which I don't get. The Nemesis system is cleverly thought-out and contributes enormously to the replayability of the game.

I'm ignoring the flaws cause the good things overshadow the bad ones and I love everything lotr. I can only mention that I hate that it was so short. Oh and yea, the last ""fight"" if you can call it like that.Time to dlc!Edit: Had lots of fun in Lord of the Hunt dlc, with new ways how to use beasts of Mordor to your advantage.

												Ok here we go. One of the best Middle Earth games i've ever played so far. BFME1 was a good strategy game but action,rpg,open world style this is the best. Pros: Nemesis system. Challenges are good and hard. Some of them are very easy. Hunting and taming beasts are good thing. Celebrimbor -the ring maker- is a great character. We saw his story in this game and Sauron -The dark lord,traitor,the eye etc.- decieved him. And another character in this game is Talion. He is a black gate ranger. I wanted to tell everything but shortly story was great. Gollum, Sauron servants, beasts, orcs, master dwarf. Ah damned Saruman is trolling in this game too. Optimization is really good. Cons: Slave saving quests are the same. Maybe you get bored of killing orcs.(But i didnt)I played 40 hours story and did challenges %98. Now i'm playing lord of the hunt dlc. I will edit after i finish all dlc's and challenges. I will recommend this game %200. You wont regret it. Orcs must die. :DEdit: Lord of the hunt dlc is really challenging. Beastmasters are really strong they have only one weakness. Before you attack you should think a plan. New beasts are good. New carabor is swift and predator. And my dear huntsmate is Torwin. A dwarf has no fear of darkness and beasts. A dedicated huntsman he is. He is a traveler. You should read his journal.Hd dlc doesnt need 6gb video card. I have gtx 660 53 fps average.			"

												A cautious recommendation. So-So story which only appeals to major LOTR followers and fans. Riding mechanics seem a little bit choppy. Other than that, the game is a solid entry to the LOTR game universe, probably being the best LOTR video game to date. A great blend of Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham, giving an excellent, responsive, and badass combat system. Nemesis system is a revolutionary mechanic that makes this game stand out. Two medium-sized open world areas, filled with stuff to do and orcs to slay. Plenty of fun.			"

The overall theme in this game is just awesome, Reminds me abit of Dishonored.Great Storyline, Combat is fully up to the player to decide,You can go in as noisy as you want or as quiet as you want or maybe you just want to attack them from range... This game has it all and does a good job at it, The weapon runes seem to balance the game & combat out quite nicely on all grounds.There are a few bugs, Mainly climbing and getting stuck inside walls. Which isnt that much of a problem as you just fast travel to one of your towers.			"

												Ok here we go. One of the best Middle Earth games i've ever played so far. BFME1 was a good strategy game but action,rpg,open world style this is the best. Pros: Nemesis system. Challenges are good and hard. Some of them are very easy. Hunting and taming beasts are good thing. Celebrimbor -the ring maker- is a great character. We saw his story in this game and Sauron -The dark lord,traitor,the eye etc.- decieved him. And another character in this game is Talion. He is a black gate ranger. I wanted to tell everything but shortly story was great. Gollum, Sauron servants, beasts, orcs, master dwarf. Ah damned Saruman is trolling in this game too. Optimization is really good. Cons: Slave saving quests are the same. Maybe you get bored of killing orcs.(But i didnt)I played 40 hours story and did challenges %98. Now i'm playing lord of the hunt dlc. I will edit after i finish all dlc's and challenges. I will recommend this game %200. You wont regret it. Orcs must die. :DEdit: Lord of the hunt dlc is really challenging. Beastmasters are really strong they have only one weakness. Before you attack you should think a plan. New beasts are good. New carabor is swift and predator. And my dear huntsmate is Torwin. A dwarf has no fear of darkness and beasts. A dedicated huntsman he is. He is a traveler. You should read his journal.Hd dlc doesnt need 6gb video card. I have gtx 660 53 fps average.			"

												Shadow of Mordor does only a few things, but does them definitive top quality. It cannot be denied that the game wasn's only inspired by Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series, but it's largely identical. You have a sandbox in which you have several regions you gain full vison of by climbing to a high tower to ""eagle vision / hammer something"" it, after which a small region gets revealed on the map around your tower with various very repetitive sidemissions of the well known archetypes, such as kill them all, kill them all but stealthed, kill them all but with a bow.Shadow of Mordor however, spins this formula a little with it's core gameplay system the entire game is built around, called the ""nemesis system"". It's basicly a web of ork hierarchy and leadership, with several unique and endless generated ork bosses from local band leader to legion commanding warchiefs. They fight for power among each other, dominate the weaker to be their bodyguard, challange the stronger to take it's place, or even make fragile alliances. Anyway, they live their little lives without you, in an ever changing power-struggle. Each has unique strenghts and weaknesses that are really varied and for once I can say are really gamechanging and fun to play around (for example one can be immune to stuns, stealth kills, has strong armor and a squad of elite bodyguards, but is afraid of fire and beasts). So you have this little hierarchy here with unique orks in them, and you can manipulate the power struggle with turning them against each other, wiping the mind of one making him your puppet, manipulate the hierarchy around him in a way to get him ranks, you may get him as a bodyguard of a huge warlord and when the time comes to kill him, you can flick your fingers and get him backstabbed by your puppet. Or ride a warg to the middle of their fort, set it loose and assassinate your target in the middle of the chaos while he is separated from his elite squad, running and hiding because you exploited his fear of beasts. And it was just 2 examples, you can come up with many and do them however you like, with the exception of some key points in the story.Shadow of Mordor, is a great sandbox. It looks good enough (though faces definitly age faster), plays fantastic with the well known copypaste gameplay from Assassin's Creed / Arkham games, adds some unique elements to it that define the game (such as marking orks with your hand just like Saruman did, you can literally see the fear and terror in the poor ork's eyes when you force him to kneel before you with your burning palm on his face with an irresistable commanding otherworldy voice demanding obedience, it's so awesomely done you absolutely feel unstoppable and powerful).Buuuut, there are some downsides. For example, the story starts great, ends great (through it's a huge cliffhanger without sequel or explanation which sucks), but has almost nothing in the middle. Those ""great"" parts are good because something happens. And that's it. Not because it's outstanding or even logical, but this is the only thing you get that isn't sandbox artifact hunting or random ork killing. The main story is basicly a very long tutorial as the game gives you more tools to use, and teaches you how to use them on some random target, so on this perspective it's definitly mediocore or worse. It's also disappointing that when you finally finish a collection of any kind (weapons, moon runes, whatever) you barely get any satisfying rewards (like, a quote from some neverheardofhim and that's all for your long work of sword runes collecting). It is heavily advised to do most of the sideactivities and collections you want to finish before you finish the main story, because it's very discouraging to keep playing after that. It's a common problem of many sandbox games, some can surpass it, some can't. Shadow of Mordor definitly can't. But this is everything I can hold against it.It plays great, it runes great performancewise, it feels great because you don't have the good guy restrictions like in AC or Arkham. It's a slaugherhouse with spilling ork blood, badass ""Mordorlike name chanting ork music"", with stunning slow motions (and even a pause->photo mode with many tools!), the cold sound of steel as your sword slices the air towards some poor ork your blade strikes down like a thunder (quite literally, sometimes the cold reflection of light on your blade just lits up in slowmo and it's feels so great, it's full of little detail additions like this), the feeling of being the unstoppable, dark, unrestricted tragic hero with a combat system I cannot find more ways to praise, it's just... when you can't say more than ""IT'S SOOO GOOOD"".Shadow of Mordor is fantastic for it's gameplay, gives you a moderate sized sandbox to enjoy it, and it's definitly an experience worthy of it's price. The main story however quicky falls to boredom, is very predictible and unexciting with the exception of the cliffhanger ending that has no following.			"

												One of the best adventure games - gameplay, story, characters, voice acting, graphics (!), replayability, fun, challenge (if you're up to it). Its price has become very low unlike other titles of the same age but of worse quality which I don't get. The Nemesis system is cleverly thought-out and contributes enormously to the replayability of the game. It may feel boring but give it a few tries and it will grow on you and make your game even more entertaining. It's one of those few games I truly loved.10/10			"

												This is great game, the combat is fun but it takes time to gets the skills to make it so. I played 4 or 5 Story Missions getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked so I started to make side missions and it made a big difference.The story took a lot of time to get insteresting for me but maybe is why because I played side missions for about 8 hrs xD, still felt it was a little short.COMBAT:The combat was great but in the start is basically smashing the X and Y buttons but then you get the skills and if you don't use them and just keep smashing you're gonna have a bad time, and you'll feel like a badass for killing them with many techniques.BOSS FIGHTS:The weren't many of them (besides the obvious fights with the warchiefs), many of them were meh but there were some pretty good ones.NEMESIS SYSTEM:The Nemesis System is really interesting and for me it succeeds in making you hate the Uruks when they kill you many times and they get Power and you feel the satisfaction of killing them. But I got to admit it was kinda annoying sometimes having to get information from the Uruks.LEVEL DESIGN:The map I got to say was kinda disappointing, It felt very same at times and only certain areas had room for strategizing, and talking about the map there were certain wall where you could get kinda stuck, you have to climb down and then climb up again.RESUME:For me this game was great, the story was good and the combat excellent. It is worth every penny because I did 22 hrs and made 68% and I am planning on playing it again. I would give it an 8/10. The things holding it back were the lacklockster boss fights (not all of them) and the story being kind of weak at times, specially being LOTR related could have been better.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!Even though the final battles were amazing and felt epic I think they could have been harder and don't even get me started with that freaking final boss battle with the Black Hand of Sauron, it was bullishit. The fact that you were (kinda) the forger of the Rings of Power was pretty awesome  because I haven't read the books (and not sure if this is them), only seen the Extended Edition of the LOTR trilogy (like 8 times haha) and it let me seem some of the back story of the forging of the ring and of couse the one ring but still felt Golum was a little bit forced in the story.

												Shadow of Mordor is a hybrid Batman/Assassins Creed game set in the LoTR universe. It looks lovely, plays wonderful and is very addictive. Fans of any of these would probably like it.The combat is very similar to the Batman games. bar some key mapping changes I would go as far as to say it's almost an exact copy infact, so anyone familiar with the system will be right at home here. It's smooth, engaging and rewarding. A button-masher this IS NOT. Stealth works nicely alongside this system to give you several options for taking down the enemy. You even get some ranged weapons in the form of your elven counter-part's bow - using ""Elf Shot"".The story seems fairly well devised and sits nicely within the LoTR universe. it oozes Tolkien from the get-go and it's wonderful to be playing a LoTR game that is actually good. Voice acting is also top-notch, which really benefits the game.The nemesis system is a wonderful little addition that makes deaths more meaningful to you. When you get killed, the enemy gets promoted in Sauron's army, making him stronger. The next time you meet you will then get a little jab from them about when they previously killed you before battle ensues for revenge. There are some other really nice touches here, like if you choose to run away from one, they will comment on this the next time you meet. It makes the battles and deaths seem more personalised to your game and is a welcome addition.All-in-all, this is a very solid game that I would recommend to anyone that likes Batman or Assassins Creed and LoTR.Jimbo Rating: 8/10			"

												Clunky and awkward keyboard and mouse controls combine with hyper twitch happy fighting gameplay. That said, the game looks amazing, and the is incredibly engaging. My first foray went 6hrs, of which I should have been asleep 4 lol. The story and gameplay engage you right off the bat and you pretty much immediately fall into a 'just let me get this one more thing done' mindset. The fighting mechanisms are pretty impossible to master, unless you take enough speed to dilate time, but at the same time, are simple manage to be simple enough to allow you to succeed in most combat situations.The nemesis system is easily the most interesting and frustrating aspect of the game. Letting an Uruk kill you two or three times can make them nearly unkillable, combine that with their frustrating ability to mob you with 3 or 4 of these captains all at once and it can get really obnoxious. Even captains that aren't anywhere near your fight seem to magically teleport to you. That said, it really helps to engage you and add to the satisfaction of finally putting them down hard. As icing on this rather delicious cake, we get to explore an area and time frame previously never expanded upon in Tolkien lore. In this the game offers several methods to increase the immersion factor, finding artifacts with memories bound to them, NPCs, even the wraith you're bound to. The player is constantly hit with in game conversation, and information. All in all this is one seriously damned fine game and can be equally fun and infuriating. DEFINITELY a worthy buy on a decent sale price.(I'm cheap I wont spend $50 on a digital copy of a game for anyone)			"

However... the story is pretty bland and perhaps its longevity is relatively short, but its good at what it does and has the key fun factor, slicing and dicing Uruks.			"

												Well, i had been looking forward to this game for quite a long time, it looked like it would be a mixture of assassins creed and the lord of the rings, which was always good.. The scenery looks amazing, the music is nice, and the story keeps you interested... However that said, the story is very, very short... and then when finished, it does feel like you have only played about half of the game, DLC from the season pass should come out soon, but it does still leave you wanting more. So after i finished the game after about 6 hours, i decided i would try and get the achievements, which are your standard, collect so many of this and kill so many of that, with the odd tricky one thrown in, freeing slaves is boring after the first island, as it is literally just going in and doing the same thing over and over again.The nemesis system is all very well, and yes it is cool that if you are killed by an orc they become a captain and can then become a war chief, and still remember you and insult you like everyone else in the game, but the novelty soon wears off, and can be a bit of a pain if wanting a specific captain to go to a certain position, which you need to do on more than one occasion. I do think that it is a very good game, if short, and DLC should extend the fun, it's just the landscape is all a bit samey, and it can seem a bit repetitive after a while.			"

												I will say right off the bat, that I mostly play MMOs. Not many single player games can pull me in. The other day I sat down, turned on this game, and for 6 hours I could not exit. I didn't want to get off. I figured I should sleep so I did. I don't play it every day, but when I do I can't put it down. The Arkham series was my all time favorite single player game, but this one has taken that over. I am crappy at reviews but here ya go:First off, I heard the last boss fight sucks, that its to easy. I haven't got that far yet as of typing up this review. But honestly,  I don't really care. The game is extremely enjoyable, the amount of content for a single player game is awesome. The story seems to be fairly short as there is only 20 missions in it, but if you do all the side stuff, its very lengthy. Would I recommend this game to someone that only wants to do the main story and none of the side stuff? I would say No. This game really feeds off doing side missions, messing with the nemesis system  and whatnot. Building up your weapons, purchasing abilities, etc.. Its just all around a great game to get lost in.Speaking of purchasing abilities, the system is good and all, but almost 14 hours in I think and I almost have all the abilities purchased that is available. The only reason I bring this up, is because I think that its bad. It reduces customization options. What I mean is, it don't really matter where you put the points cause you will end up having them all anyway. Know what I mean? At this point I just slap a point in, see what I got and go on my way. I just love deep customization, but that won't knock points off from me.All around its an amazing game. Would I change anything? Honestly no. I do hate stealth and am TERRIBLE at it (terrible hardly explains it) but in this game its rather easy so far. It may get more difficult, I don't know, but its not a hard system in this game. Its very simple and straight forward. At this point, the Arkham series had harder stealth areas than this game does and I managed that one fine.Ok ending this here. Hope it helps out some, probably not :D			"

												I am happily surprised with how satisfied i am with this game. I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all, but just bought this game on a whim. It was the hype game of the month and i said why the hell not, and took a leap of faith, and it paid off ten-fold. I love it when i by a masterpiece on accident. The game's story isn't really what keeps me engaged, but it is compelling enough not to want to skip. The voice acting by Talion is spot on. The game plays like Batman Arkham City meets Assassin's Creed, and builds on both formulas both in traversing the environment and combat. Like in the batman arkham games, the combat is extremely simple with some extremely complex mechanics buried within it, that makes for an intriguing and addicting thing to get into. I know there are story missions, but there's just something about simply killing hundreds of uruks all day and all night that just loses me. The game runs beautifully too, this is by far one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played. It makes Tomb Raider look like an old Xbox 360 game. My only minor gripe is with Warner Bros and their blocking of posting content published by them on YouTube, but if you don't mess with that kind of thing, then that doesn't even cocern you. This isn't the most innovative game in the world, but it feels like it's own game. Despite it borrowing mechanics from other games, it borrows them the right way, taking what made them fun, and throwing some middle-earth spice in the pot. This hands down one of my top games of this year, based on my first few hours of playing the game alone. You know this game is a masterpiece within the first hour of play. For a game that i never even remotely considered buying until it showed up in my queue a few days ago, I'd say this was the most satisfying blind purchase of $70 (with the season pass) I've ever spent. Buy this game now. Saving up for another game? Who cares. Buy this anyways. There's a 75% chance this game will end up being better than whatever it is your saving up for. The best part is, you can tell this game wasn't intended to be as good as it is. It's ironic that we live in a world where overhyped games are just that, overhyped, while the ones that fly under the radar turn out to be some of the greatest games you'll ever play.			"

												Highly enjoyable, if a bit short.PROS- Very good, modern graphics.- Fun combat, similar to batman (combo and parry) but much smoother.- Fun exploration / sandboxing, similar to assassin creed but more natural and less repetitive.- Kinda original with the nemesis system. (Dynamic orc captains with varied modifiers.)- Nice dialogs. Never heard anyone repeat the same line twice, which is quite the feat.- Nice achievements, fun to pursue, all doable in reasonable time. None of those usual ""kill a gazillion zombies"" kind of mindless grind achievements.- Really nice polish and attention to details. The developers know what they are doing.CONS- Only about 30 hours, including 100% completion and getting all achievements (and quite a bit of fooling around), in fact you can probably beat this in under 15 hours if you are not a collector and just beeline the story mode. - The is a time / score race mode that can get you a few hours on top of that. But seeing as people are posting 500 000 scores while the max i was able to do is about 10 000, I conclude there is cheating involved so you can't really play it competitively, only see how you're doing compared to your friends.REVIEWWell, to me this is a mix of assassin creed, batman, Risen (the first, not the abomination that followed it), and dare I say it, skyrim. In fact this could have been a worthy successor to skyrim if it wasn't so short... I felt like they did a good job creating the overall gameplay, world, settings, creature and enemy diversity, and so on, they just need to have bigger areas and more content for this game to truly shine and create a ""must play"" IP.Value wise, it is a bit overpriced for it's length. I feel like 30$ or so would have been more reasonable, seeing as it is a lot shorter than games in the genre (their fault for claiming being an sandbox RPG, games in this genre go for hundreds of hours) and they seem to plan for DLCs which probably should have been included in the game to give it that much needed longevity. Highly recommended to grab this in a sale, but paying full price is not a horrible idea if you can't wait. I'd aim for the game + season pass for 50$, that would be a decent price for what you are getting.			"

Nan iChir Gelair Mordor!Uruk decapitaion simulator, Mordor sandbox and enough collectables to keep you hunting longer than the lidless, burning Eye of Sauron. Set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor takes place in the land of Mordor, apparently you can just walk in if you live there, who knew? The Necromancer has returned and with him, death, decay and enough uruk to write Macbeth ten times over should they all be given a type-writer. The games light opening quickly sours and soon our protagonist, Talion the Ranger finds himself connected to Celebrimbor, the ring-maker turned wraith. This connection leaves us with a two-for-the-price-of-once protagonist, sharing a body and spending time having friendly chats and discussing Talion’s emotional weaknesses. Talion, as a ranger, has a variety of combat skills at his disposal, but when combined with Celebrimbor we gain access to the otherworldly powers of the wraith. Edwenno o Gwath!The combat is very similar to the Arkham series’ combo driven Army-of-One style brawling, but with swords and power it feels much nicer to play, and incredibly fun to watch as blood and heads fly across the screen. A variety of enemy types change the way combat must be approached, can you just slice and dice your way through that uruk or must you attack from behind? Can you counter that attack or is dodging your old option? The combat can get hectic at times, which is by no means a bad thing. At times I found the game becoming rather easy, but there was more challenge to be found within Strongholds which, should you let it, can quickly become host to a swarm of uruk all thirsty for your blood. The powers you can unlock open different ways to tackle situations and later in the game dominating enemies and having them fight for you is a lot of fun. The game also allows for stealth, it isn’t as tight as other games, uruks tend to forget they saw something and the sound of someone choking on blood as you slash their throat isn’t enough to alert others just a few steps away. But it is nice to have the option anyway. But should you die, well, that’s when things get interesting. If you haven’t yet heard of the Nemesis system I can only assume you live under the dark cover of Mount Doom. The Nemesis system controls the inner workings of the Army of Sauron. Uruk aren’t known for being honorable or decent leaders, so of course the army is filled with uruk who are desperate to dominate others and should another take issue with that, they may try to overthrow them. There are a few different things which you can do to alter the way the army works, killing off captains or warchiefs weakens the army but should you keep some of them alive they can grow in power and become a force to be reckoned with. I found a strange enjoyment in letting a regular uruk kill me just to see them promoted to captain and seeing how that one uruk may alter the army from within. Of course, with time it becomes obvious that the Nemesis system isn’t as deep as it first seems but that never diminished the quality of the mechanic, at least not for me. One of my favourite things about the system was watching an uruk I had previously defeated come back, scarred and hungry for revenge. Seeing their appearance change with each losing encounter is enjoyable, especially when Ùkbùk the Bleeder was screaming at me through a sack bound with string with a damaged red eye the only visible part of his face. Removing his head was bittersweet. Nor Eduath!The story isn’t the deepest or most groundbreaking thing I’ve ever seen in a video game but it is nonetheless enjoyable, seeing familair faces such as Gollum helps to ground the game within the world. It may not appeal to the lore-worshipping Middle  Earth fans but for those who enjoy the world and relish anytime spent there this game is essential playing.Side-missions are plentiful. There are a few types of mission available to you. Each of Talion’s weapons has its own range of missions all suited to the weapon in question and there is the option to save slaves opening even more quests. Completing a weapon’s range of quests ends in a satisfying reforging of that weapon. The game is exceptionally good looking, the darkest corners of Mordor look fantastic and the weather adds to this with glistening stone and water running over cliffs.  My only issue was Talion’s hair but with the Dark Ranger skin that issues was gone.Only you could accomplish such art, Celebrimbor.In short, if you are looking for a beautiful looking game with a variety of gameplay options all wrapped up in a neat Middle Earth package this is the perfect game for you.

												While its story is unfitting that of a Lord of the Rings release, gameplay itself is supported by the unprecedented, engaging Orc system alone. Hunting down Orcs takes a whole new personal level with simplistic yet gory and satisfying combat mechanisms that revolve around diversity over adversity. Complement this with a tight and packed world with gorgeous effects, lots of side content and replay value that's nearly endless and you got yourself one powerhouse of a game worth exploring.

												Clunky and awkward keyboard and mouse controls combine with hyper twitch happy fighting gameplay. That said, the game looks amazing, and the is incredibly engaging. My first foray went 6hrs, of which I should have been asleep 4 lol. The story and gameplay engage you right off the bat and you pretty much immediately fall into a 'just let me get this one more thing done' mindset. The fighting mechanisms are pretty impossible to master, unless you take enough speed to dilate time, but at the same time, are simple manage to be simple enough to allow you to succeed in most combat situations.The nemesis system is easily the most interesting and frustrating aspect of the game. Letting an Uruk kill you two or three times can make them nearly unkillable, combine that with their frustrating ability to mob you with 3 or 4 of these captains all at once and it can get really obnoxious. Even captains that aren't anywhere near your fight seem to magically teleport to you. That said, it really helps to engage you and add to the satisfaction of finally putting them down hard. As icing on this rather delicious cake, we get to explore an area and time frame previously never expanded upon in Tolkien lore. In this the game offers several methods to increase the immersion factor, finding artifacts with memories bound to them, NPCs, even the wraith you're bound to. The player is constantly hit with in game conversation, and information. All in all this is one seriously damned fine game and can be equally fun and infuriating. DEFINITELY a worthy buy on a decent sale price.(I'm cheap I wont spend $50 on a digital copy of a game for anyone)			"

												I am happily surprised with how satisfied i am with this game. I'm not a Lord of the Rings fan at all, but just bought this game on a whim. It was the hype game of the month and i said why the hell not, and took a leap of faith, and it paid off ten-fold. I love it when i by a masterpiece on accident. The game's story isn't really what keeps me engaged, but it is compelling enough not to want to skip. The voice acting by Talion is spot on. The game plays like Batman Arkham City meets Assassin's Creed, and builds on both formulas both in traversing the environment and combat. Like in the batman arkham games, the combat is extremely simple with some extremely complex mechanics buried within it, that makes for an intriguing and addicting thing to get into. I know there are story missions, but there's just something about simply killing hundreds of uruks all day and all night that just loses me. The game runs beautifully too, this is by far one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played. It makes Tomb Raider look like an old Xbox 360 game. My only minor gripe is with Warner Bros and their blocking of posting content published by them on YouTube, but if you don't mess with that kind of thing, then that doesn't even cocern you. This isn't the most innovative game in the world, but it feels like it's own game. Despite it borrowing mechanics from other games, it borrows them the right way, taking what made them fun, and throwing some middle-earth spice in the pot. This hands down one of my top games of this year, based on my first few hours of playing the game alone. You know this game is a masterpiece within the first hour of play. For a game that i never even remotely considered buying until it showed up in my queue a few days ago, I'd say this was the most satisfying blind purchase of $70 (with the season pass) I've ever spent. Buy this game now. Saving up for another game? Who cares. Buy this anyways. There's a 75% chance this game will end up being better than whatever it is your saving up for. The best part is, you can tell this game wasn't intended to be as good as it is. It's ironic that we live in a world where overhyped games are just that, overhyped, while the ones that fly under the radar turn out to be some of the greatest games you'll ever play.			"

												I will say right off the bat, that I mostly play MMOs. Not many single player games can pull me in. The other day I sat down, turned on this game, and for 6 hours I could not exit. I didn't want to get off. I figured I should sleep so I did. I don't play it every day, but when I do I can't put it down. The Arkham series was my all time favorite single player game, but this one has taken that over. I am crappy at reviews but here ya go:First off, I heard the last boss fight sucks, that its to easy. I haven't got that far yet as of typing up this review. But honestly,  I don't really care. The game is extremely enjoyable, the amount of content for a single player game is awesome. The story seems to be fairly short as there is only 20 missions in it, but if you do all the side stuff, its very lengthy. Would I recommend this game to someone that only wants to do the main story and none of the side stuff? I would say No. This game really feeds off doing side missions, messing with the nemesis system  and whatnot. Building up your weapons, purchasing abilities, etc.. Its just all around a great game to get lost in.Speaking of purchasing abilities, the system is good and all, but almost 14 hours in I think and I almost have all the abilities purchased that is available. The only reason I bring this up, is because I think that its bad. It reduces customization options. What I mean is, it don't really matter where you put the points cause you will end up having them all anyway. Know what I mean? At this point I just slap a point in, see what I got and go on my way. I just love deep customization, but that won't knock points off from me.All around its an amazing game. Would I change anything? Honestly no. I do hate stealth and am TERRIBLE at it (terrible hardly explains it) but in this game its rather easy so far. It may get more difficult, I don't know, but its not a hard system in this game. Its very simple and straight forward. At this point, the Arkham series had harder stealth areas than this game does and I managed that one fine.Ok ending this here. Hope it helps out some, probably not :D			"

												Visually and vicerally stunning, and a lot of fun. Obviously simmilarities with other games like Assassins Creed and the Batman Arkham games with some RPG elements, but its very polished and the Nemesis system adds a bit of uniqueness. However... the story is pretty bland and perhaps its longevity is relatively short, but its good at what it does and has the key fun factor, slicing and dicing Uruks.			"

												Highly enjoyable, if a bit short.PROS- Very good, modern graphics.- Fun combat, similar to batman (combo and parry) but much smoother.- Fun exploration / sandboxing, similar to assassin creed but more natural and less repetitive.- Kinda original with the nemesis system. (Dynamic orc captains with varied modifiers.)- Nice dialogs. Never heard anyone repeat the same line twice, which is quite the feat.- Nice achievements, fun to pursue, all doable in reasonable time. None of those usual ""kill a gazillion zombies"" kind of mindless grind achievements.- Really nice polish and attention to details. The developers know what they are doing.CONS- Only about 30 hours, including 100% completion and getting all achievements (and quite a bit of fooling around), in fact you can probably beat this in under 15 hours if you are not a collector and just beeline the story mode. - The is a time / score race mode that can get you a few hours on top of that. But seeing as people are posting 500 000 scores while the max i was able to do is about 10 000, I conclude there is cheating involved so you can't really play it competitively, only see how you're doing compared to your friends.REVIEWWell, to me this is a mix of assassin creed, batman, Risen (the first, not the abomination that followed it), and dare I say it, skyrim. In fact this could have been a worthy successor to skyrim if it wasn't so short... I felt like they did a good job creating the overall gameplay, world, settings, creature and enemy diversity, and so on, they just need to have bigger areas and more content for this game to truly shine and create a ""must play"" IP.Value wise, it is a bit overpriced for it's length. I feel like 30$ or so would have been more reasonable, seeing as it is a lot shorter than games in the genre (their fault for claiming being an sandbox RPG, games in this genre go for hundreds of hours) and they seem to plan for DLCs which probably should have been included in the game to give it that much needed longevity. Highly recommended to grab this in a sale, but paying full price is not a horrible idea if you can't wait. I'd aim for the game + season pass for 50$, that would be a decent price for what you are getting.			"

Instead of a shotgun, he has swords and a bow and an Elven bro. Instead of playing in Australia, you're in New Zealand.

												In short, it's a great game. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and sword combat games. Obviously the lore in the game is much more interesting as a LOTR fan. The game is fun to play, the combat dynamic and the uruks (the main enemies in the game) in my opinion are as hilarious as equally as they are brutal at times. I personally can't think of many negatives apart from the fact that perhaps that sometimes the jumping and climbing can feel a little clunky at times. The game can also become a bit of a grind if you want to complete all of the side missions and grab all of the artifacts, but often this is the case with most games of this type.9.5/10 "

												tldr:  buy it.I've been playing games for over 35 years, ever since PONG!  I've played a lot of games.  Shadow of Mordor is one of the best games I've played.BUT ... when I started the game, I absolutely HATED it.  It was frustrating.  I didn't understand it.  However, the community gave me advice:  I was totally going about this game the wrong way.STORY:  This game, right away, made me care about the characters.  The characters and their motivations were very clear right from the beginning.Talion is a ranger on a quest for revenge.  Been there.  Done that.  But voice acting is strong enough to take a fairly cliche plot and breathe life into it.GAMEPLAY:  Best advice I got:  ""Killing all captains is not the goal of this game.""  The fighting is some of the best I've seen in a game.  I loved Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  This game feels like a more polished and more focused version of Batman combat.  It's on par with Sleeping Dogs.You can approach silently.  You can hack-and-slash.  You can hit and run.  You can snipe the enemies with a bow.  As your skills and powers increase, the game hands you more and more tools you can use the mix up the gameplay.  I loved running around a stronghold blowing up campfires, dumping broken walls on orcs, releasing monstrous beasts and generally creating all-out mayhem.I've never seen a game that gave me THIS many ways to take down an enemy stronghold.MISSIONS:  Story missions are focused.  NPC characters are varied.  Challenges are challenging without feeling impossible.  Collectibles are INTERESTING, and they alternate between completing an image and telling stories about Mordor.The story missions build up right to the end and the story-telling, from a technical point of view, is very well-done.NEMESIS SYSTEM:  This is where the game really shines.  Each captain is different.  Once an orc moves up to being a captain, it gets a personality.  As you kill the captain again and again, and he kills you, he changes, and his responses to you change.  The writing for the captains and warchiefs is first-rate.PROGRESSION:  I really like how the game starts you off weak and builds you into the most awesome super-hero in Mordor.  It was VERY satisfying to feel that progression.CONS:  There were two main weak points in the game.1.  After a certain point, the orcs would die permanently and I wouldn't have the joy of seeing the same orc come back for another round.  I wouldn't want to change the current style MUCH.  I'd just like for there to always be a few captain who can escape to fight another day.Likewise, after a certain point, I pretty-much stopped dying.  Now, I don't care too much for games that never let you progress to being really powerful.  I like feeling like I'm moving up in the world.  But it would be nice to have a FEW roaming warlords who would level up a bit more and provide a serious challenge at the higher levels.  I wouldn't like to feel COMPLETELY invulnerable.2.  The ending.  I felt this was the weakest part of the game.  Fighting the Five Talons of Sauron was cool, but the battle against the boss called The Tower was too easy.  I get above him, drop down with a stealth drain.I think it would have been awesome to make the player use as many of their skills as possible:  take it these enemies with arrows, brand these orcs, ride a carragor here, ride and graug here, etc.Likewise, the final battle with Sauron was disappointing.  I would have liked to see a bit more:  not necessarily a battle.  Just something more epic.3.  Once I had completed all the weapon quests for one of the weapons, it would have been nice to have more of a reward than a cutscene.  I would have liked to have had a special ability unlocked.That said:  these are small things for me.  Overall, I really came to love this game, and its one of my favorite games now.One final note:  This game has one of the nicest communities I've seen on steam, with a lot of people who are really patient and helpful.  I'm really impressed by that.			"

												At the time of writing this review, I am 27+ hours into this game, with 18/20 story missions completed, all character upgrades attained, one army almost entirely decimated, another fully under my control, all collectibles found, and a handful of slave liberation missions completed. If you enjoy high-octane action and adventure games that manage to hold up a good story, introduce innovative gameplay ideas, has amazing grapics, and performs well on the PC, then Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is the game for you.I have never been a massive fan of the LoTR series, so the story of this game was fresh to me (I knew not much more than the basics of the lore before playing) and strayed far enough away from the central plot of the books/movies while still including some major characters in the game. The story was not this game's strongest point, but it was still very good and kept me entertained until the game's conclusion.You've probably heard of the Nemesis system if you have done any research on this game, and it deserves the hype. It genuinely adds to the gameplay experience, and offers fun and interesting twists to the gameplay. Captains who kill you in battle will grow in strength, gain followers, lose weaknesses, and get promoted. Fighting them but letting them escape will make their actual battle wounds prevalent in your next encounter, as well as unique contextualized dialogue between you and the captain. Sometimes, just like Talion (main character), a captain that you have killed will come hunt you down and challenge you to a ""rematch.""The most amazing thing about the nemesis system is how it creates real digital enemies who you will grow to hate (or admire if you dominate them). Very early into my play through, I was fighting 3 or 4 captains at once. Having few special abilities, low health, focus, and elf-shot, I was barely managing the captains and horde of normal uruks. However, just before I was killed for the final time (I had a rune that let me go down 2 times before I was killed for good) I killed a captain, restoring my health to full. I then whittled away at the uruks as some ran away, and was down to the last captain. Unfortunately, he caught me off guard, and then a random spear thrower got me with a lucky shot and killed me while I was down. That seemingly unimportant level 1 character leveled up ~10 times just for killing me once. He became my nemesis, and after growing in power even more, I tracked him down and decapitated him after a long battle. That has been my favorite moment of this game so far, and it happens all the time with the nemesis system.Not only are the graphics fantastic in this game, but it also runs incredibly well. I am running a GXT 970 and an FX-6350, and while my GPU may be pretty solid, it is not quite the top of the line, and my CPU definitely has room for improvement. However, I am able to pretty much max out this game at 1080P and always get over 60FPS. I can't have the Ultra textures enabled because NVIDIA lied and the 970 only has 3.5GB of VRAM that is useful to games, but turning down textures a little bit to fit your VRAM needs will make sure that this game runs without a hitch, while some crappy console ports run terribly on my system even on the absolute lowest settings. TL;DR:Awesome game, tons of fun, long campaign and potentially ""infinite"" replayability via the Nemesis System, fantastic graphics and performance. 9.5/10, I am 27 hours in and plan to spend many, many more.

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game which takes place in the Lord of the Rings universe. It is set before the events of Lord of the Rings but after the events of the Hobbit.You play as a Ranger who was killed by Sauron's Black Hand, but was denied death. Your body is also host to a Wraith as you go looking for revenge. What I like the most is the nemesis system the game uses, which allows non-playable characters to remember the death of the game's protagonist and react accordingly. There's nothing quite like an Uruk captain or war chief taunting you about how he's going to kill you yet again. And Uruks that kill you get more powerful for having done so. And killing the war chiefs doesn't mean the enemy runs out of them, others will get promoted in the killed war chief's place. You can also set the Uruks up against eachother, issue death threats against them or poison their grog barrels and watch them turn on one another.The main story consists of 20 or so missions, but there are also tons of side missions. If you have all the DLC you get side missions with Gollum, finding out about the past and the forging of the rings. You get to ride magnificent beasts and stealth kill or simply mass-murder Orcs and Uruks. There are also side missions to build the legends of your sword, knife and bow. Some of those missions are easy, others are tremendously difficult. I also had fun helping a sniveling coward Orc named Ratbag become war chief (he did not survive in the end).Don't get frustrated if you get killed a lot early in the game. Build up your Ranger and Wraith skills and you will be fine in the end. I don't always play 100% of the main and side missions in every game, but in this one I did, and that says it all. This game is great, get it if you can. I got it on discount from a well known and legal Bundle site, including all its DLC. But even at its full price I would consider it worth it.10/10 will manipulate Uruks into killing eachother again			"

												One of the best and amazing RPG's i ever played ! It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.Acrobatically slaughtering Sauron’s ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jackson’s movies :DDD. Middle Earth: Shadow Mordor will look familiar to you when you start playing specially if you have an experience with ""Assassin Creed"" and ""Batman Arkham City"" that because the game is a nice mix between both of them. • With that great graphics and full of action gameplay I can guarantee a lot of hours enjoyable gameplay !!!! Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman – which is to say it’s amazing. Mordor’s take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that you’re almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what he’s doing and counter instantly. It’s extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though it’s kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, it’s great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know you’re there ;] ! At the end of the day you get an awesome open world game,with intelligent ai and really nice athmosphere,it's LOTR after all ! 10/10 !!!			"

IntroductionShadow of Mordor is an open world, fantsy RPG which has slight links to the LOTR films. Before playing Shadow of Mordor I was worried that due to me not watching any of the LOTR films (Please don't murder me for not watching them!) I would get really confused when trying to revise the story of the game. It turns out that there are only 2 characters that starred in the film within this game, so if you haven't watched any of the films don't sweat about it as you won't need to, in order to enjoy this game.CombatThe first thing I would like to congratulate this game on is its combat. Shadow of Mordor has the best combat system that I have ever experienced in any game, and i've played a hella load of games! Every kill you get feels badass, whether its an insignificant orc or a warchief, you will leave the battle feeling like your a cold blooded murderer. The executions that you can do after charging your hit streak are gorey, just the way I like it, and a selection of abilities can be equipped onto your bow, sword and dagger to give you that edge in combat. Even after completing the story, I was motivated to go around and just go on a killing spree just to get the satisfaction from the combat system.StoryThe story was fascinating to play through, but was too good to last. I would deliberately stall myself from playing the story missions as I was afraid that I would complete the game too fast, and even when slowly pacing myself through the game it came to an end in the blink of an eye. Even so, the story was addictive and lured you into the game. The story was enjoyable to play through, and i'm not going to give any spoilers, but the game ends with the same feeling that you would get when checking your bank balance after a night out. Disapointment. I get the feeling that the developers were rushing to meet their release date and quickly chucked a few cutscenes in with a crappy end battle and then thought bobs ya uncle. Saying that the intriguing story up until the ending allowed me to forgive the game for cutting it short whilst I was still flacid. DLCAfter completing the game I thought to myself, ""Oh its okay, the DLC will keep me going for a while."" I played through the Lord of the Hunt DLC and it had a similar mission to the main game, being that you had to assassinate all of these warchiefs that were killing little baby Caragors, which I could not stand for. I found this DLC reasonably enjoyable but having the same motif as the original game I kind of shortcutted it, and only assassinated the warchiefs, and didn't bother with all the collectables and slaughtering the other orc captains because it felt like a repeat of the main story. The other story DLC, The Bright Lord, was again similar to the main game with only slight modifications to the combat and a vaguely different story, leading me to bordom within the first couple of minutes when playing through it. I am interested in the lore of games and like to learn more about the characters, but the DLC was painful to play for me as I knew that the end game factor would be the same as the main game and the Lord of the Hunt DLC, making me give up on it rather quickly.GraphicsThe graphics have a hyper-realistic sense to them, and from looking at them you could not guess that the game was released in 2014, as they were made to look sexy even in the future. The game is also well optimized as i'm running this game on a Radeon 380 with a 2560x1080 display on high settings with anti-aliasing set to x4, and my game is running at a solid 60fps, so I will give the game props for its optimization. A cool feature that I picked up on was how the grass and foliage would interact with the player, and was a feature that I have rarely seen in games. The orcs within the game are all unique in their own way, and alot of effort has been made to give them their own looks, personality and fighting styles. You will be pushed to find an orc which looks similar to another. (Unless you compare Mogg and his twin brother lmao!). To conclude, I did love playing through Shadow of Mordor due to its awesome combat and captivating story, implementation of lore from the films, and progression system. I do believe that the story was rather short, and would have loved to have been able to feast on some more content, but it is clear that Warner Brothers games have done a great job in producing an RPG game with a rich story. The banter between Talion and Torvin where Talion will mock Torvins high by itself is worth playing the game for. #RoastSimulator.Fishykins rating: 8/10 "

												OK first let me tell you this, When I first played the game I thought to myself "" oh it's a copy of AC ""... after a few minutes of gameplay I realized how wrong I was, this game is absolutely great, the interactions with the uruks, the story which is absolutely captivating. And by no means, just because talion climbs wals and stuff does this make it a clone of a said series.  The game is standalone, breathtaking, filled with action, and so many COOL ways of dispatching your enemies and alowing you to choose your aproach. Are you gonna be all sneaky and silent? Or perhaps you're gonna be a badass who walks right through the gate of an enemy camp and just cleave your way through hordes and hordes of orcs?? Or maybe you like to snipe with a bow, teleport and quickly execute foes, or perhaps you will be the Bright Lord who commands his own army of orcs??? It's up to you really... there are ways to make the game very easy aspecially when you are nearing the maximum of your perks and upgrades, some of the chalenges are actually chalenging and some of the more elite Uruk captains are tough cookies... I actually met one who was imune to melee, ranged and stealth damage altogether, and it took me a few takes to get this MF down :D. the game also looks great and the story as I have said before is really good, Talion is not your average ""oh no I must avenge my familly"" sissy... no he's a cold hard killer of orcs and beasts, and where he comes short then there is the ""Wraith"", who is just as scary as the F*ckin Sauron himself... driven by hatred hard to imagine, also there is some history and lore about middle earth which I liked and some people didn't know about ( at least from what I gathered from comments and such :P ) and the best and biggest + in this game is that nobody needs to be save by the F*ckin Eagles!!! ( hate those things!!! so OP :D ) I was kinda dissapointed at the lack of the 9 but honestly the Hammer, Tower and the Hand are kinda F*ucked up in the head as well so no real dissapointment there... Honestly though, the game could have been a little bit harder, some of the skills you can posses are really OP like hell... especially with the right runes ( And no I don't mean the lame ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones you get from the DLC's)all in all... the game is great for any fan of middle earth and it's story... also except for the really nasty one... there are no prissy Elves so thank god for that ( F*ucken tree huggers :P ) so for me it's a big Recommend, and also......... ""It's time for a new ring"" :3			"

												Sleeper hit of 2014, I was really happy to see this game receive the praise and attention it deserved.  I am a big fan of the Tolkien IP and I was nervous this game was going to be another attempt to cash in on loyal fans purse strings.  I made an apprehensive day one purchase and could not have been more surprised by the quality and fun this game provided.  Shadow of Mordor is a mash up of Assassins Creed stealth approaches to enemies, with a lethal style of Batman combo combat.  One feature that I did not read in many reviews that I really enjoyed was going on revenge missions when an Orc captain killed one of your STEAM friends who were also playing the game.  I always made any orc who killed a fellow Ranger public enemy #1.  Of course as mentioned in every review the Nemesis system was a lot of fun and made my play-thru feel personal and special.  I am looking forward to seeing what WB and other developers do with it in future titles.			"

												I bought this game because it looked like an interesting concept, yet the gameplay got stale fast. It felt like assassins creed all over again; counter then attack. They tried to implement gameplay mechanincs that would challenge you to fight different bosses with different moves differently. yet all the bosses I fought you just counter or dodge then chain attacks, then use the execute. Very boring gameplay; I couldn't even finish the game.TL;DR: boring gameplay don't buy			"

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game which takes place in the Lord of the Rings universe. It is set before the events of Lord of the Rings but after the events of the Hobbit.You play as a Ranger who was killed by Sauron's Black Hand, but was denied death. Your body is also host to a Wraith as you go looking for revenge. What I like the most is the nemesis system the game uses, which allows non-playable characters to remember the death of the game's protagonist and react accordingly. There's nothing quite like an Uruk captain or war chief taunting you about how he's going to kill you yet again. And Uruks that kill you get more powerful for having done so. And killing the war chiefs doesn't mean the enemy runs out of them, others will get promoted in the killed war chief's place. You can also set the Uruks up against eachother, issue death threats against them or poison their grog barrels and watch them turn on one another.The main story consists of 20 or so missions, but there are also tons of side missions. If you have all the DLC you get side missions with Gollum, finding out about the past and the forging of the rings. You get to ride magnificent beasts and stealth kill or simply mass-murder Orcs and Uruks. There are also side missions to build the legends of your sword, knife and bow.

												Synopsis: Middle Earth is set in the lands of Modor set  between the Hobbit and LOTR telling the story of a man who has been cursed into the wraith world seeking the revenge for him and his familys death at the hands of Sauron's army.  Yea!-Gorgous graphics-Fluid and responisive comabt that is a blast to play-Nemesis system is awesomeMeh!-Average story-Once you unlock a good deal of upgrades the game becomes way too easy-Final two missions are major letdowns-The amount of hidden collectables is at just the right amountBleh!-Campaign is very short at about 15 hours-Enemy AI is extremely stupid, but this may be a intentional as Orcs are suppose to be dumb- Quciktime events involving moving the marker to the circle seemed very unresponsive for meLowdown:The combat follows that of Batman/Assassins Creed series, but at a more responsive state. You will not need to finish animations to get in that counter or dive out of the way of danger. It is a blast to play, countlessly beheading your enemies. While busting headfirst into the fray can be fun, you can quickly become overrun by a ton of Orcs, which could lead to death. But do not worry after a few levels you will be extremely powerful and rarely see death. So the best way to take care of your enemies is to pick em off via your bow from a distance or to stealth kill them. Stealth is extremely easy to accomplish, as you can  pretty much pass right in front of enemies from a short distance away without too much detection. This could be intentional due to Orcs being pretty dimwitted though by the developer. The highlight of the game is its Nemesis system., where foes that kill you will rise in power and level up to captains in Sauron's army. These captains will also taunt you every time they meet you recalling past moments of your battles in quick one liners.  There hasn't been a moment in gaming in a while that I was so satisfied to have killed a captain that had been endlessly harrassing me for ages. With a ton of enemy captains out there in the army with random strengths and weaknesses you could just spend hours hunting just them down. they even eventually will get replaced by new ones for your endless slaughtering fun.While I enjoyed the game there was just a few minor issues I had. One was the quicktime event where you have to position the left stick into a circle and press a button. I seemed to fail about 50% of these due to the fact that it seemed the icon moved to slow and by the time I got there I had no time to react. Upping the aiming sensitivity  seemed to help a bit, but still missed quite a few. And lastly the final two mission were extreme let downs, as they were nothing more then easy beat downs and quicktime events.Verdict: While the game has a few short comings, it is a blast to play and easly worth a purchase. The season pass is still debatable at this point if it will be worth it			"

												I really had a great time with the game.I feel that they successfully nailed the atmosphere and feeling from Tolkien's books.For some reason, the in-game save file time and the Steam playtime don't match (63 vs 55), but since I forgot the game running a couple times while I went to watch some Mentalist and stuff I guess it doesn't really matter much.I'd describe the game as a mix between Batman and AssCreed in its game-play, with some QTE thrown in for good measure and a certain degree of freedom in how to approach the goals to complete missions.I liked the sense of freedom given by the increasing unlock of abilities and runes for the weapons, which made the task of fighting a really pleasing part of the game thanks to how much more powerful the player can become overtime, going from having to flee if a group of orcs gang-up on you to fighting groups of captains and their bodyguards doable and fun.Fighting is where the game reminded me of Batman, with combos, counterattacks and throwing knives, executions or special attacks once the counter has reached a certain point. The AssCreed vibes come from the parkour abilities and the stealth part of the game.The game isn't really long. I spent 63 hours with it mostly because I kept playing side-missions instead of progressing the story initially and then going around killing orcs and playing in the power feuds part of the game, trying to gain more power to unlock skills, to get runes and to build my own army of orcs. This meant that I spent a big part of the game going around killing and getting killed for no other reason than my own fun, to get revenge for my deaths or the deaths of other players, to ruin the orcs gatherings etc... and I consider that a big plus for the game, since open ended kinda games tend to bore me after a while.Aside from being a fun game, Mordor is also a very good looking game, both in the in-game graphics as well as the cinematic parts. I felt a certain lack of AA though, but I'll say that the... gritty and sharp look of the game was enjoyable more than distracting.Music is another nice aspect of the game as well as the whole audio direction in the game. I loved how the name of a Commander would be chanted once he showed up and the Italian VA for the game was really good, with both nice voices and good acting.QTEs are mostly the only sore part of the game for me. More than once I died because I was pushing the stick in the wrong direction initially as I miscalculated the point where it would pop up and the QTEs made the last 2 fights feel quite anti-climatic, though everything else more than made up for it.All in all a fantastic experience.

												This game is great.  It's not incredibly deep, but the devs clearly chose the things they wanted to do and then executed wonderfully on it.  Progression is gentle and proceeds at the pace you choose, without having a meaningless tutorial that's separate from the actual game.  The graphics are _fantastic_, even on my relatively modest system (stock i5-2500K, Nvidia GTX 960, 16GB RAM, Win7 x64) -- if Steam's reviews supported italics or underlines, I would have used both to underscore how good it looks.  And there's a good reason it's known as the Orc Trolling Simulator: the Nemesis system of manipulating orc captains and warchiefs opens the door setting up to tons of amazing orcish shenanigans.If you're at all into Tolkien lore and want a game that will keep you hooked for a solid 20-50+ hours, pick this game up and have yourself a treat.

												Amazing yet repetitive game. Solid combat gameplay, amazing stealth and original captains and warchiefs mechanics. A flawless bug free game.But it comes to a point that it is always the same thing over and over again. Find captains, slay or dominate and so on. Also after you get the hang of it and get all the core habilities, the game gets too easy and pointless. I finished the main storyline and that's it for me. I don't feel motivated to complete the game secondary tasks and quests. I won't even touch the DLCs.Completing the story and playing around with this mechanic was enough and a nice experience overall. It took me around 20 hours. Recommended.			"

												I am going into this review with a decent knowledge of Lord of The Rings, having read some of the books, and of course having watched all the movies.STORYLets start off with the simple stuff, the storyline. Not only is it very short, it is very overdone, your family is killed, and you seek vengence, you gather an army, you make close allies, you go after boss. Just wish that a new twist could have been put onto this, or an original story could have been made. Not to mention, that once again, we are seeing more bland, unrelatable characters, alongisde our already bland, and unrelatable playable character of Talion. So sad to see this, honestly, I though that is anything was done right, it would've been the story. The Lord of The Rings series is so uniquely creative, and unfortunately, if your only knowledge of Lord of The Rings is playing this game, it could be a big turn off to potential readers/fans.COMBATTAgain, with all of Warner Bros. games, it is the exact same form of combat, pushing two or three buttons. Why do they do this?

This is just one example, but, Shadow of Mordor is no different. There is a huge gap between what is really going on on-screen, and what the player is doing. Talion may be flipping around, executing Uruks, but the player is only pushing a few buttons. The cool things you see on screen wear off after a while and the game becomes boring again. I really hope this doesn't catch on any more than it already has, and why it has become acceptable to have to do so little in games anymore really amazes me. The ""stealth"" aspect of this game is an absolute joke as well.PARKOUR/CLIMBING SYSTEM:Very unpolished, making it feel like a discounted Assassin's Creed knock-off, I wish they would have dedicated just a little more time to it, because otherwise it would have been decent. Often times Talion will not go where you tell him to go, or it will take him 2-3 seconds to even move from the position.Irritating when you are attempting not to be seen, and you unintentionally make him jump off a roof thus making him seen by all the Uruks in the near area.SCENERY/LANDSCAPE/WILDLIFE:Very beautiful game to look at honestly, the colors are so vivid, and the landscapes are awesome and pretty vast. The only gripe I have with the games scenery/graphics is that again, like all developers, they cater to console users, and all the cutscenes are pre-rendered. I really despise that, but I also understand that the developers are in the business to make money, not just to please fans, but this is going off topic. The Caragors, and Graugs and pretty cool to ride and kill, I like that feature, and for the most part, the creatures and wildlife are pretty lore-friendly. Except for the Ghuls, they were added for no real reason and server no actual purpose to the story, another useless feature that actually takes away from the story, and may confuse potential fans. That and not all of Mordor is a complete wasteland like this game may lead you to believe, but that really isn't a big deal.NEMESIS SYSTEM/OTHER GIMMICKS:The biggest selling point for this game is the Nemesis system. I cannot dispute the fact that this feature is pretty cool at first, but later on, you can tell it's really just a cheap gimmick. It gets old fast, and very tedious. Having to find and ""interrogate"" Uruks for information about higher-ups is very tedious, and repetitive, but doing this isn't necessary, therefore, another gimmick.The only real gimmick I enjoyed a lot is being able to possess enemies and make them fight for you. OVERALL RATING/OTHER COMPLAINTS/OTHER THINGS I ENJOY:What I do like about this game, which may seem contradictory, is the fact that you do have a choice of ""stealth"" or going in head on and taking out enemies. TONS of collectables, if you still want to take a shot at this game, you can definitely invest at least 100 hours into it if you want.What I do not like about this game, which I know will be controversial, but I personally do not see a need for it, especially in this game, is the inclusion of a mini-map. This game is supposed to be an open world, adventure RPG. With the inclusion of the mini-map, you are not able to take in all of the beauty this game has to offer, it would have been really cool if you would've ran through Mordor, finding pieces of the map after killing/searching Uruk encampments or other places. Would have made it feel a lot more survivorish and cool in my opinion.I really wish that they would just take out all mini-maps from games, I know this is the new norm, but I truly dislike them.I truly wish I could reccommend this game, but I cannot say that I enjoyed it very much. It will confuse newcomers to LOTR series, the combat is boring, and repetitive, the story, is boring, and repetitive... The games gimmicks are just that, cheap gimmicks.			"

												I absolutely love the game. Have not looked forward to coming home to a game like this in a long time. The combat is awesomeThe story is pretty goodGraphics are greatMy one and only complaint was that I wanted it to be more of a struggle. After a few hours you can take on armies by yourself with the game telling you to left click or space bar to avoid taking any damage. Even with though I hated how easy it became, it's my fav game of 2015 so far.			"

												It looks great, it runs great, it plays great...check this one out !If you take the Batman Arkham series, throw it in a blender with the Assasins Creed series, squeeze all the best bits of them both (Third person, open world, climb over any building or obstacle, detective mode/eagle vision, free-flow combat and lots of exploration),then add a new mechanic that makes it unique...The Nemesis system, Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor is what you will get.Every time an enemy kills you or flees from you, they will be promoted to captain and you will encounter them again. These encounters happeen at the most epic times usually when you are making headway in another fight against another captain leaving you with three choices:1 Run...♥♥♥♥ that, the combat is way too awesome to run away.2 Take on two captains at once, sometimes more will show up too, the longer it takes you finish them.3 If you die in a fight with more than one captain, they both get promoted.Combat is awesome in this game, and coming from a massive fan of Batman & Assasins Creed, I would have to say this is probably even better.It looks great, it runs great, it plays great...check this one out !Highly reccomend this game to fans of Batman Arkham, Assasins Creed and Lord Of The Rings.Check out my first impressions videos if you would like to see more:

I can only recommend this game. It feels like a really well-done mash-up of Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham series, offering an addictive combat system, many sidequests, an encouraging story and interesting gameplay twists, all presented in a solid and quite beautiful open world full of creatures, collectibles and other activities.If you're into open world Action-Adventures, you can't really go wrong with this one. -> 9/10 Additionaly if you're into the LotR-verse, you can learn quite a lot about geography, species and other Middle-Earth things. Nonetheless it isn't 100% lore-friendly. "

												His name was Skakuga Caragor Slayer. He bore full metal armor, a metal shield, and wore the head of a Caragor. All of his armor was adorned with the tusks and claws of beasts. We met in a small trench as I was chasing down another captain and was about to kill him. Skakuga came from a nearby stronghold bridge after hearing the screams of a fellow captain. Anytime I tried to jump over his shield, Skakuga countered me, anytime I tried to shoot him with an arrow, it simply deflected off him. Explosions and caragors only angered him. He was fearless, would never retreat. Obviously I met my match in that trench. The captain I was chasing was long forgotten and all that lay in front of was Skakuga, who was towering over me, ready to deliver a final blow with his Caragon-claw trident. But Skakuga did not kill me, he told me, ""You are not worth the nicks you left on my blade"" and walked off. I stood up, belligered but alive. Skakuga had been promoted for being able to tell me off. I was beyond enraged, I wanted vengeance. I advanced time and finally inflitrated Skakuga's stronghold. I decided to use guerilla warfare. I brought down Mogfly nests, set off explosions, kill archers, released caragors. I made that stronghold a living hell. Skakuga found sanctuary in a decrepit courtyard. From above, I jumped, ready for my revenge. But Skakuga was invunerable to stealth and countered me. He called about twenty orcs to help him and just as before, he told me off and walked away. I could not escaped, a grunt killed me and was raised to captain. My desire for revenge grew yet every time I met with Skakuga (sometimes, completely at random), he would nearly kill me and walk off again. Never I ever felt as motivated and driven to keep playing and killing enemies as I have in SoM. There are real,  real consequences to your death or humiliation. Captains become more powerful, harder to kill, and will remember every encounter. This game is amazing and I highly reccomend you buying it. P.S. ♥♥♥♥ you, Skakuga			"

												idk man i thought it was boring and repetetive and easy. I give it like a 4/10The nemesis system is basically a way for the game to craft bosses around you playing the game. On paper that sounds AWESOME, but the ball was really dropped with this. It basically just over powers the one orc out of the group of 30 it took to kill you and eventually gets that orc to a point to which it can only be damaged one way, usually like a combat finisher or something and also making the nemesis do tons of damage and be surrounded by enemies. Outside of the nemesis system this game is like a bad installment in the Arkham™ franchise. The stealth is WAY too easy. Almost to the point where sometimes you will think the enemies are blind due to you walking out in broad daylight 20 feet away from them without them noticing you (I guess crouching removes you from this plane of existence?)The developers were going for the combat system that the Arkham system devloped, and, in my opinion, they dropped the ball hard with this one. Don't get me wrong, the combat in Arkham wasn't overly difficult, but there were some some components to it that made it infinitely more fun than this. In Arkham, to master the combat, you have to get a rhythm to your button presses to punch, counter, stun, and dodge, whereas ME:SoM almost lets you go unpunished just by slapping the attack button and looking in the correct direction, save for a few special class of enemy. Also if you ever feel overwhelmed just run for 7 seconds in one directions and the enemies forget you ever existed!Also navigating this world felt boring to me. Honestly, I felt like I was walking through the same area over and over again. Like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't think I've ever felt this bored while playing a game.  Not only did the environments feel bland, boring, and repetitive, the parkour, while super easy to use, just did not feel satisfying. I don't know if it's the initial leap from running along the ground to running up the wall is about a 25 foot leap or that it feels almost to wonky to use efficiently, but holy poop it just felt so bad to me. They try to make it fun by giving you things to do between and on your way to missions with challenges. These challenges are ultimately a chore which devolve down to pick an herb or kill 3 of one type of enemyShadow of Mordor was a game that felt like it was going for an Assassin's Creed crossed with the Batman: Arkham franchise vibe. And in my honest opinion it felt like they dropped the ball in every category.tl;drCombat: Easy and very forgiving. Basically slap the sword button to win. When overwhelmed run 3 seconds in the direction of your choice to escapeStealth: Could not be easier. Crouch to go invisible is all but trueExploration/Navigation: Boring. the onlu incentive are these hunting and ""survival"" challenges which involve killing 3 of one enemy or picking 3 herbs.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a 3rd person Action-Adventure game from Monolith Productions, previously known for the excellent F.E.A.R. and the underrated Tron 2.0. In Shadow of Mordor, you play as Talion, a Ranger of Gondor stationed at the Black Gate. For those looking for comparable games, one of the easiest comparisons would be the Arkham series also published by WB. The combat sticks closely to that model, using a combination of strikes, parries and dodges to help you get the edge on your enemies. Those that have played all the Arkham games may find the combat to be too easy due to their familiarity, however there is the option to turn off button indicators which can make things a little more difficult. Another close comparison would be the Assassin's Creed games, which the overall map stucture and parkour system borrows heavily from. Shadow of Mordor manages to blend a lot of the good aspects from these two game series to create an enjoyable new adventure.The main innovation of Shadow of Mordor, and one we will most definitely be seeing in other game series in the future, is the Nemesis system. The majority of side missions in the game involves attacks on Uruk, and the subsequest consequences on their social structure. Regular Uruk are ruled by captains, who are ruled by chiefs. Every enemy captain you encounter is unique, with their own name, strenghts and weakness. They will remember their encounters with you, will remind you of any times they have defeated you in battle, and may even return from defeat to fight you another time. These can lead to some fun conflicts with Uruks who just can't stop coming back for more, each time showing new scars from previous battles. If a Uruk manages to defeat you, they increase in power and become more difficult to defeat the next time. The story is very enjoyable, especially for a licensed game. The developers did themselves a favor by mostly using characters and a time period not explored in previous work. They were free to thell their own story, which they did well. In addition, the events in this game tie in nicely to all of the other Lord of the Rings material. You will get more background on how certain events before the films happened, and you will also see some set up for things that you do witness in the movies and books.The graphics in Shadow of Mordor are remarkable. While I began the game with computer hardware that was beginning to show its age, the game scaled well so I could still have a usuable framerate while enjoying some of what the graphics had to offer. Upon upgrading my computer about halfway through my time with the game, I was treated to some amazing visuals and incredibly detailed characters. The landscape of Mordor is a little more varied than I was expecting after reading the books and watching the movies, but I am grateful that it wasn't all desolate wasteland.The controls don't stray far from the usual 3rd person action formula. I found them very responsive, and never did I feel like it was difficult to pull off a button combination. This game could use a few less QTEs, but sometimes it is the only way to show off a particular set piece.The music and voice acting is top notch. Fantasy voice work can get corny at times, but this game never felt that way.Overall, I completely recommend Shadow of Mordor, not only for fans of Lord of the Rings, but for everyone. While the gameplay does borrow heavily from the Arkham and Assassin's Creed franchises, it uses the best from each. Shadow of Mordor also adds a new innovation to the genre, the Nemesis system, which is sure to show up in other franchises in the future. The story is enjoyable, the combat is smooth, and the graphics are great. Play this game.Score: A			"

												Meh.Sure it is fun for arround 12 hours at normal difficulty.But basicly thats pretty low for a Open World Game these days.Most fun is, as advertised, the possibility to take over Commanders/their minions.But besides that?The quests are absolutely repetetive.The landsides do offer at the beginning a great view, but u shortly will crave for more.So ...besides it is in a good Sale, i do not advise you to buy it.

 Initial Thoughts ~2 Hours +Great combat, fun, thrilling, fast and violent. Easy to pull off great combos and moves.+Incredibly large amount of unique enemies+The captains/enemy hierarchy system is super interesting+The runes system, while basic, seems very rewarding.+Awesome stealth system, Wicked Executions.+Loving the voice work, excellent tutorial, and great freedom afforded to the player right from the get go.+Graphics are absolutely stellarDisclaimer: While I am lucky enough to have an outrageously powerful computer to play this on, I suspect it would lose some of its phenomenal visual fidelity on lower end machines. That said, I have toyed with the settings and even on medium it looks pretty stellar. As long as you can pull a decent frame rate of at least 30fps, it should be more than competent.I would 100% currently recommend this after 2 hours of play. Those that enjoy Assassins Creed, Batman Arkham Asylum, and Tomb Raider could find some great appeal here. Have fun. EDIT* 7-8 Hours play time.  Still thoroughly enjoying playing this. I am having a blast playing with the Nemesis system (I think that's what it's called) Having tracker Uruks hunt me down and being in the middle of a massive battle and then out of nowhere a rival Orc shows up to also try and kill me, it's really super neat. I have also been sent a screenshot from a friend of mine, he had avenged my death in his game somehow, had no idea that functionality existed, very cool. He killed a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Uruk that had killed me around 7 times after brutal battles.  EDIT* ~16 Hours Play Time I have noticed I have been spending large amounts of time just roaming the landscape and interacting with the enemies ranks, manipulating them to my liking and toying with the enemies. Don't get me wrong, the story missions are fun and interested and well acted, but maaaaaaaan I love screwing with these Uruks. Being able to mount Caragors and Graugs is pretty excellent too.I also have been pleasantly surprised by unexpected occurrences with animations. For example, standing above a Graug and raining arrows down on it, when it unexpectedly climbs the wall I was hiding atop of. Totally blew me away, same with the Caragors, they can reach places that I just didn't expect. Either way,  I am in a second zone that is much more green and lush than the first, and I am just astonished by how great this game looks. EDIT* ~25 Hours Play Time Completed 100% After 100% completion, I can say that this was one of the most enjoyable experiences I have had with a game in a long long time. Thank you very much to the developer for such a detailed and fantastically fun game.Final Thoughts:Pros:+Amazing Graphics+Wicked fun combat+Nemesis system is mind boggling and entertaining as all hell+Open world was expansive and fun to live in and discover+Great upgrades + abilitiesCons:-Getting stuck on a wall or ledge is frustrating occasionally-Quicktime events are nonsense (that said, I don't know the alternative for some of those moments)-The missions where you have to free the slaves are too numerous and repetitive-A broken achievement (you will obey) was a little frustrating.Conclusion:I fully recommend Shadows of Mordor as one of the most important and excellent games to play this year.

												EDIT: It should be noted that this review is based on my first impressions with the game and should be taken with a grain of salt.Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a well made game. It runs well and it is interesting from the lore perspective of someone who is a fan of the Tolkien mythology. So why am I not recommending a purchase of this game?Its boring. Granted the first hour or so was really entertaining, but the game feels very much like Batman or Assassin's Creed. I mean it feels shallow. Hunting down and killing the captains and warlords is fun the first couple of times you do it, but once you see that the slain are being replaced you lose the sense of progression. It feels completely pointless to go around killing the captains. The upgrade system also feels shallow. You get runes and skill upgrades, sure, but they are very generic and uninteresting. You can upgrade your health, stamina, weapon slots, and combos/special moves but you don't really get a sense of character development. From the get-go your character is a supreme badass compared to the legions of rabble trying to gut you. You don't really even need special moves/combos through the unlock system to feel badass. Just as long as you're able to hit the ""counter"" button and dodge arrows you're going to be able to take down enemies far outside the intended progression. I'm sure lots of people are really into this game. But I can't recommend it. Its too similar to the Batman/Assassin's Creed games to be worth playing through. It feels just as generic and shallow as the other games I mentioned and suffers from the same critical failure. It just isn't that much fun doing the same stuff over and over and over and over and over again while you are toted along the generic plot.			"

												This game is quality, real quality.The graphics are beautiful, the characterisation is excellent (especially of the orc chieftains and even the grunts), the architecture of the orc strongholds and scenery in general is outstanding but these are actually second to the gameplay.The fighting is its main strength and boy what a strength.  When you combine your ninja abilities with tailoring your planned attack against a nemesis or just a top dog on the to-do list, this is so good and I mean really good.  Especially when you get rumbled and have to make a sharp exit.The only detracting factor for me was that I found the game a little easy when you're powered up and found most fun and excitement at lower levels.That minor criticism aside this is still a 9/10Well worth getting.

												Take control of Talion, a ranger killed by Sarouns minions during the fall of the Black Gate. He has been ""Banished from Death"" by a mysterious wraith who will help him exact his revenge. The game is well acted, with Troy Baker nailing the main character. The story of revenge isn't entirely original but is made interesting with the addition of a wraith in the cast.The combat is solid, being a slightly dumb downed version of the Arkham system. The combat is just as unforgiving however and it takes some time to get used to the mechanics. Arkham veterens will, however, not find much diffictuly, but should enjoy the system for what it is.The highlight of the game, The Nemesis system, brings your enemies to life with unique foes that evolve based on your actions. They come back for revenge if you take them down and will taunt you endlessly if they take you down. It's a breath of fresh air that could have been a disaster.The game is a fantastic value. It took me around 18 hours to finish the main game with a bit of dillydallying.8/10. Worth the 50 dollar price tag, especially for Lord of the Rings fans. It is one of the best open world games this year and the best Lord of the Rings game of all time.			"

Shadow of Mordor Is the Lord of the Rings game you've been waiting for. Nice open world for you to explore, collectibles, challenges, side missions, upgrades and a nice skill tree.The Combat is really responsive just like in the Batman Arkham Series but with Gore and Decapitations.The Nemesis System is where things get really interesting. Fight or Help Uruk Hai Captains to weaken Sauron's army, by killing them or making them stronger for your command.Once you get a hang of it you can do a lot of cool things to change the way you can face your enemies.One of the best games of 2014 in my opinion. I strongly recommend people to give it a go.Pros+ Graphics+ Combat+ Lore+ Enemy Progression (Nemesis System) and RatbagCons- Story could've been better			"

												Middle earth: Shadow of Mordor, is in my opinion, an excellent game.I've enjoyed every part of it, and continue to enjoy it. I am currently 45% through the game and I've been playing for about 14 hours. If you love the Lord of the rings and want to know a little more about Mordor, this game is excellent for that; It's the kind of game everyone would want to 100%! Although it does have some issues, such as it leading me to think you can only be in Udun and Nurnen, which dissapoints me and the fact that it's quite unclear to me on how to 'brand warchiefs' without having to make millions of power struggles.I'd rate it 8.5/10 for these reasons, although if it's on a sale, it's really worth getting it (Or other chap games sites, I can't list any here but you know what I mean).

												""One Ranger to rule them all""Shadow of Mordor is one of the best triple a games i have played this year although it still has a few short comings such as there being a non existent ending, which leaves the story wide open for a sequal (or dlc), and secondly my biggest gripe with the game is the mediocre parkour system that often has you getting stuck on stuff and jumping to the wrong place. however this is all made up for with the fanatasic open world gameplay, the original nemesis system that keeps throwing something new at you at every turn and the smothest combat gameplay we have had since the first two arkham games. also through into the mix some intresting characters both new and old and you have a soild game that sady falls apart towards the end. however the positives far outweigh the negitives and the journey alone is worth experiencing.

												I normally don't write reviews, as normally people have already said what needs to be said about games. That is probably the case with this game as well, but I enjoyed this game enough for me to put my 2 cents in.I didn't think I would like this game. In fact, when I first seen that this game was another LOTR game, I was turned off instantly. I can only think of one other good LOTR game (personal opinion of course) as games that pull from this IP or any movie / book IP always seem to fall short on quality. This game is a huge exception.Watching the trailer I got excited. It really seemed like a solid mix of Batman / Assassin's Creed, and I love both of those games- at the same time it looked like a rip off. How could this game be mechanically better than either of those games? While not necessarily mechanically better than either, it is different enough from both and what they do offer as far as combat mechanics is satisfying and feels great.Stealth elements are not as fleshed out as assassin's creed, so don't get hyped over stealth mechanics. They are not bad, but the meat of the gameplay comes from the solid combat system which is where this game truly shines. When you enter combat, combos are smooth and flashy, and the system succeeds at making you feel like a true badass. That last point is probably where this game really hits the nail on the head for me. No other game lately has made me feel so unstoppable- so powerful and badass. I can go into fighting a hoard of Orcs right in the middle of a stronghold and have a blast just battling waves of enemies. It has yet to get old! The combat is something I enjoy with a passion. That being said, while earlier in the game it can be more difficult than later on, I do wish there were ways to increase the overall difficulty. The core of the game revolves around fighting Captains and Warchiefs which have different stats and abilities. The game gives you tools which can make fighting strong captains and warchiefs easier, but most of the time you can do the same combo to take them out. Sometimes they can block your initial stun, but then you just role over them and hit them from behind with your stun and continue your combo. Sometimes they can block your stun and block your roll over them. Then you have to start thinking outside the box, especially if they have the Combat Master buff. The truth is, once you unlock more abilities and skills, combat becomes more of a slaughter than a battle or challenge. I wish that there were stronger Captains / Warchiefs that were so strong that you HAVE to use their fears or other mechanics against them.Overall I would say that this game (FOR ME) is a no brainer. I would buy it again- in fact, I will probably get the season pass just so I can enjoy the upcoming DLC. There are not many games I go back too- especially in this day and age where I have 100 games to play and only time for a hand full of them. This game however, I will be finding any excuse I can find to play more of it. I have already beat the story mode, and I am now having a blast going through self made scenarios or goals that I make. Do I feel like killing every Captain / Warchief on the map? How about mind controlling all of them? How about I go get revenge on a captain who happened to get a cheap kill on me earlier? The story is really yours to craft, and that's probably one of the biggest highlights of this game. The Shadow of Mordor sandbox has all the tools you need to make your own fun. My last point will be regarding what the game calls the Nemesis System. This is probably one of the cooler aspects of the sandbox and truly brings a lot to the table. It adds a lot of personality to the Orcs, and gives every Orc / Captain / Warchief a little uniqueness and personality. Captains will remember you and mention past encounters you may have had. Orcs don't always look different, but there are certainly many varieties of Orc to keep it mostly random, and each have their own quirks that makes them one of a kind. It's something that I really appreciate, and one of the reasons I wish the game was harder. I hardly got a ""rival"" or an Orc that was too hard for me to beat. I would say there was only one Orc in particular through my entire playthrough that killed me twice, but that was before I knew you could upgrade your max health!Overall this game was completely worth it. I had a great time playing it, and I recommend it for those of you who enjoy the Lord of the Rings setting, and a good action game. The only true improvements I could think of is adding difficulty options, mod support, and more customization, but what we do have is excellent. I think many would agree.			"

												Easily on my Game of the Year list for 2014. Shadow of Mordor is a fantastic game adapted from an outside product. Lots of other movies/books/comics to games etc, tend to fall flat on their face with poor production and simply lack of passion for the characters to make a good game. And you can't help but feel like it was just a cash grab to profit from the hype at the time.I mean seriously, how many comic book/movies inspired, and other games have come out over the years and were mediocre at best? Shadow of Mordor does not fall victim to this treatment. It really feels polished with lots of little details that really give you the feeling that this is Middle Earth. The team working on this seems to have been big Hobbit/Lord of of the Rings fans making a game they wanted to play.If you've played games like Batman Arch or Assassins Creed, you'll be right at home here. There are a ton of little side missions, collectables, challenges, and extra distractions that add a lot of quality, not crappy fluff, but quality fun to the game.The Nemesis system is by far the coolest feature of the game and one of the most entertaining I've experienced in a  long time. With every win or loss in the battles against the forces of Mordor, there is a shift in power. And either you're growing more powerful, or your enemies are. Beautiful voice acting, graphics, gameplay, music, cutscenes, pretty much everything here is great looking and it seems unnecessary to pick on the little minor problems with the game.The only thing that I would say is a negative, no new game plus. But even then, if gamers wish for a new game plus, then that in itself is praise for the game isnt it? A number of DLC content is on the way and I honestly, can't wait. Few games have ever made me look forward to DLC content, and that says a lot to me about how much I love this game! If you're a fan of Middle Earth, don't miss Shadow of Mordor. If you love Assassin's Creed style of open word gameplay with lots of side content, don't miss Shadow of Mordor. If you want a fun new challenge with the Nemesis system, don't miss Shadow of Mordor!

 Killing Orcs Has Never Been So Fun! I have to admit I come into this game knowing nothing about the The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series. So the universe and the lores behind the movies or the novels mean nothing to me. I have to say, when I bought this game I did not buy it for the story, I just wanted a fun action game with tons of content and very addictive gameplay. I am happy to confirm I got what I wanted and it was more than overdose.The first thing I want to address is that this game was made by Monolith Studio who also made the popular WWE series. It is strongly portrayed in the game by the way characters walk, tackle and performing actions which is really cool as it work perfectly well in a game where the world is dominated by the Orcs. When a warchief is making an entrance you get all the lesser orcs chanting out their name making them look badass and you get the sense of satisfaction by cutting off their head at the end and claiming that epic rune.The game plays very smooth. It combines features from The Batman and Assassins Creed series but improves on the formula by having a deeper and better combat system, better stealth approach and wide array of interesting skills at your disposal. At certain point of the game I was actually really weak and was unable to defeat even an orc captain and was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about the game. However, as I dig deeper into the combat system and gained a few more levels I was able to finally defeat that nemesis that claimed my head countless of times. Speaking about revenge, the game introduced a very unique system called the 'Nemesis' system in which as player and time passes and evolves, the ranks within the orc army will also change. You soon learn that enemy AI behave extremely smart by roaming from place to place, killing superior orcs to gain power, dominate fellow orcs to earn an army and even ambush you when you were fighting other orcs. There will always be one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that always kill you becoming stronger each time and eventually raise in power to become a warchief. Furthermore, this system makes the AI memorise you so that the next time they meet you they come prepared with bodyguards as well as better equipments.The game was also very intense from time to time with some battles lasting way longer than 10mins as waves of orcs swarming in I find my self unable to escape or rather, the manliness inside me tells me to face them head on and after killing near hundres of orcs and gained a few powerful runes it results in a very satisfying warm little fuzzy feeling inside.After 20 or so hours into the game, the epicness is really showing as the world  totally opened up to you and you pretty much gained most of the abilities helping you to dominate the orcs in any situation. You can ride a caragor into battle and you can even ride a Graug to siege an entire orc fortress which was absolutely mind blowing. On top of this the game graphics looks absolutely beautfiful with very detailed graphics options. However, to have the graphics setting set to ultra high you will need a high - end pc to play it. When I was using a Razer blade with GTX 765m I can play on high setting with about 40-50 fps. With a Alienware m18x dual GTX 560m I get about similar results and with my desktop with R9 290X I can play on ultra with 60fps no problem. So it is fair to say that this game is well optimised. To top it all off, the game comes with a photo mode helping you to capture every moments of glory and it has many features that you can play around with to capture some really beautiful eye candy.Final verdict 10/10 I believe that this game is my game of the year 2014, as 2014 hasn't been a great year for gaming I think that shadow of Mordor really do stand out from the rest and it is packed with tons of content as well as delivering a satisfying experience to fans of the series or action game lovers alike.tl;dr+Fun combat mechanics+Satisfying orc slaying mayhem+interesting set of skills / passives+blend stealth with action really well+Gorgeous Graphics+Tons of content+Addictive and challenging-skins offer no new voices (Every skin uses Talion's voice)-Season pass doesn't offer much contentP.S. I have played about 30hours some were played in offline mode because I had no internet for a few days so the record on steam is wrong. within the 30hrs of game time I completed all the main missions, side quests (except killing all orcs), found all collectibles and learned all the skills as well as the passives.

												Just going to forewarn you, if you don't like games that you constantly die in, then this might not be the game for you. BUT THATS PAST THE POINT.Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a beautiful game full of immense stories and side missions, absolutely outstanding graphics, (might I add that the game is  THIRTY FOUR GIGABYTES!!!! The nemesis system is my personal favorite feature of the game. It combines frustration with extreme joy whenever you either lose to a really terrible enemy which was by accident or just lost, which is really frustrating, OR whenever an enemy you really despise gets beaten in a duel BY the enemy that you just lost to. You can pretty much climb ANYTHING between a pillar and 100 foot mountain. I have been saved by scaling rocks and such countless times, thats not including the caragor, the caragor makes it so if you're sprinting then well you can climb anything...Whats really frustrating is that there is no difficulty settings so you are stuck playing on 1 set setting. Hence my forewarning. This makes you either die a lot or makes the game a fun challenge and you die a lot which is a good mixture. With Arkham Origins, its really disappointing since the enemys are so easy to defeat but with the Shadow of Mordor, either you counter right or you die.I honestly don't see a reason to dislike the Shadow of Mordor. Although I would love to see difficulty settings implemented, I still recommend this game :)			"

												I have no words to truly describe this game.  Talion is more badass than Batman; that is all you need to know.9.5/10 (for the cutscenes which occasionally have aliasing problems)If you are on the edge of getting this game, take the plunge.  I guarantee you won't regret it.In my humble opinion, this game deserves to be the Game of the Year; but obviously most people will not agree with me.Also, please comment on this after reading.  This is only my second review and since my first was not well recieved I would like some advice on how to improve them.  I want to review some of the other games in my library, so any help would be appreciated.			"

												Top Tip:This game has an odd learning curve.  Initially it will feel fluid, natural, and simple.  You will quickly become weak and outclassed.  The trick is to do ALL the white missions you possibly can before doing anything else.  Use your points to buy rune slots and health upgrades.  And make sure to learn to block attacks using right click when prompted.Pros:-Graphics are very good.  There is also an HD texture pack but I couldn't get it to work.-Combat is fun, much better than in Assassin's creed.  There is a lot of talent and skill and even strategy that goes into taking out your opponents.-Being able to ""brand"" (hypnotize) Uruks, captains, and war chiefs over to your side is really awesome.-PC controls work REALLY well.  I commend the developers for figuring it out.  Your pinky will get a little tired of holding shift but their is no reason to break out a controller for this game.-Save system is totally automatic and competent.  Most of the missions won't last longer than 5-20 minutes so their isn't a need to save while in progress.Cons:-Music is too heavy to have playing in the background while you are hacking away at Uruks for hours.  Luckily you can easily silence it-IMO the story was really boring and I couldn't care less.  I enjoyed the LOTR movies and the Hobbit is one of my favorite books.  However, I'm not a big LOTR good.-The DLC that just came out makes you feel like you didn't get a full game.  Especially considering that their is no online play and the game isn't very long.  The story isn't very immersive either, so it doesn't have a ton of re-playability.Overall this game is fun and that's what really counts.  If you see a future version on sale with DLC included it will be a great value.			"

												This game...Oh my God.Hory♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It is the most epic thang evah,Who doesn't want to teleport into 5 orcs and kill them all with a wraith in amazing graphics and brutal deaths?It is an insane game, though the story is 10 - 15 hours, there is a lot of other stuff to do, brand all the Warchiefs/Captains etc.Besides that there are multiple challenges to complete, such as hold a bridge from constant waves of enemies for 3 minutes without letting a torch bearer through. With a 550 Mirian reward; such challenges really make you push for those 2500 upgrades, which I have one of. You would think that getting those upgrades would make the game too easy, in a way it does, but it makes it so much more epic. Before you were worried about those spear and shield guys, and those dual-wielders right? Not anymore, activate the Sword of Urfael and brand them all instantly and have them turn on the Captain and other orcs (who then get rekt).While it makes it easier with those upgrades it also gives you a much larger set of options to complete certain tasks and missions. No longer do you have to sneak about and kill EVERY archer before you go in, for fear of getting shot. Go around and brand a few then charge in and brand everyone with the ability, making it a 15v1 on the Captain :PThis game is amazing, after so few hours I still have a lot to do and cannot wait for the DLC's where you can play as Celebrimbor and the extra missions.

												A fantastic game that emerses you immensely in the game world. With solid Arkham style combat that contains brutally amusing finishers. The story is decent with a lacklustre end game boss battle which is a real shame because it had so much going for it. A neat feature about the game is the nemesis and orc system. The nemesis system allows orcs who have killed you or have encountered you to remember the past experiences you had with them. This also leads to the occasional orc captain who will return even after you apparently killed them. I can see how this could be annoying for some people but it ends up quite entertaining. The orc system allows orcs to interact with eachother in the world without your input, whether this interactions are duels or riots for power and domination, or a simple feast to increase the morale of their troops. All in all it's a fantastic game that truly deserves more attention. Not a masterpiece, but very deserving of a go. A strong 8/10 (I recommend you purchase the game on♥♥♥♥♥as it's very cheap there).			"

												""One Ranger to rule them all""Shadow of Mordor is one of the best triple a games i have played this year although it still has a few short comings such as there being a non existent ending, which leaves the story wide open for a sequal (or dlc), and secondly my biggest gripe with the game is the mediocre parkour system that often has you getting stuck on stuff and jumping to the wrong place. however this is all made up for with the fanatasic open world gameplay, the original nemesis system that keeps throwing something new at you at every turn and the smothest combat gameplay we have had since the first two arkham games. also through into the mix some intresting characters both new and old and you have a soild game that sady falls apart towards the end. however the positives far outweigh the negitives and the journey alone is worth experiencing.

												I killed this snidey low level uruk all the way inside his base sorrounded by his enemies. It was a glorious battle with me executing foes once in awhile to break the pace before they all swarmed me. When the battle was nearing its end I was felled and had to use the last chance mechanics to hoop the orc captain- and turn the tides in my favour! I stabbed him in the throat to rejoice at the fleeing orcs. But one of them threw a spear at me through his fear. And I died to this pale skinny minion.After the fight the minion became thurgag the pale captain and instantly became promoted. I thought to myself that I should get around to hooping him soon.So after fannying about I go back to the stronghold where Thurgag gloats at having hooped me before.And he kills me.and then he does so again on my revenge trail.He levels up each time He kills me and now hes strong enough to climb the ranks.he also learns ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skills from beating me time and time again.I actually promoted him to a high captain after dying a few more times through rage.Then I grinded.I murdered.I pillaged.Just so I could kill him.and killed him I did.Best gaming moment 2014 for me.Until to my surprise the ♥♥♥♥er came back with blues eyes and a ♥♥♥♥ off scar to say - YOU SHOULDA CHECKED WHEN YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!then I killed him again after a grueling mana un mano.I actually ♥♥♥♥ed my pants.Would go on this vendetta quest all over again.

												*This review will be lengthy, so please, if you want a simple review, scroll to the bottom.*This review will include the following:- Open World- Graphics- Nemesis System- Combat- Stealth- Movement- Campaign (No Spoilers)- Runes and Upgrades- CharactersOpen World: The open world of Shadow of Mordor is very well made and detailed. Stealth spots are easily seen and fit well in the environment. There is a fast travel system to towers you've been to. There are two different areas. One area is near the Black Gate, which is where you start, the other area has a lot of grass and beautiful scenery. Both areas, however, are absolutely beautiful.Graphics: With my R9 280X, this game was a candy store to my eyes. This GPU is not required, but it runs the game on Ultra at 60 FPS. Even on lower settings, the game is visually stunning. I cannot express my profound love for the scenery and detail that is worked into this game. There are so many different factors that contribute to the graphic fidelity of this game that I can't list them here. Long story short, this game is gorgeous. Period.Nemesis System: Besides my gushing over the graphics of the game, the Nemesis System is my favorite part of this game. This feature basically gives you an almost endless replayability. The main enemy faction, the Uruks, have a heirarchy of captains that increase in rank until they become warchiefs. The lower captains USUALLY are easier to kill and find, and won't drop very good rewards. There are some changes in this statement where the lower captains spawn with REALLY good qualities that counter your fighting style so perfectly, that you have to reevaluate your every attack. Some are immune to range or stealth. Some can't be scared off by a specific creature. It varies greatly from captain to captain, but they all can be quite formidable. When you kill a captain, that's it right? Wrong. Every time you kill a captain, a new one will take it's place, whether it's an already known, lower captain that wants to advance, or if it's a new guy that hasn't been seen before. Captains must be discovered individually, along with warchiefs. Warchiefs aren't necessarily super strong, they just are higher up. I personally had trouble with one captain that was in the second tier, and I killed a warchief in the first five minutes of being in his stronghold. If a captain kills you, or any Uruk for that matter, they will be promoted, or fight for a higher spot in the heirarchy. When you come back, they remember you and will  mostly mock you. Names are random and names depict what their unique personality is like. Some sing, some are slow witted, so on and so forth.Combat: I wish it was more than what I'm about to say. It honestly isn't very new or innovative. It's, click to attack, click to counter attack, tap f to execute, that type of stuff. Very much like Batman.Stealth: The stealth isn't really challenging. The Uruks are slow to detect, and have a bad case of tunnel vision. Hiding spots can be used to stalk Uruks. Cages with Caragors inside can be broken to release the hounds out. That type of stuff. It is, nonetheless, fun to play stealthily.Movement: Fast, and very fluent. The animation of clothes and weapons and all of the movable objects around you are so well done. Talion is very fleet, Caragors are VERY fast, and everything is satisfying to say the least.Campaign: The campaign is a good length, and is an interesting story. It is VERY worth it in my opinion, and it leaves you wanting more.Runes and Upgrades: The runes and upgrades are in depth, and detailed. They add a very interesting twist to the normal skills of a ranger, besides the wraith thing. All of your weapons could be extremely powerful, and give you bonuses for doing specific actions.Characters: All of the characters are well voiced and are well represented. They are interesting and varied, and will spark a fascinating intrest to talk to a character through their mission regularly. You'll soon find yourself playing the missions to talk to the characters. At least I did that.Here is my overall impression of Shadow of Mordor. The game is fun. Just outright fun to play. The movements and animations are pleasing. The nemesis system is just fantastic, and adds endless replayability and variation in enemies. Combat could have been better, but ended up being pleasurable. The characters and the campaign are both very well done and very engrossing. The open world is stunning and vivid with details and action to partake in. Overall, the game is a must buy. This type of quality with LOTR themed game? Come on, it's a no brainer. Any information I excluded in my summary here, consult the novel above this.			"

												Pros:+Good graphics (runs pretty good as well)+Nice scenery+Fun combat+Awesome animations+Fun mounted combat+Lots of sidequests and other stuff to do besides main quest+Decent main quest+All bosses etc are unique, giving the game better replay value+Badass cape physics+Great soundtrack+Fun talent and leveling up system+Large open worldCons:-Some visual bugs like rainbow textures (no gamebreaking bugs, a restart usually does it)-Repetive enviorments (same ruins everywhere, same animals etc) Lack of unique things to discover-Super easy boss fights (Finished them all on my first try), in fact so easy that warchief/captain fights are harder than the actual bosses-Short main quest-Boring/forgettable characters-Only two unique zones, which really rustles my OCD, either it should be 1 or 3+-Annoying Orc voices, every other Orc sounds the sameOverall:I rate this game 8.5/10! It's amazing and although I bought it on full price, I wouldn't recommend doing so unless you have money to spend. It's still an amazing game and I haven't had this much fun in almost a year!			"

												This game...Oh my God.Hory♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It is the most epic thang evah,Who doesn't want to teleport into 5 orcs and kill them all with a wraith in amazing graphics and brutal deaths?It is an insane game, though the story is 10 - 15 hours, there is a lot of other stuff to do, brand all the Warchiefs/Captains etc.Besides that there are multiple challenges to complete, such as hold a bridge from constant waves of enemies for 3 minutes without letting a torch bearer through. With a 550 Mirian reward; such challenges really make you push for those 2500 upgrades, which I have one of. You would think that getting those upgrades would make the game too easy, in a way it does, but it makes it so much more epic. Before you were worried about those spear and shield guys, and those dual-wielders right? Not anymore, activate the Sword of Urfael and brand them all instantly and have them turn on the Captain and other orcs (who then get rekt).While it makes it easier with those upgrades it also gives you a much larger set of options to complete certain tasks and missions. No longer do you have to sneak about and kill EVERY archer before you go in, for fear of getting shot. Go around and brand a few then charge in and brand everyone with the ability, making it a 15v1 on the Captain :PThis game is amazing, after so few hours I still have a lot to do and cannot wait for the DLC's where you can play as Celebrimbor and the extra missions.

												Just going to forewarn you, if you don't like games that you constantly die in, then this might not be the game for you. BUT THATS PAST THE POINT.Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a beautiful game full of immense stories and side missions, absolutely outstanding graphics, (might I add that the game is  THIRTY FOUR GIGABYTES!!!! The nemesis system is my personal favorite feature of the game. It combines frustration with extreme joy whenever you either lose to a really terrible enemy which was by accident or just lost, which is really frustrating, OR whenever an enemy you really despise gets beaten in a duel BY the enemy that you just lost to. You can pretty much climb ANYTHING between a pillar and 100 foot mountain. I have been saved by scaling rocks and such countless times, thats not including the caragor, the caragor makes it so if you're sprinting then well you can climb anything...Whats really frustrating is that there is no difficulty settings so you are stuck playing on 1 set setting. Hence my forewarning. This makes you either die a lot or makes the game a fun challenge and you die a lot which is a good mixture. With Arkham Origins, its really disappointing since the enemys are so easy to defeat but with the Shadow of Mordor, either you counter right or you die.I honestly don't see a reason to dislike the Shadow of Mordor. Although I would love to see difficulty settings implemented, I still recommend this game :)			"

												After playing some of the other Lord of the Ring universe based games, I can say this is by far the best. Such an immersive world driven by a great story and plot allows for a player to be completely swallowed into game playing endlessly for hours.The game boasts a lot of base content compared to many games with tons of side missions/quests, exploratory rewards and means to better yourself by learning game play mechanics or by earning experience and earning new runes!Graphically (PC - Ultra Settings) this game is stunning, with beautiful environments and fluent 'level design' I find my self often running around and taking in the world that was built. There is a fast travel system yet I never seem to use it, the map is fairly large, but not large enough to become a pain to travel across, especially with all of the various side content or a fight with one of the 'bosses' of the games, which thankfully are fairly common.SoM has a very much 'Assassins Creed' style of gameplay and is a must buy if you are a fan of those games, or J. R. R. Tolkien universe.The only bug bear that I personally have is I find games like this rather repetitive, this is the reason I stopped playing AC. As long as they don't try and milk this games style and universe it will be fine, but I would be willing to make purchase of a sequel if one does ever get released.			"

												If you are even slightly into Lord Of The Rings, then this is the game for you. After completing the main campaign (which is brilliant in itself, a really damn good story), I can safely say that I will continue to put my time into the side missions and other activities in Mordor.Extremely fun gameplay.Stealth elements.'Batman-Like' combat, which is a very good thing....and lots and lots of gore. The only slight issue with the game is the amount of QTE's, but that isn't a massive issue when the actual combat is as fluid and fun as it is.One of the best releases in a long time.9.5/10			"

												I killed this snidey low level uruk all the way inside his base sorrounded by his enemies. It was a glorious battle with me executing foes once in awhile to break the pace before they all swarmed me. When the battle was nearing its end I was felled and had to use the last chance mechanics to hoop the orc captain- and turn the tides in my favour! I stabbed him in the throat to rejoice at the fleeing orcs. But one of them threw a spear at me through his fear. And I died to this pale skinny minion.After the fight the minion became thurgag the pale captain and instantly became promoted. I thought to myself that I should get around to hooping him soon.So after fannying about I go back to the stronghold where Thurgag gloats at having hooped me before.And he kills me.and then he does so again on my revenge trail.He levels up each time He kills me and now hes strong enough to climb the ranks.he also learns ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ skills from beating me time and time again.I actually promoted him to a high captain after dying a few more times through rage.Then I grinded.I murdered.I pillaged.Just so I could kill him.and killed him I did.Best gaming moment 2014 for me.Until to my surprise the ♥♥♥♥er came back with blues eyes and a ♥♥♥♥ off scar to say - YOU SHOULDA CHECKED WHEN YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD!then I killed him again after a grueling mana un mano.I actually ♥♥♥♥ed my pants.Would go on this vendetta quest all over again.

												Middle earth: Shadow of Mordor, is in my opinion, an excellent game.I've enjoyed every part of it, and continue to enjoy it. I am currently 45% through the game and I've been playing for about 14 hours. If you love the Lord of the rings and want to know a little more about Mordor, this game is excellent for that; It's the kind of game everyone would want to 100%! Although it does have some issues, such as it leading me to think you can only be in Udun and Nurnen, which dissapoints me and the fact that it's quite unclear to me on how to 'brand warchiefs' without having to make millions of power struggles.I'd rate it 8.5/10 for these reasons, although if it's on a sale, it's really worth getting it (Or other chap games sites, I can't list any here but you know what I mean).

Shadow of Mordor Is the Lord of the Rings game you've been waiting for. Nice open world for you to explore, collectibles, challenges, side missions, upgrades and a nice skill tree.The Combat is really responsive just like in the Batman Arkham Series but with Gore and Decapitations.The Nemesis System is where things get really interesting. Fight or Help Uruk Hai Captains to weaken Sauron's army, by killing them or making them stronger for your command.Once you get a hang of it you can do a lot of cool things to change the way you can face your enemies.One of the best games of 2014 in my opinion.

												I normally don't write reviews, as normally people have already said what needs to be said about games. That is probably the case with this game as well, but I enjoyed this game enough for me to put my 2 cents in.I didn't think I would like this game. In fact, when I first seen that this game was another LOTR game, I was turned off instantly. I can only think of one other good LOTR game (personal opinion of course) as games that pull from this IP or any movie / book IP always seem to fall short on quality. This game is a huge exception.Watching the trailer I got excited. It really seemed like a solid mix of Batman / Assassin's Creed, and I love both of those games- at the same time it looked like a rip off. How could this game be mechanically better than either of those games? While not necessarily mechanically better than either, it is different enough from both and what they do offer as far as combat mechanics is satisfying and feels great.Stealth elements are not as fleshed out as assassin's creed, so don't get hyped over stealth mechanics. They are not bad, but the meat of the gameplay comes from the solid combat system which is where this game truly shines. When you enter combat, combos are smooth and flashy, and the system succeeds at making you feel like a true badass. That last point is probably where this game really hits the nail on the head for me. No other game lately has made me feel so unstoppable- so powerful and badass. I can go into fighting a hoard of Orcs right in the middle of a stronghold and have a blast just battling waves of enemies. It has yet to get old! The combat is something I enjoy with a passion. That being said, while earlier in the game it can be more difficult than later on, I do wish there were ways to increase the overall difficulty. The core of the game revolves around fighting Captains and Warchiefs which have different stats and abilities. The game gives you tools which can make fighting strong captains and warchiefs easier, but most of the time you can do the same combo to take them out. Sometimes they can block your initial stun, but then you just role over them and hit them from behind with your stun and continue your combo. Sometimes they can block your stun and block your roll over them. Then you have to start thinking outside the box, especially if they have the Combat Master buff. The truth is, once you unlock more abilities and skills, combat becomes more of a slaughter than a battle or challenge. I wish that there were stronger Captains / Warchiefs that were so strong that you HAVE to use their fears or other mechanics against them.Overall I would say that this game (FOR ME) is a no brainer. I would buy it again- in fact, I will probably get the season pass just so I can enjoy the upcoming DLC. There are not many games I go back too- especially in this day and age where I have 100 games to play and only time for a hand full of them. This game however, I will be finding any excuse I can find to play more of it. I have already beat the story mode, and I am now having a blast going through self made scenarios or goals that I make. Do I feel like killing every Captain / Warchief on the map? How about mind controlling all of them? How about I go get revenge on a captain who happened to get a cheap kill on me earlier? The story is really yours to craft, and that's probably one of the biggest highlights of this game. The Shadow of Mordor sandbox has all the tools you need to make your own fun. My last point will be regarding what the game calls the Nemesis System. This is probably one of the cooler aspects of the sandbox and truly brings a lot to the table. It adds a lot of personality to the Orcs, and gives every Orc / Captain / Warchief a little uniqueness and personality. Captains will remember you and mention past encounters you may have had. Orcs don't always look different, but there are certainly many varieties of Orc to keep it mostly random, and each have their own quirks that makes them one of a kind. It's something that I really appreciate, and one of the reasons I wish the game was harder. I hardly got a ""rival"" or an Orc that was too hard for me to beat. I would say there was only one Orc in particular through my entire playthrough that killed me twice, but that was before I knew you could upgrade your max health!Overall this game was completely worth it. I had a great time playing it, and I recommend it for those of you who enjoy the Lord of the Rings setting, and a good action game. The only true improvements I could think of is adding difficulty options, mod support, and more customization, but what we do have is excellent. I think many would agree.			"

												Like Lotr? If not, then why are you looking at this reveiw? Many people say Shadow of Mordor is just a re-skin of a Batman Arkham game. That's because it was supposed to be a batman game, but obviously it isn't. Why do I say this? Because the combat is exactly like Batman and Assassin's Creed, but Shadow of Mordor is much bloodier. It is set after the Hobbit and before Lotr, and without giving away too much, has a dark and brutal but fun story which fits in with Tolkien's lore very nicely. There are also two great maps to explore, tons of abilities, side missions and collectables to keep you entertained. If you're a Tolkien fan like me then definately give this amazing game a go.			"

												I played this game with everything maxed except high shadows and textures (3GB gfx card), but I improved visuals further  with SMAA/Lumasharpen forced through SweetFX configurator since there is no AA option in game, I got a steady 80-100 fps and the game looks great. The game benchmark averages 99 fps.

												First of all ı'm a big Lord of the Rings fan but this is game is not much relevant to it. Maybe..yes you see gollum a couple times and learn better about Sauron and his supporters. Story 9.5/10 : In the begining (let's not give some spoilers) you get a little sentimental ..erhmm maybe couple tears.. then you know why you kill thousands of uruks and orcs for no reason. In the begining of the story you get some kind of corrupt from and elf and you live with him. The elf (Celebrimbor) has his own special moves and a bow. Long story short the story is great but it could have been little longer.Gameplay 9/10 : Game is based on a system where there is from lower rank to higher , standart uruks-the ones with the shields-berserkers-captain-master captain exc..-Warchiefs. In the esc menu you can see a ranking of the captains and chieftains. But first you need to learn some intel about them from the one less ranked soldier, for exp ıf you want to learn something about chieftain , you need to interrogate the captain and if you want to learn something about captain , you must interrogate a standart uruk. After you learn their location you go to kill them. Its almost easy to kill every captain but ıf you die one of them, they get stronger, maybe even promote. But the chieftains is hard to kill. When you go the place where they rest in the map. They wont show up at the first place. At first you must complete some kind of little game. exp : kill this , this and that guy , so the chieftain show up. You have 3 weapons at total. A sword which you can use to kill the uruks in combat and execute them. An arrow , you can only use your arrow when you're in elf mode, you dont have a quiver but when you drain a uruks life. It will give you 4 arrows. A dagger , which will help you to kill enemies from the behind below or above. Dagger is most used for sneaky attacks, and its deadly for standart uruks and gives extra damage to the captains and chieftains. The game has a level system , where you can upgrade your weapons, your hero or the elf side of yours. Also game is a little bit like Assassins Creed because , your jumps, running style , and free-style parkour runs in the castles is a little bit similar to it.Atmosphere and Map 7/10 : The biggest lost in our list is map. The map is pretty big..yes..but it doesnt contain much stuff in it. Yeah , there are castles. mountains. uruk camps exc.exc. But after some point its monotone. Same stuff all over it. The atmosphere is good , it reflects the middle earth as it is, relevant to wasteland because uruks burn the tree's and stuff.Total 8.5/10 : In total game is worth it's money for the storyline and gameplay and gives you slightly 30-40 hours of fun with couple of dlc's . Whether you're a LOTR fan or not you must try this one.Thank you Monolith productions :)			"

It captures the combat experience from the movies in a way I would have thought impossible. The added bonus in being able to manipulate the enemy captains and other leaders was just that much more fun. If you\'re looking for some fun hack and slash carnage I\'d recommend this game.			"

												Can't stop playing. The best Middle-Earth \ Lord of the Rings themed game out there so far.Nemesis system adds very unique aspect into gameplay. Uruk captains and warchiefs are generated every time you kill them or when they are fighting each other to advance in ranks and take over place of their leaders. Each has his own personality, weakneses, strengths. It adds tons of replayability. Not to mention you can dominate uruk minds and send them to fight each other, thus you can build an army of your own uruks. I branded an uruk captain and made him a bodyguard of a warchief by sending mine to kill his bodyguard in duel, then I sent him to betray warchief. And there is more to Nemesis system, it is but a glimpse of this deeply elaborated system. The combat system is very decent.The story is very fitting and lore-wise, even if it is short, the quality of main missions is very high. There is much to do without story, even after completing it, you can continue to take out uruk captains/warchiefs and explore collecting artifcats, runes.The world map is big enough to explore hours and hours. I believe Monolith will add new regions of Mordor beside Udûn and Sea of Núrnen once a DLC comes out (hoping to visit Plateau of Gorgoroth and Morgul Vale someday).And there is this feel and immersion. The feel you are in Mordor and Middle-Earth.			"

												Absolutely brilliant game that does a service to the Franchise. The visuals,game play,sstory and mechanics are all fun and rewarding. My only problem with the game is the controls for the PC. The controls would work for a game with slower action,but due to the fact,you need to react fast,combat can be clunky and  difficult to master. Sometimes due to the difference in parkour and fight mechanics,escaping a battle can be damn near impossible if sorrounded by enough enemies. So perhaps a controller for PC is the way to go. Aside from that the game is a classic.			"

I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun adventure through a gorgeous world.PS: Be wary of downloading on low-end systems! This game requires a heavy duty card to run smoothly. My AMD R9 290 just grabs the ULTRA settings, but I do not recommend on a low-end system. Also, its over 40GB after install, so have fun downloading!			"

Combat Pros: Whether you choose stealth or the walking mayhem approach You always feel like a powerful combatant. Arkham esque. Brutally violent. Every execution could be it's own Slayer album cover.Combat Cons: After several hours of playing it can become a bit dull and repeatative.----Story Pros: It's brief and unobtrusive. Often in games that let you choose your playstyle the story parts have your character doing things that you've avoided doing for hours of gameplay. (in farcry 3 I played very stealthy and yet in every cut scene this kid was running around screaming his head off like an idiot)Story Cons: The story is generic and kind of flat. Which isn't to say it's bad but some people may be expecting a lotro/hobbit epic adventure and it's not really that.----Why should I not just wait until this game is $10 on steam sale?: Quite simply, the world they created is stunning. The Nemesis system is by far one of the single most interesting mechanics added to the Assassins Credd/Batman games since they added boats to the Assassins Creed series. I completed the game in just over the minimum completion time which is not a feat by any means but what is impressive is that after I did that I spent the next 5 hours watching how the nemesis system played out. Sometimes I would kill my own guys to create a power vaccum just to see who took over. It's truly fascinating. Sometimes you'll find a weird little Orc that you just have to back in their power play because they're such a weird dude. When one guy kills you it beccomes a personal vendetta. Unlike quick time events I hope the Nemesis gets picked up by every game maker because it just helps give the player a vested interest in the world they occupy.			"

												I'm sure you've heard this about, but this game plays very much like a combination of Assassin's Creed and Batman. So if you're a fan of these games, I would definitely recommend this game to you. Gameplay is very smooth, and a bit hectic at times. Many times I have been caught fighting 30+ Uruk and 3+ Captains because I charged in head on, not scouting the area first.Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8.5/10. A very fun game to play, with a great new mechanic in the Nemesis system, one of the more inovative things to come out of this game			"

												Generally I find ""open-world"" game design to be a crutch-- an excuse for not designing any good levels or writing any decent content. With Shadow of Mordor, the game's core concept wouldn't work in any kind of linear construct. It's the only game I've seen that actually makes positive use of the open-world concept.The fighting system is basically the same as any of the Batman: Arkham games. It gets it right, though; stringing together the combos and prioritizing targets is fun and addictive. The combat is entertaining and works just fine with a mouse and keyboard.There is a traditional main line of quests, but for the most part these serve as tutorials for doing the real work of the game, which is trying to gain control of the army of Orcs by interfering in their political struggles in ways that benefit your plans. And they really are your plans, not ones the game has fed to you; you have to get control of a captain and set him up for success by helping him cheat at duels, gain prestige by throwing good parties, and so on.Another amazing feature of this game that I haven't seen nearly enough about in the gaming press is the facial expression engine. Orcs look angry, confused, and utterly terrified in the most convincing ways. It's a small thing that has an emotional impact that isn't immediately obvious and simple. Bravo for this.As for problems, I only really noticed two. First of all the environments are boring. It's all just the same decaying stone buildings, mud, and scraggly plants. I realize it's supposed to be Mordor, but I still feel they could have worked harder at this, maybe by varying the architecture, putting more wildlife that isn't caragors and graugs, adding a swamp, or whatever. There's no real excuse for how identical everything looks.Secondly, I get stuck a lot on weird little jutting pieces of the wall or tiny rocks I should be able to easily step over. The fact that I can climb a 100-foot tower by walking next to it and pressing spacebar, but get stuck on tiny rocks the size of a baseball is maddening. It is an intermittent problem, but it crops up just enough to be irritating.In the end, it's a really fun game about a guy with cool super powers killing a lot of Orcs in fun ways. It has unique gameplay mechanics, a solid enough story, visceral violence, and no god damn crafting system. Buy it and play it. It's worth it.			"

Posted: October 2, 2014
												So I’ve put about 40 hours in the game thus far, it says I am 53% through the game. Now I’m not one for doing a lot of side quests, but this game is just so amazing there is a real incentive to do everything in the game, you find yourself running around collecting artifacts listening to memories and freeing the slaves. You find yourself going out of your way to save slaves. The enemies have some real context, they feel real. When you are slain he becomes a captain and can become more powerful. You’ll find yourself scouring the countryside for these captains to get your vengeance, and sometimes he will even kill you again, make that eventual victory even more potent. You’ll find yourself just killing off captains. There is so much to do in this game, and all of it stays fresh from the runes you get and the abilities you unlock really makes this game a fairly unique experience even though its mechanics are shared with the Batman and Assassins Creed series. Unlike those games this game gives you a real reason to do all the content in the games and get completely lost in them. Music: Ok, I’ve never felt more epic in a video game. When you are facing captains or are locked in an epic battle, the music starts taking cues from what you are doing on screen. You will punch a captain and the trumpets will start blaring and makes a string of combos feel more cinematic. Graphics: I haven’t had a single issue running this game and boy does it look amazing, I am running everything on ultra, it’s nice to see how far the lithtech engine has come from the days of F.E.A.R.. I’ve had a few issues where some U/I would disappear making it hard to complete some missions where I just had to quit and restart the game. Controls: This game feels very much like batman with the sword fighting. But I believe it feels much more fluid in this game and as you unlock more moves and finishers in the game the more fluid it becomes. I am playing with an xbox 360 controller and I felt a bit limited. I’d be using the bow and ill be using my right index finger to pull the bow and find myself needing to hit the right bumper to shoot a fire arrow which took some finger acrobatics. NOW I did have some issues with the way the game handled navigating the world, sometimes I wouldn’t jump a wall when I should have been which could get annoying when you are trying to evade enemies. Also sometimes the screen will tell you to push a button to do an action and the game will do a completely different action when you press the button, which can really suck when you are trying to jump down but instead you jump on top of someone in the middle of a pack of Uruks. But these minor control issues don’t make the game any less enjoyable.Story: Play it, there are a ton of great characters and well-acted dialogue. The word is even enriched by the enemy soldiers when you are sneaking around and you hear them talking about you as your legend grows.	There isn’t too many bad things about this game. I still haven’t beaten the story, so I will update this review when I have completed it. But for now this is very much worth every penny and I have to recommend it to everyone even if you aren’t a fan of Lord of the Rings, I think this game has something to offer everyone.			"

												""One Ranger to rule them all""Shadow of Mordor is one of the best triple a games i have played this year although it still has a few short comings such as there being a non existent ending, which leaves the story wide open for a sequal (or dlc), and secondly my biggest gripe with the game is the mediocre parkour system that often has you getting stuck on stuff and jumping to the wrong place. however this is all made up for with the fanatasic open world gameplay, the original nemesis system that keeps throwing something new at you at every turn and the smothest combat gameplay we have had since the first two arkham games. also through into the mix some intresting characters both new and old and you have a soild game that sady falls apart towards the end. however the positives far outweigh the negitives and the journey alone is worth experiencing.

												Just going to forewarn you, if you don't like games that you constantly die in, then this might not be the game for you. BUT THATS PAST THE POINT.Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a beautiful game full of immense stories and side missions, absolutely outstanding graphics, (might I add that the game is  THIRTY FOUR GIGABYTES!!!! The nemesis system is my personal favorite feature of the game. It combines frustration with extreme joy whenever you either lose to a really terrible enemy which was by accident or just lost, which is really frustrating, OR whenever an enemy you really despise gets beaten in a duel BY the enemy that you just lost to. You can pretty much climb ANYTHING between a pillar and 100 foot mountain. I have been saved by scaling rocks and such countless times, thats not including the caragor, the caragor makes it so if you're sprinting then well you can climb anything...Whats really frustrating is that there is no difficulty settings so you are stuck playing on 1 set setting. Hence my forewarning. This makes you either die a lot or makes the game a fun challenge and you die a lot which is a good mixture. With Arkham Origins, its really disappointing since the enemys are so easy to defeat but with the Shadow of Mordor, either you counter right or you die.I honestly don't see a reason to dislike the Shadow of Mordor. Although I would love to see difficulty settings implemented, I still recommend this game :)			"

												This game...Oh my God.Hory♥♥♥♥♥♥♥It is the most epic thang evah,Who doesn't want to teleport into 5 orcs and kill them all with a wraith in amazing graphics and brutal deaths?It is an insane game, though the story is 10 - 15 hours, there is a lot of other stuff to do, brand all the Warchiefs/Captains etc.Besides that there are multiple challenges to complete, such as hold a bridge from constant waves of enemies for 3 minutes without letting a torch bearer through. With a 550 Mirian reward; such challenges really make you push for those 2500 upgrades, which I have one of. You would think that getting those upgrades would make the game too easy, in a way it does, but it makes it so much more epic. Before you were worried about those spear and shield guys, and those dual-wielders right? Not anymore, activate the Sword of Urfael and brand them all instantly and have them turn on the Captain and other orcs (who then get rekt).While it makes it easier with those upgrades it also gives you a much larger set of options to complete certain tasks and missions. No longer do you have to sneak about and kill EVERY archer before you go in, for fear of getting shot. Go around and brand a few then charge in and brand everyone with the ability, making it a 15v1 on the Captain :PThis game is amazing, after so few hours I still have a lot to do and cannot wait for the DLC's where you can play as Celebrimbor and the extra missions.

												Easily on my Game of the Year list for 2014. Shadow of Mordor is a fantastic game adapted from an outside product. Lots of other movies/books/comics to games etc, tend to fall flat on their face with poor production and simply lack of passion for the characters to make a good game. And you can't help but feel like it was just a cash grab to profit from the hype at the time.I mean seriously, how many comic book/movies inspired, and other games have come out over the years and were mediocre at best? Shadow of Mordor does not fall victim to this treatment. It really feels polished with lots of little details that really give you the feeling that this is Middle Earth. The team working on this seems to have been big Hobbit/Lord of of the Rings fans making a game they wanted to play.If you've played games like Batman Arch or Assassins Creed, you'll be right at home here. There are a ton of little side missions, collectables, challenges, and extra distractions that add a lot of quality, not crappy fluff, but quality fun to the game.The Nemesis system is by far the coolest feature of the game and one of the most entertaining I've experienced in a  long time. With every win or loss in the battles against the forces of Mordor, there is a shift in power. And either you're growing more powerful, or your enemies are. Beautiful voice acting, graphics, gameplay, music, cutscenes, pretty much everything here is great looking and it seems unnecessary to pick on the little minor problems with the game.The only thing that I would say is a negative, no new game plus. But even then, if gamers wish for a new game plus, then that in itself is praise for the game isnt it? A number of DLC content is on the way and I honestly, can't wait. Few games have ever made me look forward to DLC content, and that says a lot to me about how much I love this game! If you're a fan of Middle Earth, don't miss Shadow of Mordor. If you love Assassin's Creed style of open word gameplay with lots of side content, don't miss Shadow of Mordor. If you want a fun new challenge with the Nemesis system, don't miss Shadow of Mordor!

Posted: December 30, 2014
 Killing Orcs Has Never Been So Fun! I have to admit I come into this game knowing nothing about the The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series. So the universe and the lores behind the movies or the novels mean nothing to me. I have to say, when I bought this game I did not buy it for the story, I just wanted a fun action game with tons of content and very addictive gameplay. I am happy to confirm I got what I wanted and it was more than overdose.The first thing I want to address is that this game was made by Monolith Studio who also made the popular WWE series. It is strongly portrayed in the game by the way characters walk, tackle and performing actions which is really cool as it work perfectly well in a game where the world is dominated by the Orcs. When a warchief is making an entrance you get all the lesser orcs chanting out their name making them look badass and you get the sense of satisfaction by cutting off their head at the end and claiming that epic rune.The game plays very smooth. It combines features from The Batman and Assassins Creed series but improves on the formula by having a deeper and better combat system, better stealth approach and wide array of interesting skills at your disposal. At certain point of the game I was actually really weak and was unable to defeat even an orc captain and was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about the game. However, as I dig deeper into the combat system and gained a few more levels I was able to finally defeat that nemesis that claimed my head countless of times. Speaking about revenge, the game introduced a very unique system called the 'Nemesis' system in which as player and time passes and evolves, the ranks within the orc army will also change. You soon learn that enemy AI behave extremely smart by roaming from place to place, killing superior orcs to gain power, dominate fellow orcs to earn an army and even ambush you when you were fighting other orcs. There will always be one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that always kill you becoming stronger each time and eventually raise in power to become a warchief. Furthermore, this system makes the AI memorise you so that the next time they meet you they come prepared with bodyguards as well as better equipments.The game was also very intense from time to time with some battles lasting way longer than 10mins as waves of orcs swarming in I find my self unable to escape or rather, the manliness inside me tells me to face them head on and after killing near hundres of orcs and gained a few powerful runes it results in a very satisfying warm little fuzzy feeling inside.After 20 or so hours into the game, the epicness is really showing as the world  totally opened up to you and you pretty much gained most of the abilities helping you to dominate the orcs in any situation. You can ride a caragor into battle and you can even ride a Graug to siege an entire orc fortress which was absolutely mind blowing. On top of this the game graphics looks absolutely beautfiful with very detailed graphics options. However, to have the graphics setting set to ultra high you will need a high - end pc to play it. When I was using a Razer blade with GTX 765m I can play on high setting with about 40-50 fps. With a Alienware m18x dual GTX 560m I get about similar results and with my desktop with R9 290X I can play on ultra with 60fps no problem. So it is fair to say that this game is well optimised. To top it all off, the game comes with a photo mode helping you to capture every moments of glory and it has many features that you can play around with to capture some really beautiful eye candy.Final verdict 10/10 I believe that this game is my game of the year 2014, as 2014 hasn't been a great year for gaming I think that shadow of Mordor really do stand out from the rest and it is packed with tons of content as well as delivering a satisfying experience to fans of the series or action game lovers alike.tl;dr+Fun combat mechanics+Satisfying orc slaying mayhem+interesting set of skills / passives+blend stealth with action really well+Gorgeous Graphics+Tons of content+Addictive and challenging-skins offer no new voices (Every skin uses Talion's voice)-Season pass doesn't offer much contentP.S. I have played about 30hours some were played in offline mode because I had no internet for a few days so the record on steam is wrong. within the 30hrs of game time I completed all the main missions, side quests (except killing all orcs), found all collectibles and learned all the skills as well as the passives.

												While there weren't a ton of good games that came out in 2014, this one has to be the best. I hear Wolfenstein: the New Order is great, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. this is so good. It's good if you're a Tolkein fan as the game centers around familiar ground in an unfamiliar time featuring original and unsung characters -- and it's good if you're NOT a Tolkein fan because the combat is metal as ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the innovative Nemesis/enemy rank system that makes things extremely personal. It's gorgeous, it sounds gorgeous, it's gratuituous, it's ♥♥♥♥ing great. Worth any price.Also brooding, grizzly protagonist that makes Aragorn look like a chump.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, is a unique game. It is set in a great fantasy universe, with a focus on combat, and planning how to take down your enemies. The combat in this game (like all of the arkham games) is superb. If combat isn't your strongsuit, then the stealth will be. The stealth in this game is great, its a mix between the arkham and assassin's creed games. if you die in Mordor, whoever kills you will become promoted into a captian. It is an intresting concept, and makes death even more dreadful, as it will be more difficult to fight that random orc again, when he becomes a captain.All in all, this game is a great choice to buy. I purchased it for a low price during the Steam witer sale, but this title is definetly worth buying.			"

												Despite underutilised characters and voice actors, and a story that reeks of terrible fan fiction, Shadow of Mordor is a solid (albeit on the smaller side) open-world experience. It's a great mix of Assassin's Creed parkour and discovery, and Arkham combat. The real meat and enjoyment of Mordor comes from the Nemesis system, a refreshing new gameplay hook that adds near-infinite replayability to the free roam (though you'll need to get through a good portion of the story to unlock every mechanic of it), which enables memorable encounters and rivalries with the multitude of randomly generated Orc characters.The biggest draw back of Shadow of Mordor (in my opinion): no difficulty options, and as such a solid player will bypass some of the most fun aspects of the Nemesis system (which incorporates your defeats). By the endgame and at 100% content completion, you may still be left wanting more, but the lack of difficulty at that point may be a deal-breaker to the otherwise great free-roaming under the Nemesis system.

												I think this is a good game, but they are wrong about the time they decided to launch this tittle. It could be named Assassin's Creed Middle Earth or something like that.The point I found so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying is that you are ALWAYS surrounded by enemies and you have no time to take a walk or run with no stealth because if you give a step without stealth they are going to detect you, and when they detect you, the second point I found annoying happens. When you start a fight agains a group of enemies, they start to fall from everywhere, and when you take a view, you see like 20 enemies with two ""mini bosses"" at least, and it's like : ""Ok, I'm ♥♥♥♥ed"". The last thing I would wished to have in this game, is a better customization in weapons and clothes/armors, the rune system is so boring (at least for me). I would prefer loots with swords, axes or things like that.But after this little angry comment, I can say the game is so beautiful, the gameplay is funny, and overall, the Boss system to check the progress is amazing, I have never seen a control over the enemy like this. I love it.			"

												Like Lotr? If not, then why are you looking at this reveiw? Many people say Shadow of Mordor is just a re-skin of a Batman Arkham game. That's because it was supposed to be a batman game, but obviously it isn't. Why do I say this? Because the combat is exactly like Batman and Assassin's Creed, but Shadow of Mordor is much bloodier. It is set after the Hobbit and before Lotr, and without giving away too much, has a dark and brutal but fun story which fits in with Tolkien's lore very nicely. There are also two great maps to explore, tons of abilities, side missions and collectables to keep you entertained. If you're a Tolkien fan like me then definately give this amazing game a go.			"

												I played this game with everything maxed except high shadows and textures (3GB gfx card), but I improved visuals further  with SMAA/Lumasharpen forced through SweetFX configurator since there is no AA option in game, I got a steady 80-100 fps and the game looks great. The game benchmark averages 99 fps. Forcing SMAA really helped, but the game looks smashing without it too.I ran it on a 4770k @ 4.5ghz,  evga 780 SC acx @ 1310 mhz.The game is definately worth the money if you're looking for a good 15-25 hours play through with a good engaging story, a lot of customization and abilities, and a stunning beautiful open world. Feels like a mix of assassin's creed and batman arkham city with amazing fluid controls, and with the story taking place in the lord of the rings universe. A good experience and money well spent, no regrets.			"

The Nemsesis System (GENIUS!!!!), the Arkham-esque combat (finally someone besides Rocksteady made this work), and.....Wait for it.....Graug riding, caragor riding, slashy slashy boom, swish, clash, slash (me reenacting my gameplay). It's so great, but you may have noticed that I haven't mentioned anything about the story. That's because, sadly, it's not that good.... I mean, I like it, but it's missig something... LIKE A GOOD FINAL BOSS BATTLE. I mean really, all that build-up for a f****ing quick-time thing?! DISClAIMER!! NO ONE LIKES QUICKTIME!!!!!!!!! Especially for the final boss battle...Also, the build up for the quick time  right after the epic orc battle  was SO EASY. Just stealth takedown over and over and over...and over....and over.

												First of all ı'm a big Lord of the Rings fan but this is game is not much relevant to it. Maybe..yes you see gollum a couple times and learn better about Sauron and his supporters. Story 9.5/10 : In the begining (let's not give some spoilers) you get a little sentimental ..erhmm maybe couple tears.. then you know why you kill thousands of uruks and orcs for no reason. In the begining of the story you get some kind of corrupt from and elf and you live with him. The elf (Celebrimbor) has his own special moves and a bow. Long story short the story is great but it could have been little longer.Gameplay 9/10 : Game is based on a system where there is from lower rank to higher , standart uruks-the ones with the shields-berserkers-captain-master captain exc..-Warchiefs. In the esc menu you can see a ranking of the captains and chieftains. But first you need to learn some intel about them from the one less ranked soldier, for exp ıf you want to learn something about chieftain , you need to interrogate the captain and if you want to learn something about captain , you must interrogate a standart uruk. After you learn their location you go to kill them. Its almost easy to kill every captain but ıf you die one of them, they get stronger, maybe even promote. But the chieftains is hard to kill. When you go the place where they rest in the map. They wont show up at the first place. At first you must complete some kind of little game. exp : kill this , this and that guy , so the chieftain show up. You have 3 weapons at total. A sword which you can use to kill the uruks in combat and execute them. An arrow , you can only use your arrow when you're in elf mode, you dont have a quiver but when you drain a uruks life. It will give you 4 arrows. A dagger , which will help you to kill enemies from the behind below or above. Dagger is most used for sneaky attacks, and its deadly for standart uruks and gives extra damage to the captains and chieftains. The game has a level system , where you can upgrade your weapons, your hero or the elf side of yours. Also game is a little bit like Assassins Creed because , your jumps, running style , and free-style parkour runs in the castles is a little bit similar to it.Atmosphere and Map 7/10 : The biggest lost in our list is map. The map is pretty big..yes..but it doesnt contain much stuff in it. Yeah , there are castles. mountains. uruk camps exc.exc. But after some point its monotone. Same stuff all over it. The atmosphere is good , it reflects the middle earth as it is, relevant to wasteland because uruks burn the tree's and stuff.Total 8.5/10 : In total game is worth it's money for the storyline and gameplay and gives you slightly 30-40 hours of fun with couple of dlc's . Whether you're a LOTR fan or not you must try this one.Thank you Monolith productions :)			"

The last thing I would wished to have in this game, is a better customization in weapons and clothes/armors, the rune system is so boring (at least for me). I would prefer loots with swords, axes or things like that.But after this little angry comment, I can say the game is so beautiful, the gameplay is funny, and overall, the Boss system to check the progress is amazing, I have never seen a control over the enemy like this. I love it.			"

												I played this game with everything maxed except high shadows and textures (3GB gfx card), but I improved visuals further  with SMAA/Lumasharpen forced through SweetFX configurator since there is no AA option in game, I got a steady 80-100 fps and the game looks great. The game benchmark averages 99 fps. Forcing SMAA really helped, but the game looks smashing without it too.I ran it on a 4770k @ 4.5ghz,  evga 780 SC acx @ 1310 mhz.The game is definately worth the money if you're looking for a good 15-25 hours play through with a good engaging story, a lot of customization and abilities, and a stunning beautiful open world. Feels like a mix of assassin's creed and batman arkham city with amazing fluid controls, and with the story taking place in the lord of the rings universe. A good experience and money well spent, no regrets.			"

												Awesome game. Plays a little bit like the Assassin's Creed franchise. Really enjoyed punching the Uruks. Definitely worth the €24.99 I payed for the pre-order. Recently bought the GOTY Edition Upgrade for €3.57 which unlocks more content. Pros:- Nemesis-system- Combat system works fine.- Good story.Cons:- No background about Talion.- You have to buy additional DLC's to get all the achievements.9/10			"

												First of all ı'm a big Lord of the Rings fan but this is game is not much relevant to it. Maybe..yes you see gollum a couple times and learn better about Sauron and his supporters. Story 9.5/10 : In the begining (let's not give some spoilers) you get a little sentimental ..erhmm maybe couple tears.. then you know why you kill thousands of uruks and orcs for no reason. In the begining of the story you get some kind of corrupt from and elf and you live with him. The elf (Celebrimbor) has his own special moves and a bow. Long story short the story is great but it could have been little longer.Gameplay 9/10 : Game is based on a system where there is from lower rank to higher , standart uruks-the ones with the shields-berserkers-captain-master captain exc..-Warchiefs. In the esc menu you can see a ranking of the captains and chieftains. But first you need to learn some intel about them from the one less ranked soldier, for exp ıf you want to learn something about chieftain , you need to interrogate the captain and if you want to learn something about captain , you must interrogate a standart uruk. After you learn their location you go to kill them. Its almost easy to kill every captain but ıf you die one of them, they get stronger, maybe even promote. But the chieftains is hard to kill. When you go the place where they rest in the map. They wont show up at the first place. At first you must complete some kind of little game. exp : kill this , this and that guy , so the chieftain show up. You have 3 weapons at total. A sword which you can use to kill the uruks in combat and execute them. An arrow , you can only use your arrow when you're in elf mode, you dont have a quiver but when you drain a uruks life. It will give you 4 arrows. A dagger , which will help you to kill enemies from the behind below or above. Dagger is most used for sneaky attacks, and its deadly for standart uruks and gives extra damage to the captains and chieftains. The game has a level system , where you can upgrade your weapons, your hero or the elf side of yours. Also game is a little bit like Assassins Creed because , your jumps, running style , and free-style parkour runs in the castles is a little bit similar to it.Atmosphere and Map 7/10 : The biggest lost in our list is map. The map is pretty big..yes..but it doesnt contain much stuff in it. Yeah , there are castles. mountains. uruk camps exc.exc. But after some point its monotone. Same stuff all over it. The atmosphere is good , it reflects the middle earth as it is, relevant to wasteland because uruks burn the tree's and stuff.Total 8.5/10 : In total game is worth it's money for the storyline and gameplay and gives you slightly 30-40 hours of fun with couple of dlc's . Whether you're a LOTR fan or not you must try this one.Thank you Monolith productions :)			"

												I finished this game a while ago at the time of writing this review, so my memory might've missed a few thing here or there.Anyways, this game is AWESOME. I love it so much! The Nemsesis System (GENIUS!!!!), the Arkham-esque combat (finally someone besides Rocksteady made this work), and.....Wait for it.....Graug riding, caragor riding, slashy slashy boom, swish, clash, slash (me reenacting my gameplay). It's so great, but you may have noticed that I haven't mentioned anything about the story. That's because, sadly, it's not that good.... I mean, I like it, but it's missig something... LIKE A GOOD FINAL BOSS BATTLE. I mean really, all that build-up for a f****ing quick-time thing?! DISClAIMER!! NO ONE LIKES QUICKTIME!!!!!!!!! Especially for the final boss battle...Also, the build up for the quick time  right after the epic orc battle  was SO EASY. Just stealth takedown over and over and over...and over....and over. Anyways, I'll give it an 8/10,  9/10 with rice.  +Good gameplay  +++++++NEMESIS SYSTEM  +Love the Nemesis System   -Climbing up walls sometimes feels bad, or clunky  -Sloppy ending			"

												If you're a fan of Middle-Earth and LOTR/Hobbit, then it's a ""must buy""!!! ;) The story of this game is happening before LOTR and Hobbit, it is about a gondor ranger Talion who was murdered with his wife and child by the Sauron's most evil servants called black hands of Sauron. He was later then revived from the dead by a an Elf called Celembribor. His story is much like the ranger's. Sauron wanted Celembribor's skill to forge him the rings of power for the better world, but Sauron tricked him and in secret he created One Ring to rule them all. After that, Celembribor was betrayed and killed along with his fammily. Now he seeks vengeance. With finding Talion who suffered the similar fate, he will team up with him and plan to destroy Sauron! By doing so, u get an awesome single-player campaign which is portrayed in Mordor, killing orc captains and riding mighty graugs etc. ;)How much more do I have to say!! It is a MUST BUY!!!! ;))15/10 would buy atleast 3x more xD			"

 POSITIVE   Really good graphics  Canon, in terms of the books  The Nemesis system can really make you change your entire play style to defeat an enemy  Very enjoyable and smooth controls  Pretty bug-free from my experience  Lots of things to do for the first 15~ hours  Orc dialogue/voice-acting is really entertaining the first time you hear it  Nemesis system provides some replayablitity  Sword combat is very satisfying and lots of fun NEGATIVE   Pretty bland main character(s)  Not a lot to do alongside the main story  Some weapons/playstyles become insanely over powered near the end of the game  Fairly small map for an openworld RPGThis game is far from a ""must have"" but if you have the money and want to kill a few dozen hours, you won't regret it. The stealth is fun, the action even more; and it stays true to the feel of LoTR. "

Personal vendettas against Glob the Mudlicker and dealing with the ever-growing power of Captain-soon-to-be-Warchief Roktar Thunderkunt as he kills you for the 6th time are not uncommon in this shining gem in the dirt and dust of half-arsed PC ports ripped straight from the peasant machines.10/10 would angbadang again			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a game that looked back at the third person action games of last gen, namely Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games, took what worked and polished them to a fine sheen. The Nemesis system is also something that will most likely be emulated from here on out. Overall Shadow of Mordor is  just a really fun game gameplaywise. When it comes to atmosphere it's really pretty too. The writing is unremarkable but there's nothing really bad about it, it's just serviceable for an action game like this. I definitely recommend it to third person action game fans, it's a quality game.			"

 No spoilers I played this game basically because I wanted to explore more of the Middle Earth's lore and wanted to play this before Shadow of War is released. Let's get to more details about the game. Gameplay It is a third-person melee and ranged combat style with emphasis on timing your attacks and countering enemies. And the game delivers here absolutely. You can take no more than 5 or 6 hits before you fall. During fighting the stakes are always high as every death gives more power to your enemies and puts you behind. Shadow of Mordor gets a +1 from me here. Story As I said in the top, I wanted to get a good Middle Earth story. But it's not great by any means. Premise is pretty simple. Nothing compared to anything written by Tolkein. But a couple of references and cameos makes it interesting. A mere 10 hour campaign (without side missions) with a super anti-climatic end boos fight leaves me far from satisfied. +0 here Level Design Game is set in an open world map that is divided into a few regions. All of the regions are invaded by orcs and mostly when you encounter humans, they are slaves or dead. The scenery looks good and it looks to be inspired by the movie series and the books. +1 from me. Characters You play in the boots of Talion, a ranger (Much like Aaragon from the movies, but far earlier) who has lost his family and his life. He comes back to life with an elf smith who suffered a similar fate and together they set out to get revenge on the enemy. Apart from the main character and a dwarf, I found every other character pretty bland and did not care enough about them. +1/2 for characters. Replayability Game is only a one time playthrough and it was meant to be this way. When it comes to upgrading your skills and weapons, you can get basically most of them if you do a few side missions. Not too much decision making or planning required here. +0 Overall 2.5/5 Buy it in discount and rush through the main story-line if you want to play the game for the sequel release.			"

												Can't stop playing. The best Middle-Earth \ Lord of the Rings themed game out there so far.Nemesis system adds very unique aspect into gameplay. Uruk captains and warchiefs are generated every time you kill them or when they are fighting each other to advance in ranks and take over place of their leaders. Each has his own personality, weakneses, strengths. It adds tons of replayability. Not to mention you can dominate uruk minds and send them to fight each other, thus you can build an army of your own uruks. I branded an uruk captain and made him a bodyguard of a warchief by sending mine to kill his bodyguard in duel, then I sent him to betray warchief. And there is more to Nemesis system, it is but a glimpse of this deeply elaborated system. The combat system is very decent.The story is very fitting and lore-wise, even if it is short, the quality of main missions is very high. There is much to do without story, even after completing it, you can continue to take out uruk captains/warchiefs and explore collecting artifcats, runes.The world map is big enough to explore hours and hours. I believe Monolith will add new regions of Mordor beside Udûn and Sea of Núrnen once a DLC comes out (hoping to visit Plateau of Gorgoroth and Morgul Vale someday).And there is this feel and immersion. The feel you are in Mordor and Middle-Earth.			"

												One of, if not THE, most enjoyable game I have ever played. Slaughtering Uruks is so entertaining, I just can't get off my computer now. Don't let my hours decieve you, I have almost 200 hours at the moment and I'm still going strong (Steam should fix the Offline Hour system). I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun adventure through a gorgeous world.PS: Be wary of downloading on low-end systems! This game requires a heavy duty card to run smoothly. My AMD R9 290 just grabs the ULTRA settings, but I do not recommend on a low-end system. Also, its over 40GB after install, so have fun downloading!			"

												Absolutely brilliant game that does a service to the Franchise. The visuals,game play,sstory and mechanics are all fun and rewarding. My only problem with the game is the controls for the PC. The controls would work for a game with slower action,but due to the fact,you need to react fast,combat can be clunky and  difficult to master. Sometimes due to the difference in parkour and fight mechanics,escaping a battle can be damn near impossible if sorrounded by enough enemies. So perhaps a controller for PC is the way to go. Aside from that the game is a classic.			"

Combat Pros: Whether you choose stealth or the walking mayhem approach You always feel like a powerful combatant. Arkham esque. Brutally violent. Every execution could be it's own Slayer album cover.Combat Cons: After several hours of playing it can become a bit dull and repeatative.----Story Pros: It's brief and unobtrusive. Often in games that let you choose your playstyle the story parts have your character doing things that you've avoided doing for hours of gameplay. (in farcry 3 I played very stealthy and yet in every cut scene this kid was running around screaming his head off like an idiot)Story Cons: The story is generic and kind of flat. Which isn't to say it's bad but some people may be expecting a lotro/hobbit epic adventure and it's not really that.----Why should I not just wait until this game is $10 on steam sale?: Quite simply, the world they created is stunning. The Nemesis system is by far one of the single most interesting mechanics added to the Assassins Credd/Batman games since they added boats to the Assassins Creed series. I completed the game in just over the minimum completion time which is not a feat by any means but what is impressive is that after I did that I spent the next 5 hours watching how the nemesis system played out. Sometimes I would kill my own guys to create a power vaccum just to see who took over. It's truly fascinating. Sometimes you'll find a weird little Orc that you just have to back in their power play because they're such a weird dude. When one guy kills you it beccomes a personal vendetta. Unlike quick time events I hope the Nemesis gets picked up by every game maker because it just helps give the player a vested interest in the world they occupy.			"

												Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor definitely isn’t for everyone, but I can almost guarantee that everyone who gives it a shot will find something enjoyable about it, regardless of whether you are a Tolkien fan or not.The Nemesis system alone is worth giving this a go, let alone the LOTR setting.Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor is a remarkable game, with an uncharismatic main character surrounded by enemies whose design is really spectacular, lots of content to complete and guaranteed fun. And, on top of that, it's a game that, despite being clearly influenced by others, has its own style.It will appease hardcore fans of games like Assassin’s Creed and the Batman: Arkham series, while introducing new gameplay mechanics that fundamentally change the structure of the game. A unique experience for any gamer indeed.Side characters could be more interesting.Side quests are easy and same.And the main scenario is not good enoughBut this game is funny.Side Characters are bad,scenario is bad but dude this game is f..king cool cuz it is realy funny			"

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, is an open world action game with RPG elements. Much higher emphasis on Action here, but enough here to consider it to be an RPG here. Some depth and choice in what you want to level up, although you will be able to max everything in your trees eventually if you so choose.TLDR; Its a decent open world action rpg that takes a lot from other games and builds on them immensely. It has lots of new additions as well on those systems, making it feel much more polished than the games it takes from. The RPG elements are nice, and you feel like a badass from start to end. The nemesis system and branding make this game have a lot more replay value than most, allowing for different results every time you play! Great game.NOTE: Since I've been planning to review tons of games I got this summer, I decided to review this one next.. Have too many games to play, and this is something I will definitely finish up and try to 100%. I really like this game a lot, although I will say I haven't bought too many games, or played that many AAA titles, so to those who have this will probably feel a little repetitive, or you've seen parts of it before. I will say however, this game does take mechanics from other games and might build on them immensely, or dumb them down a bit. Although it might be more of the same, it has a lot more to offer than what I just said. Just stating they did take styles of other games and made kind of a mega game here!. -Positives-     - Combat system    - Nemesis system    - Okay replay value    - Graphics are great, surprisingly.    - Good tutorials/beginning    - Good Optimization    - Branding(you can control your enemies, and make them fight against eachother and much more!)    - Tons of different approaches.    - This version comes with the DLC, meaning no need to have to buy dlc after this purchase.    - If you ever wanted to feel like a badass, you definitely can! Even at the beginning you feel strong, and capable enough to do whatever you'd like.-Neutral-    - Takes heavily from other games, such as Assassins Creed, Batman Arkham knight/city(sorry.. never played much of either, sorry if I get names wrong)    - LoTR Skin    - LoTR lore - Note; I put this here because they aren't really negatives, or positives. They can go either way from player to player. I love lord of the rings personally, and the skin makes it nice to me. (Watched those movies too many times honestly..)-Negatives-    - Can get repetitive    - Somewhat easy combat system, no depth. Although, the game can be as hard as you'd like due to the amount of   ""customization"" the game can have.    - Some mechanics were a bit dumbed down from what I've heard, and don't really feel right. This included the climbing mechanics, it just doesn't really feel great.    - Can be a bit grindy at times, especially if you want to unlock everything. If you followed the story completely, you'd probably get to the end of it in about 20 hours, which isn't half bad compared to some games. Although collecting and doing everything would probably take ages.   P.S Thanks again mike! @.@ so much to play, its hard to decide what to launch anymore!			"

												A very good game that is easy to play and has a nice story even tho I'm pretty sure the story is not quite in line with the one that J. R. R. Tolkien wrote in his books, the story is however very good if such things don't bother you. The game has few bugs and worked with no problems at all for me.			"

												This is a really good game with great combat, stealth, story and characters. The Orcs really are brilliant and anyone who is into Lord of the Rings will be delighted with the different point of view this game offers. The game has a lot in it with a decently long main story and enough side missions to keep you occupied for hours. The Orc captain system is very good as well and you really learn to love to hate your enemies.Perhaps not as good as the hype around it says but this game is still very very much above average. One word of advice though, you NEED to have a controller to play this game since the combat is far too fast for a keyboard and mouse. Once you use a controller though it handles like a dream.			"

												Middle-Earth: Shadow of Moar Door has got to be one of my favourite games that ive played it the last couple years, i've found it very engaging and compelling to play. The game works best for me using a controller rather than the keyboard but it is definately playable with either. One of my favourite features in this game is that when/if you die, the enemy that killed you gains power and becomes a captain in the enemy's ranks. So rather than dying and feeling slightly irritated before trying again, you know have a nemesis, and can plan your revenge which feels oh so good. Or alternatively, you could be more sneaky and help your adversary climb the ranks until they become a warchief, at which point killing them makes it even more tasty. I found out very early on that this game has a unique twist to combat, usually in these kinds of games its very easy to take on a whole bunch of enemies at once (Assassins Creed, looking at you), however in this game, it may be wiser to run away than to engage an entire stronghold by way of blade. If your a fan of Stealth, blade and bow action, creating your own army, gravely voices or picking herbs and flowers, than this game is definately something you should look at!			"

												Overall, this is definitly the best LOTR game ever made. Period. The game is full of new mechanics which can hook you for hours, such as branding uruks to do your bidding and then making them fight to the death. The animations are pretty top quality as well.The only fault i have about this (beware, minor spoilers) The game builds up towards a huge fight of revenge with sauron, who is pretty much evil incarnateBut then they go and ruin it with the entire fight being a 1 minute long quick time event, come on devs. This is bloody sauron, show some respect.

												I could go on for hours with reasons to buy this game, but I'll make it short, this game is a mix-up of Assassin's Creed (Parkour, and stealth) and the Batman Arkham series. I personally absolutely love this game, and my hours certainly do not show so, but this game in my opinion is truly a masterpiece, and you should buy it if you enjoy the above mentioned games.To clear things up, my hours are so low due to me playing on another platform for most of my game-time.

												Shadow of Mordor is a pretty decent stealth/action game. It plays a lot like Assassin's Creed, with a focus on parkour and wall-climbing with QTE-ridden hand-to-hand combat mechanics but the various upgradable skills and runes give it it's own flavour in terms of gameplay.The much-toted Nemesis System is pretty solid, too. While it occasionally spits out fairly unremarkable opponents, it's also provided me with some very entertaining rivals. There's something about turning the cannon fodder enemy that happened to snipe you as you were making a clean getaway and turning him into an unstoppable leader that provides a very unique thrill. Unfortunately, I did notice an unfortunate tendency for my rivals to die horrifically shortly after I brainwashed them into joining me (RIP, Dush the Caragor-Slayer, whose post-duel fanfare was cut tragically short by a giant rock monster), and frustratingly while enemy Orcs can respawn under the right conditions there's no such luck for allied ones.There's a fairly decent campaign and a large number of optional quests, too, though some are definitely better than others. The slave rebellion missions in particular play out nearly identical to each other, which is very jarring since the ""Legend"" quests usually have a unique gimmick or two to make them stand out. There's also a few dozen relics to hunt down and elven symbols etched into walls that provide a neat little diversion as well.I did have some performance issues at times-- I had a recurring crash on launch that required me to restart my computer every few sessions in order to fix it, and the framerate does tank a bit during particularly busy sections. Shadow of Mordor is also fairly buggy at times-- I had several dozen instances where orcs randomly flew into the air, the ziplines had a tendency to make me clip into the scenery (forcing a reset) or fall out of the world entirely, and on two seperate instances the game crashed immediately after a lengthy quest forcing me to redo it.But while Shadow of Mordor is definitely rough around the edges at times, there's just something about being able to turn five of a general's bodyguards against him without him suspecting a thing, having them gang up and kill him in his home fortress, then causing all of their heads to explode with a single keystroke so that the sole remaining captain in his regiment, who was also under my control, can take his position in the enemy army. Or the time I let a random enemy kill me, then converted him and made him the most powerful Orc in all the land before luring him into a cave where he was eaten alive by the undead. Or that time where...And really, that's Shadow of Mordor in a nutshell. A fairly entertaining, if flawed, means creating the type of stories you'll share with your fellow gamers around the water-cooler. And then getting weird looks from your other co-workers because you explained, in great detail, how you let a ""Slave Taskmaster"" get torn apart by tigers.			"

												If you like Assassin's Creeds and you like Lord of the Rings then you will love this game. Graphics are good and the fighting was amazing and being a fan of LotR I really enjoy listening to the story parts. There was something that I couldn't quite put my finger on that seemed...well...familiar. It wasn't until I was running and jumping off of buildings and scaling walls with the utmost ease that I realized I was playing another variation of Assassin's Creed...Basically a game that becomes extremely repetative with ever increasing semi complexity in all the skill categories. While I will admit this game goes about it slightly better since it really only changes the fighting complexity vs the wall climbing of AC but it still left me disappointed to an extent.Overall the game is good. I just can't play it without seeing AC and that just kind of takes away from the experience IMO. I would recommend it only if it were on sale.			"

												So, first of all I would like to point out that this is a great game - which gives you an almost perfect RPG experience. Next, I would like to compliment their style of making the combat system, because it gives you a feeling, as if you are the character - also making you able to use brand new skills and techniques not seen before. The skill tree system is also okay, but not exactly after my taste (but everything can't be perfect). The graphics are utterly amazing, the effects are almost done perfectly - depends on your system setup and stuff - and only with a few bugs (VERY few). Gives you a really immersive experince. This game - as mentioned before with the combat system - also let's you use different cambat styles, techniques etc. for example the ""Hard on"" non stealth way, the stealthy assassin approach, the ranged approach, the smart approach - triggering traps to your advantage.Overall a mostly perfect game, they did an amazingly good job with this game - HUGE thumbs upp from me in DDenmark!!

												I would describe this as a cross between the Batman games and Assassin's Creed, with a bit of interesting new stuff thrown in.  First, it looks beautiful, the graphics are a joy to behold.  The combat is fun, similar to the Batman games.  As you progress, you pick up enough new abilities, that slicing through a horde of Uruks just never gets old.The Assassin's Creed reference I mentioned is how your character moves though the areas.  There is a lot of climbing and perching above your prey and attacking from above, which, like the combat, never seems to get old.But what really makes this game shine is the Nemesis system.  You really feel like these are real Uruks you are killing, all with different weaknesses and strengths and widely varied appearances.  You can join in on a power struggle between Orc captains and influence who wins.  As the captains and warchiefs gain power, they get promoted and move up in ranking.  Also, if some random orc kills you, he automatically gets promoted to captain, and has a name and gains a little armor to alter his appearance.  You can then kill him for a vendetta.  It is a very engaging system and honestly, I had a great time just trying to kill the captains and wreak havoc among their leadership.  It's great fun!			"

												I could go on and on about why I love this game but suffice it to say that the game has an amazing soundtrack, lots of gore as well as an extremely solid combat system which is very satisfying to both play and watch, incredible voice acting of uruks and main characters, the game completely nails its atmosphere. Not to mention you continually need to adapt your strategies to the strengths and weaknesses of different warchiefs and captains. Even long after finishing this game you have a good amount of DLC to keep you entertained and even so the Trials of War are a great challenge to test your mightMy only real negative of this game is the final boss fight which sadly does not even last a minute and is basically a QTE Other than that this game is a solid 8/10			"

												Huge fan of LOTR. I was a couple years late to the party but I have to say that this is one off the best games i've ever played. It's a blast. You are possessed by a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off elf and the two of you will stop at nothing to seek revenge against those who have wronged you. The nemisis system is absolutely ingenious and adds a lot of depth to your enemies. You will do everything you can to finally bring down that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ orc who is giving you a hard time.The AI learns from your previous encounters and you will have to change your strategy up if you wanna take down the filthy scum of Morgoth! I can't recommend the game enough. If you are a fan of LOTR, Batman Arkham games, and a dash of the Assassins Creed series, this is for you. I cannot wait for Middle Earth: Shadows of War to release. Monolith/Warner Bros. Stuidos absolutely killed it. I highly advise you give the game a try. I have a feeling you will be happy you did.			"

												I just finished the main campaign in this game, and started touching on the DLC missions, but this review will focus on the basegame. There's a reason this game received the GOTY award from multiple reviewers and journalists.It brought a couple of unique features to a genre that was sorely needing something fresh.1. The unique AI engine that made enemies remember you, power up to battle you again if they lost previously or if they won boast in your face as they attempt to best you again. Each enemy had unique properties and rarely would a direct approach help you much. Especially in the beginning.2. The weapons were basic and simplistic, but offered a lot more and had a deeper narrative if you knew where to look.3. The environments were lovely with some interesting characteristics and many hints at the books and movies.4. The art direction, specifically with the Uruks and their armor, weapons and scowls were just superb. That green skin textures used in game made them look real. I was in awe when I first saw it.5. The playstyle, with a unique concequence to death and to leveling up. The stealth mechanic worked nicely, but added some difficulty ot the game as well.The storyline is not amazing, or new or unique. But it is a very proper LOTR lore. And they made proper use of the characters. In the end, what more can we ask for?The only real negative point comes in the learning curve. If it's your first time playing it, there's a lot of detail going on and a lot of reading to understand everything. However the tips and tutorials are properly documented and are helpful all the way to the end.I would absolutely recommend this game.			"

												It's like Assassins Creed in the world of Lord of the Rings. The game mechanics are amazing and so fun, it's such an addictive game at the start, I didn't even bother with the story when I got the game, but eventually I thought it was time to play the main story, and I started disliking what I saw. The story given to the game is poor and short, it merely takes half a day to complete the entire game if you just played the story non-stop. Other than the story being completely off road from what Tolkien wrote, if you are a fan of Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, you will hate this story with all your heart. Gameplay Mechanics : 10/10, simply outstanding.Storyline and Quests : 3/10, repetitive, boring and misleading.Graphics and Ambiance : 9/10 beautiful. "

												I bought Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor to get rid of my post Witcher 3 depression. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself with a hugely underrated game. The story is a little bland admittedly, and the world is quite small and plain. However Shadow Of Mordor offers the best combat experience I've ever had in a video game, with responsive and intuitive controls, fun mechanics and the most satisfying cinematic takedowns I've ever seen. The developers clearly poured a lot of time into creating the nemesis system in this game, with Urukai captains and warchiefs you can target and take down. It's very fun to see captains fight, feast and gain more experience, and even more fun to take them down.Admittedly I haven't played through enough of the story yet however it seems pretty mediocre. I also haven't started either of the two DLC yet so I can't comment there. Additionally the visuals in this game are quite striking, with the protagonist, Talion, looking particularly spectacular.So far I'm loving this game and would give it a 7.5/10.			"

												Overview---According to the game, I'm 12% through the game. This game is filled with Assassin's Creed-like parkour, Batman Arkham Asylum/City/Origins-like combat, and it's more entertaining than ever. It's a hack and slash with amazing elements that you will most likely not find in any other game. Not only is this a Lord of the Rings game, which is a selling point for most fans, but it's combat is fluid and systems in the game is faultless. I believe that this game will never get boring. The endless nemesis system is awesome, as many new captains come in, kill/hunt with each other, working their way up to legendary captains, which is their ultimate goal. Along the way, not only do orcs get attacked by your character, killing them after their fruitful efforts to reach the top, but also competing orcs. If an orc gets to a high enough power level, he will try to move up in rank...but some of the times that doesn't work, resulting in the loss of their lives and making the winner a target for the player.You can get upgrades for your weapons in game, and also upgrades for your character and wraith abilities. You do missions to gather a currency to purchase more health, shots for your bow and arrow, and slots for your weapons. You have three weapons in the game, which all play crucial parts; the sword, the bow, and the broken sword, which functions as a dagger. The sword is for most melee combat, the bow is for taking out ranged troops and grunt ground troops, and the sword is for stealth kills.Also, if you have friends who play the game, when you progress through the storyline, you unlock Vendetta waypoints. if you go to one of these, you have a chance to murder your friend's nemesis, which is the 'Uruk' that killed them most. This feature is awesome.Pros and Cons---Pros--Great graphics, even on low-Fantastic combat, gory and different every time, also challenging depending on your advantage in stealth-Brilliant mechanicsCons--The storyline's don't really line up. In the game, it takes place in between the end of the Hobbit book and before the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, the enemies you encounter in the game are called Uruks, short for Uruk-Hai, which is Saruman's creation. This is before Saruman has begun working for Sauron, therein these 'Uruks' shouldn't be in the game. I hope you appreciated my review, and I hope you buy the game. Add me if you do so I can avenge you from your nemesis! :)EDIT:Upon completing the game, I just wanted to warn you. The final battle isn't exactly a battle...You just press buttons to block attacks. But the rest of the game is great, there's two different maps you can travel around, adding to the adventure.Graphics: 9/10 Beautiful scenery, gore, and orcs.Gameplay: 8.5/10 Engaging Combat, Interesting Systems, Disappointing Last Boss Fight.Controls: 9/10 Good Controls, easier with a keyboard and mouse than a controller.

The one point being how fast the game is to finish but I guess that's more or less me wanting to have a longer storyline mission. . .			"

												I was fortunate enough to play Shadow of Mordor through the steam family sharing system. Although I would not have been disappointed had I purchased the game at full price. I enjoyed every last second of it from start to finish and actually looking forward to more story based DLC.Let me just start by saying that I love the combat system. It's very similar to that of the Batman Arkham games. In fact it's just like that really. So it'll be very familiar to those who have played those games. Killing orcs in this game is incredibly satisfying and I sometimes get caught up in big battles and forget what I was trying to accomplish in the first place.The game itself has a decent story. It's nothing that will really blow your socks off but I think any Lord of the Rings fan will appreciate it for what it is. Uncovering all the lore collectables and stuff throughout Mordor is interesting as you get to learn more about Middle-Earth and the type of creatures and beings who reside within Mordor. The game itself takes place right before the events of Fellowship of the Ring. You play as Talion, a ranger of Gondor who meets an unfortunate end, but gets his body possessed by a friendly wraith who helps him get revenge for himself and his family. However this mysterious wraith has an agenda of his own that you will discover throughout the story. Interesting stuff.. .MMMMYYYYYEEESSSS!Lets talk about the new nemesis system. I love this thing. Defeating an orc captain just to have him come find me later with a piece of metal in his head to replace the big ol' wound I gave him in our last battle.. or he's burned... or he's mad that I spooked him by throwing bees at him... it's really cool. The orcs remember you, some of them hold grudges, some of them fear you. There was one that even sang to me, it was lovely. Another orc just asked if I had any snacks. I decapitated him very quickly. You'd really have to see the nemesis system in action for yourself to see what I mean. Easiest way to describe it would be to say that it makes your enemies seem more real. It makes things much more interesting when you're defeating or being defeated by them.I can't think of much reason to dislike this game. I suppose it did get a tad too easy in the middle of the game. I did feel way overpowered throughout most of the game and was pretty much impossible to kill near the end. I guess I don't like some of the stealth missions that would cause you to fail if you get spotted. They don't make any sense to me. The idea is that you'd be overwhelmed and killed if you're spotted... but I kill entire armies in that game. I am a harbinger of death. I chop off orc heads for fun, what do I care if I get caught? Oh well. Final Verdict: (4.8 out of 5)			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a pretty decent stealth/action game. It plays a lot like Assassin's Creed, with a focus on parkour and wall-climbing with QTE-ridden hand-to-hand combat mechanics but the various upgradable skills and runes give it it's own flavour in terms of gameplay.The much-toted Nemesis System is pretty solid, too. While it occasionally spits out fairly unremarkable opponents, it's also provided me with some very entertaining rivals. There's something about turning the cannon fodder enemy that happened to snipe you as you were making a clean getaway and turning him into an unstoppable leader that provides a very unique thrill. Unfortunately, I did notice an unfortunate tendency for my rivals to die horrifically shortly after I brainwashed them into joining me (RIP, Dush the Caragor-Slayer, whose post-duel fanfare was cut tragically short by a giant rock monster), and frustratingly while enemy Orcs can respawn under the right conditions there's no such luck for allied ones.There's a fairly decent campaign and a large number of optional quests, too, though some are definitely better than others. The slave rebellion missions in particular play out nearly identical to each other, which is very jarring since the ""Legend"" quests usually have a unique gimmick or two to make them stand out. There's also a few dozen relics to hunt down and elven symbols etched into walls that provide a neat little diversion as well.I did have some performance issues at times-- I had a recurring crash on launch that required me to restart my computer every few sessions in order to fix it, and the framerate does tank a bit during particularly busy sections. Shadow of Mordor is also fairly buggy at times-- I had several dozen instances where orcs randomly flew into the air, the ziplines had a tendency to make me clip into the scenery (forcing a reset) or fall out of the world entirely, and on two seperate instances the game crashed immediately after a lengthy quest forcing me to redo it.But while Shadow of Mordor is definitely rough around the edges at times, there's just something about being able to turn five of a general's bodyguards against him without him suspecting a thing, having them gang up and kill him in his home fortress, then causing all of their heads to explode with a single keystroke so that the sole remaining captain in his regiment, who was also under my control, can take his position in the enemy army. Or the time I let a random enemy kill me, then converted him and made him the most powerful Orc in all the land before luring him into a cave where he was eaten alive by the undead. Or that time where...And really, that's Shadow of Mordor in a nutshell. A fairly entertaining, if flawed, means creating the type of stories you'll share with your fellow gamers around the water-cooler. And then getting weird looks from your other co-workers because you explained, in great detail, how you let a ""Slave Taskmaster"" get torn apart by tigers.			"

												I could go on for hours with reasons to buy this game, but I'll make it short, this game is a mix-up of Assassin's Creed (Parkour, and stealth) and the Batman Arkham series. I personally absolutely love this game, and my hours certainly do not show so, but this game in my opinion is truly a masterpiece, and you should buy it if you enjoy the above mentioned games.To clear things up, my hours are so low due to me playing on another platform for most of my game-time.

												A mixture of Assassin's Creed series, Batman Arkham series and a very cool and fresh idea in the form of the Nemesis system that gives it its own distinct personality.

I can easily recommend this game to anyone who likes action adventure games and/or LOTR lore :)			"

												Captivating gameplay in an immersive world. Simply far too much satisfaction is found killing Uruks.It has been 3 years or more since I have got ""into"" a game. Shadow of Mordor fitted my niche perfectly and I have played it exclusively for 2 weeks.I have just come to the end of the story, having completed all side quests and found all but the hunting/survival collectibles. It is not often that I find a game where I actually enjoy grinding through every last peice.Time and money well spent. I'll be looking back on this game in a few years thinking ""oh man, that was awesome"".			"

												A thinking persons hack and slash.This is the best game I've bought in quite some time. I sneak around a lot, but since dying doesn't really matter sometimes i just wander into a pack and settle down for a long , fun fight. Riding the caragor (sp?) into battle is fun as hell.There are so many side missions it's ridiculous. I have barely touched the main missions yet.It gets frustrating at times (When you first start it can be overwhelming what with the different things the same keys/buttons do), but once you conquer the learning curve it is a blast.Once you learn the different moves/actions you might want to remap a couple of keys, but it can be played with a mouse/keyboard effectively.i almost forgot to mention: the graphics are amazing, as is the voice acting.And the Nemesis system is awesome as well.

												Middle-Earth: Shadow of Moar Door has got to be one of my favourite games that ive played it the last couple years, i've found it very engaging and compelling to play. The game works best for me using a controller rather than the keyboard but it is definately playable with either. One of my favourite features in this game is that when/if you die, the enemy that killed you gains power and becomes a captain in the enemy's ranks. So rather than dying and feeling slightly irritated before trying again, you know have a nemesis, and can plan your revenge which feels oh so good. Or alternatively, you could be more sneaky and help your adversary climb the ranks until they become a warchief, at which point killing them makes it even more tasty. I found out very early on that this game has a unique twist to combat, usually in these kinds of games its very easy to take on a whole bunch of enemies at once (Assassins Creed, looking at you), however in this game, it may be wiser to run away than to engage an entire stronghold by way of blade. If your a fan of Stealth, blade and bow action, creating your own army, gravely voices or picking herbs and flowers, than this game is definately something you should look at!			"

												Overall, this is definitly the best LOTR game ever made. Period. The game is full of new mechanics which can hook you for hours, such as branding uruks to do your bidding and then making them fight to the death. The animations are pretty top quality as well.The only fault i have about this (beware, minor spoilers) The game builds up towards a huge fight of revenge with sauron, who is pretty much evil incarnateBut then they go and ruin it with the entire fight being a 1 minute long quick time event, come on devs. This is bloody sauron, show some respect.

 POSITIVE   Really good graphics  Canon, in terms of the books  The Nemesis system can really make you change your entire play style to defeat an enemy  Very enjoyable and smooth controls  Pretty bug-free from my experience  Lots of things to do for the first 15~ hours  Orc dialogue/voice-acting is really entertaining the first time you hear it  Nemesis system provides some replayablitity  Sword combat is very satisfying and lots of fun NEGATIVE   Pretty bland main character(s)  Not a lot to do alongside the main story  Some weapons/playstyles become insanely over powered near the end of the game  Fairly small map for an openworld RPGThis game is far from a ""must have"" but if you have the money and want to kill a few dozen hours, you won't regret it. The stealth is fun, the action even more; and it stays true to the feel of LoTR. "

 No spoilers I played this game basically because I wanted to explore more of the Middle Earth's lore and wanted to play this before Shadow of War is released. Let's get to more details about the game. Gameplay It is a third-person melee and ranged combat style with emphasis on timing your attacks and countering enemies. And the game delivers here absolutely. You can take no more than 5 or 6 hits before you fall. During fighting the stakes are always high as every death gives more power to your enemies and puts you behind. Shadow of Mordor gets a +1 from me here. Story As I said in the top, I wanted to get a good Middle Earth story. But it's not great by any means. Premise is pretty simple. Nothing compared to anything written by Tolkein. But a couple of references and cameos makes it interesting. A mere 10 hour campaign (without side missions) with a super anti-climatic end boos fight leaves me far from satisfied. +0 here Level Design Game is set in an open world map that is divided into a few regions. All of the regions are invaded by orcs and mostly when you encounter humans, they are slaves or dead. The scenery looks good and it looks to be inspired by the movie series and the books. +1 from me. Characters You play in the boots of Talion, a ranger (Much like Aaragon from the movies, but far earlier) who has lost his family and his life. He comes back to life with an elf smith who suffered a similar fate and together they set out to get revenge on the enemy. Apart from the main character and a dwarf, I found every other character pretty bland and did not care enough about them. +1/2 for characters. Replayability Game is only a one time playthrough and it was meant to be this way. When it comes to upgrading your skills and weapons, you can get basically most of them if you do a few side missions. Not too much decision making or planning required here. +0 Overall 2.5/5 Buy it in discount and rush through the main story-line if you want to play the game for the sequel release.			"

												this game is one of my top ten best of all time. thats all u need to know to decide buy it or not.(dont look on my time recored. cause i bought it on PC only in 2016) but spent like a year on my ps4.now pros and conscons:- short (its con cause in the end u want MORE)- small map ( its con cause u want MORE to explore)- not so good optimization. to play on ultra u need a very good PC- this nemesis system. i cant tell anything bad about it but nothing good too. its fun for fist few times but than... meh. i can tell one thing it there and its cool. but if delete it u wont notice its gone  : )pros:- story one of the best. - graphics is great. even on low settings it beautiful. and u will never see so much details in killing orcs.- skill system is one of a kined. u reallly can see how better u are after few more new skills. and if on start u can die from 3-5 orcs. in end u can jump in crowd of 50-100 and kill them all. and all who come after to help them.- u can have your own army of orcs (but closer too the middle or end of story)- and last and best: combat system. in theory its the same as in batman or Mad Max or any other WB titels. but its not. its best i ever seen. it works so well. never in batman contrloller listen me so good. Its the best part of the game. sometimes u just notice that u killing hordes of orcs over and over for like an hour for no reason. thats how it good. sometimes u just forget about quests and side chalenges and go in crowd of orcs jumping and slashing. its so fun and so rewarding, i never seen other game with so good combat system. u can tell that devs gave there souls for that.

												Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, is an open world action game with RPG elements. Much higher emphasis on Action here, but enough here to consider it to be an RPG here. Some depth and choice in what you want to level up, although you will be able to max everything in your trees eventually if you so choose.TLDR; Its a decent open world action rpg that takes a lot from other games and builds on them immensely. It has lots of new additions as well on those systems, making it feel much more polished than the games it takes from. The RPG elements are nice, and you feel like a badass from start to end. The nemesis system and branding make this game have a lot more replay value than most, allowing for different results every time you play! Great game.NOTE: Since I've been planning to review tons of games I got this summer, I decided to review this one next.. Have too many games to play, and this is something I will definitely finish up and try to 100%. I really like this game a lot, although I will say I haven't bought too many games, or played that many AAA titles, so to those who have this will probably feel a little repetitive, or you've seen parts of it before. I will say however, this game does take mechanics from other games and might build on them immensely, or dumb them down a bit. Although it might be more of the same, it has a lot more to offer than what I just said. Just stating they did take styles of other games and made kind of a mega game here!. -Positives-     - Combat system    - Nemesis system    - Okay replay value    - Graphics are great, surprisingly.    - Good tutorials/beginning    - Good Optimization    - Branding(you can control your enemies, and make them fight against eachother and much more!)    - Tons of different approaches.    - This version comes with the DLC, meaning no need to have to buy dlc after this purchase.    - If you ever wanted to feel like a badass, you definitely can! Even at the beginning you feel strong, and capable enough to do whatever you'd like.-Neutral-    - Takes heavily from other games, such as Assassins Creed, Batman Arkham knight/city(sorry.. never played much of either, sorry if I get names wrong)    - LoTR Skin    - LoTR lore - Note; I put this here because they aren't really negatives, or positives. They can go either way from player to player. I love lord of the rings personally, and the skin makes it nice to me. (Watched those movies too many times honestly..)-Negatives-    - Can get repetitive    - Somewhat easy combat system, no depth. Although, the game can be as hard as you'd like due to the amount of   ""customization"" the game can have.    - Some mechanics were a bit dumbed down from what I've heard, and don't really feel right. This included the climbing mechanics, it just doesn't really feel great.    - Can be a bit grindy at times, especially if you want to unlock everything. If you followed the story completely, you'd probably get to the end of it in about 20 hours, which isn't half bad compared to some games. Although collecting and doing everything would probably take ages.   P.S Thanks again mike! @.@ so much to play, its hard to decide what to launch anymore!			"

												8/10 - A highly entertaining killing frenzy amongst funny looking creatures with silly names.This game takes some of the highest-grossing elements of action-rpgs that came up in the past years and combines it with the successfull franchise of LotR. A good idea, that was realised almost perfectly. ME:SoM has much to offer for ARPG and Tolkien-Fans. Also, if you liked climbing on things and stealth-killing enemies in Assassins Creed or beating the living hell out of thugs in the Batman Series, this Game is likely perfect for you. Besides the familiar and well balanced gameplay, this game has to offer a pretty good storyline with a nice character development. The only downsites here are the endless upcome of sidemissions, that distracted me too much from the story, the lack of different races and characters of the LotR universe and a pretty lame bossfight at the end. The atmosphere is quite nice, but the two large sections the game offers are fastly explored and get boring after a while. Nevertheless the nice soundscape and the enemies and creatures roaming the lands of ME:SoM result in an immersive atmosphere. The graphics are very good: a low amount of loadingscreens but a stable framerate at high settings on a average system. The mainstory is quite short, but there is plenty to do in the world of ME:SoM. The DLCs offer some more information about characters of the story, some more gameplay features (sadly even more quicktimevents) and a more challenging alternative gamemode.Gameplay - 9/10Atmosphere - 8/10Storytelling - 7/10Graphics - 9/10Playtime - 7/10Total: 8/10 - Middle-Earth: Shadow of Morder had everything to offer I missed in the Assassins Creed Series. The gameplay mechanics are entertaining until the end.			"

												There are literally thousands of other reviews, so I'll keep mine concise.+ An excellent storyline. The story follows Talion, a Gondorian ranger who is stationed at Black Gate. He is later possessed by a very important and very powerful figure in Middle Earth's history. The story's pace is quite good, though it feels a bit disconnected towards the end.+ The lore is greatly enhanced by the artifacts you find. Collect all the artifacts if nothing else. I especially loved the ones where they delve into lore of Blue Wizards.+ You get to see lots of important characters from the Middle Earth's history, and also many characters from the movie trilogy. I'm an avid fan of LOTR mythology, so this game was a very good opportunity to refresh my memory.+ The voice-acting and sound effects are incredible. It really feels like you are watching a movie during cutscenes.+ For those achievement hunters, the game is choke-full of collectibles and challenges, though none of them unlock anything in the game (This may be a negative point for some).+ Towards the end of the game you become something like a demigod. If you unlock all abilities and find all the epic runes for your weapons, there is nothing that can stand in your way, be it Graugs or hordes of orcs (This may be a negative point for some).+ The nemesis system really makes you want to go take your revenge.+ I loved the bit about Ratbag. I think all the quests related to him were hilarious.+/- The graphics are not ground-breaking. They are nice, for sure, but not mind-blowing.+/- The combat is nothing special. It uses the same system as Arkham games. It is less fluid than Arkham, but more lethal. You need to be more careful. With a little reflex, you can beat 20+ men easily as Batman, but you will die a lot if you try to take on 20+ orcs here (until you unlock epic runes and abilities at least).- Throughout the game I had frequent sound glitches. It may be my system (I'm using a Sound Blaster Z and I play with heaphones. I chose ""headphones"" in the audio options menu). The problem is, after a while all speech sounds come from the left speaker, some speech sounds are very muffled, and some sound effects are completely muted. Restarting the game fixes the issue.- There are tons of challenges and collectibles but none of them unlock anything.- If you don't rush thorugh the game and do all the quests and everything, you become nigh-invincible towards the end and the game loses all challenge (This was not a negative for me but it may disappoint many people).- There are some rare bugs in some missions which forces you to restart them.- The unskippable little cutscenes you have to watch every time you face an Orc captain or Warchief start getting boring after a while.Verdict: I think this game is a must-play for everyone, even if you are not really interested in the LOTR. There are some negative points to be sure, but the positives far, far outweigh them. Definitely recommended.			"

												You can kill orcs in every way possible imagined. Throw them off cliffs, chop off their heads, shoot them with a shadow bow, teleport to them then cut their head off, stab them multiple times with a dagger, you get the point (HAAAAAA PUN INTENDED). Okay, Okay. It's a ton of fun to play and the bosses you fight are challenging, but fun. It's a really fun game with a great story, whattya waitin' for? BUY IT NOW.			"

												Only a few minor setbacks prevent this game from being a perfect 10/10. First, the positives: It's got a really good story, the characters (protagonists and the people around them) are easy to empathize with, which makes you want to complete the game and have some sense of justice on behalf of them. The open-world mechanics work well to draw you in the game, combined with the beautiful graphics makes the whole experience an immersive one. I like the fact that the many side quests are somewhat shaped depending on your actions as well as the procedurally generated enemies creating an atmosphere of uniqueness to the game. Your choices, while they may not really matter in the larger story line, help shape and influence the smaller stories within the story by interacting with the player. The fight dynamics are simply fantastic, it almost becomes an art form to slay the Uruk-Hai, which are apparently in endless suppy. Least but not least, the stealth actions bring a whole new dimension to the already rich-in-mechanics game. The negatives: Controls aren't up to notch for some of the more intense combat situations, you will feel them working against you and not for you. For example when surrounded by 30 enemies, including a warchief and two captains in some random stronghold and you're backed into a ledge, having very little health, you might want to jump off the edge and get a breather and shoot a few head-shot arrows to scatter a couple of these wretched creatures... Well, the game doesn't agree so. For stealthy actions, this is not a problem though. Second, the tactical and strategic elements of the game are served too up front with side missions. It would have been a lot better if the game gave us  a clue as to what the greater goal is and what kind of strategy and tactics we might want to employ towards that goal and left us alone to gather our own intelligence and cultivate our own side missions from the ground up. That would have suited the great open world atmosphere of this game a lot better. To conclude, this is a must have/play game, even if you're not a fan of the LOTR books/movies, the former of which I am not. I highly recommend this game for hours of fun. Now, I must go back to the tons of DLC I bought for it.			"

												I played this for close to 40hours. That included the main story and all the side quests the game has to offer. This do not include:+ All the DLC content which I will buy this very day.+ The first challenge modeI would say about 5 hours were used so far playing my very own ""♥♥♥♥♥♥fighting"" game mode, where I select a Uruk with the best potential starting at the lowest level and working him up as my champion, selecting his opponents to fight without my intervention. I cannot get enough of this, seeing them win and die eventually. I don't know, but having my own Uruk prize fighter, it's like playing game of thrones with a strap on.Furher more I spent some time collecting all the epic runes in the game, building the Uruk army up and busting a cap after they are fat with potential for an epic rune. It's almost like running my own Uruk farm. feed them, slaughter them, Collect my prize. I am even considering buying my own farm and have epic battles with cows to get their meat. But no, seriously.Then offcource there's a little regret, I like my games not hard, not damn hard, no.... ♥♥♥♥ing hard. Thats what I expect of my games, but even with the difficulty not being merciless with me, I would say from time to time, there's this one uruk chieftain that slaps the snot 7 times around your face. I once had this♥♥♥♥♥Uruk who killed 4 other players and yes... I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me too. It was amazing. If I had to compare this to something I like in life, it would be like getting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. it's that good. No but really. It's better than good. It's a mix of majestic and epic. Called.... Epijestic. My friend created the word so:""Werner™, battries not included, T&C's apply.""I don't play a lot of RPG games, I am only starting out now and between The Witcher and Mass Effect Series, I hope they pop more Shadow of Mordor out because of it's immense replayability. Even after you complete your story line you can go do your side line quests for better weapon asthetics, Play ""Game of Chieftains"" or what ever other crap you can do to mess with the power structures of the Uruk ranks. BEST RPG EVER. "

												I just finished the main campaign in this game, and started touching on the DLC missions, but this review will focus on the basegame. There's a reason this game received the GOTY award from multiple reviewers and journalists.It brought a couple of unique features to a genre that was sorely needing something fresh.1. The unique AI engine that made enemies remember you, power up to battle you again if they lost previously or if they won boast in your face as they attempt to best you again. Each enemy had unique properties and rarely would a direct approach help you much. Especially in the beginning.2. The weapons were basic and simplistic, but offered a lot more and had a deeper narrative if you knew where to look.3. The environments were lovely with some interesting characteristics and many hints at the books and movies.4. The art direction, specifically with the Uruks and their armor, weapons and scowls were just superb. That green skin textures used in game made them look real. I was in awe when I first saw it.5. The playstyle, with a unique concequence to death and to leveling up. The stealth mechanic worked nicely, but added some difficulty ot the game as well.The storyline is not amazing, or new or unique. But it is a very proper LOTR lore. And they made proper use of the characters. In the end, what more can we ask for?The only real negative point comes in the learning curve. If it's your first time playing it, there's a lot of detail going on and a lot of reading to understand everything. However the tips and tutorials are properly documented and are helpful all the way to the end.I would absolutely recommend this game.			"

												B4 i start i just want to say that i am 100% totally and completely biased, as i am in love with the world of Middle-Earth...As soon as i saw the very first teaser of the game, i fell in love. Like most others i loved the idea of killing hundreds of orcs at a time and the idea to use Batman's combat style seemed like a perfect fit which would avoid clunky combat and make u feel and look like a total badass while preforming the great kill animations.When i got my hands on the game my love only grew further, as i didnt expect the orc society to be so personal. I remember dying the first time to what would later be my ""arch-nemesis"" throughout most of the game. However seeing his head fly off into the distance was well worth the planning and patience it took to kill him for good. However there is one ""negative"" that i found at the very start of the game, and that is the difficulty. This game is just too damn easy with all those visual cues on screen. Thankfully they can be turned off for a more immersive challenge at the start of the game, that being said once your character gets enough skills he is pretty much a god that can keep a kill-chain going till u start to feel sorry for the orcs. All in all i had a super fun time with the game and even 100% it (which is rare for me) and definitely consider it my GOTY of 2014.			"

												I had huge expectations from this game considering most reviews rated the game like it's a masterpiece giving it top ratings.However the game feels like an average action game with a lot of wasted potential.Let me explain myself:Combat is pretty much the same as it is in Batman series - you build combo streaks, you use special attacks, you crit on well timed attacks. The combat feels fluid, mostly fun and even challenging. Things can get sometimes ridiculous - captains / warchiefs get resistance to pretty much everything and you can only kill them in a single way. For me it's 8/10Story felt mediocre - it's clear it wasn't the focus of the game. People leave as quickly as they are introduced. Some main points aren't even explained. For example - why was Talion the one chosen by the 'wraith'? Why was his family chosen by the black hand?Not to mention boss fights were ridiculously easy. At the end of a second boss fight all I thought was only THAT'S IT? I had bigger problems with Uruk warchiefs and even with some Uruk captains than that pathetic boss fight. Expected much stronger story from LotR game, so for me it's only 5/10Side missions / collectibles are a good way to earn currency to unlock rune slots on your weapons or to increase general stats of your character. You will most likely do them only at the beginning as they quickly become repetitive. Killing 5 marked uruks while not raising alarm / not being detected can only be interesting and fun for first few tries. As for collectibles - artifacts add some lore and or emotions to certain state of the place or time. I honestly didn't find them interesting enough to collect them all. Rune spots however felt a bit more interesting though I hadn't finish them too. To me it's about 5/10Some thoughts: Variety of enemies is absolutely awful. About 99% of the time you fight uruks, and the rest of the time you fight wildlife (caragors / graugs / ghuls). You'd think you'd get to fight cave trolls, 'evil' humans, goblins (aka orcs - uruks are stronger orcs), wargs or other fantasy creatures from LotR universe yet all you do is fight Uruks equipped with different weapons - swords, crossbows, spears, shields,... The game isn't as long as many other reviews say, however if you are willing to continue with dlc, it can make up for it. The base game is about 10 hours of playing unless you drag it around by slaughtering uruks for fun / run around instead of using fast travel / do many unnecessary side missions or collect all the runes and artifacts.ConclusionWhile I complain about a lot of things in the game, I still enjoyed it and that's what matters the most.If you are looking for a good action and don't care much about story, this game is definitely worth a look. Total score: 7/10 "

												Love this game. The combat is fluid and fun, the story isn't too short, the replayability is nice, and you get to kill ALL of the orcs you could ever want to. The LotR lore is really cool in this game and my fears of the developers screwing up a good story did not become reality. I had a blast with this game, and they keep coming out with more cheap DLC that is a ton of fun. I had one person say they didn't want to buy the game because all you do is kill orcs. My response to that: Yeah, that is all you do in a sense, but the variety in which you can kill a rediculous amount of orcs makes this game the best LotR game I have ever played.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ orc-spawn of the Assassin's Creed and Batman series BUT crucially much better than both.  The Orcs and the Nemesis system is a literal game changer - getting to know the personalities of your orc enemies makes an already fantastic combat system even more thrilling.  It's amongst the best 3rd-person  melee combat I've experienced in a video game.  Chaining attacks together rewards you with brutal finishes which you can pause & screenshot at anytime.  It's so addictive!  The LOTR lore, voice acting and art design are all of high quality.  Buy it.			"

Love the game and whole heartedly say buy it.			"

												Shadow of Mordor:Graphics - On a decent computer it looks amazing, the scenery, the texture details the lighting, everything is really top class.Character detail and animations -  are fantastic, the physx hair and cape sway around in the breeze, the characters mouth movements sync up really well with the characters voice, not just in the cinematic cut scenes but the in game talking when you pick up a specific item etc. The looks on the orcs faces when you about to stab your sword into their face, the look of their friends is also really well done, you know, the look of horror when you brutally stab them all over the place. The animations for combat is flawless as well, the different types of kill possibilites for not only basic attacks but for executions and dagger kills as well.Voice acting + cinematics - really amazing job for every character, the stand outs for me was the guy the does for voice for Talion the main character I thought was absolutely fantastic, beautifully fits the character and also all the orc voices are amazing. Every captain has a different personality which affects how they fight in some cases. Cinematics obviously are gonna be great, I suppose its kind of expected in this time of technology, but Shadow of Mordor has more cutscene cinematics then pretty much all other games that I've played. There is basically one for each step of the main story which includes about 20 parts so. Yea really great job on the voice acting and cutscene cinematics.Immersion - So for me one of the greatest things about this game was the immersion, I guess games that come out now are gonna be more and more immersive because the graphics become more and more realistic but this game especially. It really gives you the drive to keep playing and to not only finish the story but complete 100% of the games content as well. The story for me was really quite good, the dialog that the characters had really made sense, it was logical which in some games is hard to find. And what I mean by that is some games have the character make really stupid decisions like not wanted to have help or not completely killing a person and its just to drag on to the story, similar to horror movies when its very dark and there is obviously someone hiding in the dark room with a knife but the idiot walks in anyway and gets mauled to pieces, when in reality, you would probably run out of the ♥♥♥♥ing house drive away get on a plane and ♥♥♥♥ing move to an entirely different location. Another immersive part of the game was the collectables part of the game, usually in games they make you pick up little items to extend the game a little bit. Shadow of Mordor gives you a logical reason and rewards for getting this items, they give you backstory of the item you just picked up or dialog between the Calabrimbor and Talion discussing what they found. There is also a bunch of rescue quests which involve you going to free human slaves from the orcs. Each time you accept the new rescue quest it tells you what the slaves did in order to be tied up and tortured and then that story affects the bonus part of the quest. For example if a bunch of slaves tried to poison the orcs 'grog' which is basically their alcohol, you have the bonus quest of finishing the job and poisoning the grog.My rating + should you buy the game - So my rating for the game is going to be a 10/10, I stayed up for 38 hours and I played the game for 37 of those hours and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was waiting for this game for a long time and it really delivered more then I expected. I think they did an amazing job and I'm really looking forward to what DLC's they're going to bring out. Now about buying the game for youself, I highly recommend doing it. It's an open world game with so many possibilites on how you would like to play the game. The captains and warchiefs are all different and you can choose which ones you want to control and which ones you want to kill, you can create your own unique army of orcs which is a really cool idea in my opinion. So definitely go out and get it, seriously one of the best, if not the best game ive ever played.			"

												To start off, this does not follow the Lord of the Rings story or The Hobbit's story line. It branches off somewhere in the middle of the two as Gollum is alive.As for the perks there are many....- Amazingly Optimized- Open World- Endless amounts of side missions if you wish to continue the awesomeness!- Graphics are stellarThe game is truly amazing and if you are a huge Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit fan, I recommend this to you as you will get many, many hours into the game without even realizing!** Edit - I finished the main story today (took me about 25 hours for the main story, while there is still a bunch of side missions that would take a while) and I have to say it was a very good game and I HIGHLY recommend this to Lord of the Rings fans as you get to see some fun stuff towards the end, which I will not spoil! **10/10			"

												Great gameplay, although a little on the easy side once you get most of the upgrades. The gameplay can also start to feel old as you progress towards the end. The story is something that you feel is lacking as soon as it begins. Very predictable and stereotypical, not even the addition of lore through artificats and such can save the story for me. The gameplay can be described as a combination of the free roaming mechanics of Assassin's Creed with the combat of the Arkham games. It makes for a very satisfying experience, as you roam the lands of Mordor hunting down Uruks and bend the armies of Mordor to your liking. However, the pace of the game could be better. Before the game allows you to use all your wraith powers, even story missions feel like a tutorial that introduces you to the nemesis system. The game holds your hand most of the way, its obvious, and yet doesn't take away from the experience. Which speaks to the polish of the gameplay and mechanics.The story really is just a back drop for the fantastic mechanics this game has to offer. It will be interesting to see other developers take the nemesis system and place it in existing IPs and beyond.			"

												I would recommend this game but would say that you shouldn't expect too much out of it. I bought this game with really high hopes, hearing how great the combat system, and the nemesis system were, and had a blast for the first few hours or so. About halfway through the game really started to drag on for me. I like to try to do everything before the main quest, so I kept trying to kill all of the chieftains and warlords, and you can't. It's horribly frustrating to keep trying to kill everything off, and then logging off and coming back on just to have everyone be replaced and you no longer have intel on them. And the combat is so easy it's boring. You can just crouch and suddenly you're invisible and can do whatever you want, and if anyone does see you, you just pull out your sword and kill them in a few quick hits. The character just feels too over powered for the world, other than caragors. Caragors were the bane of my existence in this game, and I would rather fight 3 warlords at the same time than deal with a single caragor. Worth it if you can get it cheap, but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

I feel that the y could have easily created extra minor storylines or other things which gave it a more in depth feel.Bottom line: Get this game when it goes on sale, so you get what you pay for.If you get it, get it along with the season pass, you will get bored without those DLC's			"

												Great game.  It takes place between the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, with Sauron coming back to Mordor as the backdrop for the plot.  Enough Tolkien to immerse yourself in, without it completely destroying the lore to make a playable game.  Don't get me wrong, there will be several WTF moments where it appears to go directly (or indirectly) against the mythos of Middle Earth. Generally speaking, however, it is excellently done, and you can tell the creators had a love of Middle Earth.    As has been mentioned before, the gameplay is combination of Batman: Arkham Whatever and Assassin's Crap.  The fighting mechanics are lifted almost directly from Batman, and I consider that a good thing.  My only gripe is that the combat is a bit easy, and although you will die, towards the end of the game death will only occur if you're just not paying attention.  The final mission was a blast, although the final boss was a let down.  (When you can tackle 30+ orcs at a time, how do you make a 1:1 fight interesting?  I don't know, and neither did the developers).  The game takes awhile to complete if you aim for all the side missions.  I rarely felt bored or like I was wasting time when going after the side missions, and the main missions were well scripted, interesting, and thoroughly enjoyable.  If you're a Tolkien fan, you'll love this game.  If you're not a Tolkien fan, well...I don't know what's wrong with you.			"

												Enjoyable, very satisfying third person combat in a setting with lore that's well handled, with abilities that make sense in context. The closest comparison i can give for this game is that it is a Tolkein version of the latter Far Cry games, even moreso than it resembles the Arkham series games from which it takes most of its combat dynamics.The nemesis system is very fun and as much as i hated dieing multiple times at the hands of my own personalised nemesis, it really drew me in.That said, beyond the open world fun and nemesis system, if you're aiming for 100% completeness as I did, this really is a game that runs out of tricks towards the end (an end no less where if you end up completely skilled up, you can do away with the challenge. As for the DLC, the Lord of the Hunt has been a bit of a let down. I hope the Bright Lord content makes up for that.			"

★★★★★It was the 2014 GOTY of a lot of websites, which kind of says how disappointing that year was, considering that this game is not as amazing as the years around 2014. It's an excellent celebration of player freedom and control, which is somewhat undermined by it's unadjustable, low difficulty.By this time, I'm sure you know what you do in this game, and what the combat is compared too. The brilliance lies in its player agency and execution. The combat and stealth portions are satisfying and the player is free to tackle situations in anyway he/she sees fit. The game is also well-known for its 'Nemesis-system'. There are captains who are spread out over the plains of Mordor, each with their own randomized characteristics and traits. I don't know how many types of visual characteristics the devs have programmed into this, but 40 hours in and I was still fighting Uruks I've never seen before, like ""Kubai the Drooler"" who is actually drooling at all times. This is awesome, because you will remember some of them simply because they were successful in fending you of or perhaps even killing you. This is where my problem lies.This game is too easy, especially in the first eight hours. The nemesis-system looses it's value, because of the low difficulty. Unique to the system is that a captain that kills you, will grow in strength and power. Some captains will make a comeback at you at completely random times to take their revenge on you (with some new scars on their heads). Again, this is awesome, but most captains won't be able to defeat you, and you'll just plow through the Uruk army, taking captains one or three at a time. The low difficulty just negates the the system.The small amount of story missions is actually pretty nice. These are afterall somewhat restrictive and because there are a  massive amount of side-missions, the game entices you to play in bursts spreading out over a couple of weeks, instead of burning through it in a single week. Not that you get burned out with it, on the contrary, but it is nice that the game allows the player to take it's time with it; the positive effect of the casual playstyle.The DLC offers two more short stories set in the same landscapes. Some traits of the player and of other units are changed for the sake of variety, and the new achievements offer the right amount of difficulty for those who seek more of a challenge.You should give this game atleast a try, after all it's only 10 bucks during steam sales. It's well polished (no bugs at all) and well designed. It runs good on pretty much everything, meaning that some small changes in the settings can change a whole lot for you. The one gripe, the low difficulty, is a bummer but it is something to overlook.			"

												I was initially skeptical about Shadow of Mordor. I thought it was a blight upon a fantastic universe, and would ruin the lore. I thought it was a shoddy attempt at capitalising on a popular genre of ""jump-drop-assassination-fun-times"". Then I was convinced by friends to try it out.And I was so wrong. While the game takes liberties with the lore, it keeps certain elements the same. It maintains Celebrimbor, Sauron's deceit, Melkor, Numenor, and the likes. None of that is changed beyond recognition. It's not a reboot. It is, at worst, a side-spring; an alternative timeline. It stays loyal enough to the lore that it doesn't feel out of place, but it takes enough liberties that lore-puritans may take offense.But for those that don't, for those that can look past that? You're in for a wonderful surprise of orc slashing, ghûl chopping, caragor riding goodness. The game features a nemesis system that means if a regular bootlicking orc kills you, he can get promoted to captain on the condition he can defeat one of the already present captains. What's more? The orc can end up becoming your nemesis if you kill one another enough times.Orcs that survive being killed by you(a seemingly random chance) end up returning with visible scars and alterations. Observe case; Gorfel Blood-Hand. Dude was a regular foot-orc until he managed to kill me through circumstances I don't recall. He was promoted.In revenge, I sought him out and killed him. But that was not the end of it. He returned, this time with a massive metal plate across his eye. That was a visible disfiguration, considering he had been rather un-scarred before. I once again took the liberty of assassinating him, just because I could.Fast forward a few hours, and I had forgotten about him more or less. Than he appeared once again, as the bodyguard of a warchief. His entire face was covered with leather and a hood. You could see his metal plate under the hood, but his sanity had clearly drained from his skull. His motive? He apparently thought he was cursed, and killing Talion(the player character) was the only way to break the curse.I didn't let him. But it shows how small stories can form within the game's world, letting you drive an orc from their wits just by killing them over and over.The combat itself hearkens back to the Batman: Arkham games and is quite simplistic. The graphics aren't anything to write home about either, but the collectibles and nemesis system will provide enough fun in themselves.			"

												I'm writing this review completely biased as I been itching to get my hands on this game since it was first announced.  But I only got a chance to play it now.  This game hits every note for me personally.  Whether that makes it an amazing game or not is entirely subjective.  It takes most of its mechanics from other games.  The free flow combat is Batman with swords.... Which is just really cool.  Its faster and more fluid and less rythmic.  The parkour is a faster Assassin's Creed with everything climeable within seconds. the story is barely there but servicable and just offers more orc killing.Orc killing.... Thats the entire point here.  Orcs being used as fodder for your playground.  As you level up they become more and more laughably easy.  But where this game truly shines is the nemesis system.  Its everything I hoped it would be and more.  This allows for every player to experience something different in their game.  With orc captains having personality traits.Highlights for me has been a complainer who whines about everything.... I made sure to dominate him so I can keep him around :D and its been funny hearing his dialog.  Also a brain damaged captain who has trouble talking.  I had one random orc kill me and I jump off the tower respawning and kill a random orc only to find out it was the one that just killed me lol.  One captain refuses to die and keeps interrupting the same fight with a warchief.  How annoyingly delightful!Over all the game itself runs like a dream with no noticable glitches for me.  Again I admit my bias as these types of games are like crack to me and this one especially scratches every itch for me.  I haven't even finished the story and I don't care!  Shadow of Mordor is the perfect game as far as I'm concerned.  Minor nitpicks of the 2 maps being really small and how archers can sometimes get you very cheaply when your swarmed by a lot of enemies.  But I'm not even complaining about those.  this is a 10/10 for me.  Takes all the elements from other games and just makes it better in my book.  Just don't go in expecting some deep story to move you.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a surprisingly good open-world third-person action game that I can easily recommend to everyone.I guess not many have people expected Monolith to pull off a good open-world Tolkien game but they did and they did so amazingly. While nothing inherently new is on display, your character gains new moves at a great pace and the action never seems stale. You have a wide variety of ways to deal with your foes and when you add the nemesis system to this mix,  you not only enjoy the opportunities the game gives you but also feel invested in the inner dealings of the Uruk hierarchy.I have not felt so ""enjoyably"" lost in an open-world since Just Cause 2 and this is no small feat in my eyes. During the 25 hours it took me to almost 100% the game, I always felt excited to step into the shoes of Talion and always had fun with whatever I was doing in the game: going through the story, liberating the outcasts, riding giant creatures into the hordes of Uruks, pitting Uruk Captains and Warchiefs against each other and so on.It's a pity that there wasn't more non-DLC content to the game but I easily got my money's worth. There were some things that held back Shadow of Mordor from becoming a classic such as the somewhat easy difficulty, the QTE bosses and the extremely weak endgame but overall, it is a must buy for the fans of the genre!

												Personally i'm not a fan of Lord of the Rings which meant that i only had passing knowledge of the world and characters. From what i have seen in the movies a lot of things are referenced in the game and this should be a fans dream game. I had a bit of trouble keeping track of the different beasts and factions and such but the story was entertaining on its own. You could remove all things LOTR from this game and replace them with generic fantasy clichès and it would still work because the gameplay is fantastic.Shadow of Mordor is a truly open in it's gameplay and it's just a blast to play something like this. Main meat of the game is playing around with the hierarchy of the Uruk army. There are elite captains who command captains who command the army. Killed ones will soon be replaced by another as the captains raise in ranks. If they manage to kill the player then whoever struck the final blow will be raised to captain status and thus every enemy in the game can become one of the main villains. All the while this is happening the player can complete main missions to progress the story but the enemies you face in the story are affected by the situation on the hierachy board. It's a bit complicated system to explain and it took a while for me to understand whats going on, but once i did it brought a grin on my face. It is a really well made system.Captains can be found out in the open or they can be stumbled upon while killing someone else. Sometimes multiple captains just happen to be in the same place where the player is doing something else and everything just escalates into chaos. Additional action comes from luring Caragors (wolf-like pack beasts) and even Graugs (humongous all-killing mega monsters) into the situation. In the later part of the game player gets the ability to brand uruks to fight their comrades. Captains can be forced to fight eachother. After everything is set up you can either join the action or climb somewhere and let the AI battle it out. It's unique and so much fun!The game is a bit on the easy side with harder no difficulty levels available. This is not all bad since it makes playing around with the AI easier but on the other hand it makes many things optional. AI is blind and deaf and escaping or sneaking is really easy. Unless specifically required stealth is often meaningless anyway, because killing a dozen uruks is no problem. Finding out a captains weaknesses is also optional since they are quite easy to kill without that information.  There are things to collect but not hundreds which is nice for a change. Optional hunting challenges are also available and all of these can be completed while on other missions so the game flows really nicely.The game runs really well and looks amazing. It doesn's slow down at all even with 30 uruks on screen in a dense fortress. That is an achievement on it's own. The game crashed once but my sessions could be even 4 hours in one sitting with the game staying stable so it's well made. Autosaving is frequent and also the nature of the game is such that you never lose much progress anyway. I played with xbox360 controller which the game supports flawlessly. No idea how well keyboard controls work.It took around 20 hours to complete the story missions and do almost all of the side activities. This doesn't include DLC, which should bring few addiotional hours. Shadow of Mordor gets a bit repetetive towards the end, especially with locations and mission types but the AI keeps things interesting to the end and beyond. Recommended!			"

Fun gameplay that isn't ultra linear and repetative, many things to do in the (open) world, basically infinite content with the challenge mode and so on. Highly reccomend. Tons of new content on the way too in DLC!			"

												This game feels like one huge quicktime event, or a slightly interactive movie.The combat consists of mashing one button and watching the fight resolve itself in nicely done choreography. If you want to expedite things a bit, or add some moves to the choreography, you may spice up your button mashing with additional keys, as suggested by screen prompts (parry, dodge, etc.). It doesn't actually feel necessary though.The camera is annoying, the controls feel spongy and weird (no strafing, sneak is faster than walk) and the cutscenes are extremely frequent and feel interruptive. Also, this thing calls itself an RPG, but there is no loot, no alternate weapons/armor, no inventory, no character customization whatsoever.I regret this purchase, sale or no.			"

												Fantastic game.  It's got Batman's combat, but improved.  It's got Assassin Creed gameplay mechanics and format.  And it has a splash of the Skyrim atmosphere.  It's been a long time since I experienced such satisfying combat.  The Nemisis system is fantastic.  It makes losing just as fun as losing.  People don't understand it when I tell them I'm happy with being a loser.  I've got about 20 hours logged in the game at this point and I just finished act 1 of 2 acts.  Of course, about half of that is just from running around collecting things, picking fights with orks and side missions.  The slave missions with bonus objectives are my favorite.  So overall, I think it's going to be a long game that's replayable.			"

												I thought this was going to be some boring Open world GTA remake. At first it very much felt that way. It was not till after I died the first time and saw the horde increase in their level and skill. The guy who killed me remembered me and somehow killed me again. He got stronger.... and before I knew it I was playing ONLY to get back and kill that damn orc. My failure made him super tough and strong and he became an Orc god. This depth was so simple but was enough to catch me and keep me playing. I have since started playing the story but always look out for a chance to try and kill that damn orc who killed me from the start. He is immume to everything since I died to him 10 times!			"

The story is in some ways original and your typical fantasy style but interesting enough to make you want to continue and see what's beyond the next horizon.  New abilities are given at a fair pace and are fun to see how many ways you can destroy your enemies.  I haven't had any technical issues or performance issues with the game.  I use an Xbox 360 Controller and it works flawlessly with no lag or issues.  The stealth elements aren't new to anybody but the penalty for being caught means you are SWARMED, with literal HORDES at times, for a simple miss step, and it can make for a very pulse pounding experience when you are in an Uruk stronghold trying to avoid an archer seeing you before you take him out so he doesn't sound the alarm and unload a metric f*ckton of Uruks ready to coat their weapons in  a few gallons of human plasma.  I give it an 8/10 as it does get a bit repetitive like most games these days, but I will edit this review after some DLC content comes out and it perhaps expands an already promising continued experience.  To put it in another way, I have been a gamer on Steam for almost 5 years and this is the first game I actuall felt deserved a fair and honest review.

												Shadow of mordor is Badass to say the least the nemesis system works perfectly making every encounter different.This game has an enteresting story to tell and an emmensly fun open world to explore with badass orc strongholds filled with  little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, captains and sometimes even warchiefs. This game has in my opinion the best hand to hand combat system I have ever used taking Ideas like its instant parry from assassins creed and the combos from batman arkham franchise. It actually takes alot from the ac series like climbing and parkour, taking parts from batman arkham like the stealth and the bulk of the combat and it even takes from the new tomb raider with the collectables each thing telling its own story. This game was almost perfect and if they added these 5 things it could have been my favorite game of all time its already soo close.1. give the plants different uses for example the blue one refills the stamina, the green heals you, the yellow makes your weapons deal more damage and red makes you faster. Also adding crafting with scavenged materials would be awesome2. instead of having graugs and caragors use  different animals from the tolkien universe that are more popular like wargs and cave trolls 3. add dragons yes maybe alot to ask but you cannot deny the badass idea of it, a dragon in each part of the map how badass would that be like the ultimate boss battle4. have ally camps like three camps per location one for elves, one for dwarves, and one for humans. Each camp would have a blacksmith shop where you could by upgrades for weapons and armor that are not mystical but made from leather and metal these upgrades would change your appearance. Also each camp would have a mission that would help the camp making it upgraded and ready to take mordor.5. a third location, in this game there are 2 maps one the sea of nurnun and the other is uden but the third location would be really dark there would be volcanoes smoke fire incredbly op enemies a place drowned in evil this would be the last location you head tothe 5 things I have mentioned where things wanted added but where not needed to make this game great it is well worth the price and in a bit of time when more dlc is released it will be worth buying the premium edition. I give this game a 9/10 "

												Of all the LoTR games throughout the years, this one definitely tops them all.  From combat, to story, to skill mechanics, the game beats out all previous installments.  SoM does a great job putting you in the world of Middle Earth while also keeping you specifically out of the direct story line of the LoTR, breathing into it a fresh perspective on the game.You play in 3rd person mode and wade through waves of Orcs as you seek to uncover the past behind your ghostly friend who constantly appears and shows you how to use your newly unlocked powers.  The world is divided into segments that you can fast travel between in order to complete various quests (divided into two types, story and level up).  Each quest unlocks new runes and skill points.The game is gorgeous, its graphics are some of the best and the combat mechanics are smooth.  There's very little awkward disconnects in the movement, so you will rarely find yourself looking at fights and wondering how an orc swung his axe 2 feet off from where you are and still hit you.  That being said, the difficulty becomes broken once you're leveled your skills up to a certain point.  Skills like being able to counter by simply tapping the right mouse button when you see the icon means with a little practice you are mostly untouchable.  Add to this some very over powered combos that you can unlock and you're basically the bane of all orcs existence.  This is fun so long as you weren't hoping for a challenge throughout the entire game.  This also can add replay value if you just enjoy wading through enemies and seeing how ridiculous your combo can be.Overall, the game is engaging and learning how to link together your skills in order to master the art of slaughtering orcs is fun.  If you always wished you could be plopped into the epic battles you see in the LoTR movies, this is as close as you're going to get.  If the developers balanced the skills and added a little more variety into the world, this game would be a shining beacon for all other games in the series to aspire to.  Definitely worth the money!			"

Would have liked a bit more of an open story along the lines of the way Skyrim is built,  but it is still awesome nonetheless. pros;-nemesis system-visuals-finisher moves-storycons;-a bit too linear for me, i was hoping it'd have a more open storyline but so far it seems quite paved for you.Overall I have no regrets purchasing this game. 9.5/10 if it had a more open storyline like Skyrim for example it'd be an easy 10/10 from me.

Product received for free
												I first read the Lord of the Rings as a six year old and I wanted to be a Ranger. Now I can. The combat is mostly smooth and engaging and fun - how many other games can you really fight twenty orcs at the same time? However, there is an apparent bug with the dodge function when using a keyboard, namely that dodge doesn't always work. Other than than I have zero issues. Much better than the Batman games, which were pretty dang good.			"

												This review is long, but please bare with me.  Let me start this review by saying that I am NOT an actual ""fan"" of LOTR, shocking I know, lmao!  I DO love fantasy and RPG elements though.  With that being said I debated on getting this game for close to a week before I clicked ""Add to Cart"" and hoped I wasn't disappointed.  MY GOD WAS I NOT!  This game, while not at all groundbreaking, has fantastic elements and in my opinion extremely fluid combat similar, AND BETTER, than the Batman Arkham series.  The story is in some ways original and your typical fantasy style but interesting enough to make you want to continue and see what's beyond the next horizon.  New abilities are given at a fair pace and are fun to see how many ways you can destroy your enemies.  I haven't had any technical issues or performance issues with the game.  I use an Xbox 360 Controller and it works flawlessly with no lag or issues.  The stealth elements aren't new to anybody but the penalty for being caught means you are SWARMED, with literal HORDES at times, for a simple miss step, and it can make for a very pulse pounding experience when you are in an Uruk stronghold trying to avoid an archer seeing you before you take him out so he doesn't sound the alarm and unload a metric f*ckton of Uruks ready to coat their weapons in  a few gallons of human plasma.  I give it an 8/10 as it does get a bit repetitive like most games these days, but I will edit this review after some DLC content comes out and it perhaps expands an already promising continued experience.  To put it in another way, I have been a gamer on Steam for almost 5 years and this is the first game I actuall felt deserved a fair and honest review.  I don't give a flying purple Smurf sh*t what anyone says, this game is more than deserving of a fair shake.  Happy gaming!			"

												This game is incredible in appearance and gameplay. It blends so many great features of other games (like AC for example) into one, although feeling robbed at the end it was an enjoyable experience due to the exemplary gameplay and awesome weapon upgrades obtainable from killing Urak chiefs. These chiefs, captains, ect, offer a great diversity in personality, combat styles and appearance. Most of them are how you'd expect the stereotypical orc (essentially are them) would be, humourous and dim witted. If you are purchasing the game for the boss fights, you will be dissapointed unfortunately.  these are anti climatic and feel incredibly easy. I would award this game an 90 out of 100, simply brilliant.			"

												""Hey, someone got Assassins Creed in my Arkham Asylum""I have nothing but good to say about this game, although a little buggy sometimes - it works well for a multi-platform release. 2 things struck me about this title, the graphics and the content. The graphics while at their base are quite nice, once you download the HD content pack it becomes quite stunning. It's a must if you host a mighty machine. Secondly, the content right out the gate is quite surprising. This game could easily keep you busy for 30 hours if you work your way through all the side missions. Another huge plus to this game is the multiple ways you can develop your character, offering ways to level Wraith, Talion or even your individual weapons with runes. While I'm still playing through the main quest line I feel comfortable enough to give this game a solid recommendation for most players.			"

												I thought this was going to be some boring Open world GTA remake. At first it very much felt that way. It was not till after I died the first time and saw the horde increase in their level and skill. The guy who killed me remembered me and somehow killed me again. He got stronger.... and before I knew it I was playing ONLY to get back and kill that damn orc. My failure made him super tough and strong and he became an Orc god. This depth was so simple but was enough to catch me and keep me playing. I have since started playing the story but always look out for a chance to try and kill that damn orc who killed me from the start. He is immume to everything since I died to him 10 times!			"

												I finished the game in 25 hours, did all the survival challenges and hunts, collected all the stuff! And so on.My overall experience was very glitch and bug free, though I did encounter some here and there.The animations are extremely well done and beautiful to watch but after awhile, I had seen them all.Combat is fluid and far better than the combat in the Batman games which are known for its wonderful combat.That they are using code and animations from the Assassin's Creed series is blatantly obvious from the moment you start climbing, I even think I noticed some during combat. However, I don't care as the game is very enjoyable.Graphically, it was quite pleasing to the eye and I am very impressed with how incredible the game looked and ran on my computer. (I played on the highest setting)Now onto sound, which is more my thing:The voice acting is extremely good, but don't expect actors from the movies to show up with a voice role, which annoyed me for one scene when you get to...familiarize yourself with an Istari, without giving too much away.After awhile, I swear the same actor did all the Uruks and that annoyed me. I also began to hear the same voice being used for two different Captains amongst the Uruks. Overall though, the VO is top dollah, as they say.The sound design work is familiar to the work done on the movies which was a relief. I heard many references that the sound designer did to keep it in the same field as the films which was sounds that you heard for instance during the reforging of the tower, and the wraith world (Frodo puts on the ring and he enters that domain.)The sounds of the Caragor were great and a lot of detail went into making them interesting and overall believable. I think I hear a seal in there for them during their running animations.The combat sound work was a little bit disappointing as there is no power behind the hits of the swords, however, for the executions, there's some great work in both sound design and mixing happening from the engine, to emphasize the brutality of the animation.I enjoyed the various sounds for Talion's abilities that made you feel powerful and always in control, which is to me, the most important with good sound work.Music:They did not flat out copy or just slap on some Howard Shore and call it a day. There are some great original work in here channeling the spirit of Howard Shore but it goes way beyond that. I enjoyed that they combined musical stingers with the combat when you did well. I enjoyed the opening song the most, which I also think was the main theme of the game.A chant in black speech saying the oh so familiar phrases: ""One ring to rule them -"" etc.I hope to hear the composer work in other games, because he quickly rose amongst my favorites, just stop and take a listen.Gameplay:Though I enjoyed some of the side-missions at first, they become quickly redundant and boring, it is like they never learned to make good side quests from the mistake of others. That being said, the main quests were enjoyable in nature. I particularly enjoyed a part of the game where you meet a new character who lost his partner and is out looking for a nasty beast. That part was best due to the chemistry of the actor and that it took away from the awful washed out main story. If I played again, I would just avoid doing all the side stuff except the weapon challenges, though there is some interesting memory audio that plays when you collect the objects, you get nothing else from it other than some coins that you can use to upgrade your skills. I was fairly disappointed at that but I guess being able to upgrade stuff is good. Though I got coins by just killing Uruk, which was a far more enjoyable part.The nemesis system is where the game truly shines. I encountered an Uruk I had left for a Caragor to munch on, only to hear him moan about it later and hating me for it. This is a system I hope more games will learn from and use because it was extremely enjoyable to both see and hear the results of what you did to them.Another thing I enjoyed was that the Uruks became more powerful when you died and the political backstabbing they did to each other was hilarious. They rose in power and rank, it was glorious!Like I said, I hope other games incorporate the nemesis system because it was the best part of the entire gameplay experience.They got some stuff to learn in terms of side-quests but else, I think the gameplay was fun.Story:The story and the pacing of the story is, imo, horrible.When you begin, you are thrown into it so quickly, you have no idea why it is happening and it doesn't give you room to breathe which is very important in making a good intro.It is the typical revenge story we have seen so many times over and specially in fantasy. It doesn't try to stand on its own two feet by trying to tell a different kind of story, just rehashing tried and true formulas in story telling which is by now so overly done it smells like grandpa's old socks.I did enjoy that the story for the Wraith and figuring out who he was. He is a huge character amongst LOTR fanatics and I think it might be the reason he was picked for this part. He serves it well but keep in mind that it is off-canon.Very disappointed by the fact that the main character is a Ranger and that they didn't try to make him something completely different. Also the name Talion is horrid; in fantasy we find names that end with ""ion"" so often it is by now lazy writing in their part. I cannot write much about the story without giving too much away but the writing will sometimes rehash a lot of what the movie writers wrote. You will hear direct quotes from the films every now and again which is silly when they happen. Of course the obligatory: ""Fly, you fool!"" is heard, though that is copied directly from the pen ship of Tolkien, which I don't mind as much.It is a game  you don't go in for the story, but the background work which Tolkien gave his world. I really enjoyed seeing Morgai flies and hearing about it from the Uruks in their idle chatter.Overall: 8/10Great combat, sound, graphics and animations. Nemesis system is the best partBoring story, main character and side-quest designs.			"

												Having completed this game's story in 11 hours, I feel it's time for a worthwhile review. Spoilers below.I've been a huge fan of Tolkien's Universe since I was little; I've read the Silmarillion, the Unfinished Tales, all three Books and the Hobbit so many times I've lost count. I've also been privelidged to have been part of a very fine role-playing community on  The Lord of the Rings: Online where I wrote Elven RP guides for the community, and participated in server-wide RP events. Safe to say, I like my Tolkien experiences to stay true to the books. That goes for the games, too. Hence why I often take a wide berth from most, since they all diverge at some point away from the source material.Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is one of those games that I wouldn't initially play; I've seen the gameplay footage trailers, and spoke with friends who got the game before me. Ultimately, I went ahead and purchased it because (against my better judgement) I wanted to experience a Middle-earth tale. On that subject I am quite...strained.You take the role of Talion, a Gondorian Ranger who was part of the Durthang-Morannon watch; a Númenorian 'guard' intent on keeping all the Evil of Mordor within the boundaries, since Sauron's defeat in the year 3441 of the Second Age. The Gondorian's have let their watch over the Dark Lands slip since the Kin-strife (a disastrous civil-war in Gondor), allowing the nine Ringwraiths to sneak back in and begin rebuilding their Dark Lord's domain. Sauron, after being driven from Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, returns to Mordor in the year 2942 of the Third Age - attacking the garrisons at Durthang and on the Black Gate, easily overwhelming them. Talion and his wife and son are killed in the assault, but a mysterious wraith appears to him - in Elven attire - announcing that he cannot die. With revenge in his heart, Talion seeks to strike out at the Dark Lord and all who follow him.At this point I must digress and critique the 'lore-friendliness' that Warner Bros. have built this game upon. While they do stick to certain accurate parts of the story, they take the liberty (for the sake of story-telling, of course) by reinventing the great Elven smith Celebrimbor, the Elf who forged the Rings of Power (all except the One, who Sauron alone had a hand in making). WB attempt to write Celebrimbor into the creation of the One by making him the smith that engraved the now-famous phrase in Tengwar along the rim of the ring. Furthermore, WB attempt to tell the tale of how Celebrimbor stole the One and used it to gather an Orc army, unnoticed, to challenge Sauron. For the sake of story-telling, I let this slide as it does give an interesting tale for the game to play - but it's a stark contrast from how Celebrimbor was actually tortured, murdered and his body paraded with arrows shot into it around Eregion (the Elven realm next to Moria).The gameplay is quite reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, but a lot more cruder. It has a specific 'action hack-n-slash' feel to it, but by combining the fun Orc Captains feature, makes each playthrough unique and unexpected. There's a lot of deadpan humour in this game, often from the Uruks themselves, but sometimes from Talion (berating a Dwarf, anybody?). Each enemy is unique, has such hated and are very well acted out that the game actually makes you resent them. Topped with a grand amount of side-quests and collectibles, it's easy to lose some hours in this game just by exploring.I've not ran into any bugs at all, surprisingly, for a game so new. Some of the missions are quite hard, and I've had to repeat them several times, but other than that I have no faults.Lore-friendliness: 3/10Story: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10			"

												I know everyone has heard this a million times but think Batman: Arkham style combat with some Red Dead Redemption-esque slow motion ranged shooting, and an Assassins Creed style stealth and parkour system. It was basically all that put together and polished to make the gameplay really fun. Story was interesting but the ending was pretty terrible and after awhile the fights become underwhelming, especially the final 2 missions. I really enjoyed the Nemesis System and what it added to a game, especially when I would think I had killed a captain and it turns out he survived and hunted me down for vengeance. All in all, it was super fun and I highly recommend it.			"

												One of the most immersive games I've played in a while. Story telling is good, very J.R.R. Tolkien like but still so far from it. It has a solid main story with very good voice actors behind it, they bring the story itself to life.The gameplay is lots of fun, combat system is like Assassin's Creed meets Batman. So expect very detailed, timing based hack 'n' slash experience while slaying as many Ûruk-hai Orc's as you want to. You can also wallclimb and unlock wraith towers similiar to Assassin's Creeds eagle points. Also as mentioned earlier, you can raze your way across Mordor if you wish to,- and believe me. It is damn fun.Graphics of this game are astonishing. I never seize to be amazed by the light effects that swindle across my sword all the time. It's hypnotizing. The whole in-game world of Mordor is beautifully made and the weather conditions are rude, but turn the world into even more darker place than it was before. I have not played this game with Keyboard + Mouse combo, so on that behalf I can't really tell you anything. But on controller the game shows it's true potential.5/5 would buy again.			"

Posted: October 2, 2014
												Hello everyone. Time for me to go into another review!(This part might hold some minor beginning story spoilers.)Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open world RPG style game in which you play as the Gondorian Ranger Talion, one of the only remaining soldiers to guard the Black Gate. The beginning story is a little sharded and fragmented as the game needs to hold true to canon, but hey that's what you get for having a game with an already pre-determined lore, right?Anyway, the Black Hand of Sauron sacrifices Talion and his entire family as a sort of curse for reasons I don't really understand...I mean he sacrificed you and your family to become one with the wraith himself but instead it went inside you, and now you have all of the skills that this king had in life. Why exactly did it go to you and not him? That's not explained, but whatever, the rest of the story's still good.Your job now is to, as an undying super soldier of Gondor, hunt down Uruk and Orc captains/warchiefs and use some super magic mind reader magic to find out what they know about other captains and warchiefs and the Black Hand, so you can find him and make him undo the curse so you can find rest.Now how's the controls and gameplay in the game? Honestly, I want to say good, but I feel they could've used A LOT of work! The controls are choppy and hard to manage, and require quite a bit of controller finesse in order to get you through a simple doorway. Considering how fast paced and merciless this game's combat is, I'd like to have some very polished, crisp controls to at least not make my controller be a handicap. That'd be great!Sometimes your character will also decide to just do his own thing; Lets say an enemy Orc is to your right on the screen, and there's another to the left. Let's say you want to attack the one on the right first. So you push the control stick to the right and push X. 8/10 the character will go for the right...But 2/10 he'll go up down or left...Now that might not be such a big deal, but when the aforementioned enemy on the right is charging up for an attack with you having only enough HP for 1 more hit, and your character doesn't stop him? That has made me throw my controller on occassion. It's a death,  which shouldn't have happened. Hardware should never be a wall between you and game progress.Your character also seems very fond of walls...There's a sneak feature(Really cool btw, I LOVE the Stealth in this game), which lets you slink around corners and stuff, and pull off some pretty impressive ""Neener nee you didn't see me! *Sticks tongue out!*"" moments, but sometimes you get a little ahead of yourself and you need to pull a super fast U turn and get back to your corner in the darkness to avoid being spotted by a guard. Well, chances are your characters' irresistable love for hugging walls gets in the way. If you're even an in-game foot or so off and end up running a little into the wall before getting around the corner, your character will hug it, and it's A LOT easier to get 'into' the corner hugging thing, than it is to get back out.This 'auto wall hug' feature has ruined several, otherwise flawless stealth runs in a stronghold, and has also led to some Controller abuse.The quest system can be a bit repetitive, the same objectives in different locations etc. However, as poor as I may think the repetitive quest system is? The execution of the missions, aka going from start to finish in them, can be insanely fun! You can choose to be all sneaky with a bow and be all Legolas like and strive for nothing but headshots etc, or you can go in stealth like with a dagger, or berserker style with a large sword. Sadly there's not really any magic in this game, no mage stuff for you *Sadface*Be that as it may, though. The game has a fantastic difficulty system lined up. There is no real 'easy, medium, hard' cookie cutter selection to choose at the start of the game. Instead of that, they seriously upped the bar of standards with the idea of giving the AI skills and abilities just like you! Some I can remember off the top of my head are:Fears(Such as fear of Carabors, or Ghuls, etc. The Uruk will pretty much flee at the sight of the specific unit in question. Alternatively, fears have a corresponding strength version)Hate(Such as hate of Carabors, or Ghuls, etc. This is the polar opposite of Fears. Instead of fleeing like a frightened cat, the sight of the specific unit will enrage them, making them harder to kill)Weakness/Critical Weakness(Such as to Stealth, ranged, melee, mounted attacks etc. If an Uruk has a weakness to something, it means they can take damage from it, however, if its a critical weakness, they can be one hit killed by the type in question. Say a Captain has a critical weakness to stealth, as well as a regular weakness to ranged. He can be regularly damaged by ranged, but a Stealth attack? Will instantly kill him. Very useful!)Immunities(Polar opposite to weaknesses. Immunities will make it impossible for you to ever damage them with this type. An uruk with immunity to Stealth attacks cannot ever by caught off guard. They are impossible to quietly kill.)The list goes on with Poison weapons, small or large warbands of supporters, bodyguards, stealth awareness, etc. etc. etc. The list is impressively long.These lists of attributes however, and here's the fun part: They're INVISIBLE TO YOU! You don't know exactly what strengths or weaknesses a captain or warchief might have, making it hard to plan a good assault! Of course there's a way to discover these attributes! remember when I mentioned the magic mind meld ability you can use to read their minds? Well it comes in handy here! You can use it on 2 kinds of enemies: uruk Captains, or 'worms'. Uruk captains need no explanation, but Worms are lesser Uruk with more knowledge than they should have. Sort of a 'messenger' if you will. If you can catch them off guard and read their minds, you get to choose an Uruk captain, and instantly learn his weaknesses and/or strengths! If it is an unknown Captain(An enemy you havn't faced yet), you can discover their identity, location, and weaknesses etc. rather than having to do it yourself. Intelligence and information are incredibly important in this game.The graphics are outstanding, the voice acting is par none, I mean this voice acting is some Grade A Epic Stuff, seriously. The people in charge of sound and ambience and voice acting etc. seriously needs a medal or something, cause it was believable, and it made the RP in the RPG seriously easier to agree with. Sadly you don't get dialogues though, so I guess it is more Action/Adventure, and less RPG, but eh, there aren't that many differences between the 2(3).So, how will I rate this game?Story:★ ★ ★ ★ ✰Room for improvement, and some fragmented bits here and there, but overall the story is solid, and merges well with the  pre-existing canon!Gameplay:★ ★ ★ ✰ ✰More room for improvement. Some aspects are cool and fun, but it just doesn't quite make up for how poor the controls are. Very frustrating, choppy character control, difficult to maneuver accurately.Sound:★ ★ ★ ★ ★Perfection incarnate. The sound in this game, and the voice acting, is simply perfection.Graphics:★ ★ ★ ★ ✰I'd give the graphics 5/5, but it gets 4 cause your average every day gaming computer will not be able to handle more than low settings across the board. It takes a high end machine to run it at high or ultra.Overall Score:★ ★ ★ ★ ✰A fantastic game with a few drawbacks and the occassional annoying glitch, but eventually fixed glitches aside, the game is worth it if you're a fan of Lord of the Rings and have some cash to spend.Do I recommend this game? Yes I do.			"

												Pros :Not bad, but don't misunderstood, it's a pur action game, like Assassin Creeds. Don't think you will play a role game like Skyrim, here you will have to fight, fight, and fight. But it's well rendered, very smooth, and well made, so like an action game, it rocks. You got powers trees, swordman, thief and bowman play style, and the ambiance is the dark mordor of lord of the ring, including lore story parts, golum, orcs, elves, and sauron. Cons :Just it's quite repetitive though, when you're dead, you will respawn at towers, and all enemies are back again. Even if you turn around for a while, enemies are back too, as you are in an undead area at start.  The orcs captain system is very strange, it doesn't add anything to the game : when you kill a boss, or an orc slay you, there's like an orcs boss tree map that is updated, but who care of orcs boss tree map ? Sometimes, the missions are really boring (like find some rare herbs in a small area). And it's a mess to play with keyboard, this game is really designed for consoles. For linux users, you will have to deal with a big bug of bodies not rendered : you should add ""__GL_ShaderPortabilityWarnings=0 %command%"" to the launch options if you got nvidia proprietor driver, as explain in a discussion topic.  So not a bad game, maybe to much repetitive, but around 20 bucks it worth it, as it's nice game though. I recommand it as an action game in a Lord of the ring univers, but don't recommand it if you wanna play a role game (unfortunatly there's no ""mixte"" recommendation). At full price, I don't recommand it though, as it's way to much repetitive. It's not a game you will replay when finished. So the recommend balance is going to No.			"

												It never was so fun to cut, slay, slaughter and butcher orcs of all kinds! Kill them all and their leaders or brand them and  create your own army. Monolith did great job with both Freeflow combat system(plays really smooth) and Nemesis system(brings you a lot od surprises). Stealth and parkour are Assassin's creed style. I recomend this game to LOTR fans and to all fans of great action games.			"

												An orc commander had the chance to finish me off, he said I was not worthy of his blade.Hunted him down after I picked up the pieces of my shattered pride and killed him... or so I thought.Few days later, what was supposed to be an easy mission took on a turn for the worst as the commander ambushed me with his many men, the sense of shock I felt; I cannot describe. Somehow, I won the battle, and carried on.He came back.and again...and again...By the fifth time we met, I had no fear of him: only the desire that the game would let me chop his head off.. and so I did... and my nemesis was no more.9/10 Batman game in LOtR universe.People will ask you if you're playing Assasin's Creed... a lot.

												I'm barely out of the gate, and with six hours on my belt, I'm bloody loving Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.Delicious looking vistas, amazing night-time graphics, and a flowing, familiar yet personalised combat system makes Middle Earth a must-buy. It's a colourful, wide, sprawling game that I apparently have barely touched the surface of, and with the HD textures now downloading I'll see soon the real sqaplendor [(C) thoma5nator] of Mordor in its full glory. The gamepad controls make sense and times when you occaisonally make a mis-leap are few and far between. You can scale Orc masonry with the speed and litheness of a certain eagle-motif'ed protagonist, and he'll show you how to scale walls people, AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A CLIMB LEAP GLOVE!Performance-wise, at near-max on my beefy♥♥♥♥♥non-SLI system I attain at least 90fps in most areas, thanks to Monolith Productions' undying love of the superior gaming platform, although I don't think that will matter much as you'll likely want to play this with a gamepad, so you'll be slamming on dat VSync.

												Shadow of mordor is Badass to say the least the nemesis system works perfectly making every encounter different.This game has an enteresting story to tell and an emmensly fun open world to explore with badass orc strongholds filled with  little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, captains and sometimes even warchiefs. This game has in my opinion the best hand to hand combat system I have ever used taking Ideas like its instant parry from assassins creed and the combos from batman arkham franchise. It actually takes alot from the ac series like climbing and parkour, taking parts from batman arkham like the stealth and the bulk of the combat and it even takes from the new tomb raider with the collectables each thing telling its own story. This game was almost perfect and if they added these 5 things it could have been my favorite game of all time its already soo close.1. give the plants different uses for example the blue one refills the stamina, the green heals you, the yellow makes your weapons deal more damage and red makes you faster. Also adding crafting with scavenged materials would be awesome2. instead of having graugs and caragors use  different animals from the tolkien universe that are more popular like wargs and cave trolls 3. add dragons yes maybe alot to ask but you cannot deny the badass idea of it, a dragon in each part of the map how badass would that be like the ultimate boss battle4. have ally camps like three camps per location one for elves, one for dwarves, and one for humans. Each camp would have a blacksmith shop where you could by upgrades for weapons and armor that are not mystical but made from leather and metal these upgrades would change your appearance. Also each camp would have a mission that would help the camp making it upgraded and ready to take mordor.5. a third location, in this game there are 2 maps one the sea of nurnun and the other is uden but the third location would be really dark there would be volcanoes smoke fire incredbly op enemies a place drowned in evil this would be the last location you head tothe 5 things I have mentioned where things wanted added but where not needed to make this game great it is well worth the price and in a bit of time when more dlc is released it will be worth buying the premium edition. I give this game a 9/10 "

												Of all the LoTR games throughout the years, this one definitely tops them all.  From combat, to story, to skill mechanics, the game beats out all previous installments.  SoM does a great job putting you in the world of Middle Earth while also keeping you specifically out of the direct story line of the LoTR, breathing into it a fresh perspective on the game.You play in 3rd person mode and wade through waves of Orcs as you seek to uncover the past behind your ghostly friend who constantly appears and shows you how to use your newly unlocked powers.  The world is divided into segments that you can fast travel between in order to complete various quests (divided into two types, story and level up).  Each quest unlocks new runes and skill points.The game is gorgeous, its graphics are some of the best and the combat mechanics are smooth.  There's very little awkward disconnects in the movement, so you will rarely find yourself looking at fights and wondering how an orc swung his axe 2 feet off from where you are and still hit you.  That being said, the difficulty becomes broken once you're leveled your skills up to a certain point.  Skills like being able to counter by simply tapping the right mouse button when you see the icon means with a little practice you are mostly untouchable.  Add to this some very over powered combos that you can unlock and you're basically the bane of all orcs existence.  This is fun so long as you weren't hoping for a challenge throughout the entire game.  This also can add replay value if you just enjoy wading through enemies and seeing how ridiculous your combo can be.Overall, the game is engaging and learning how to link together your skills in order to master the art of slaughtering orcs is fun.  If you always wished you could be plopped into the epic battles you see in the LoTR movies, this is as close as you're going to get.  If the developers balanced the skills and added a little more variety into the world, this game would be a shining beacon for all other games in the series to aspire to.  Definitely worth the money!			"

The Nemesis system makes torturing your enemies that much more fun.  Achievements and story completion, even the artificats, are very achieveable goals that don't leave you searching every nook and cranny of the map for hours like with other games.

												This game could possibly be the best open world single play RPG I have ever played. I found the graphic of this game absolutely stunning. Majority of the game play graphic are even look better than the cut scenes. Don't get too scared from the system requirement, i think this game is actually very well optimised. I have a GTX 850M graphic card and INTEL I5 as processor and 4Gb of RAM. It runs on High graphic setting and i set the textures to Ultra . It runs around 55-60 FPS as I capped the FPS to 60 frames per second.The combat system in this game aren't that good, as they are pretty much the same as the Batman series which made by WB games. I'm not saying that the combat systems it self is bad, it just seems bit weird on a game that related to the Lord of the Rings. Also the running, stealth, climbing system are looking like Assassin's Creed which is kinda weird as well. Overall, as a Lord of Rings fan boy, this game just looks awesome to me and i would definitely rate 10/10.Strongly recommended to all the Lord of Rings fans.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, but unfortunately I purchased it when it was brand new and around $50-60, which it is definitely not worth. I played through this game without giving a single thought to the time I was putting into it. I hunted down every single artifact and completed every possible side quest or event with the exception of 2 or 3 that I just didn't feel like messing with by the end of the game. With only 31 hours play time - some of that spent standing around afk, the game is complete.Don't get me wrong, this game is so much fun. It's everything I wished Assasin's Creed would have been. The story was a lot of fun as well. The voice acting is good, and the nemesis system with the orcs is awesome.The ratio of what I paid to the hours of entertainment received is where the game loses out.Wait to pick it up on a decent steam sale and you won't be disappointed. Buy it full price and you might be.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is an open world action game with some elements of RPG.To start things I'l talk about the pros of the game, beware of a few spoilers (I'l try to put as less as I can).1st good point, immersion :So when you open the game, everything is very immersive, even the logos of developpers and such are in theme with the game, and when you begin the story, the background of the main character is well revealed in a tutorial that takes place in a fallen wall at the frontier of Mordor, you learn the basics of combat, stealth, and movement wich are very basic.2nd good point, grafic quality :The game isn't incredibly good looking, but it is pleasing nontheless to see very well made ugly orc faces when you see them up close, and the environment is very well done, making the movement through it very fluid most of the time.3rd good point, gameplay :Maybe the reason you should get this game is the gameplay, its really well done, fun, dynamic, incredibly satisfying in the same way of God of War, but with a lot more of manipulation over your enemies and your own actions, you can choose to ""wraith stun"" and then flurry ennemies with your sword to finish them of with a brutal finisher, knock them out with enough hits and then slice their throat open with your dagger, or make them explode in flames with your bow to then teleport on the survivors and cut their heads off.You can also use stealth to thin your ennemies ranks, climbing up walls to attack from above, and basically do anything like in assassins creed, but in a more satisfying way, and with the option to brand your ennemies and get intel from them so you can plan your next assassination.The movement too is very satisfying in a way, mostly because of stealth mechanics very well implemanted in the game but also because you will soon be looking for every little rock so you can jump over it to get a speed boost.4th good point, the RPG elements :You level up like a classic action RPG, using you skill points to unlock various abilities on a skill tree, varying in wraith abilities or marauder abilities (choosing wich type of abilities you wan't will not change anything in the game), abilities like different finishers with multiple effects on the ennemies, or an increase in the rate of the charging time of your bow.You can also upgrade the number of runes on your weapon (you aquire different runes by killing high ranked orcs) or increasing your max health, focus, and number of arrows you can have at a time.Now that most of the pros are out of the way lets talk about the con of the game.1st and only con, the story (minor spoiler alert) :The story is quite good, you learn about how the rings were forged, who forged them, even a bit about gondor's military, but it doesn't go very far. The main character's motives are clear : vegeance, and the game really makes a good job of telling how he will get his revenge by killing the ""black hand"" of mordor, and everything goes well, he gets help by various people, the first being the wraith that follows him everywhere because of a curse. He quickly finds the first of the three ""black hands"", using a naïve orc as bait, the boss is quite challenging but you don't learn anything about him, he is of no importance except that he killed the hero's family, and then a random girl randomly appears to get him to a  random place where he meets with a random queen... Ok, the queen knows stuff about the wraith (by the way golum helps you get  back the wraiths memories before that but he's not much more than a cameo) and she tells you you can take control of the orcs you find, so you go and find orc leaders and bend them to your will. That queen also tells you to meet a dwarf like its very important but all you do is hunt with him and fight a beast boss so he can get his revenge on it.Then the queen is revealed to have been under Saroumane's control all along and you break the spell on her with the help of her daughter (the random girl) and you go make an army of orcs to bring into mordor and make a little orc genocide.You do all that and the story falls short. You kill a few orc leaders with the help of your own, get to the second black hand, kill him very (VERY) easily, learn that the wraith could have chosen to let you die (OMG PLOT TWIST... not so much), and then you kill more orcs, then confront Sauron, Quick Time Event the♥♥♥♥♥♥outa him aaaaaaaaand the story is over.Thats it, no more LOTR lore for u just enjoy the rest of the game killing orcs and then killing orcs again.It all builds like you're gonna get a badass army battle like in the movies but nope, just a few battles at the end, not even bigger scaled than the normal riots you can create throughout the rest of the game.To wrap it up, the game is very VERY satisfying gameplay wise, but you shouldn't ask for more. The orc hierarchy system is very well done, but the story ♥♥♥♥s it all up.Its still worth playing though, the replayability is definetly very high, there are many sidequests because you can create them youselves, the collectibles are in a good number and each offer little stories, the skill tree is full of usefull stuff you won't get just by finishing the story and you can obtain through side missions enough points to get infinite finishers, arrows and even invisibility all for a limited time as bonus skills.I would recommend the game to people who won't be startled by the lack of lore and story, but are motivated by the fun the game gives (it sure gives a lot of that).Thank you for reading and I hope this review will help you decide yourself as if you want the game or not (it IS made for that after all).

												Is Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor still relevant? YES!OptimizationVery well optimized. On a GTX 960M, 16 GB RAM, and an Intel i-7 processor, this game runs at a solid 60 FPS. No screen tearing, no lagging.Graphics and AnimationsFor a game made in 2014, it has exceptional graphics. Cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous, but, still, the gameplay looks great. But the kill animations are even better. Well, if you like brutal and gorey animations at least. Lots of head chopping and neck bleeding. StoryAt first, I thought this would be a combat based game with no story. It actually had some wonderful story. Yes, it only takes about 12 hours to complete, but the character development is so rich. It makes you think about the things which happened. GameplayNot much of a challenge. It's a casual man's game. If you want challenge, get Dark Souls. Still, this game has a great stealth and movement system and a wonderful and gorey combat system. You can also customize Talion's abilities the way you want. In all, deep and great gameplay.ConclusionA must play. It may be a bit expensive (USD$50), but I think it's worth getting. Now, if you want more of something like this, I'd recommend Skyrim (for uber casuals) or Dark Souls (for tryhards).EDIT: April 25, 2016: One more thing. The side missions. I did not feel obliged to do them in any way. I was strong enough to do all of the main missions without doing any of the side missions (You earn XP and basically strength from side missions, but I felt that this wasn't necessary).			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a ton of fun. To describe it as part Batman (combat and character upgrades) and part Assassin's Creed (world and mission structure) would be a disservice, as it manages to be better than the sum of its parts. The much-touted nemesis system is an achievement and adds a never before seen dynamic to the open world formula. It's the most dynamic open world game I've played as you can play the with nemesis system seemingly indefinitely, as you fight orc captains and disrupt the military structure of Sauron's army. Halfway through the game you gain the ability to brand enemies which puts them under your control, pitting your orcs against Sauron's. As someone that was skeptical of the marketing that always surrounds games like this, I was pleasantly surprised how well the nemesis actually works.Orcs that were not killed by decapitation may come back from the dead more powerful seeking revenge (orcs are resilient, if nothing else). Orcs will kill you and level up, becoming captains themselves if they weren't one already. You will likely run into a captain or warchief that continuously bests you and develop a deep desire to get revenge, and when you finally do you will yell at your screen in satisfaction. The orc army will fight amongst itself and generate random events for you to disrupt the balance of power. It's all very, very cool. The amount of work that must've gone into it is staggering.The story isn't anything special and mostly serves as a MacGuffin for you to interact with the nemesis system. It's serviceable, with excellent voice acting, but remains a fairly typical revenge story. I have no idea how it fits in with the LOTR canon but I'm sure it takes many liberties.The graphics are nice but not groundbreaking. Mordor looks like Mordor and as such is mostly a brown wasteland. It's a pretty wasteland, but a wasteland nonetheless. There is a second map that is much more lush and green and is welcome change from the first map. I think the VRAM requirements they stated were highballed since I'm able to play with a mix of high and ultra settings on my 2GB GTX 670 at 60fps 95% of the time (textures on High, using adaptive vsync). Animations are top notch and make you feel like a total f-ing badass. The combat animations aren't as smooth as Batman since the combat is more forgiving as lets you counter mid-animation. This can cause some quick and unnatural movements that serve the gameplay more than the visuals.Climbing is similar to Assassin's Creed but quicker and simpler since your character can jump longer distances and move much faster. Traversal is easy but sometimes the camera runs into problems or you will fight with the multi-purpose buttons (drop and stealth brand are bound to the same thing, as are stealth brutalize [a kill move] and distract).The music and sound design is excellent especially in combat. The sound FX for executions and certain powers are awesome and make you feel that much more badass.Overall I think Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game and I hope it does very well for WB and Monolith. I would love to see more games using the nemesis system. I think that from now on any open world game without it will seem stale in comparison.TL;DR: I would highly recommend playing this game.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time.Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a new addition to the Lord of the Rings universe.I have had this game for a very long time now, and have beaten almost every single thing in the game.I had a review of this game up prior to this review, but I deleted it to make a brand new one.First of all, this is the best game I have ever played. Honestly.I have played many games in the past, but this is my number 1. It has everything you want it to have plus more.Other than the main story, there are many side quests and other things to do to keep you busy. I only dunked 25 hours into this game so far, and I still have a few more things to do plus more DLC to download and finish.If you are getting the game, please get the season pass. You won't regret it.			"

												(tl;dr Skip to the bottom for Pros + Cons)Shadow of Mordor is the open world game we've been waiting for. It uses the Arkham games free flow system with the Assassin's Creed open world. Its a perfect mixture of the two that creates such an amazing game. The combat is very fluid and incrediebly responsive. The open world is large with many side missions and collectibles. The crown jewel of this game is the Nemesis System. To put it in basic term, every Orc you face will remeber who you are. So if you get killed by an Orc, then when you go back for a rematch they'll remeber that they killed you and they'll remeber details of the battle. Its unbelievable how well this system works. Each Orc looks different and has their own strengths and weakensses that you can expliot by capturing other Orcs and compelling them to tell you about their captain. The main story is very good. Troy Baker once again delivers an amazing experience by voicing the main character. Sadly we didn't see much of Nolan North even though he was supposed to be the main baddie. Side missions are fun and challenging. Each has a goal for you to do, like kill 10 Orcs with stealth while not alerting anyone. And each missions has a bonus option that will give you extra XP. Now there are some bad parts of the game. The game is optimzied but it still has its hicups when fighting large amounts of enemies. Also, the cutscenes, even on Ultra, are very low quality. The boss battles are very easy, which is something that shocked me. The Warchief battles or even a nemesis battle can be pretty hard, but the 3 main boss battles were basic and somewhat boring. Pros: 1. Amazing open world2. Fluid Combat System3. Great voice acting and story4. The Nemesis SystemCons:1. Low Quality Cutscenes2. Bad Performance in some areas3. Simple boss battlesAll in all, this game is hands down one of the best I've seen this year. I cannot wait for the DLC to come out. I really hope this game gets a sequel, cause this is probably my favorite LOTR game ever. 8.5/10 "

												It never was so fun to cut, slay, slaughter and butcher orcs of all kinds! Kill them all and their leaders or brand them and  create your own army. Monolith did great job with both Freeflow combat system(plays really smooth) and Nemesis system(brings you a lot od surprises). Stealth and parkour are Assassin's creed style. I recomend this game to LOTR fans and to all fans of great action games.			"

												IMHO, this is a masterpiece. Pros:- The story is good, it keeps you attached to the seat until the very end (and makes you hope for a sequel).- Fighting has never been so much fun. When reaching the end you really feel like a swordmaster, being able to overcome over 20 orcs at a time!- Graphic is still great despite a few years have passed: Mordor's land has never been so alive, and characters animations are just about perfect and never feel unnatural.- Audio compartment is great; nothing remarkable, but everything works really well.- DLC content is good and worthy of being played.- Learning curve is optimal, difficulty level never too hard or easy.Cons:- Game mechanics are be partly ""borrowed"" from Assassin's Creed.- The CG animations are not steady in terms of quality - sometimes they look and feel a little outdated.- No Multiplayer.I would give this a 9/10.

												This game starts out so promising but your character quickly becomes so OP it's laughable. I really enjoyed running around and killing the enemies in part one (didn't realize you can't kill them all before they respawn) but this was my main mistake. By the time I got to part two my character was so OP the game was a joke. The three final boss battles are two push button scenes and a 5 v 5 warcheif battle. I was hoping that when I took over the warcheifs I would be fighting a real war against Sauron, instead it ended with such a letdown. The first 15 or so hours were GREAT and since I bought it on sale made the game totally worth it. Going into a stronghold and slaughtering hundreds of orcs is a great stress reliever. The ending, while giving closure, should've been much harder. 8/10.			"

												God, I love this game. The combat is smooth, flowing and captures the fluidity of the way the elves fight in the movies perfectly. The stealth is very enjoyable, if a little similar to Assassin's Creed, but it's great to pick off Uruks one by one as they steadily discover more and more bodies. The nemesis system is, of course, very damn cool and allows you to carve your own stories, finally killing that Uruk that has killed you time and time again and feeling an epic sense of revenge and accomplishment. The story is pretty good too, and the graphics are incredible- I can, personally, keep a consistent 90fps, however sometimes I experienced random and severe framerate drops. 9.7/10			"

												At the time of writing this review, I have just completed the game. Not 100% achievement (actually far from, sitting at 34%), but story and all. The journey was fantastic, gameplay addicting, and it kept me wanting more. That's good, as I have a library of 650+ titles and there are few that seem to continually grab my attention like this one has.So take it from me - it's well worth playing, even if you don't 100% it.

												This is a really fun game. I was quite pleasently surprised. Of course it helps, if you really like the world of Middle-earth. The game is basically a playground to mess with orcs. Seriously, I spent quite a lot of time just messing with the captains and orcs, instead of doing quests.It's not perfect though. While the nemesis system is awesome, it sort of falls apart when you get most of the skills and powers, because you become to powerfull and all the orcs just die or you brand them. At the beginning of the game, there was one captain I encountered and defeated 4 times (actually, he was a psycho and kept following me) and each time he had more of his face bandaged, was more furious. It was funny and awesome at the same time. SPOILER: Plus he became on of the bosses at the end, which was like a high school reunion. Hey, you're that guy I kept shoving in the locker. Good times!! END SPOILER.I think that if you enjoy the LOTR movies, you'll also enjoy this.Edit: Ok, update on the difficulty of the game. Play the Bright Lord dlc, the game gets hard. Sure it's lowered if you use the One ring power, but when it's gone. And all those berserkers and defenders. I really suck at dodging..... Ugh. Great game.			"

												I got this game for Christmas (the 24'th as I live in Denmark) and finished it today at two minutes past twelve on New Years Eve (it finished installing the 26'th as I wasn't home for Christmas). It is a seriously enjoyable game and now I'm only missing a very small amount of side quests (I have completed all the side quest to do with the bow, sword and dagger in the game, and am only missing 3-4 quests to do with saving slaves and am at the hunting challenge 9). I have spent 47 hours completing the game and have enjoyed every second of it! I really love the nemesis system as it makes every encounter with a captain or warchief memorable. I also like all the lore you can find by collecting the artifacts and that they have used tso many facts from the books. All in all I rate it a big 10/10			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a good game all in all.However, it also includes the same kind of collect-a-thon which Ubisoft games always include.My recomendation: play the base game, don´t play the dlc´s cuz they all suck. How much do they suck? Well basicly you get a little bit more of story but it´s only some things you´ve already experienced in the base game, or some stupid story about a hunt which is just stupid.Also, the dlc´s let´s you do the same kind of thing that you did in the base game. Not worth it.			"

												Superb game, very fun.  Looks beautiful especially with the dynamic weather.  The story is good and the nemesis system works really well.  There is varied gameplay with side missions a plenty and if you feel like it, jut run around killing the Uruk-Hai.  There are skill tree's which you have to earn XP for to unlock to improve your moves and unlock extra ones to make the combat varied when you do get into a struggle against more than one captain.  There are also runes which you can equip on your weapons to improve various different stats.  The game is very well optimised unlike some games which have been released this year and works very well at 1440p with an AMD R9 290 gpu, achieving over 60 fps.  If you enjoy both the batman and assassins creed series of games you should enjoy this game as it mixes different elements of the two together very well.  All in all I would have to award this game as my game of the year for 2014.			"

												An orc commander had the chance to finish me off, he said I was not worthy of his blade.Hunted him down after I picked up the pieces of my shattered pride and killed him... or so I thought.Few days later, what was supposed to be an easy mission took on a turn for the worst as the commander ambushed me with his many men, the sense of shock I felt; I cannot describe. Somehow, I won the battle, and carried on.He came back.and again...and again...By the fifth time we met, I had no fear of him: only the desire that the game would let me chop his head off.. and so I did... and my nemesis was no more.9/10 Batman game in LOtR universe.People will ask you if you're playing Assasin's Creed... a lot.

												I'm barely out of the gate, and with six hours on my belt, I'm bloody loving Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.Delicious looking vistas, amazing night-time graphics, and a flowing, familiar yet personalised combat system makes Middle Earth a must-buy. It's a colourful, wide, sprawling game that I apparently have barely touched the surface of, and with the HD textures now downloading I'll see soon the real sqaplendor [(C) thoma5nator] of Mordor in its full glory. The gamepad controls make sense and times when you occaisonally make a mis-leap are few and far between. You can scale Orc masonry with the speed and litheness of a certain eagle-motif'ed protagonist, and he'll show you how to scale walls people, AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A CLIMB LEAP GLOVE!Performance-wise, at near-max on my beefy♥♥♥♥♥non-SLI system I attain at least 90fps in most areas, thanks to Monolith Productions' undying love of the superior gaming platform, although I don't think that will matter much as you'll likely want to play this with a gamepad, so you'll be slamming on dat VSync.

												If you'd have asked me what I thought of Shadow of Mordor in the first 10 hours I would of told you I loved it - a well refined, fun and atmospheric game. I found myself so involved I wanted to read all the appendices and complete all the side activities. The combat, especially against large groups has a good feel to it and the player progression is rewarding. I also enjoyed the story, at least the first half of it. That's where my problems started, around half way through my 24 hours it began to feel a bit tiresome, the map isn't big (at least not in my opinion) and you find yourself covering the same ground and doing the same things over and over again. At times this is okay because the nemesis system works very well and once you've got a good batch of skills you can have a lot of fun in the combat but overall, as time went on I just wanted it to end. It had used up all its tricks and the better part of the story was over.I'm glad I bought Shadow of Mordor and enjoyed most of my time with it but it went on about 8-10 hours too long, perhaps I shouldn't of done all those side quests! 7/10			"

												LMB+LMB+LMB+LMB+RMB+RMB+LMB+LMB+RMB+LMB+LMB.This game is a hack-and-slash Lord of the Rings themed Batman Game, which is by no means a bad thing.If it wasn't for the 'Sauron's Army' feature as well as the nemesis system, this game would be an average Uruk killing simulator.However, the incredibly innovative Nemesis system allows you to hunt Uruk Masters to free captives and 'beat' a stronghole, but it also allows you to enact revenge on a Uruk that has killed you in the past.The open world aspect of the game is fairly average, due to the lack of iventories there's really no reason for you to explore.However, the Forge Towers are an amazing twist on the 'Fast Travel' system which other RPGs have adapted, unlike Skyrim you cannot fast travel once you'vebeen to that area, instead each region has a Forge Tower, which you climb and once you've reforged at the top, you can fast travel to that region. Very Assassin's Creed esque. Overall, I found this to be a brilliant and enjoyable game, even if you're not persuing the missions for now. It's great to just jump into, run to a stronghold and fight ENDLESS (literally) Uruks who are relentless and never stop.84/100.			"

												Superb game, very fun.  Looks beautiful especially with the dynamic weather.  The story is good and the nemesis system works really well.  There is varied gameplay with side missions a plenty and if you feel like it, jut run around killing the Uruk-Hai.  There are skill tree's which you have to earn XP for to unlock to improve your moves and unlock extra ones to make the combat varied when you do get into a struggle against more than one captain.  There are also runes which you can equip on your weapons to improve various different stats.  The game is very well optimised unlike some games which have been released this year and works very well at 1440p with an AMD R9 290 gpu, achieving over 60 fps.  If you enjoy both the batman and assassins creed series of games you should enjoy this game as it mixes different elements of the two together very well.  All in all I would have to award this game as my game of the year for 2014.			"

												While fighting regular groups of enemies, Captains can show up at any time which is super cool. I’ll be in the middle of this huge war, destroying twenty, fifty, seventy enemies and just when I’m enjoying being a complete badass, some Captain will come in and slap the crap out of me. Then, I’m facing a huge army of common enemies with an all new boss type. But that’s not all, often times in larger battles, more than one Captain will show up. It’s nuts.Read more of my  First Impressions! [germaximus.com]I also wrote up some  Tips & Tricks [germaximus.com] "

Posted: October 2, 2014
												So I've just finished this game and I have to say it is absolutely brilliant! Many people compare the combat to the Arkham games and the parkour to the Assassin's Creed games and while I agree with that, neither feel exactly like said games. I never once thought the parkour felt exactly like the Assassin's Creed games or the fighting felt exactly like the Arkham games, only that they are similar. Both elements feel unique to this game which makes it feel ""new"" rather than ""copied"". As for the story itself I thought it was very interesting, especially as it's set in between the Hobbit and the Lord of The Rings, however if it hadn't been for the nemesis system, side quests and collectibles distracting me, I feel as though the story missions could probably be completed fairly quickly. The nemesis system for those of you who don't know is an extremely cool feature in Shadow of Mordor that randomly generates unique enemies within Sauron's Army. Each enemy has their own name, voice, appearance and personality. I've yet to see the same enemy twice. Their position in Sauron's army can be affected by your actions and/or those of other enemies in side missions called “power struggles” that, if left, progress by themselves over time meaning enemies may level up, gain in power or be killed without you even interfering, it’s all done dynamically. This makes the open world feel much more immersive and alive. What's even cooler is the enemies remember previous encounters with you and mention it on your arrival, so for example, if an enemy escapes near death, when you next face them they will mention their loss from the previous encounter. This makes each encounter feel truly unique and add hours of extra gameplay onto the game. I feel that the nemesis system is a truly unique and addicting element to the game and has done the best job I’ve seen in any game at making each enemy sound, look and act differently rather than using the same model, voice and animations for enemies which is what most games seem to do.If you like the Arkham combat style, the Assassin’s Creed parkour and Lord of the Rings, I have no doubt that you’ll thoroughly enjoy this game. This game combines those elements together and manages to make it feel unique. While the story itself doesn’t appear to be that long, although very good in my opinion, the nemesis system, numerous side quests and collectibles and upgrades and abilities that can be added to your character and weapons, add hours of gameplay to Shadow of Mordor. At the time of this review I’ve played for around 21 hours and I still have loads of side quests to do, collectibles to find, upgrades to buy and will continue to discover new enemies within the nemesis system. In my opinion, this game is brilliant and is definitely worth the money.  "

												This game has given me faith as to the future of LOTR games.  The past ones (in my opinion) have been terrible, and this is finally a well deserved revival.Shadow of Mordor makes use of the expansive world of Middle Earth, and maintains a strong and entertaining storyline, whilst not piggybacking off any of the books (or movies).For comparison, Shadow of Mordor is a beautiful clash of Dark Souls, Assassin's Creed and Mortal Kombat.Explained, SOM contains the tough bosses and minions, along with the fighting style of Dark Souls, the parkour and attack opportunities of Assassin's Creed and the brutality and gore of Mortal Kombat.Some things which are extremely notable are as follows:+ Amazing soundtrack+ Movie-grade voiceacting+ Graphics which are on par with Battlefield 4+ Does NOT require a massive gaming rig to play+ Days of gametime in which a sprawling story unique to the player developsI honestly can't list all the positives.I personally can say that the new $50 pricetag is a VERY good deal for a VERY good game.

												Excellent Game! Combines Stealth gameplay much alike Assassins Creed and Fun combat. Got some gore, allowing you to disable your targets. Some opponent may even surprise you allot of times, and some Orcs may be stronger than you think. The game got loads of upgrades, and collectibles. Much game content, and things to unlock after completing certain things. For those who want a fast paced, like lord of the rings, a well timed and true combat and a game that takes at least a while to complete, get this one. This offers hours of good gameplay, i would say it offers a very good story compared to other games about middle earth.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open world action-adventure video game, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The story of the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. You control Talion, a ranger who was killed by the Black Hand of Sauron. Talion's spirit merged with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, and together they try to avenge the death of their loved ones. You can engage in melee combat, and utilize some of the wraith abilities to fight against enemies. The game uses the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember the death of the game's protagonist and react accordingly. The game's open world takes place in Mordor and is filled with lots of activities and War Chiefs to kill, Shadow of Mordor is packed with lots of things to do. Talion is a very interesting character, as his spirit is merged with an Elf Lord's. The story is fun and interesting to progress through although it only has 20 main story missions.Overall I think Shadow of Mordor really deserves a score of 9/10, it is just a lot of fun to play through. It also being a game based on The Lord of the Rings makes it a very great game. This is the first open world action adventure LOTR game we've gotten and damn it is a great one. It is very accurate to the movies and just makes for great entertainment. If you're looking for a fun, content filled and story rich game, then this is the one to buy. You will not be disappointed it has loads of content to keep you entertained for quite a long time. So what are you waiting for, stop reading this review and GO get this game, it is AWESOME!.			"

												Nicely done, runs great. BUT It's just running around killing orcs, nothing else. It's basically Batman Akram city but set in the LOTR universe. Honestly, it's all about mindlessly pressing buttons to make combos. I was expecting a deeper story and more character improvements, it's really a pointless game. I would have asked for a refund if I was still within the allowed refund period.			"

												The game doesnt even feel like a Lord of the Rings anything, its basically a Batman / Assassin's Creed crossover with a literally pointless degree of combat grinding. People can hail the gameplay all they like but honestly it feels very empty considering it all boils down to a very basic type of Batman style hits sprinkled with easy to use finishers that get stale quickly. The game gives you virtually no reason at all to engage it on any level except as a sandbox to beat up orcs in. At the very start, the main character's family is murdered before his eyes. Instead of developing any kind of emotion for either the player or the character the game simply jumps straight into: ""ok now you're a supernatural badass from random phenom! Go kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubblegum cause you Cant. Ever. Really. Die.""There is no real incentive to progress the story, there is no tactile incentive to explore the world, the only substantive reason to wander the sandbox you are dropped into is to find more orc captains to slaughter through a repeating series of special moves that make you virtually unstoppable when used smartly.I admit I bought the game late, and I bought it on an extreme sale, but I cannot help but wonder after only 3 hours of playtime, how this game ever managed to draw a ""game of the year"" title to itself with such a sterile atmosphere and numbingly repetitive gameplay mechanics.

												You begin alone in the heart of the enemy's territory. Everywhere you turn there are patrols looking for you. With great effort you manage your first couple of fights and run away from the rest, using stealth to hide and gather your strength. If you make the mistake of blundering into an enemy stronghold they will raise the alarm and you will be assaulted by endless waves of orcs until you either leave or die. That's the first half an hour of the game, and you get a false impression that this is going to be amazing. Once you discover leveling up and your new abilities you almost instantly become a god. Stronghold? Who cares. You can slaughter wave after wave of enemies, no captain can stop you, nothing can stop you. Monotonous and tedious slaughter in a bland landscape. And once you get really bored of it, don't worry. Just turn beasts and orcs to fight for you and the only thing you'll have to do is convert more of them to join your side.			"

Shadow of Mordor's greatest accomplishment is its fluid and responsive combat system. It's incredibly fast paced and highly energetic but the one issue I have is the narrow 'field of view' which can obfuscate larger groups of enemies. The game soon becomes very easy to progress through, especially as more of the overpowering skills are unlocked. The simplistic movement system can be extremely cumbersome, particularly with scaling the environment, as I'd often find myself bumping into walls rather than climbing them, or descending ledges in a tardy fashion while I'm trying to quickly escape a group of enemies.I found that I would often fail missions due to how the game would behave in a bizarre fashion. One example is where I would accidentally exit the quest area due to how the combat system magnetically locks onto enemies and throws my character's body a few dozen feet towards them, outside the quest radius. It would start to be especially dumb when the game decides to have my character land in front of an enemy, during mandatory stealth missions, rather than onto the wall or ledge near them, causing me to immediately fail the mission. There's also one mission in particular where I'm required to draw out a Warchief by killing 20 enemies in 2 minutes. For some reason, in this strange parallel universe I've suddenly entered, no one wants to confront me so I'm left searching for enemies to slaughter and have failed this mission a number of times now. I feel like I'm going insane. What I initially considered a fun game is now frustratingly tedious and soulless.In essence, Shadow of Mordor is pretty on the surface but rotten at its core. It is an unremarkable and miserable experience that does nothing to improve on the modern 'Action RPG' formula that I love to play. It's a shame because it's obvious that the developers put a lot of effort into the lore of this game but Shadow of Mordor would fade into obscurity if it weren't connected to the familiar Lord of the Rings franchise. It is undeserving of a sequel.			"

												Monolith’s first adventure in Middle-earth, Guardians of Middle-earth, was less than stellar, but the developer has rediscovered its mojo. Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game, one worthy of standing alongside such classics as Shogo, Alien vs Predator 2, and the No One Lives Forever series.Shadow of Mordor is set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The game opens with the death of protagonist Talion, a Gondorian Ranger stationed at the Black Gate. After being attacked by Sauron’s forces and bearing witness to the ritual sacrifice of his family, Talion's soul is joined with the spirit of an elvish wraith who grants him extraordinary powers, and apparent immortality. Driven by a desire for revenge, and by a coupling to his mysterious incorporeal companion, Talion ventures in to Mordor.The fairly basic set-up is elevated immensely by some superb performances. Talion’s mission for revenge never feels forced, and the slow revelation of his elven companion's identity and past is genuinely engaging. Even the addition of Gollum fits neatly within the narrative, and gives Shadow of Mordor a solid link to the film adaptations without forcing it and smacking players like they were a fish on a rock.Voice acting across the board is impressive. Orc and uruk captains throughout the game get noteworthy attention. Each feels unique and has his own distinct personality, and considering the huge number of them that’s an impressive feat.Tolkien purists will no doubt take issue with the lore portrayed in the game but it works well and fits in perfectly with Peter Jackson’s interpretation of Tolkien’s works.Much has been made of the lineage of the combat and navigation mechanics used in Shadow of Mordor, and Talion did at first appear to be Assassin's Creed's Ezio by way of Arkham Asylum's Bruce Wayne, but it only takes a few moments of play to learn that Shadow of Mordor refines these systems and creates something superior to the originals.Free running and climbing is clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed, but it feels tighter and has more weight and momentum. The addition of some superhuman wraith abilities also mixes things up, and helps the navigation system to be distinguishable from others. Similarly, the combat emulates the core of what makes the Arkham games so fun, but it adds more depth, responsiveness and visceral flair. The lineage is very clear, but Monolith stands on the shoulders of greats, and it’s hard to argue with that choice.Exploring the land of Mordor is where the game really shows its quality, and is highly recommended. Collectables, upgrades, side quests, weapon upgrade quests, artefacts, and hunting missions are littered throughout the world. They're a completionist's dream, adding more flavour and some interesting rewards.Talion has multiple upgrade paths available to him. Not only can he upgrade his martial skills, and his ranged and stealth based wraith abilities, he also can modify each of three weapons with runes, which alter their effects when used. Coupled with unlockable skills and combat moves, Shadow of Mordor provides more depth in combat alone than practically any game on the market, and it's all in service of the wholesale slaughter of orcs.Everything in Shadow of Mordor is in orbit around its central mechanic, the Nemesis system. As orcs and uruk increase in power they can be promoted to captains. Captains are unique minibosses that can be found throughout the world, and each has his own agenda. They will fight among themselves to gain power, or bribe and bully other orcs into paying them fealty. All of this can be tracked in game using the Sauron’s Army screen, which shows all known captains and warchiefs, their conflicts, levels, and any intel Talion may have gathered about them in-game.Where the system really shines is how these captains interact with Talion. A grunt will automatically be promoted to captain status should he defeat Talion in combat. This will allow him to gain new skills and strengths. He will also remember Talion when they meet again. Each defeat at the hand of a captain increases their power.Every captain will remember and remark on their previous encounters with Talion, be it victory, defeat, or if they fled. All of it adds another dimension to their personality and further individualises them. What's truly remarkable is how organic it all feels. Each and every encounter seems fresh and completely unique. With Nemesis, Monolith has what might fairly be considered the best emergent videogame system ever made.The PC port garnered much attention due to some steep system requirements. For the most part these are overstated. A medium- to high-spec gaming rig will handle the game exceptionally well in 1080p-1440p with most if not all bells and whistles checked. While a cutting edge PC might be required to ensure more than 60 frames per second with ultra textures and maximum settings, solid performance can be found on a decent system touting 3GB of VRAM. Having said that, the actual difference in visual fidelity between high and ultra textures is virtually undetectable rendering the 6GB VRAM debate moot as they can be turned off with no perceptible loss of quality.The core story in Shadow of Mordor could feasibly be hurried through in a dozen or so hours, but the constantly evolving and escalating conflict within the Nemesis system and the huge number of side quests can easily double or triple that. In any case, the joy in Shadow of Mordor is not measured in hours played, but in the accumulated swords of defeated orc captains. Shadow of Mordor is a triumph, and even a slightly flat ending and some repetition cannot diminish the overall quality of the game.VERIDICTShadow of Mordor is the single best Lord of the Rings adaptation to date, and one of the very best third-person action games in many years. By taking some well-known mechanics and adding their own special twist with the Nemesis system, what Monolith has created is much more than the sum of its few borrowed parts.UPS  Exceptional voice acting. Stellar combat. The game-defining Nemesis system is a game-changer.DOWNS  Lore purists will find the odd thing to harumph. Combat with the non-captain orc hordes can get repetitive. Occasional QTE’s.			"

Posted: October 2, 2014
												Hrm. First off, I'd like to mention that I'm very into Tolkien. And being so, it does skew my opinion of this game. But I'll make an attempt at an even-handed review.Here goes...I'm very on-the-fence about this game. I've gone through many of the areas of the game, and to be honest, it all starts to look identical. Caragors, Orcs, crumbling tower ruins - all basically the same. I get that this is Mordor, but even with great graphics, animations, and production design - it gets very boring to look at. Even as the map opens up to the next one, it merely replaces the blackened ground with lush grasses, cliffs, and steppes - the ruins feel pretty much the same.Much ado was given about the Nemesis System - but so far, all I've really seen is a revolving door of Orcs that, much like the scenery, starts to blur together into a long chain of interchangable Orcishness. I kill a few, they get replaced by others. They kill me, they get promoted. Sometimes they run away, or survive my antics, only to pop up later for the cycle to continue. Not exactly as revolutionary as it was made to sound. Even got to kill a few more than once. Which was a little weird.The combat is very reminiscent of the Arkham Batman games, to the point where I found myself using many of the same tactics - and fought enemy types that were also cut-and-pasted from the Arkham series. I eventually started calling Talion ""Batmanigorn"" because, aside from gliding/grappling around, I sort of felt like a sword-wielding Batman and not a Ranger of the North. I don't mind this type of combat, but after 3 (soon to be 4) Arkham games, I started to feel like playing more Arkham Asylum/City/Origins, rather than Shadows of Mordor.Some of the Lore-changing/additions are interesting, a few are not actually possible (I'm looking at you Mr. Elf wraith!). And what could've been a great plot-twist concerning the origins of the Wraith Talion is bound to (which I won't reveal), advertising/promotion has largely spoiled. That being said, the game looks good, runs well, controls are fairly tight (if you use a controller), it has a good musical score, and excellent voice acting for the Orcs.Do I like it? Yes. But not so much that I think I'm going to be playing it in 6 months. In my opinion, there could've been much more story and drama injected into this game's beginnings - but it largely feels lifeless, and a bit uninspired. I don't really have a sense of Talion's pain, nor his Wraith companion's. If I'm rooting for anyone, it's Ratbag. He actually has some kind of personality, direction, and sense of humor. Talion is mopey, bland, and needlessly gruff. The Wraith is an arrogant know-it-all (which is funny for an amnesiac). Why would I want to play these guys? Why would I want them to succeed? And in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter if they do?All-in-all, I just don't feel like I'm playing in Middle-earth. It feels a bit more like playing in someone's not-quite-fully-fleshed out fan-fiction. And then there's the lack of content. 2.5 months and the only real additional content are Runes, 2 character swapping costumes, and a few Warband missions that drop piddley♥♥♥♥♥runes. The Warband missions don't even deviate from the basic hunt-the-orc-chief-down quests and add nothing really to the game. Charging people for this is shameful. As of right now: 6/10Good, but not great. All these professional reviewers squealing in girlish glee over this game are on hallucinogenic drugs. This game isn't anywhere near the stream of 9+/10s I've been seeing.The graphics, music, art direction, and Orc voice acting elevate what is otherwise a game that borrows extremely heavily from other sources.

												The game itself is amazing. Good story, awesome combat etc.I simply can't give it a positive review due to the disgustingly anti-climactic ending of the main story. I want the final boss of a game to be a huge, epic battle, not a 2 minute cutscene and a 5 second QTE. Appauling.			"

												Standard action combat, rather weak story, small world, fairly easy, but the nemesis system is amazing.Plays like an assassin's creed style game. Sneak around, group combat is usually still just 1-2 guys coming at you revolving around counters, but there are a large number of finishers (from executions to setting enemies on fire to even turning enemies into allies). There are a number of creatures that can fought against or controlled and mounted, but are...clunky to both fight against and control.The story left me asking ""but why?"" quite often. I've never really been a part of the LOTR universe so maybe it makes more sense with more context, but in my case...just why.The world is fairly small, there are 2 major maps with about 6 regions to them. The maps are small enough that you can literally chase a fleeing enemy from one side to the other in a couple minutes on foot, much less mounted. There are ""fortresses"", which consist of just a couple towers and that's about it as opposed to what you might expect a fortress to look like.There is no difficulty setting and the game peaks in difficulty around early to mid-game until you successfully grind up more abilities and/or better runes. I use the word grind, but I didn't exactly go out of my way and had everything unlocked before leaving the 1st map.The nemesis system is the main reason to play this game. I've never felt such a strong connection to a random enemy before. The fact that if you die to a regular trash enemy, he gets promoted to captain and becomes a primary threat for you to deal with that your character always has special lines for is amazing. Not only do they all feel fairly unique (as far as 60+ captains can be), but they all have words for you and will give a speech once they either spot you or clash with them; commenting on what you're doing, how your last battle went, revealing something about what's going on in the story, or just something personal to help them feel more developed than just random badguy #2138.All in all, this game has made me look forward to the next installment.

												A very pleasant and wonderful game set some time before the ""War of the Ring"".The story,the graphics and the gameplay are very good,very well polished,with a lot of attention given to details. It's also very well optimized,should run very smooth even on low-end systems.Sadly the boss fights are very easy and very short in the original game,however the dlc bosses raise the bar a bit and increase the the difficulty of the fights,which makes it more enjoyable and more rewarding,although the dlc stories lack a lot compared to the original..Overall,this game is very good..9,5/10 from me,would have been perfect for it to be harder!

Gollum is also in this game so that's kinda cool.Managed to 100% the main game and DLC in around 50 hours so lots to do.Very well optimised, looks beautiful and a lot of fun to play.Also Orcs called Dush.

												Shadow of Mordor feels like a blending of EA's Assassin's Creed and WB's Batman franchise. Added to that blend is a non canonical version of Middle Earth's rich lore and magic, and some streamlined, non linear elements of an RPG character system. In many ways, Talion, the dead human protagonist of the game, is the embodiment of a (white) male power fantasy. In virtually no time at all, the deceased Ranger of Gondor becomes powerful enough to slaughter literally dozens of Orcs and beasts without breaking a sweat. While Orc Captains seem imposing and dangerous at the start of the game, they quickly loose their bite. Parallel to that, Talion becomes the embodiment of fear to the Orcs of Mordor. Listening to their conversations reveals they are in an almost reverend state of fear of Talion, who they call the Grey Walker. And the fear is understandable, considering he can invade their minds almost at leisure, make their heads explode after torturing them for information, brainwash them to fight for him even. By all accounts, he is a truly terryfing foe to have, and making enemies fear him is addictive to the player.The Nemesis system is, of course, the games biggest and most pronounced feature. It generates a neverending stream of almost unique characters to fight and be killed by the player. It has received much praise already, and it is truly a revolutionary feature which will probably be influencing a lot of games to come in the future. The graphics, voice acting and the bleak, ragged terrain of Mordor makes for a superb gameplay experience, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed either Batman or the Assassin's Creed franchise.EDIT: Achievement complete in less than 35 hours. About 25-30 hours of gametime. A bit more if you go for the non-story related achievements, like I did. But in all fairness, the ending is so worth it!			"

												Now, what can I say?CONS:- You have to perform (lots of) rather similar missions in order to get runes, abilities and tier points (and it is essential that you do so);- I didn´t like to see what happened to Talion in the very beginning of the game.- no quick save - quick load feature: you have to deal with the consequences of your acts (much like real life)PROS:- It´s Middle-earth;- You play as a badass ranger, like Strider (a.k.a. Aragorn)-  You can use a sword, a bow or a dagger- You get to hunt a lot (I mean a lot) of orcs- You get to kill a lot (I mean a lot) of orcs- Ypu get to even control orcs- You get to ride Caragors (Warg-like animals)- You get to ride Graugs (cave troll-like animals)- Lots of side missions- Mordor atmosphere- You have to be cunning- You have to be ferocious- You have to use strategy- You have to know your enemy´s army- You have to be as stealth and as parkour as Assassin´s Creed- You have to be as♥♥♥♥♥kicking as Arkham series Batman- You can use the powers of a Wraith (drain, brand, shadow kill, etc.) while dwelling in the Shadow realm (remember when Frodo wore the Ring?)- Challenging: when you die, the guy that killed you mocks you in the face and gets stronger- Compelling storyline based on pre-LOTR eventsHINTS (there are lots of them, I ´ll stick with two):- In the beginning (and throughout the game), if you are losing a battle (you will hear your own heart beat), just run. No shame in living to fight another day. Simply run away, until you find one of the many weeds that will replenish your health. This is very important.- Later in the game, you will be required to brand (control) warchiefs. For that, it is advisable to kill the captain(s) that guard each one of them. My hint is: instead if killing them, BRAND them as well, because they can help you in the figth and, in the event you kill the Warchief by accident (it happens in the heat of battle, when you have to get him weak; if you kill him when you´re supposed to brand him, another one will take his place, and you will have to start over), the captain you have previously branded will take his place and, as he is already branded, you won´t have to research / hunt / fight another Warchief all over again.Long story short, as Aragorn would say:Let´s hunt some orc.;)			"

												Easy to Kill and Easy to Die.  Shadow of Mordor is great fun to play and gives a hugely satisfying feel for any adventures you can find.  Open (ish) world exploration hack and slash semi-RPG spectacle fighter is a bit of a mouthful for the genre, but quite simply, this game lets you run around killing orks.  Great voice acting tops off the well done battle controls and cool game mechanics.  Look for this on sale and pick it up.			"

												My god is this game entertaining and addicting. You wil become so obsessed with killing the warchiefs in unique ways that you can't stop playing. The nemisis system is a great original idea that I believe will be in many more games in the future. The open world is expansive with quite a few activities to get involved in outside flat out killing orcs. Not to mention the game runs great. The combat makes you feel like a complete badass, without lowering the difficulty to much, but once you start leveling up the game does feel a little bit to easy. If you like open world games and hate orcs, then you should definatley play this game.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is a fantastic installment in the LotR legacy, complete with sweeping vistas and a wide array of fully voiced enemies providing a wonderful overworld experience. The game paces itself quite well and expects nothing too fancy from the player, indeed including room for error or more inventive methods to complete an objective. Each new unlock feels useful and plays a part in a rich, multi-layered structure of enemies who range from the measliest of footsoldiers to the strongest of the chiefs. There are many ways to brutally destroy your foes, from popping their heads to inciting a riot. You'll keep coming back for more, because with 42gb of data, there's bound to be something for everyone's demented wishes. Ride as Tallion, a forsaken Ranger whose purpose is to fight against the brutal Orc Army. Part man, part spirit, all bloody and definitely satisfying 10/10			"

												If you're a die-hard LOTR fan or not here's why I think you would like it:It has all the combat mechanisms of popular Batman gamesIt has Assassin creed parkour and feel. (Con side: It's not as fluid or posished parkour however)It has LOTR lore and story line, so it's bound to be a very beautfiful game with good musicYou can control orc captains to fight at your side and use a political system in ways to take over. (Con side: You can't do this as soon as you start playing. You have to do about 7 main missions before that skill is given to you)The system will create more captains as they die off so you can't run out of captians or bodyguards to control (Unless you of course take control of all of the orcs)All the Orcs have their own weakness's and strengths. I've died and had to track them down again because I felt confident I could kill them just to find they're immune to stealth and die from fighting all his orcs and him at the same time.The combat's realtively easy in the beginning until you advance to the story. Berserkers and Orcs with big shields come along.(Con: Taking control of so many Orcs can take out the challenge for some and may find it too easy)The Orcs remember when they killed you and will mention it when you clash.

												Overall, I'd give this game a solid 7/10.This game didn't really being anything new to the table, except the Nemesis System with the orc warlords. What made it interesting is if you die, you get punished for it by leveling up orc leaders around Mordor. Though at the same time this helps you if you're somewhat skilled in combat. By leveling them up and killing them, you also get upgraded runes for your weapon. Also there have been multiple complaints of this game being too hard. This game is where difficulty standards should be at. This game's ""normal"" mode is ""hard"" on other games. If you aren't someone that is bad at games and looks for instant gratification, the difficulty is fine. Switch it to easy if you're bad. The combat is much like the Batman Arkham City game. Unfortunately it's a combination of button mashing, with a parry like Assassin's Creed, with finisher abilities. The stealth is also much like Assassins Creed, but the ledges and areas to grab onto are much more obvious, and the movements are a little more clunky. The graphics in this game look pretty good. The combat is fun to look at and the landscape fits the new-gen standards. Unfortunately this game doesn't have quite as much replay value as it could. You get perks for your 'talent tree' which makes you think you can specialize in what you want, whether it be beasts, bows, etc. Unfortunately by the end of the game or before it (if you abuse the nemesis system), you can have every single perk filled out which makes the point of perks pointless. At the end of each game, you'll end up with the exact same character unless you limit perks yourself. I played this game about twice until I moved on to another game. Last the story is amazing and fits into the Lord of the Rings story well. The cinematics and explainations are great and easy to understand (assuming you've read the books). For anyone that is only a semi-fan of the series, I'd say don't buy this game at full price, but maybe $40. For anyone who is a Lord of the Rings fan, the full $60 may be worth it for you. In the end, it has nice graphics, fun to watch combat, a neat nemesis system. The downfalls of this game is the little diversity in perk points, somewhat clunky movements, and low replay value.  "

												All of this is based on my opinion.GRAPHICS: 9.5/10 : This game is beautiful and the draw distance even on my computer setup is pretty impressive, there are a few in game *using game engine* cutscenes for the main story and a few pre rendered cutscenes. I rarely came across clipping or clipping issues, particles looks great. Not perfect but damn good.SOUND: 10/10 : The soundtrack , the sound effects, the echoing, the voice acting, and many other effects are used with great care in this game and give it a pretty awesome feel and pace to the game. Very much what you would expect from a LOTR games.GAMEPLAY: 9/10 :Fantastic climbing, responsive controls, just enough enemy variety to keep it interesting, with the opportunity to really just go into a group of Orcs and just start destroying them one by one. You get melee sword action, stealth gameplay, and ranged combat. This all makes for a fantastic experience that only near the end got a little stale for me. I am not the biggest fan of quick time events but this game used them in a decent way. Pros: Graphic, bloody, gruesome, fast gameplay, propped up with a great story that helped me understand the lore of the one ring how it was made, what happened to the ring maker, seeing another story unfold in a great way. This game will give you hours and hours of fun either creating a army or orcs or destroying every last one of them. Or you could just do both and still have amazing fun.Cons: at the end of the game the gameplay got a little stale as many of the things you have to do at the end are things you have had to be doing for the last 15 hours or so of gameplay. This for me meant that at the end of the main story I was really looking forward to playing another game. The middle ground: I bought this for 10$ and to me it was worth easily 2-3 times that amount in gameplay ,story, and fun factor and that is not something that happens too often. If you can get this game for less then 30$ or cheaper i suggest you do so as you will not be dissapointed. I find it really hard to find any real flaws this game has, considering i got almost 40 hours of playtime out of it and had lots of fun 95% of the time, and i still have some things to 100% still as at the end of the game i only had 80% of the game complete and that was without the DLC i have yet to play. Final say: If its cheap and you have been thinking about it just get this game, it will be a good investment in my eyes.			"

												Another fairly solid game coming from somewhere in the realm of WB game studios and whomever their devs are. The combat runs almost the same as the Batman Arkham series. Though the character you play as is another one of those guys with a personality equal to that of a cucumber. It keeps poking you in the ear and but nothing really sticks. Besides that, the story is forgettable in the face of running around slaughtering Uruk, completing side quests and challenges and occasionally following what can be a short story. But I have to say, most of the challenges manage to feel somewhat varied and collectables aren't a major nuisance while providing bits of lore which is questionably canon or not.Oh. And there's an Uruk caste system you can disrupt by killing leaders or mind control.Pros:-Smooth combat and intuitive-Great graphics and atmosphere-The Uruk caste uses the ""Nemesis System"" to create unique Uruk to either assassinate, fight or mind control-Two fairly large maps with varied landscapes to traverseCons:-You can become rather overpowered late game, even if you've only done just side missions and no challenges-The characters are all cliche personalities and the story is mediocre-The rune system for upgrading weapons is clunky and made OP with dlc-Boss fights are mostly quick time events-No difficulty settingsI'll go ahead and put my system specs for comparison below.MS-7850i5-4670k CPU 3.40GHz (4CPUs) overclocked @ 4.3GHz12288MB RAM (12GB)EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB ftw edition1080 scale down to native 1600x900 monitor			"

												Not much of a reviewer but I genuinely enjoyed this game and I hope I can help others do the same:Pros:-Fun combat - stealth and aggressive are both satisfying ways to play-Nemesis system means that you actually feel things for your enemies - you hate the ones that have killed you over and over and you feel strange paternal/maternal/whathaveyou instincts towards the ones that you help rise through the uruk ranks-An acceptable use of QTEs - I have no idea why developers keep insisting on putting these in-game, but the ones in Shadow of Mordor are not nearly as frustrating as others and they at least make sense in the context in which they're used-Nice soundtrack - nothing I'd want to download and listen to it apart from the game, but it's suitably immersiveCons:-The story is kind of odd in how it fits in the Tolkien-verse, though this is somewhat understandable since they were not able to acquire many rights to the lore to make this game-Protagonist is really boring, barely even has one dimension, but all of the cutscenes are skippable so you don't have to deal with him too much if you don't want to. Plus, the Lithariel skin helps ignore his existence even more.-Final boss ""battle"" is ♥♥♥♥ing dumb - hence the quotes			"

												Great Game! The good:* The fighting system and stealth system works very well and is very satisfying. (Think of the best parts of batman and assassins creed mixed together.)* Many RPG elements that are integrated into the game to make your character play the way you like. (Stealthy, combative, etc.)*Animations, graphics, and sound are top notch. Watching the game in motion is very entertaining and similar to watching the well-known movies.* The nemesis system is brilliant to watch and to my knowledge nothing like the system has been done in games before. Watch some video's on it to find out more otherwise I would have to wright a few paragraphs about it.* Fast travel options make it pain free to get to where you want right away.The Bad: * Playing on a mouse and keyboard is very hard at first even with me being an experience PC gamer. I'm sure you can use a controller as most games that are out have that included.* The beginning of the game can be brutal and slightly confusing to those who are casual gamers.			"

												Game is really good, its really fun, but its also really huge and takes forever to download if you have an ISP that rips you off on what are internet speeds appropriate for a caveman.Shadow of Mordor is basically what Assassin's Creed is desperately trying to do as a game, but always manages to fail. The result is a game that is actually a lot of fun to play.Assassin's Creed isn't the only game Mordor borrows from. There's a saying, ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"" and Mordor is practically a Frankenstein creation of taking concepts from popular/successful games via market study. Dissecting them to find what worked and grafting it into their own game. This is tastefully done somehow since uninspired rip-offs usually ape success poorly and wind up failing to deliver a satisfying experience. Mordor isn't just shameful in how it imitates other games, it just doesn't somehow manage to be a very good imitation, but it somehow manages to out do some of the games its ripping off.Mordor's got stealth like AC. Assassinations like AC. Climbing towers to reveal map information just like AC. Generic side missions like AC. Free running/Parkour like AC. But where AC games typically have dodgy AI, clumsy controls, bugs, and identical cut and paste side missions, Mordor mostly doesn't. And if it does, (like fidgety controls) its not nearly as bad as AC. WB Games/Monolith put an A grade team on developing this game because someone somewhere didn't just know what they were doing, but they wanted to ensure it all worked.For example, Mordor isn't entirely a rip-off of Assassin's Creed. They didn't take what is easily the weakest aspect of that game: the fighting system. Like I said about taste, Mordor rips-off the Batman Arkham games. And it works fantastically.And there are various other flavors of games found in Mordor. You can almost make a game of picking out what its taken from other games.Its open world sandbox is very GTA.It also has stealth (again) like MGS. You can grab and interrogate soldiers for intel like MGS3.I could continue on, but this review is long enough.Mordor is good, but it does have its problems First (for me anyway), this game is enormous. 46 gigs.  It took 2 days to download. Yes my internet is that slow. Real issues in the game are the controls are sometimes flaky. Sometimes its extremely difficult to navigate corners on walls/obstacles on the ground sometimes and your guy won't want to move. Another annoying issue is sometimes the camera position is bad. This is the worst during fights where it gets hung up on walls/objects. Its rare but it happens.Oh, also, people say this game is canon. If its not written by Tolkien, its not canon. Also, canons are what you shoot balls out of.			"

For me, that was the greatest part of the gameplay! The sidequests can become a bit repetitive, but are still entertaining. The orc voice-acting is amazing!! The fact that captains and warchiefs who have met you before remember you and tease you about it is quite funny!There's been a lot of talk about the ending being... well... very blah... Although I found this to be 100% the case (uuurghhh......), I still recommend this game for its very well designed and fun combat dynamics!Graphics and sound are very impressive!Story is Ok, although not for the Tolkien purist...Overall, a great 8.5/10			"

												BUY IT!You won´t find better LOTR game than this. You will hardly find 3rd person action with better combat system (Batman Arkham series doesn´t count, since these games invented these mechanics). Shadow of Mordor is extremely addicting videogame, which excels in many fields. One of the main advantages of the game is that it leave you a lot of freedom in eliminating your targets. You can rush in like Rambo, or go speaky beaky like.Regarding your targets, game introduced so called Nemesis system, which encourages player´s creativity in killing warchiefs. Basically, you don´t even need to cross your sword with them and kill them by manipulating your minions. Nemesis system is something that videogame industry really needed, because it makes your enemies unique personalities with different strengths and weaknesses. Thanks to these, every encounter with warchiefs is different.Game itself had potential to be pure 10/10 material, but unfortunately it has some flaws. For example dissapointing ending, repetetive side missions (but every one of them has some bonus objectives/challenges, which can refresh the gameplay) and slightly low difficulty.Despite these minor flaws, Shadow of Mordos is a must buy for every LOTR fan. Hell, it is a must buy for every videogame fan!9/10			"

												Insanely smooth, fun, intuitive combat filled with changing enemies. strengths weakeness to keep things fresh and flowing without boredom of repitition or button mashing. Superior voice acting compared to most NA games.Excellent graphics. Ported well for PC *Or maybe to console?* Controls move properly to you and aren't awkward or laggy.Sound is immersive and fills you with awe, sucking you into the enviroment.Worth full price and no regrets.

												+ Great Arkham style combat. Very meaty and satisfying, and the skill tree helps to keep it fresh.+ Nemesis System creates cool emergent storylines. Great innovation from Monolith.+ Solid Story with loads of LotR lore. Nice integration of the Nemesis system into the story.+ Good visuals and solid PC performance.- Story, while good, feels a bit too short.- Minor problems with the climbing that interupt the smoothness of translating running into climbing. Not a big deal though.			"

												A well done third person open world RPG, with a great story, excellent combat mechanics, and amazing characters that are easy to bond to. One thing that I feel that this game has done well is that the traveling does not feel boring,  with the enemies and beasts that you can find in the environment, and the great parkour mechanics that this game has. It is always suprising to find captains in the middle of nowhere and duel them, and you feel like a complete badass when you fight and win against 30 enemies alone. Overall, i'd say that this game was definitley worth the $50.10/10 -Whatever name I have at the moment			"

												Shadow of Mordor is, as many describe it, like Assassin's Creed and Lord of the Rings combined into one game. Now, the only thing is, it's so much better. Now before all the Assassin's Creed fanboys start going ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥HE JUST CALLED THIS GAME BETTER. DOWNVOOOOOOTE,"" let me explain. First, I'll break the review down into categories.GRAPHICS:Graphics...They're...stunning. They're actually quite beautiful when you get down to it. Especially at night time when it rains. The terrain and mudsplashes are phenomenal and breath-taking. I sound like IGN here, but seriously, it's something to appreciate. Furthermore, they have interactive body slashes on the mobs when you attack them. Most Assassin's Creed games do not have this, where you slash the body and the blood follows the path of the blade. Instead, on those games it just leaves a mark on them. In this, it shows black uruk (main mob) blood gashed open on their body as you slice them with either blade or dagger. All in all, these graphics are intense and very nice when turned to max settings.GAMEPLAY:Gameplay is solid. It has a very nice fighting system, but can be abused at times, but I'll cover that later. Furthermore, there are acquireable mounts in the game. But, it treats it like as if you were a hunter; i.e. you need to hunt out and tame that mount. However, it isn't permanent, but doesn't require a lot of effort once you unlock the skill in order to do so. Speaking of those, the skills themselves are EASILY unlockable if you follow the quest chain. If not, just go beat up a Uruk Captain or Warchief or something of the like. Go balls deep for a good couple hours and you should unlock some pretty good skills.              GAMEPLAY SECTION 1: FIGHTING MECHANICS                         Fighting mechanics are very solid and can be somewhat tactful at times. However....They're easily abused by simple spamming mechanics. For example, you can unlock a ""Throw Knife"" skill. On the keyboard, you can just spam ""Q"" and rack up a hit streak to do some finishers (finishers being a one-hit kill on normal mobs). Basically, in essence, it's more of ""THROW KNIFE, THROW KNIFE, THROW KNIFE, THROW KNIFE, THROW KNIFE, ANNND DICKSWORD IN YOUR FACE"" sort of combat. Additionally, you can also spam the charge knockdown, as I've come to notice; along with the very funny ♥♥♥♥♥-slapping stun (""E"" on keyboards), along with some other things as well. However, when you get into the high hit-streaks, the finisher moves I noticed change. You start pulling off more brutal and very bloody finishing moves. And these finishes surprisingly are all reliant on where the target is in the world and what condition they're in. If they're stunned, it'll do a stun finisher. if they're up and about ready to attack, it'll actually deflect the attack first and then ♥♥♥♥ING OBLITERATE THEM.                   GAMEPLAY SECTION 2: BOSS SYSTEMInstead of having your usual bosses out in the world, they have what's called ""Captains and Warchiefs"". The Captains are basically bosses, but early-game they can be classified as mini-bosses. When you start to progress and unlock a lot more skills on the skill tree, not only the Bosses but also the game begins to toughen up and smack you a bit harder until you become a damn masochist. Now, the Captains are characterized by Power Level, and the Power Level depends on their unique qualities that each captain presents. Now, Captain abilities and such are hidden until you collect ""intel"" by interrogating SPECIFICALLY MARKED Uruk. After ""gaining intelligence"" by interrogating them by basically saying ""YOU'RE MY ♥♥♥♥♥ NOW"" sort of deal, you can now see a Captain's full name and abilities/weaknesses. As their power level increases, they will have A LOT less weaknesses and more abilities.                                 As for the Warchiefs, they're a whole 'nother world altogether. They're REDICULOUSLY difficult when starting out early-game because you're like ""holy ♥♥♥♥....this guy's 10 feet tall and has a massive spear....how should I- OH♥♥♥♥♥♥HERE HE COMES. *ded*"" kind of deal. Not only do they have NO insta-kill weaknesses, but they also have BODY GUARDS. And these aren't just normal mobs. THEY'RE DAMN CAPTAINS. Some I've found have like THREE OR FOUR late-game. But early, you should have it easier with only one or two.                            One more thing I found interesting on this system is how they characterize each Captain or Warchief. They not only have a unique name, but the name describes how they act, what weapons and armor they wear, and even their fighting style. For example, I had ""[INSERT GIBBERISH-SOUNDING URUK NAME HERE] The Judge"" as my main target on my Captain Hit List. Because he was a Judge, he had a Fist of Justice instead of a spike ontop of his helmet. He also carried around a massive cleaver. Additionally, he wore a feather-like cloak/mini-cape as if he were an actual judge. When we confronted and crossed blades, he started yelling insults that a judge would. For example ""DON'T DROP THE SOAP, PRETTY BOY."" (Not really, but I bet he would've had he been programmed/scripted that way)Summary: The graphics are stunning and the fighting is very solid, very gorey and bloody, yet still exploitable and spammable. They have a VERY unique boss system and quite a good one at that. The game progresses its difficulty the further you get into it, however is ALWAYS a challenge, especially to those knew to the hack-and-slash genre. It doesn't exactly ""hold-your-hand"", and sort'a thrusts you out there and says ""kill this♥♥♥♥♥♥using this kind of attack. If you don't, you'll probably die. Good luck."" Development, from what I've seen, has stopped as of right now, but the full game is amazing.FINAL RATING: 9.5/10 (not enough balls deep action)			"

												This is a ok game it's not great but it has all the elements of a great game. First off the nemesis system is a lot of fun it's one of the reason to play this game. It has good graphics I couldn't play it on ultra with my gtx 660 ti but I could play it on medium high, and it looks good. The controls with the keyboard and mouse leave something to be desired but it's playable which is more than I can say for some of the games that have came out this year. The main problem I had with the controls is that sometimes not always but sometimes it would not go in the right direction, which got me killed. The combat is fun the animation quality is good and most of the time it flows well, their was a few times in the game where an animations looked forced. The story is good but there is almost none of it, they voice acting is great but again they went with quality of quantity which is ok, not enough games do that. Now lets talk about the reason you buy this game, the nemesis system. It is good until the end of the game, towards the end around the last five hours it becomes trivial, as does the combat and any other elements of the game that add difficulty. The reason for this is branding, once you can brand orcs all you have to do is spam it in combat and you soon have an army fighting for you, which is awesome but it makes the game way too easy. The reason for this is simple and probably could be changed easily, when you use any finisher you become immune to damage, which means if you are any good at the game you can spam brand and never die. Now lets talk about the replayability of this system because it seems like it would be great, but it's not. The max power level of a captain/warchief is twenty witch is trivial after you finish the game. Without even using the most powerful upgrades you can take on five or more power level fifteen plus with ease. Again this is caused by the problems stated above. So in conclusion if you want a 20 hour game that has a lot of quality but not much content this game is for you if you would rather spend three hundred hours in a game settle for the lackluster combat ok skyrim instead.(Side note, if there was a elderscrolls game with this combat system but more fleshed out it would be a lot of fun.)

												I'm quite late to the party with this game, but wow I'm so glad I finally got to it. So far it says I've played 8 hours, 7 of that was today. I just want to keep playing, it's so much fun. So many developers claim their game is a ""living breathing world"" so much that it's become a tired old cliche now, but this game is one of if not the first where I've thought that actually seems true. (I don't know if they actually said that about this game, but I am saying it!) The AI is really clever (not perfect, some of those orcs are really stupid!), so much so that when I have run away from a certain 'captain' and then found him again later he has commented on our last encounter and that I ran away. Another managed to kill me, and later when I faced him again commented on me being back from the dead. You can overhear them talking about you, and each other. It really does seem like the world and it's inhabitants are doing their own thing, with their own agendas, regardless of whether you're around or not. The NPCs don't just stand in their spot and wait for you to come and get them. There are so many things to do, lots of combat and load of missions, but also a lot of artifacts and stuff to find in the environment, for those times when you need a break from the action. It's also fun to ride around on one of the beasts and tear around the map eating orcs with it, then jump off and leaving it in the middle of an orc camp where it causes havok so you can sneak in and grab your target while they are distracted. I haven't had this much fun in a game for a long time (probably since Skyrim) and I can't wait to play it again and see what else happens!  :)			"

Nan iChir Gelair MordorMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open world action-adventure video game set within Tolkien's legendarium, developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.holy♥♥♥♥♥♥have i enjoyed every single bit of this game,i'll try to keep this review decently short.GameplayWhile the hack and slash combat is pretty similer to the batman arkham franchise and the parkour is pretty much Assassin creed's,so you would assume this game would be boring,right? yes,to an extent i did get bored of  shadow of mordor's combat BUT the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nemisis system is what makes this game unique when an enemy kills you he becomes strongerit feels like shadow of mordor defined the rpg genre for this generation,along with witcher 3 and such.StoryWell i've never watched a lord of the rings movie or played a game before SOM so i don't know what the hell is going on but it seems pretty dark and almost grim.GraphicsI'm not really a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ but it's pretty beautiful.Soundtracks and LoreWhen it comes to lore, collectables and their stories SOM is top notch,hell there are even bits of elven language thrown in there, oh boy and the soundtracks,they're amazing! i've never been amazed by such soundtracks and chants since Darksiders 2 which i played 2 years ago.ConclusionShadow of mordor is worth getting but not really worth FULL price,try to grab it when its on sale,especially the GOTY edition.

												9/10A great action game. Geat LOTR lore. Great mechanics.PROS- Nemesys system. It's excellent and fun.- Lot of action. I'd say gameplay is like Assassin's Creed, but harder than the first 2 (Only ones I have played)- Lots of Lord of The Rings Lore. You can learn a lot of LOTR Universe.- It's really fun to kill Orcs. But you know what is funnier? To send an orc to kill another orc.CONS- As other have pointed out, the only think you can do in this game, is to kill orcs. In very different ways, but killing is killing. It suffers the same repetitive syndrome as the first Assassin's Creed. Let's hope second part of this game will bring  a variety of things to do, kind of what EA did with Assassin's Creed II.- Really short Main Campaign. You can beat it under 15 hours.TL; DR If you like LOTR and Action games, this is a must buy.			"

I was deeply immersed in the game (this is a must play at night for an odd reason but I digress), the fighting mechanics were extremely fluid, the orc facials very realistic. A must buy if you like the Batman series, you will enjoy this as well. However, there is a bit of repetition after 12 hours and it can get tedious, but I countered this by taking breaks and playing a rage inducing game, just to return to the peace and quiet of KILLING EVERY MOFO ORC THERE IS!:)			"

												First off i want to say that i love the LOTR world. Kind of a nerd about it so coming into playing this game i have had my biasness.Story (10/10)Story in any game to me in any game in paramount so therefore i must say this game does not dissapoint at all. The story in this game is one of the best if not the best i have ever experienced. As i progressed throught this story i wasnt just the avenger but rather i felt like a key player in the LOTR world and how the story would eventually play out (if you read and watch LOTR movies). So the story did not dissapoint at all.Gameplay (8/10)This is where i kind of feel i am nit picky (only because its LOTR). The general combat mechanics are easy to get used to and get very proficient at. That being said you feel as though you are a baddass fighting multiple eneimes at one go and kicking the $hit out of everyone. Now killing the more difficult bosses and instances thats a different ball game, you need to do your research (intetrogate minions). You want to use every advantage you can get. So gameplay wise really well done, what i would like to see different would be the ability to maybe use different swords in the LOTR world.Graphics (9/10)One of the better looking game to me, i played it maxed out at 1080p. Enviroment looks nice, background looks really really nice. Animations are smooth and play out nicely.Overall: Buy this game its cheap as of now and well worth the time to play it.			"

												I'm making this review after finishing the main storyline. (Which took me around 15 hours of gameplay)The game is amazing,  Every action scene in the game are just wonderful. Gameplay is just like Batman and Asassin's Creed combined so if you have played any of these games before, you'll get familiar pretty fast. Storyline is enjoyable, honest, it was good, especially if you're a LOTR fans, you'll appreciate it. Now back to gameplay, actually i'm quite impressed with the world system. Hunting and and plotting to whether assassinate or rules the captains of each area is fun and is the main attraction for me in this game. Claiming your territories, expanding your army and finally Fight and make the warchief submit to you is just satisfying to do.  The battle sometimes can be very unpredictable. Once when i was fighting this one captain and all of sudden 2 other captains arrive and i was completely overwhelmed and ended up killed, it was hard. But sometimes it also can be very easy. Each captain or warchief has different set of weakness and power. Some can be killed instantly with stealth kill or some will run in fear in the sight of what they fear, it can be caragor, a graug or even a fire (lol, scared of fire) . Either way the game is really fun to play.The only complain i get for this game, is the Final Boss....How the heck that is even count as one??!!??Figthing The Tower with Stealth Kill? Figthing the Black Hand with Quick Time Event ?? Oh c'mon!!I was so exited when i'm about to fight them, I was expecting a brutal, fierce, chaotic big war !! After all of my effort dominating all the 5 Warchief !! Dissappointed in that.... . .Figthing the 5 Hands is also easy.... . .Figthing the Hammer (middle boss) is way harded than that...That aside... i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to spend some of his/her time playing a good quality games. Good Stuff !!Now, i'm gonna do all of the side mission !!! (a lot of 'em, lol)EDIT :Now that i'm done doing all the DLC, let's talk a lil' bit more.I'm gonna be honest here, Lord of The hunt DLC is so so, a little bit harder than story mode, but end pretty quick, The new monster system are good though, so yea.. Nice little DLC.The Bright Lord DCL on the other hand is a masterpiece on its own. Seriously, we play as Celebrimbor and must conquer Sauron's Army one by one just like in the story mode, BUT HARDER (Most of the captain and warchief are above level 20). What's more challanging is that Cerebrimbor only had half of the stat from maxed out Talion on story mode and Can't slow time when shooting, making it harder to shoot when in Chaotic battle. That aside, after Building the 5 tower and Branding all the 5 warchief, we're gonna face Sauron and this time, it's not gonna be like the lame battle we had in story mode. But anway, i thought it's gonna be easy to face Sauron because i had 5 warchief on my side but after some battle going on, Sauron take controll of all the Warchief and we defeat all the 5 Warchief AT THE SAME TIME (MY GOD THAT WAS HARD) and after doing so, Sauron appear again and this time HE REVIVE ALL THE WARCHIEF I'VE KILLED. My God.. In the end, i must fill my One Ring gauge to defeat Sauron. In the end, It was the most Satisfying battle I've had in Shadow of Mordor, really, the best one turn out to be in the DLC.			"

												The game is excellent and very well optimized. I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's work in general and I can say that this game did not disappoint me. Perhaps the only downside is the length of the game, at least the main story, which is comprised of only 20 missions and you can finish it very quickly if you want.			"

												TL;DR Good game, grab it when it goes on sale. If you only do the story quests, it will probably take you about 6 hours to beat total.  There's a ton of content, but a lot of it is repetitive and the only satisfaction you get is getting closer to 100% completion.  The combat mechanics are very similar to Assassins Creed with the dodging and countering every attack, but it has quite a few added flares (as it should, considering combat seems to be the major focus of this game).  The stealth/climbing is similar to Assassin's Creed as well except there's not a huge amount of climbable terrain outside of strongholds.The story is great, but shortlived.  It seems like they took a story that could last five times as long and shortened it down due to time constraints or laziness.  Overall a good game, but definitely not worth the $50 they're asking for at release.  Get it when it goes on sale, if I had to do it again, I'd pay no more than $20 for it.			"

												Visually the game is stunning, even on ultra high which is the best my gpu (7950) can manage before it gets very noisy. The story is very good although a bit shorter than expected, and the gameplay itself is, in my opinion a mix of skyrim and assassin's creed and mostly the best bits. My one niggle with this game which has caused me to stop playing on several occasions throughout the story and other missions, is the respawn rate and seeming power of orcs. Engaging 20+ orcs at a time is a given at several points in the game but when that number constantly refills despite firing an arrow at the orc running to the alarm and killing them left right and centre it gets very frustrating. Not only that but as the orcs constantly respawn, even if you have previously cleared out the area, several captains will 'happen' to show up making the odds very much stacked against you. Not only that but when you finish a mission to disrupt the ork heirarchy, the captain in question goes back to full health and orks, after killing all of the ones in the area, spawn out of nowhere.In conclusion, it is a great game both visually and in gameplay both story and side missions, but don't blame me if you find some of the ork respawn behaviour an absolute pain in the behind!

												Wonderful game. Great graphics and awesome gameplay. Killing orcs can get a bit repetitive, like the captain and warboss quotes. But at least the dlc helps to add some variety with the new wildlife and branding ghuls. The story is seriously fun and there is a large extent of things to do besides the story. So this makes up for it being quite short in my opinion. I enjoy this game and give me a lot of nostalgia of the books and movies. Great game.			"

												Being a licensed game no one expected much from this game but it ended up surprising everyone and for good reason cause it’s a pretty damn good game. It has an interesting enough story to keep you going but the true star of the shows are the gameplay, which is a mixture of the Batman and Assassin Creed games, and the Nemesis system. The Nemesis system is what really sets this game apart from any other game before it, there is something very powerful in seeing these no longer random nameless orcs rise up in the ranks because they killed you and now it’s become personal why you want to take them down.

												Assassins Creed + Arkham CIty + Far Cry = Shadow Of Mordor. BOTTOM HAS SLIGHT SPOILERS SO BE AWAREProsThe wonderful stealth and agility and movement system of Assassins Creed with the perfect combat system of the Arkham games plus the outpost captures and healing plants and strategy of Far Cry. All wrapped in the gorgeous and unforgiving dangerous setting of Mordor. This game is truely gold and everyone who has ever played any of the three series of games i mentioned will have a blast with Shadow Of Mordor. I enjoyed the nemesis system which brought purpose and replayability to the game. The extremely violent combat gave me a rush, especially when taking over outposts and capturing warchiefs.ConsThe shortcomings are limited but still need to be noted. at times it was hard to control Talion. A few times he wouldn't climb up unless i went down and back up again. The camera, though 90% on point, would sometimes make things hard to see in tight areas. But the main thing that annoyed me was the nemesis system getting in the way of itself and gameplay. Almost everytime i went to capture a warchief, there would be other captains that would see me and then the nemesis system would direct my screen away from Talion and to the captain for his quick speech saying he has seen me before. Though the system is great and above all other games' AI, it sometimes got in the way especially during intense battles where every move counts and the flow of the combat means everything, just to be thrown off by the nemesis system kicking in. It didnt ruin the game at all, but was annoying.VerdictThe few problems i had didnt turn me off to the game. it remains to be one of my favorite, definitely my top pick for games released in 2014. i only found one small glitch that made a few of the walls bright neon colors but that was literally the only glitch and it was during free roam so it didnt hurt gameplay. Overall i give the game a 9/10 simply for being able to blend 3 game mechanics from 3 different games into one beautiful looking game with plenty of satisfying gameplay. its not a 10 just for the nemesis system getting in the way of itself. Also not a 10 for the reason ill explain in the spoiler section.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i felt the ending of the game was so build out through my 30 hour gameplay. the story of him avenging his family's death was so compelling, even if not unique. His friendship with the hunter and queen. all very well done but i feel like Mordor needed....well more Mordor. the world seemed a little bland and the story needed more scenes like when Talion and his minions stormed the gates, that was exciting and had such a Lord Of The Rings feel! one big team against another in an all out fight in an open field. I loved that part but it only lasted a few minutes. Also the end we so built up just to be a quick time event where you hit a few buttons and beat the dark lord!!! common!! Ive been wanting to fight him since i first watched LOTR!!!! i wanted a real awesome boss fight. the only real boss fight was in the cave with the hunter. but the ending did leave with sort of a cliff hanger, hopefully a second game will bring a more exciting setting, boss fights and epic moments of two teams just clashing in all out warfare!!! other than that, everything the game did, it did it right. it was fun and now i still have 63.5% left in the game even after the main story!. plenty of fun packed in, a real joy to play.

												Great Game! The good:* The fighting system and stealth system works very well and is very satisfying. (Think of the best parts of batman and assassins creed mixed together.)* Many RPG elements that are integrated into the game to make your character play the way you like. (Stealthy, combative, etc.)*Animations, graphics, and sound are top notch. Watching the game in motion is very entertaining and similar to watching the well-known movies.* The nemesis system is brilliant to watch and to my knowledge nothing like the system has been done in games before. Watch some video's on it to find out more otherwise I would have to wright a few paragraphs about it.* Fast travel options make it pain free to get to where you want right away.The Bad: * Playing on a mouse and keyboard is very hard at first even with me being an experience PC gamer. I'm sure you can use a controller as most games that are out have that included.* The beginning of the game can be brutal and slightly confusing to those who are casual gamers.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's got great gameplay (although, orcs are blind), and it's Lord of the Rings so, who wouldn't like it? Also, don't be afraid to try a GTX 610. You would have to turn the graphics down by a lot, but it would work. Don't even think about using less than that, and certainly not a GTX 460. I'm pretty sure it would DIE if you did that. Make sure you get the DLC. I did not, but I heard it was really good. One last thing. If you havn't seen Lord of the Rings, than watch it.

												Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ is not a game i would normally buy or play. The reviews compared it to the Batman Arkam games and they never appealed so why did i buy this title. Honestly no idea.I think i got it for 50% of during the steam holiday sale but my opinion now would be even at full price this game would be worth the money.The game runs smooth, the action can be breathtaking. The scenery can be a bit samey after a while but half way through it opens up anew area which is a tad greener :) There's a mission you can play early on where you go to one of the strongholds and you have to defeat 100 uruks, when i first tried this i got pumped big time but a few unlocks later and you look forward to those battles with relish.My biggest worry was the controls, as i'm getting on a bit now (middle aged is the term) I honestly can't be bothered with learning multiple button presses combined to create a certain type of attack or defense. Fortunatly the game glides you in gently meaning it's pretty basic early on and it's only as the game progresses that you have these additional features where a press of E here or R there pulles of some amazing manouver.I'm now over 30 hours in and about 70% through the game and i'm dreading the fact i'm closing in on the end.I can only say i highly recommend this, it's fun it's enthralling and it's worth the money.

												One of the very best game i have ever played. It completely sucked me into mordor realm, all the extra little things like for example  comments after finding some pieces of past it really draws you into this world. One of the very few games that i really and i mean REALLY felt like a part of the ingame world. The immersion feel is totaly amazing.Every game has cons though which in this case are:The start of the game is not that great, there is almost no introduction to the game mechanics, you literally get thrown into ""open"" world and its your job to figure everything out, it can be quite repulsive at first touch, but just try to give it a longer shot.IT CAN GET repetitive after some hours spent, but again its the little things that make the difference like the story about the universe after almost every action you make.At first i played on ultra settings without the HD textures and it didnt look that amazing, i mean yes it still looks good but not droping jaw effect. After installing the HD textures pack it really shows the difference, graphics are truly splendid, however it comes with  a cost of VRAM so dont even try to install HD textures if you dont have at least 4GB of Vram.Really love the game and i hope for more !

Posted: October 9, 2014
TLDR: It is beyond phenomenal. My personal GOTY RPG for 2014. BACKGROUND & SYNOPSIS: This game builds upon the lore that Tolkien cemeted in history with his literature, while also adopting the dark, gritty atmosphere Jackson gave us with his cinematic adaptations. It is truly the best of both worlds combined. The story takes place in between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings stories, so there is no trek to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring - it is an all new experience. ME:SOM is a sandbox RPG with hack and slash fighting mechanics. The map is about as big as Arkham City, with your character being able to expertly maneuver around it with Assassin's Creed-like parkour. The setting of the game takes place in and around Mordor, not the entire Middle-Earth. That is an important point that many have missed upon purchase. You take control of a mortal Ranger named Talion, who after an immense tragedy has been banished from death. Unable to cross over into the otherworld, he forms an unlikely alliance with an Elven Wraith by the name of Celebrimbor, who along with no recollection of his previous life, also bears the same curse. Together you explore the Land of Mordor, recovering abandoned Forge Towers to act as your ""Home Base"". Each new tower recovered unlocks the map for that section, and thus allows you to fast travel between towers. Each story mission completed recovers new memories for Celebrimbor, and unlocks new abilites in your skill tree for Talion to master. Both Ranger and Wraith abilities are attainable.ENEMIES & EXAMPLE OF THE NEMESIS SYSTEM: The primary enemy encountered are Uruk's of all different sizes and features. The Uruk society functions with an entire militaristic ranking system consistently playing out while in-game. Everyone starts off as level 1 Grunts, except for the already established Captain and Warchiefs. If you are slain in battle, the Uruk who slayed you gets a promotion and gains a power level. This opens up multiple scenarios that can play out - one being the now level 2 Uruk gets promoted to Captain, but there are no available slots in Sauron's army..so he challenges a higher level Captain to a duel. More than likely the higher level wins, and the scum who just got promoted dies - permitting the victor Uruk to gain a power level. Each Uruk Captain has their own resistances and weaknesses, which can be exposed by beating another Captain to a pulp and interrogating him for another Captain's information. The ability to possess the mind of an Uruk develops as the game does, eventually giving Talion the ability to brand an Uruk, bringing them to your side to fight for you and betray their Uruk bretheren. This also opens up multiple possible scenarios for the battlefield. Other enemies include Caragors - four legged beasts that you can let loose on societies or tame to ride into battle on; Ghuls - deformed Elves that live in dark underground caves and can spit acid; and Graugs - giant amphibious trolls that terrorize land and water, you can tame and ride these into battle as well. Depending on how you play your game, the main campaign may take you anywhere from around 10 to 30 hours to complete. However you can get almost endless hours in if you are a completionist and you do all of the side missions, challenges, artifact gathering, monster hunting as well as just playing around with The Nemesis system - there are plenty of activities to do and two whole maps to do them on. Currently I have logged 60 hours into the game and have only completed roughly 35% of the main story.There are other game modes included if you purchase the season pass, including: Guardians of the Flaming Eye Exclusive Warband Mission; Trials of War Challenge Series: Play 4 challenge modes - Test of Power, Test of Speed, Test of Wisdom and the Endless challenge; Lord of the Hunt Story Mission; The Bright Lord Story Mission; and future content.

Posted: October 6, 2014
												Before I begin, let me say that I am more than a little biased. I first read the Lord of the Rings when I was 8, right after I discovered and read the Hobbit. I've read just about every scrap of paper that had ""Middle Earth"" written somewhere on it (With the exception of Children of Hurin unfortunately), so you can believe I have heavily tinted nostalgia goggles on here. Please, bear this in mind.Let's start with the gameplay. I massively enjoyed just about every aspect of the gameplay in this game. Monolith took great game mechanics that had been used in games like Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series, and greatly polished, if not perfected them. The combat is extremely responsive, every time I hit a button, the correct action was taken (Unless I hit the wrong button, a problem I fumbled through several times >.<). There is nothing quite like the visceral feel of fighting a large number of orcs, especially in the later stages of the game where Talion is fully upgraded and taking heads off with a frequency that would make revolutionary France jealous. The animations were smooth, with the expected clipping and distance bugs very rarely making an appearance. Difficulty wise, I found that the A.I. was quite proficient in throwing mixed groups my way, to ensure I kept my tactics varied; inevitably making my fights look more interesting. Fighting ten Uruks? No prob. Fighting fifteen? There's probably some archers in there. Maybe some Beserkers. I'll have to keep my eyes open. Thirty Uruks? I should probably get out of there. The amount of times I had to run and hide instead of just wrecking my opponents was very refreshing. The Nemisis system also provided a good bit of difficulty by churning out Captains with interesting strengths and weakneses; most of which forcing me to carefully plan out my strikes before initiating with a distraction or sneak attack. Even the politics of the Uruk society were sort of difficult to keep under your thumb; with branded Captains losing to stronger or brighter Uruks while you're busy on other missions (or dead).My complaints with the gameplay stem mainly from the lack of variety. One could see that Monolith was trying to make the game more interesting with the hunting challenges, survival challenges, slave missions, and weapon legends (Which were all good flavour I'll admit); but at the end of the day, Shadow of Mordor is an orc killing simulation, and not much more. Granted it is a FANTASTIC orc killing simulation, but I would love to see some more content. Perhaps the DLC?Visually, the game is stunning. I had just upgraded my graphics card for this game, and I was not disappointed. Although there is only two areas in the game, there was just enough variety to keep my eyeballs happy. The orc fortresses were well designed and lent fantastic atmosphere to my sneaking/slaughtering. All of the locales were distinct, and most could be tied to a particular purpose by the gubbins alone. Finally, the story, and here is where is I will probably get some flak. I loved it. Now, remember what I said at the beginning of the review? Where I've read just about all the lore Tolkien pumped out about Middle Earth and it's citizens? I am fine with the writers taking a little bit of artistic license with the lore, and more importantly I believe Tolkien would too. His whole reason for writing the adventures of Middle Earth was that he wanted to make good stories, something for his children and friends to simply enjoy delving into. He grew up on tales like Beowulf, had friends like C.S. Lewis, and wrote stories that hinged on the unlikeliest of circumstances. So when I hear other hardcore Tolkien fans complaining angrily about the likelyhood of this game's premise, or screaming about the story not holding absolutely true to the lore; I can't help thinking how these fans are getting lost in the tradition of Tolkien's stories instead of getting lost in the spirit behind them. Shadow of Mordor gives us an intrigueing story that doesn't put on kid gloves. Like the mythos it's based on, Shadow's story is mature and epic in scope, with tonnes of potential.I would love to see extra campaigns added through DLC for this game. In my opinion, the only thing this game needs, is more content. "

												What can I say? Finally we have a modern video game holding Lord Of The Rings IP, which is worth playing! This game is a must own for pretty much any gamer out there.I love the gameplay, It feels smooth and you really get into the character, regardless of the pretty all-out start of the story cinematic in the beginning. Combat is very similiar with AC and Batman franchise, so most of you will get in fast with the game. Combat is great, it's fun, it looks great and I love the variation in moves our character Talion holds. Also there are few approaches to combat and you can go for your own combat style and improve Talion alongside your style. It's great.Nemesis system is absolute killer and makes the true fun for the game. I love watching how Orc captains and warchiefs rise in ranks, fight each other. I love the fact that I can become a kingmaker and intervene a duel between captains, make one of them run away and spare his life, while I slay the other.Side missions are fun and I think the medium length is well-thought per mission.Exploring is fun, but I think there could be slight improvement in this regard, but this is just nit-picking.Final verdict: no severe bugs, lot things to do, nice features and all settings customisable to your liking. Must own game, buy it now when it is very cheap for the next 24hours!			"

												PROS:Good blend of Batman Arkham combat and Assassin's Creed open-world questing, nemesis system sets it apart from those games...perfect amount of content without feeling bloated/padded or consolidated too muchVery high quality graphics with good performance scaling (advanced options screen actually has explanations of what each adjustment does, which is a nice bonus), cinematics, sound design, voice acting...all around superb production valueCONS:No multi-gpu support (SLI/Crossfire) as of this review, 3 months after release which is pretty lame...highest texture quality requires 6GB(!!!) of VRAM on your primary card so multi-gpu support wouldn't help with that anyway...despite all this, game still ran just fine on my R9 290 with High quality textures, FXAA with motion blur @ 1920x1200, even during intense action so this is mainly a minor annoyanceINTENSE swings in mouse sensitivity/acceleration (particularly while stealthing/crouching) that is supposedly tied to framerates and sync with monitor Hz, possibly also with the motion blur...overall this game is pretty great for a console port but this seems to be one of the unavoidable compromises*possible spoiler* the last two boss fights with the Tower and the Black Hand are extremely disappointing and brief and this game uses very lazy QTE mechanics in all the parts that you are fully expecting to be the most difficultoverall this is going to make a lot of folks' Top 10 for 2014 lists and i feel it's well deserved, definitely worth whatever price it's being sold for			"

Posted: January 19, 2015
												So let me start off with the things i like about the game (i assume you've played it and beaten it? if not-spoiler alert!)1. the graphics are AMAZING. the motion graphics and battle sequences are fantastic. the blood, the guts, the slashes, the jumping, the sneaking, the zooming in and out, even the quick camera shifts...all amazing. I was very impressed. i was also impressed the game didn't glitch or have trouble keeping up with the fast-paced hi-res sequences.2. the story line and background info is phenomenal. although some of the things that take place are fictional even in the Tolkien world (Black Hand? Celebrimbor mind-controlling an orcish army? this game forces Tolkien fans to dig up their ""Tolkien Companion"" and do their homework, because the game seamlessly mixes fact with fiction), it's nonetheless obvious that the game developers are Tolkien fanatics, and have read their LOTR appendices and the Silmarillion. I REALLY LOVED how this game took place in times and places NOT covered in the books and movies. The Second Age of Middle Earth was not developed by Tolkien enough, in my opinion, and you have to really infer and piece the history of it together, because entire civilizations rise and fall within a single paragraph in Tolkien's notes (like Eregion, Khazad-dum, and the Gondorian guard on Mordor. ahem). So i was pleasantly surprised to delve into an untraveled corner of Middle Earth.Also, the story of Talion was pretty cool, and drove the plot/game very well. and discovering that the wraith was in fact Celebrimbor was pretty darn cool. I expected him to be some other random made up character like the Tower.3. the sidequests are fun, challenging, and rewarding. Artifacts, Ithildin, and forging a name for your weapons are all great ideas, and i enjoyed bumbling around ignoring the main story for a while to pick up all the extras.4. the controls are SUPER manageable and easily master-able, and i enjoyed the challenge of learning how to press the right button at the right time. it's also much less cumbersome than scrolling through hundreds of items like on Skyrim.5. the Uruk chain of command is really quite an impressive system. I'm sure it will be popping up in other games soon, because it was super fun using the politics of uruks against each other, even without branding.I also liked that you could get into blood feuds with uruks who had defeated you, and your death set the changes of leadership in motion. pretty cool.Now i will tell you what i didn't like, or what i was confused about and would like feedback on:1. did i miss something, or is this game extremely short? i logged only 30-ish hours and i'd beaten 78% of the game, including the main quest. after the main quest, there's not much incentive to ramble around picking up the last few artifacts and fighting endless uruks without any ultimate consequence. and i didn't know that picking the flowers was actually a mission--but there's no way i'm doing that.2. i didn't see a difficulty meter, so i'm left to conclude that this game was purposely made very easy. although some captains were difficult to defeat (namely the ones with shields, or the Combat Masters), i rarely actually got into such a pickle that i couldn't jump up a wall and sneak around restoring my life before plunging back in. I expected much more of a challenge throughout the game, rather than just getting used to the controls.3. speaking of which, what happened to actually FIGHTING bosses? by the time you learn how to brand, war chiefs practically kill themselves, and the Tower and even the Black Hand were basically video interruptions. It was cool, but i definitely wanted a challenge, which made the end of the game a bit of a downer.4. I know that this is Shadow of Mordor...but we're not even going to SEE any elves? or dwarves (save Torvin)? or anyone? no misty mountains? no rivendell? no Gandalf? not even EAGLES? come now. Artifact references are not enough. I was impressed by some of the cool stuff they referenced with the artifacts, but I expected to have a full map of Udun, a full map of Nurnen, a full map inside Mordor somewhere, and at least one full map in a well-known place. Minas Tirith? Eregion?this flaw is easily fixable, though--expansion packs! but i kind of doubt they will.5. Why in the world did they feel the need to cameo Gollum? of all the awesome characters that could have cameoed, they chose Jar-Jar. I mean, Gollum. No Gandalf? not even Radagast? They could have at least SHOWN the two blue Istari!at least it wasn't Orlando Bloom.I think there are a few more for both pros and cons, but those are the big ones. there were some smaller things that didn't make much sense (like why there would be artifacts that tell stories? why Talion was chosen? how did Celebrimbor actually get fused with Talion again? what's with the random white towers? why do you pick flowers to regain health? what happened to the hot blond chick? how was Saruman in the Queen's mind?) but weren't too bothersome. and it's true that game developers have to take some artistic license, so to speak, with such things.Overall, I give the game a B+. I would give it a full A if these three things could be changed (and maybe future expansions/updates will change them?):1. Develop the full story. if i get to clock 150 Steam hours to contentedly finish Skyrim and its numerous side quests (discluding any expansions) just once, then Warner Bros can surely put together a game that lasts for at least a third of that time. I don't want it to drag on and on, that's not what I mean--I want them to take the story to its fullest potential, and be in-depth. There is SO much content in this game, but without a plot to drive it it gets monotonous. I would have been totally content fighting captains and war chiefs in 5 other map areas just to reach the Black Hand!2. Make it more difficult (and include actual BOSSES). i should be able to restart this game like Halo and play it on Legendary, where even a single slice or arrow will cause me to drop to my knees and survive a ""last effort"" attempt.3. Explore more than just two random, un-noteworthy areas of Middle Earth. It was original and cool, but i don't think anyone will be content to actually play out the entire game in the ruins of who-knows-what/where/why, and the jungle ruins of who-knows-what/where/why.

												Okay, so this 1 Uruk Captain, Ûgash the Hunter killed me like 15 times, getting his power up to 20 or something. The reason for this was that he had only 1 weakness: he can be damaged(not vulnerable) by ranged. The problem was that the sucker had such good traits (Ambush, sneaky, group of followers and he was ranged) that it was almost impossible to kill him. Now I am at about 60% in the story and tried my luck at him yesterday.There he was, in a Stronghold with alot of Uruks, waiting to be killed, so I went into my bow mode, did 7 headshots and used my teleport kill ability to finish him off. Satisfied looking at all the Uruks running away, getting an awesome rune that gave me 50% extra sword damage, I noticed something was not right...Out of nowhere, 2 Elite Captains ambushed me and obliterated me!Well, 1 nemisis killed and 2 ♥♥♥♥ers took his place...Awesome game, 11/10			"

												One of the major reasons why I bought this game was the nemesis system; and it surely didn't let me down. I had some truly epic fights throughout the journey, that no other game can simply offer. The fact that any orc wandering in the world could be promoted to captain, is thrilling.The world is very immersive and full of exploring. For completionists there are many collectables to find and for people who just like to roam around without destination, this game has you covered. Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor offers something to everyone and I would highly recommend it. "

												This game has surprised me a bit, since getting it. It has shades of Assassin's Creed about it, spatterings of Batman Arkham City, and little droplets of The Witcher 2 when it comes to combat at least. This means you have to use stealth, aggression and evasion in pretty much equal measures, althougfh the game doesn't really force you down a specific route. The abilities you unlock are very cool, as as the boosts to base stuff like the runes on your weapons (you can have up to 5 that enhance all sorts of things like % chance to gain health back on stealth kill etc), so there's a lot you can do to customise your character.Now, let's be realistic here, this game won't really win any medals for story-telling - it's fairly basic, with a bit of depth, nnothing more - but here's the thing, you won't miss it. The combat, unlockables, environments and the Nemesis sytem (allowing you to dismantle, meddle with, or topple Sauron's army of Orcs) supercede any lapses in story-telling. The game covers two very large areas and there are many side quests and things to get involved in. You don't have to travel by foot (running or stealthing etc), you can also use the fast travel system which unlocks when you capture towers, or just tame a wild Caragor (big angry dog type thing) and ride that, carving through any Orcs you might encounter along the way.The only thing I wouild add, personally, is a character creation part to the game. Although the game follows the story of one guy (well two atually, ut that's a spoiler, almost) once you start to see the story played out you realise it doesn't have to be him, look like him, act like him etc. I would've like to have seen the customisation present in pretty much every aspect of the game, also extend to the character himself. Given that the story, apprently, doesn't quite fit with the LOTR lore, it wouldn't matter if the main protagonist was a short, fat dude or a gigantic woman with a voice like Barry White. There are currently only two skins for the charcter too at the moment (the default one, and a custom one you get by registering on the WB Games site through the game), so even that would've added another layer of something. But I digress, the game doesn't suffer from its omission.Anyway, I got this when it was under £30, and have not regretted it one bit. I didn't really see much hype about it (unlike games like Destiny which seems to be another hype-♥♥♥♥♥ game - all mouth, no trousers), and have enjoyed every moment of it. Being the completionist that I can be in these types of games, I've found all sorts of stuff to do, and clocked up a pretty decent amount of time away from the main story developing my character on side-quests and the Nemesis System. I've heard from others the ending isn't all that good, but I'm not sure I care .. with 20+ hours in the game already (and I've just entered the second of two acts, it doesn't really matter when the journey is as fun as this.I should probably finish by saying that I am by no means a LOTR fan, in fact I think Tolkein is a horrific writer, and Hobbits can go screw themselves with their big feet .. so my views are purely based on the gameplay, without a sniff of fanboyism anywhere near them. With gameplay this in-depth, they could've called it ""Shadows of One Direction"" and I'd still enjoy it. Well worth a buy, perhaps once it dips below £25 for those unsure about fighting games.8/10			"

												After now completing the main game and collected all the collectables in the game and most other side mission stuff, I feel I should now write a review after having a lot of fun.The gameplay places you in a small but open world as you travel about killing Uruk. The game features a system where enemies that kill you get promoted and those captains that kill you get stronger. It's a really cool system as all these Uruk seem to have their own personality and will remember you. The combat is pretty much like♥♥♥♥♥Creed and Batman. If the combat in those games weren't to your liking then you're not going to like the fighting in this game. However there is nothing to differentiate the combat mechanics beyond the abilities you unlock. In short this is a frankly repetitive game. Imagine♥♥♥♥♥Creed, the first one. The dialogue with these captains are simply superb. Even the idle chat of just the normal mobs in this game made me grin a few times. The game is superbly voice acted with all the characters, Uruk and yourself. The gallows humour comes in thick and fast from the Uruk as they talk amongst themselves while you're sneaking about in their base.The story simply has you going about from Point A to point B to kill things. While following the main story you'll unlock story related skills, which helps encourage you to finish the story. However, if you were to just do the main story quests and nothing else, then the game can be completed in one sitting in about six hours or less. Also, it needs to be said, the ending is horrible. There is no way around it. It's frankly terrible. The ending finishes with three QTE events, followed by a short cutscene and that's it.The graphics in the game are nothing to write home about. It's beautiful and it sets the setting and theme well, but not the best in the industry. Frankly that's fine because the art direction is also beautiful. The game hasn't gotten boring to look at during my play time so that's a good thing.All told this is a game that got me to pull an all nighter for the first time in years. It drew me in to the Tolkien universe unlike any Lord of the Rings game I have ever played and I enjoyed every second of it. Repetitive, yet tons of fun and funny at times as well with the voice acting. Worth the current purchase price? Yes, if you don't mind the repetitive gameplay and the frankly horrible ending. If those things are not to your liking then I still recommend picking it up, but at a discounted price, as this is still an enjoyable game which got me and the rest of my Steam friends talking to each other as we played this game. All told, worth your time to play, even with a back log of games.Thank you for taking the time in reading this.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game.Story is simple, but adequate. Music and sound effects are somewhat bland, but they get the job done. Gameplay is great. There's nothing like dashing across Mordor,  climbing walls and running along rooftops, and taking down countless orcs, all the while listening to the idiot orcs saying, ""I thought I heard something"" or ""Something just moved over there!"". Overall, great game.  Pick this one up at the next sale. I don't think the DLC are worth your time, unless you REALLY enjoy the game.Did I mention that Gollum is in this game? 10/10			"

												This game is so good it almost makes you forget that the gameplay is a weird lovechild of the Batman Arkham series and the Assasins Creed series, to an almost ridiculous extent. However, even if you do notice this, is quickly forgotten by the overall epicness of Mordor. The story is appealing to hardcore fans, but also accessible to new players, but if you like LOTR as much as I do, then this game is a an absolute blast. The pros: Great graphics, epic supernatural combat and a great source material. The cons: no greater challenge for players that like hard games, Talion is not the most interesting character, and you can pretty much get OP soon and just run over half of the game. Overall, a worthy purchase, the best LOTR games I've played and one of the funniest RPG's I've ever played.			"

												SHADOW OF ARKHAM'S CREED ...I'm sure that I'm not the first person to point out how much this games plays like a mash-uo of the Arkham and Assassin's Creeds games, just set in Middle Earth.  That's not a knock on the game at all, though (at least in my book).  If you liked those series (and most people did), you're going to like this game.  Period.That's not to say there is nothing original.  The nemesis system, for example, is quite fun, especially when defeated foes come back at exactly the worst possible time.  I was running a mission to defeat a pretty tough dude (for my level at the time).  There I am slowly wearing him down, trying to pick off his elite guard, dodging hurled spears ... and two other orc captains show up for revenge.  What was already tough fight suddenly because hilarious and insane.The open world is also quite nice.  Sure, there are tons of side missions ... but never underestimate the sheer joy of just walking around the countryside at random, clearning out camps and strongholds on a whim.  There's something deeply satisfying about picking off archers from a distance, stealth killing your way around a small encampment, or just walking brashly into the middle of twenty-thirty orcs, and emerging victories several minutes later.  On a side note, this makes it a game that can still be very rewarding in 15-30 min segments, if that's all you can manage on a particular evening.If you're still not sold, this game is on sale quite a bit.  I got the whole GOTY shabang for $10.  That makes it one of my biggest steals in years.Finally, if you don't buy it, all the hobbits will die.			"

												This is an amazing game.  Great Batman style fighting that makes you feel like god of combat.  The one complaint I have of this game would be the forced stealth missions that have an instant failure state if you are seen.  Fortunately, those missions are few and far between.			"

												Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game exhibiting high quality in almost all aspects of game design, including gameplay, mechanics design, and visual design. In essence, it takes the structure/premise of Assassin's Creed; couples it with combat from Batman: Arkham, and sets in a Lord of the Rings package. And that is a great combination.The greatest of the game's aspects is gameplay - the developers have crafted an experience that is fun to play and will have you coming back for more. It manages to instill a feeling of great power in the player, but acually has some great balancing that prevents the player from being overpowered in the game. Apart from this, the game is full of small, very intelligent features that add to the overall experience.The lore/setting is of course, fantastic. It's very deep and well established; it barely needs to be stated - The Lord of the Rings is *the* fantasy universe that all others strive to be.One criticism I can level at the game is its story. While the lore is deep and interesting, the story, for the most part, is shallow and quite unengaging. One character and subplot has depth and is interesting, but all others are not.This is actually overlook-able, however, because the rest of the experience is so solid.Overall, this is a very well-made game that is genuinely fun to play. I recommend it.			"

												Played for 2 and a half hours; died about 5 times and got about 2 nemeses. 10/10 would get killed again.Anyway, whilst the game seems easy at first, as the fighting is mostly just relentlessy clicking your mouse, it becomes more difficult just about the moment the prologue ended. Taking out a band of orcs isn't too difficult, as long as you keep paying attention and click at the right time. But as soon as some leader joins in, well, get ready for something you didn't expect. So whilst the battle gameplay looks simple at first, it gets harder quite soon, AND it looks terrific. All the buttons you have to smash, the small cut scenes, they all blend in perfectly. I think I'm off on a vacation to Mordor the upcoming weeks. Might as well start walking.			"

												HMmm The game is set some time between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and Middle-Earth lore has been handled well throughout. The story feels considered, brand new elements mesh well with established canon, collectibles offer nods to the likes of the Istari, Quendi, Dwarves and Bagginses, and there are even a couple of Tolkien's ubiquitous songs and verses snuck in between loading screens. Shadow of Mordor offers a deft and studious adaptation of the character of Celebrimbor, too, who is mentioned only briefly in The Lord of the Rings books but explained in more depth in The Silmarillion - as are the origins of Sauron, who we see in his 'fair guise' as the Vanyan Annatar during Celebrimbor's memories, which return to him throughout the campaign with the help of a tricksy Gollum. We also glimpse, in greater detail than ever before, the forging of the Rings of Power.One of the most enduring themes of Tolkien's universe has been the corrupting influence of power, but this has almost always been explored through the eyes of individuals that refuse to abuse that power. In death, Talion is free to do what those characters were never able to, and you experience first-hand what an intoxicating high that can be. At the start of the game you're not much more than a lowly Ranger, sneaking through camps and silently slitting Orcish throats in the night. By the end of the game you're boldly strolling through those same camps, as terrified uruks whisper tales of the Ranger-turned-Gravewalker over fortifying gulps of grog. There's plenty to see and do in Mordor when you're dead; all that's left, in the words of a wise old wandering wizard, is to decide what to do with the time that is given to you.			"

												This game, along with Dark Souls 2, is in the running for my Game of the Year. The combat is basically the same as the Arkham games, although I felt that at first it wasn't as flowy but over time it became just as flowy as the Arkham series. The story itself is pretty good. The plot is well done and the cutscenes are gorgeous, and the amount of outside lore put into the game by Monolith is outstanding, and it enriches the world deeply. The nemesis system is the elephant in the room. It's definitely the most innovative system I've played through in a long time. I remember my nemesis Mugluk Graug Slayer would simply refuse to die. I must have ""killed"" (if you don't behead said Uruk, there's a chance that he can come back) him at least 5 or 6 times and he kept coming back with a vengeance. I also had a hilarious experience with an Uruk by the name of Gunza the Rhymer. I beat him every time he fought me, and every time he came back he look more and more messed up in his face. In our final encounter, he retreated, only to be promptly eaten by a caragor (the Middle-Earth equivalent of a lion). Encounters like this make the game super fun and super addicting. I give this game a 10/10. It fulfilled all of my expectations and has given me a great time. I look forward to scouring Mordor all over again!			"

												This game so far has ticked all the boxes.Combat - As many have said, its like batman/AC. After unlocking techniques combat becomes very interesting.You have your average slice and dice finishers, to branding (mind control) in the middle of a fight and even brutalizing orcs to make others run away in fear.Story - I won't say I know all the lore to say it doesn't trample on some things, but I'd say its a decent story. It had some nice surprises too.SUFFER ME NOW - Dominating the minds of orcs will never get boring. Ever. Especially after its one that messed up a previous mission for you or flat out killed you.Death/Captains - If you die to a Captain (or Warchief) they will mock you the next time they come across you. So not dying has become a matter of ""not being insulted"". I also noticed a Captain make fun of me for having low HP in a fight, so that was cool too I guess.I could say so much more, but then I'd end up rambling. All in all, you won't be dissapointed in this game.			"

												Critics have been raving about Shadow of Mordor, claiming it's the best Lord of the Rings game to date, which isn't saying much. However, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor no doubt lives up to its franchise's name unlike certain past titles thatcrappymobacoughcough. The story is bland and lackluster, complete with the loss of a family and a revenge quest. All we need now is Talion, the one dimensional lead character, to wipe his troubles away with alcohol, and it'll be complete as a truly generic story. However, the gameplay is immensely satisfying. It's fluid, and surprisingly difficult at times; a stronghold alarm going off is quite possibly the most simultaneously thrilling and terrifying moments in gaming for me as of late. Being swarmed by orcs as you see familiar, scarred faces peer out at you with massive health bars and a roar to match, grants a feeling of both fear and excitement for the fight. Dynamically approaching combat through brutal executions, stealth kills, arrow headshots, drop down attacks, (or just plain out fighting,) is a gift that keeps on giving. The nemesis system is fun, and many of my worst enemies give me a continuous drive to hop back on and hunt them down. However, sometimes the orcs coming back can feel cheap, especially when you literally just killed them five minutes ago and now they're back with friends. Suddenly being hunted down by a past opponent can be enthralling and entertaining, but not if it's right after you killed them. Combat is accessible, frequently challenging, and fun to approach. The nemesis system is what I have spent most of my time in the game using, and I find it to be an excellent feature with multiple repetitive features, (flash back to the orcs coming back RIGHT after I killed them.) All in all, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a highly entertaining game that draws inspiration from Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham series, all without directly becoming a clone of either one. Its flaws are numerous, but once Skoth the Friendly is chasing you down throughout Mordor, you'll be having too much fun to care.			"

												Shadow of Mordor was a fun experience, like others have compared to Assassins Creed, I find that I could actually play-through this one without the boredom of AC. I highly enjoyed the gameplay, although I do wish it was longer. I found at end-game, I wanted more. The main quest path was really short ( I spent a few hours just playing with the loved Nemisis System ) and over 10+ hours on side things. The side-missions to take really get you to understand the game mechanics and play itself. Although, I do wish the ""towers"" did not reveal everything on the map, as it made gathering for other things in the game way too easy. If you're looking for a fun game that will kill 20-30 hours to complete it all, then grab it. If/When you get the game, go and download the free DLC, because A- It's free and B- It has a HD pack.9/10			"

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like if Aragon and Legolas merged into one kickass character and single handedly took on Sourons army of Orks? Well now you can with this title!!! If you have wanted to play a game where you can slay hordes of Orks for hours on end with style and finesse until your hands cripple from use of your controller, then I highly reccomend purchasing this game.Playing as a new character to the LOTR series Talion and his ghost elf counter part Celebrimbor, your job is to stop the Ork army in its tracks by infiltrating the sometimes hilariously weak and sometimes frustratingly hard Ork captains and taking control of their very souls. Meeting several characters along the way, most with short and unentertaining editions to the story line, evolve your characters skills to take on Sauron's evil henchmen.The game offers a simple fighting system which sees you easily killing enemies through out the game with incredible speed, skill and agility. With many smaller missions to upgrade your legendary weapons and skills along the way the only real struggles you will have come from the captains and warlords. This tends to happen in two ways. You either ignore the instructions on their immunities to different attacking styles and end up a cold corpse with no idea on how to destroy them or you accidentally end up stumbling on several Ork boss's in the area with no idea as to who they are or again how to wound them.The story line is progressive and offers a time filling engagement, though I would reccomend not focusing on the story line too much as the real fun comes from the feeling of invincibility of destroying Ork underlings.Pros:- Smooth fighting system feels incredible and slightly invincible- Game looks great and offers some candy for the eyes in the LOTR world- Offers a progressive back story in Ork heirachy and allows you to use this to your advantage- Has a good amount of unlockable skills to make you feel that much more invincibleCons:- Storyline is not as thorough and intense as could have been- Ork boss weakness system could have had a bit more depth- Main missions were reletively simpleOverall I enjoyed the game throughout. I have to admit I found myself slaying hundreds of bad guys in a row then struggling against a boss who wasn't wounded by sword or bow, so having to run away like a coward... or a smart tactician. The idea behind the Ork heirarchy can give you hours of gameplay and keeps the game entertaining until the end.If you want something to occupy your time and like the idea of mass genocide of a green race then this is defiantly the game for you.

												This game has great production values, and along with the Batman Arkham series, helps to dispel the notion that licensed games linked to either movies or other media, have to suck. Everyone's already said what's great about this game, I re-iterate what they say so just read their's.One thing that I hope the sequel would help remedy, is balance the Nemesis system if the person playing doesn't die often enough. I'm not saying I am great at the game, but with the game gives you the abilities and tools to know what's coming, so if you prepare always, you are unlikely to actually die at the hands of a Uruk you're actively hunting, unless you are incredibly unlucky.The end result is I had no actual Nemesis by the end of the game. All the strongest Uruks I dominated or killed. I thought that my Nemesis was this funny Uruk who happened to have the ""Fear of the Gravewalker"" trait that made him just run away all the time so he kept surviving. If the game gave me him as my ultimate Nemesis in one of the battles of the final mission, it would have been hilarious and great.But instead it gave me this Uruk from over half the game ago, who I don't think I even died to. I think they picked the highest power Uruk whoever survived against me, and he was still about 12 Power or something.There is some scaling in the game, I did face a lot of Uruks with more strengths than weaknesses. But I was never in real danger, I only died about 4 times in the whole game, I even played with no prompts. I wanted the cool Nemesis personal narrative that I see YouTubers get, like TearOfGrace's Prak Jaw, or AngryJoe's Olgoth, and I never got that.I really don't mind in the sequel, there would be more actual difficulty options, or maybe more proper ambushes the like that would help better players get that Nemesis experience.

												To put it out there i have been waiting for this game for the last year, and it lived up to all the hype. Simply one of the best games i've ever played. The gameplay is smooth and flows really well. Almost too well, to a point you beleave you can counter anything. The story is great, even if you are not fimilar with the background it drives deep into the plot and holds you there. The game provides lots of ways of playing, like ranged,counter crazy,poke and run, and stealth to name a few. There is no reason why any rpg gamer should not have this game in their collection.			"

												I have been waiting this game since april, crossed my fingers and hoped this would not be like TLotR: WitN in any possible ways. I can finaly breath freely becose this game is better than I could ever imagine.This game feels like it is combining two very good games into TLotR world. Batman: Arkham series and Assassins Creed series both were fun to play and kept me sitting in dark room for hours. (When Talion run's forward it looks bit like Geralt from Witcher games)Nemesis system is something new which I haven't seen before and it is something which I like, have to say it give's us more playable hours of orc slaying. Orcs are one of the best things in this game, lots of diffrent personality's (Voices, Models, Weakness, Strenghts etc.)			"

												I've only scratched the oozing, bubbling surface of this open world game and I forsee many hours being spent skulking through the ashlands of Mordor.  The combat is intuitive and fun, if not a little easy at times, and the climbing and running about the world are accomplished easily.  Your enemies have a lot of personality and someone took great care in developing each one into its own persona. The rune and stats upgrade screens are a little too small and unwieldy, as are a lot of the menu screens, which may be a result of the console port.It's almost like a nice meaty sandwich with high quality meats and cheese - stuffed between two pieces of generic bread.  The story cutscenes are beautiful, but you don't really have the connection with the characters and the plot just doesn't seem to stick.Outside of this, I see a future where much black Orc blood will be shed!

Posted: October 1, 2014
												I'm going to start off by saying I am a huge fan of the LOTR, so my review may be slightly biased. Well here it goesStory (slight spoiler if you've never watched anything about the game): You start off by reliving Talion's last day before his death/rebirth, and already you become somewhat connected to Talion. You are overrun by Uruk's only to have your family executed right in front of your eyes. You ultimately share that fate with them, but obviously you come back. But you don't just come back as a human. You now share your body with a wraith, who you find out is Celebrimbor, an Elven smith master who forged the rings of power. Even though I haven't played much of the story, it seems to be a pretty solid alternate reality to the actual storyline from the LOTR books. At first I was disappointed that I wasn't going to see Legolas, Aragorn, Gimli, or even Gandalf, but after spending a little time playing as Talion, I've come to admire him in his own way. However I can't help but feel like Talion and Celebrimber have sort of a Frodo/Sam relationship, especially when performing the missions involving Gollum.Gameplay: I really loved the fighting mechanics in the Arkham games, and this game definitely has that feel to it. Parrying is actually slightly easier than in Batman simply because you can block a move no matter what you're doing. You can be in the middle of a combo, finisher, bow shot, life drain, etc..and as long as you press the parry button while it's flashing, then you're good. However once you have about 30 enemies surrounding you, with archers and spear throwers firing from a distance, it gets fairly difficult. Granted you'll see the indicator showing when an arrow or spear is being shot at you, but at this point you're surrounded by so many enemies that it's hard to pay attention to everything at once.  Running, jumping and climbing feels more like an Assassin's Creed game, which I like. I wish though that they had put a little more effort into sneaking.  Graphics: While the graphics aren't the best out there, they are fairly exceptional and are the best I've seen in any LOTR games. Yeah I know there hasn't been much of any in the past few years, but still. My 780 handles everything on ulra, with the exception of the textures (set on high), and I get anywhere from 70-90 fps. Granted it dips to 30-40 fps once you have about 20 people surrounding you in the rain, but that's to be expected. While there are some texture smudges here and there, the bulk of the game is just a joy to look at. I especially love when it rains, as you can see water running down the walls, on the ground, and you'll be soaked as well.Voice Acting: Voice acting is superb! When someone is supposed to yell out of anger, that's exactly what they do. Yeah I know that should a thing every game does, but Commander Shepard in Mass Effect is a perfect example of a character with zero emotion. It's as if the guy the read the lines of the script without even knowing what's happening in the scene. You actually feel the emotion with Talion. It's not just him though, it's every character with the exception of a few Uruks. But they aren't supposed to potray much emotion anyway. I especially love the interactions between Talion and Ratbag. It's quite hilarious seeing Talion's patience with Ratbag grow thinner as Ratbag keeps ♥♥♥♥ing up Talion's plans; on accident mind you. All in all, if you're a fan of the LOTR, then you will not be disappointed with Shadow of Mordor. You'll find that the game doesn't have to follow the books for it to be a great experience. You end up getting to admire Talion as his own self, instead of trying to compare him to Aragorn; even though they do share some similarities.			"

												Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a nice game, Arkham style fighting etc. you've heard all the praise. The bad side of Mordor for me is the Captain System, I love & hate it at the same time. Everywhere you go you find Captains and everytime they call for reinforcements & everytime they do that the chance is high that a second, third maybe even fourth Captain shows up. I like it because you really feel like you are behind enemy lines BUT it can get very annoying if this happens to you early on.7/10 - Worth the money in my opinion but surely not the game of the year.

												Assassin's Creed: Mordor.Shadow of Mordor is basically just Assassin's Creed with Orcs and a lot more blood. The combat system in Shadow of Mordor is basic. It's an Arkham City/Assassin's Creed type of system where you can basically just mash the counter button to protect yourself. In the early stages, combat is relatively difficult, and you might actually die. Later on, though, it just becomes an absolute breeze. You get all the right upgrades and all the right runes (essentially enchantments for your weapons) and you can be killing every single enemy in two to three hits. It's VERY easy.That being said, there's an option to turn off combat prompts which makes the game infinitely harder. This way, you won't have giant flashing lights and signs above every enemy's head telling you when to counter or dodge them. I highly recommend playing with combat prompts disabled to actually have a degree of challenge.As for the story? It's uninteresting and pretty barebones. It's another typical revenge plot, i.e. ""This guy killed someone close to you. Go and kill him."" About 80% of the main story missions were just tutorials to introduce new features and that's it. The boss fights are pretty poorly done, too. The first boss you fight is basically just a reskinned Orc with some extra health. The second one you fight is just a blind guy that you've gotta sneak up on three times. The last boss is just an absolute spit in the face to the player. It's literally just a quicktime event. I recall pressing five buttons when they appeared on the screen to beat this guy. That was it.The playtime itself is short. Story missions don't last too long and you could probably blitz through the game in about 8 hours on the story alone.So why am I still recommending this game if it's a handholding AC spinoff? Because of the Nemesis system, a pretty innovative feature which makes this game worth playing. The basics of the nemesis system is that Sauron has him own army, and in his army, there are actual ranks, and a chain of command. The Nemesis system lets you target individual Orc captains and warchiefs and go out of your way to assassinate them and screw with the chain of command. The system is laid out in a board game style, with lots of captains and five warchiefs taking up their positions on the board.You can target each captain and each warchief individually, search for intel on their location and their weaknesses and strengths, and then go out and kill them. Each captain has a dynamic set of weaknesses and strengths to catch you out. For example, ""Bagabug Man-Stalker"" might have a weakness to attacks from mounted beasts, or he might be scared of burning. So when I creep up on Bagabug, I can know these weaknesses in advance and use them against him. I could bring a mounted beast to the fight and savage Bagabug within seconds, or I could try to cause an explosion nearby in order to set him on fire and cause him to run away in fear.OR, if I don't try to abuse his weaknesses, I try to assassinate Bagabug from above, but it turns out he's completely invulnerable to stealth attacks and I did absolutely no damage. Now I'm locked into a battle with him, and the captains are  quite strong early on. Failing to abuse his weaknesses means I could die pretty quickly. To add to this system, each action you participate in has an effect on the army. If you die to a normal, scrub orc, he'll be promoted to a captain and start making his way up the chain of command as well. These orcs even fight eachother, and get into skirmishes between them. You can intervene in these skirmishes in order to prevent captains from growing stronger, or maybe a weaker captain is attacking a stronger one that you've wanted to kill for quite some time. You can intervene and hinder the stronger one, maybe by killing some of his subordinates so that he's outnumbered, or you could try to pin his leg to the ground with an arrow to leave him open to attack.And the system only gets better and better from there, but to elaborate would probably spoil it a little more. Point in hand, the nemesis system makes the game truly satisfying, and that's why I've wracked up so many hours already.Oh, yeah. The game also looks ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful and runs at 60fps, 1080p on my GTX 970. It even allows a borderless window and is generally just a pleasure when you're trying to multitask.			"

The only thing is I wish the game was longer, If you don't take your time, you can rush through the main story pretty quick, (about 17 hours for me with some messing around mixed in) but there is still alot of side missions to do, and I am pretty sure there will be a sequel.

Posted: November 6, 2014
												(tl;dr at the bottom)It's an ok game... While I recommend this game, I'm not totally convinced it should get the praise it gets. Some elements of gameplay are very good and innovative (like the nemesis-system for instance) but I think there could've been more to it. I nearly 100%'ed this game in about 25 hours (with a few rescue missions undone). The biggest complaint I have with this game is that it's really repetitive at times. Especially the side-quests... Basically, if you don't care for the bonus objective of that mission, you just kill orcs... But sometimes you're forced to do it with your bow... Or you have to be in stealth all the time. At a later level you get a power called Brand. With it you can sort of control orcs. 'Control' meaning ""go apesh*t on the nearest orc and create a distraction"". Which can result in it attacking a whole different orc that you didn't intend to attack. While primitive it can sometime get me laughing when a branded orc captain who stood on the other side of the stronghold also starts to attack everyone in the vincinity and dies because it was a 1 vs 15... And I also made a booboo with the Dispatch-skill that way... Wasn't really funny then, though. Branding actually adds a whole new layer of gameplay and it's nice... but it's near end-game...There are 24 outcast rescue missions and next to that you have 10 missions each for your sword, bow and dagger. And everytime and I mean every single time you have to kill X Uruks. With a bonus objective being: ""kill X Uruks in a way that you actually should do and you would have done if given the time to analyse the situation and thinking with your brain"". Which doesn't really add difficulty to the already easy game. On the whole game I died around 10 times. And I died once on a story mission.Also: what's the point of these weapon quests if all you get from them is a shiny reskin of your weapon and an achievement... 2 even per weapon. I mean ok there are runes but couldn't they add a bit more damage or a skill that can only be unlocked by doing all the quests?Btw I hate games who forces you to play optional stuff without any reward but the achievement for it. It's good if it's a challenge. But don't put grindy repetitive quests in your game when it amounts to nothing but a reskin...Another complaint is that the game doesn't have multiple difficulties... Which means this game has zero replayability for me. Except the fact that you could encounter other goofy-named orcs (since they are randomly generated, except those who have a main quest tied to them).And my final complaint is: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending. With a poor excuse of a final boss (as you may have heard...). And feels like the whole game is a bit unfinished when everything adds up.ASIDE FROM THAT the game is really good!Main quests are good with great introductions to new powers. Graphics are phenomenal but I didn't really see a big improvement in the Ultra texture patch. Maybe because I'm still a 1080p peasant...Music is... ok? I don't recall much music... It was either your generic dramatic classical music or it was the tribal-like drums. Story is ok. While I'm not into LotR lore much (I've seen the films) I think I would've enjoyed it more if I knew more of the lore. Especially with the artifacts and such. Models are top notch with tesselation. Me likey. Animations are really good. Voice acting is very London. And what a surprise the dwarf is Scottish... (just kidding voice acting is great).Gameplay-wise, the game really shines with the nemesis-system. That your killer or the one who fled from you, remembers you and the fact that all that is voice acted, is awesome to say the least. It's fun to try and brand every orc to unify your army under one banner! It's also satisfying to lead a captain to become warchief with various events... and then kill him for giggles. The ability to order two captains to fight eachother is also awesome. The swordplay in this game is also very good. I like the batman's creed-style without being too much of 'zooming-20-meters-to-land-the-next-hit-and-back'-punch.TL;DRPro's:-Graphics and animation are top notch-Voice Acting is great-Batman-style combat (well it's a WB game after all...)-Combat skills are awesome-Nemesis-system is above awesomeCons:-Rather on the short side-Uruks must die!... like alot. Apart from collectibles it's all you do in this game.-Final boss (and final scene) is laughable.-Grindy side-quests that amount to... achievements... yay... errybody likes achievs... ugh...-Only 1 difficulty setting.-It says ""rushed release"" all over it.Verdict:7/10. It's a great game but falls a bit short on content. Combat is good with good abilities. Side-quests are repetitive, a tad grindy and amount to nothing but empty bragging rights. However what the game lacks in quantity it gets in quality. Graphics are superb and voice acting and animations are AAA. Ending sucks.I would recommend waiting for a discount before getting this game as it lacks content and has close to no replayability.P.S. It's my first ""serious"" review. So tell me wot ya think.

												The story is a bit lack-luster, but the gameplay is top notch. Combat flows very nicely, a large assortment of animations to keep kills from feeling stale, counters always seem fair, the captains' strengths and weaknesses are well varied, as well as their appearances. The Nemesis system is a nice tweak, adding some depth to the action. You can buy upgrades to power yourself up to god status, or forego them and have a satisfying challenge for most of the game. A great way to kill a few hours. 9/10			"

												I'm by no means a hardcore gamer.  I like to win and I like to gallavant around my digital world beating everything within and inch of its life causing great chaos.  I don't even like combat that much and get lazy when it comes to stealth.  Storyline is boring but it's clearly not what this game is selling so it's not really a dealbreaker for me.  It also has a playable female character (though in cutscenes you'll be shown as the default ManPain McAngst) which is always a plus. -Stealth kills easy to make and immensely satifying (but some enemies are immune, so watch out!)-Combat system very intuitive and the tooltips that can be enabled will walk you through it in-combat for the whole game if you want to in an actually helpful way -No real loot, but it helps me stay focused on my main objective- murder-Being able to brand animals like graugs and caragors means my potential chaos level is multiplied exponentially as I turn hordes of them loose in enemy strongholds and let them do the work for me. It can be a very challenging game if desired, but its' easy level settings are very well suited to a more casual style that just wants to watch Mordor burn.			"

												Combine the parkour element of Assassin's creed with the combat style of Batman Arkham Asylum, add in a levelling and revenge mechanic for the orc Captains that keeps you on your toes, and put it all the grim lands of Mordor. Apparantly it makes a good formula for a great game			"

												While it uses the Batman combat system, the Nemesis really sets it apart.  With each ""baddie"" having a good selection of abilities and weaknesses as well as models and attacks, it makes the game feel more dynamic.  The fact you can influence the enemies chain of command is a lot of fun.  This game will push any current hardware to it's limits, as there are few video cards that have enough VRAM to actually use the highest quality textures.  Meaning while it looks great now, it should remain looking good for years to come (i.e., it should age well).  It's writing is alright, not great.  It banks on the notion you know the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit stories.  Because without having that knowledge the writing would be considered fairly poor.  It's biggest weakness is it's use of QTE (Quick Time Event).   Towards the end of the game, combat with large bosses and indeed the final boss is reduced to just a QTE.Despite it's rather un-epic ending, when you beat the game, you are allowed to keep playing.  So if you want to do any of the optional quests at this time you can, or continue to mess with the enemies army, whatever.Overall, a solid game.			"

												Probably the best Assassin's Creed game to come out in 2014.I know I know, this isn't a Ubisoft Game, its WarnerBros. And that's why it's better.It brings the combat from the Batman Arkham series, and improves it slightly with some abilities and combo finishers, and the option to tune your weapon with some runes. Which make the combat quite better.The Open World thing/stealth/parkour it's pretty much AC like, which is good.And Overall, a decent experience .(+) Best Assassins Creed of 2014(+) You Kill loadsa orks(+) Unlockable skills which are awesome(+) Its fun(-) DLC's are straight cheats most of them. Pay 2 be OP.(-) DLCs which aren't cheats are just trials and ""leaderboards"", huh(-) It gets derpy at the beginning (you can get several enemy captains in the same fight and be overwhelmed)(-) and too easy in the end.(-) Plot is pretty bland, so much missed oportunities(-) And the stupid QTE at the end, DAMMIT.Overall a good game, if you find it under 25€ on sale it's a very good investment. I wouldn't recommend any DLC.			"

												I must confess, I made it less than 15 minutes into assasin's creed 1 before I uninstalled and never looked back at the franchise. I have the first 2 Batman games, and enjoyed what I played of them, but lost interest fairly quickly. So after 5 hours of this, I might lose interest soon, but it's no fault of the game, I'm just very fickle with the genre. That said, I think I'm more likely to keep this one around than give those games another shot. The nemesis system really hits the spot for me. It really is the game's only trick, though, so if it isn't enough to grab you, you're going to get bored quick. Every single aspect of this game involves slaughtering orcs. Later on you can ""brand"" some of them to be your obedient slaves, but all they do for you is kill more orcs. There's a few other beasts, but usually you just avoid them or set them free so they can keep killing orcs. The story isn't very groundbreaking, but they did a decent job of manipulating the lore into an excuse partake in never ending gratuitous orc genocide. There's even a Gollum cameo. It's good dumb fun and at least worth it's sale price.			"

												This is probably the first 3rd person game I've ever felt comfortable using kb/m instead of a controller. As a port it runs phenomenomally , and is also the first port in a long time that's actually fun. There isn't a whole lot of variety to the gameplay, but what it does, it does really wellThe graphical fidelity is decent, though it only has fxaa in options (I had to force proper AA through video drivers). Even going above recommended textures for my hardware, benchmark shows Fps is 55-185 with an average of 90 (rig specs below). No noticeable hitching or framedrops in game.The only bad thing I could name involves a bug with Savegame files. a quick peak at GameData.sav in notepad would suggest that some graphical settings are saved with character data. This resulted in a corrupted savefile when tweaking settings and I lost 55% progress.I purchased during the holiday sale at $29.99 CDN.

												If you liked the movemnt and tactics in Assassins Creed during the fighting, that alone makes this worth picking up.  Basicly that is what it is, Assassins Creed in Middle earth. But wait..theres more... The friging AI actually remembers your battles.. and unless you behead them..they return.. that's if you killed them in the first place. Sometimes, they kill you and remember that when you return.. some nice banter is included.. Ok, trhe stealth aint top notch and sometimes the orc can actually just bunch up and stare at you.. which takes a bit away.. but overall.. It's a pretty good game with nothing but action! Many side missions and a quest to the finish.. I am enjoying every minute so far.. Nice change from the shooters I usually play.			"

												<In-Depth Review>Now I haven't played any other titles that bears any reference to the popular fantasy series (aside from Lego Lord of the Rings) but I am certain that Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor will be one of the, if not THE, defining gem of LOTR-based gaming.Set within the Black Gate of Mordor, you are Talion: a ranger who was killed by an entity known as the Black Hand of Sauron. However, ""you are banished from death"" and paired up with an Elf-wraith who seems to have no memory of who he was in life. He senses a rising power that threatens the lands and together, Talion and the Elf must do what they can to get answers.It has been said in other user reviews and it will be repeated again (briefly): The essential gameplay style is akin to the Batman Arkham series. Combat consists of well-timed attacks and counters with a hit meter counting each blow and allowing players to invoke special take-downs and such. Stealth takedowns are highly encouraged and seem to never waver in terms of satisfaction. I've gotten plenty of joy stalking a small camp of uruks with nothing but my dagger. Instead of ""Detective Mode,"" there is ""Wraith Mode"" where you can enter a state that identifies enemies and other items of interest.The best feature of the title is, of course, the Nemsis system. A continually updating roster of Uruk captains, generals, and warchiefs is available at all times and lets you see what the competition is. There are missions that will require you to take them down but you are also free to find them in your own time. However, you should NEVER charge into a stronghold with your sword blazing. You need to learn more about your prey; learn what they fear and what they can do before going in. Intel for all the Nemesis can be gathered from three sources: intel lying around in camps, Worms (certain uruks identified by green in wraith-mode), and any weakened elite (that is key; do not kill worms and elites before gathering intel). Sure, you can learn your opponent through trial and error or even luck but gathering intel is a non-daunting experience that doesn't present a great challenge.Experience points are gained from kills, freeing slaves, completing missions, etc. Nemesis kills equate to Power; the tougher the enemy, the more power is gained. Getting Power unlocks new tiers of skills that are applied to combat and to the three weapons: sword, bow, and dagger. Killing Nemsis will also award players with a rune for one of the three which can be customized to fit the preferred play-style of the player Graphics-wise, this game is goregous. An oxymoron: they are the cleanest, dirt-filled hellholes I've ever seen. Tailon's cape billows beautifully and you can definitely tell on nearly every surface when it's raining. Voice-acting too is top notch though I'd be lying if I said I could identify the actors besides Andy Serkis's always-beloved performance as Gollum.A deep appreciation for the Lord of the Rings is well apppreciated, but unnecessary. An in-game guide will provide details on everything found in the game. My only grievance is that the exploration of the land is not as enjoyable as the Arkham series. Understandably, Tailon does not have a cape and grappling hook. But sneaking and running does wear thin after a while. There are a considerable amount of checkpoints that can be discovered and fast travel to any of them is possible at all times but I repeat: sneaking and running does wear thin after a while.All in all, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an experience of anyone who has any amount of love and respect for the classic fantasy saga. A familiar game-play driven by a rewarding enemy system set in a (slow) exploring open-world is what awaits any undead ranger brave enough to set foot in it.			"

												10/10 Best Political Intrigue Simulator EverIn all seriousness though, the stealth, melee, and ranged combat are all masterfully done, and it's truly fun to see the stories of the different Uruks unfold.  Gets hit for the campaign alot.  The written campaign isn't amazing (though better done than many others out there), but the randomized, unique story that you'll craft more than makes up for it.  Well worth any amount of money, I'd suggest grabbing the season pass while you're at it.			"

												This is a ok game it's not great but it has all the elements of a great game. First off the nemesis system is a lot of fun it's one of the reason to play this game. It has good graphics I couldn't play it on ultra with my gtx 660 ti but I could play it on medium high, and it looks good. The controls with the keyboard and mouse leave something to be desired but it's playable which is more than I can say for some of the games that have came out this year. The main problem I had with the controls is that sometimes not always but sometimes it would not go in the right direction, which got me killed. The combat is fun the animation quality is good and most of the time it flows well, their was a few times in the game where an animations looked forced. The story is good but there is almost none of it, they voice acting is great but again they went with quality of quantity which is ok, not enough games do that. Now lets talk about the reason you buy this game, the nemesis system. It is good until the end of the game, towards the end around the last five hours it becomes trivial, as does the combat and any other elements of the game that add difficulty. The reason for this is branding, once you can brand orcs all you have to do is spam it in combat and you soon have an army fighting for you, which is awesome but it makes the game way too easy. The reason for this is simple and probably could be changed easily, when you use any finisher you become immune to damage, which means if you are any good at the game you can spam brand and never die. Now lets talk about the replayability of this system because it seems like it would be great, but it's not. The max power level of a captain/warchief is twenty witch is trivial after you finish the game. Without even using the most powerful upgrades you can take on five or more power level fifteen plus with ease. Again this is caused by the problems stated above. So in conclusion if you want a 20 hour game that has a lot of quality but not much content this game is for you if you would rather spend three hundred hours in a game settle for the lackluster combat ok skyrim instead.(Side note, if there was a elderscrolls game with this combat system but more fleshed out it would be a lot of fun.)

												Let me start off with saying this: This game, for me, was the most frustrating game other than Dark Souls that I have ever had the rage-inducing experience of playing. That said, this game is incredibly fun. Shadow of Mordor takes what Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham do great, and smash them together in the greatest open-world (and, actually, open-story) I have ever seen. Stealth, while not 100% necessary, gives you the ability to plan out and control situations. On the other hand, when you are in open combat, it feels fluent and powerful, without being unbelievably easy as in AC.  The difficulty is not set by the player, and rather determined solely on your approach to the game. This can be extremely frustrating, especially for less-than-skilled players such as myself. However, what this method accomplishes is making the player simply learn to be better, and giving an absolutely incredible feeling of accomplishment. The nemesis system enhances this element of the game. When I am defeated by an enemy, he becomes stronger, meaning that the next time I try to fight him, it's even more difficult. So if I am ever to strike down this foe, I have to think very carefully in my next confrontation.  Speaking of the Nemesis system, that is what makes this game shine among all the others. Your enemies all seem to have a strong memory in which they can recall details of previous encounters. While not every grunt is pre-programmed with his own personality, if he finds himself promoted to being of any importance, a personality will be generated for him. This results in every major character feeling very alive, and very personal. You are the creator of your own villains. Captains and War Chiefs fall into their ranks based on the players actions, and can be promoted for doing things such as killing the player. Killing Talion is only temporary however, leaving you the opportunity to have a very satisfactory revenge-kill in which the Orc that slayed you flees in terror of the very thing that he killed not that long ago.   Furthering that same concept, When you are victorious, this also remains in the enemies memory. If someone gets away, they will remember their fight with you before. And if you think you kill an enemy, but don't ensure it via methods such as decapitation, you just might find yourself face to face with a scarred up and very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥captain. They will remember the general details of what you did to them. I found myself against a captain named Larn. After striking him down with my sword, he later returned as ""Larn the Scarred"" and told me that his men now called him ""The Scarred"" because of me, and charged me. In that fight, I accidentally threw him into some fire. After watching his body become an extra large torch, I presumed he was finally done with. I was wrong. Later he comes back with his entire face wrapped in cloth except his eye, and I have to admit, it was a terrifying sight. Here was an enemy that hunted me to his very end....           Well, I hope it was his end....  For those who care about scoring, I will give a number. 10/10. You may say that ""This game is a long way from perfect"" but to me a 10/10 doesn't mean perfect, else there would be no games that achieve this. This game is a 10/10 because it is an entrancing, fun to play, rewarding, and ongoing experience. It is along the same lines as Skyrim in it's ability to keep me powerfully connected and attached to this fantastic world it has created, and does one up from Skyrim and makes this world personal to me. No one will ever experience this same struggle that I did, no one will ever meet The Surgeon except me, and if they happen to meet someone with his same title, and even name, it will be by coincidence and it won't be the same character. This amazing level of depth and unique experience is what compells me to place a 10/10 score on this game.			"

												Assassins Creed + Arkham CIty + Far Cry = Shadow Of Mordor. BOTTOM HAS SLIGHT SPOILERS SO BE AWAREProsThe wonderful stealth and agility and movement system of Assassins Creed with the perfect combat system of the Arkham games plus the outpost captures and healing plants and strategy of Far Cry. All wrapped in the gorgeous and unforgiving dangerous setting of Mordor. This game is truely gold and everyone who has ever played any of the three series of games i mentioned will have a blast with Shadow Of Mordor. I enjoyed the nemesis system which brought purpose and replayability to the game. The extremely violent combat gave me a rush, especially when taking over outposts and capturing warchiefs.ConsThe shortcomings are limited but still need to be noted. at times it was hard to control Talion. A few times he wouldn't climb up unless i went down and back up again. The camera, though 90% on point, would sometimes make things hard to see in tight areas. But the main thing that annoyed me was the nemesis system getting in the way of itself and gameplay. Almost everytime i went to capture a warchief, there would be other captains that would see me and then the nemesis system would direct my screen away from Talion and to the captain for his quick speech saying he has seen me before. Though the system is great and above all other games' AI, it sometimes got in the way especially during intense battles where every move counts and the flow of the combat means everything, just to be thrown off by the nemesis system kicking in. It didnt ruin the game at all, but was annoying.VerdictThe few problems i had didnt turn me off to the game. it remains to be one of my favorite, definitely my top pick for games released in 2014. i only found one small glitch that made a few of the walls bright neon colors but that was literally the only glitch and it was during free roam so it didnt hurt gameplay. Overall i give the game a 9/10 simply for being able to blend 3 game mechanics from 3 different games into one beautiful looking game with plenty of satisfying gameplay. its not a 10 just for the nemesis system getting in the way of itself. Also not a 10 for the reason ill explain in the spoiler section.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i felt the ending of the game was so build out through my 30 hour gameplay. the story of him avenging his family's death was so compelling, even if not unique. His friendship with the hunter and queen. all very well done but i feel like Mordor needed....well more Mordor. the world seemed a little bland and the story needed more scenes like when Talion and his minions stormed the gates, that was exciting and had such a Lord Of The Rings feel! one big team against another in an all out fight in an open field. I loved that part but it only lasted a few minutes. Also the end we so built up just to be a quick time event where you hit a few buttons and beat the dark lord!!! common!! Ive been wanting to fight him since i first watched LOTR!!!! i wanted a real awesome boss fight. the only real boss fight was in the cave with the hunter. but the ending did leave with sort of a cliff hanger, hopefully a second game will bring a more exciting setting, boss fights and epic moments of two teams just clashing in all out warfare!!! other than that, everything the game did, it did it right. it was fun and now i still have 63.5% left in the game even after the main story!. plenty of fun packed in, a real joy to play.

												I recommend this game though it just feels like the ending was rushed. For the early part of the game you must think out your mission before acting. You use stealth more and pick your battles. By the end you are over powered and the final boss is little more then cut scenes. I thought I had further to go in the game but instead it just ended abruptly. Sure, the game is lather, rinse and repeat but that describes almost every game. It was still a good game and it had a clear story that made sense. It could have been a little better but it sure could of been a hell of a lot worse.			"

												I have thrown 45+ hours into and am still playing it, the game is amazing. Shadow of Modor is insanely addicting and while some people say it is easy I (being an average gamer) find it to be a moderate level, for me it is perfect, not too hard but still challenging, I tend run when I alert a stronghold as I have a hard time fighting 50+ orcs with some captains mixed in. And it is not just orcs you have to worry about, the beasts of Mordor are also threating and dangerous. This brings me to the nemesis system it is very well done, I enjoyed grooming an orc up to a higher level by letting him kill me over and over, and while it was weird to kill the same guy more than 5 times (as apparently you need to chop or blow a captains head off for them to be gone for good) it is still enjoyable. There is also a feature in the game where you can avenge you friends (Steam friends) who die in combat, when you die a message gets sent out to those on your friends list who are playing, this message is a mission for revenge. Completing a “Vendetta” mission grants more rewards and the ability to gloat over your friend at his or hers failure.Now some people have also said that the combat is repetitive and dull, but I find it far from dull and repetitive, upgrading Talion with new and better abilities as well as changing out runes keeps combat interesting and always new. I have found the main story to be very enticing and interesting. The characters I have encountered have kept me wanting to play more. The game, like the movies, has humor in it too, just enough though, it is not childlike and I have found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Overall my experience with the game thus far has been fun and eventful.			"

												First off the downsides: No character creation, no town hubs, no droppable item loot other then runes.  Game is lacking much of what one expects from a open world RPG.  Reasons to buy: The game IS open world, with few restrictions on movement, tutorial is fast.  Gameplay is very Batman Arkham City/AC5: BF with a dash of Darksiders.  Quests/movement/combat much like those games.The Nemesis System is this games One Trick Pony and WHAT A PONY IT IS!  The Nemesis system does for boss fights and boss encounters what the Radiant Quest system did for Skyrim quests making the combat and boss fights are the best I've experienced, games utterly addictive for me personally. If you liked Batman /AC games but found the stealth or puzzle sections broke up the combat, this game solves those issues.Best game I've played this year.			"

												One of the best LOTR universe games ever developed, but sadly has poor execution with regard to various story-key boss ""fights"". Additionally, the game was far too short (one could argue that you're supposed to fight warchiefs and captains over and over and play around with the nemesis system for most of the game, which is what ends up happening). I only got around ~23 hours out of this game, taking my time.7/10 overall, would have scored MUCH higher if execution was better, especially the ending.			"

												I'm sure you've heard people compare this game to the Arkham games, Assassin's Creed and all of that. There is no doubt it's ""inspired"" gameplay-wise by other games, but after playing this game I fail to see how that's a bad thing.The story is a pretty straight forward revenge-trumps-all revenge plot from beginning to end, where the main character experiences a big loss at the hands of some bad guys. It does have the aspect where an ancient elf ghost of sorts offers to help him on his way by giving him supernatural powers and in return the main character helps the elf find out more about his past, however. I was still not that engaged with the story, and the ending was... pretty underwhelming to say the least in my eyes.The gameplay is... well, it's an Arkham game with swords so lethal and brutal that Batman would certainly not approve. The free-flowing combat system where you slide between enemies to build your combo so you can unleash special attacks works as well as it did in Batman from my view, and the animation quality is pretty superb during all of it. It has the Arkham archetype when it comes to enemies as well, with everything from puny grunts to ranged specialists and big brutes you either have to hit in the back or stun before you can attack them. It's functional, satisfying and FUN! The stealth system is pretty basic with stealth takedowns and ""attention icons"" over the enemies' heads to let you know how suspicious they are, and you can indeed run away and come back when they calm down.The Nemesis system was hyped up pretty massively, and I feel like it works pretty well as a first dip into it. Including the normal enemies, you can also run into (or hunt) captains and warchiefs (even though even these guys are one of the ""normal"" enemy classes, for reasons that will be obvious soon) These guys are stronger and they have strengths and weaknesses. You'll meet the captain that counters all your finishing moves and can't be hurt by ranged attacks that can be instantly stealth killed if you sneak up on him. You'll meet the captain that takes damage from most attacks but can't be insta-killed, but is terrified by certain animals and becomes a clumsy little baby when he sees one... the list goes on, and there's a lot of combinations here! The warchiefs also often have captains as their bodyguards, so going for them often turns into a huge brawl.The mention of obvious reasons why these mini-boss enemies follow the normal classes is because a random grunt that gets the killing blow on you can over time rise through the ranks and become the next warchief. This game makes death both interesting and a tool at your disposal if you want to play around with the enemy officers, who constantly fight eachother and try to increase their influence. You gain the ability to ""brand"" them eventually, which lets you control them and decide their decisions. Is that warchief really giving you trouble? Seek out his 5 bodyguards and brand them, then turn them against him when you confront him again! It's all pretty fun even if it is somewhat limited, especially if you're like me and you enjoy manipulating game worlds and enemies. You should also try letting a random Uruk kill you and then indirectly protect him all the way to warchief rank simply by helping him in his trials, but not branding him... pretty sure that's an achievement, actually. And oh, they will remember if they killed you or you did something mean like burn them, and they will make sure to say it to you when you fight them again as well.I will admit that to many the game will probably turn a bit repetitive. The combat is fun, but once you get all your upgrades it does turn a bit easy. Get a 5 hit streak, decapitate two enemies, then repeat. If you want a bigger challenge you might want to consider limiting your upgrades, or maybe limiting how many health upgrades you get. The nemesis system does help quite a bit as you can jump in even after the story is done and make some riots happen, and a big messy brawl is never far away. That is most of the game though, it's a sandbox that in the end comes down to violently murdering Uruks no matter how you look at it. Or making them kill eachother on your behalf, but still counts!I had plenty of fun with it and I'm sure I'll enjoy toying with the Nemesis system for a while still, but just be aware that if you want a big amount of variety in the in-game activities it might lack here. But if you love the free-flow combat system of the Arkham games the potential repetitiveness is probably a good thing, as there's a lot of brawls to be had.			"

												Combat is never dull but your character will feel overly badass and unchallenged by this combat system. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Many will find it entertaining but some will find it boring. To increase difficulty, turn off all combat queues so you have to use enemy motion and positioning in combat when fighting large groups.For extra difficulty, never go ranged. Surviving a fight with ranged enemies nearby is quite a challenge and the sound effects as a tomahawk goes whipping passed your head are exhilerating.			"

												All of this is based on my opinion.GRAPHICS: 9.5/10 : This game is beautiful and the draw distance even on my computer setup is pretty impressive, there are a few in game *using game engine* cutscenes for the main story and a few pre rendered cutscenes. I rarely came across clipping or clipping issues, particles looks great. Not perfect but damn good.SOUND: 10/10 : The soundtrack , the sound effects, the echoing, the voice acting, and many other effects are used with great care in this game and give it a pretty awesome feel and pace to the game. Very much what you would expect from a LOTR games.GAMEPLAY: 9/10 :Fantastic climbing, responsive controls, just enough enemy variety to keep it interesting, with the opportunity to really just go into a group of Orcs and just start destroying them one by one. You get melee sword action, stealth gameplay, and ranged combat. This all makes for a fantastic experience that only near the end got a little stale for me. I am not the biggest fan of quick time events but this game used them in a decent way. Pros: Graphic, bloody, gruesome, fast gameplay, propped up with a great story that helped me understand the lore of the one ring how it was made, what happened to the ring maker, seeing another story unfold in a great way. This game will give you hours and hours of fun either creating a army or orcs or destroying every last one of them. Or you could just do both and still have amazing fun.Cons: at the end of the game the gameplay got a little stale as many of the things you have to do at the end are things you have had to be doing for the last 15 hours or so of gameplay. This for me meant that at the end of the main story I was really looking forward to playing another game. The middle ground: I bought this for 10$ and to me it was worth easily 2-3 times that amount in gameplay ,story, and fun factor and that is not something that happens too often. If you can get this game for less then 30$ or cheaper i suggest you do so as you will not be dissapointed. I find it really hard to find any real flaws this game has, considering i got almost 40 hours of playtime out of it and had lots of fun 95% of the time, and i still have some things to 100% still as at the end of the game i only had 80% of the game complete and that was without the DLC i have yet to play. Final say: If its cheap and you have been thinking about it just get this game, it will be a good investment in my eyes.			"

												I am only 5 hours into this game, but I love it.  The graphics are beautiful, the combat is smooth with a good learning curve, and I love the upgrade system.  The story is very fulfilling so far, with (spoiler alert) everyone's favorite Gollum in a very story central role.  I like how when you die the Uruk who killed you gets promoted (and stronger) but if you encounter him again he will actually remember killing you and will fight accordingly.  The AI is wonderful, with emphasis on reacting to your style of play and attacks.  I can't wait to finish this game! I will update after completion but at this time I cannot imagine anything other than  100% positive review.  Oh and did I mention the Graphics being Beautiful?Side note: The first time I played I set everything on Ultra (FX8350 + R9-280) and I noticed a little hiccup (frame stutter)  sometimes.  But after that I ran AMD Raptr and let it auto-optimize my settings. Still playing with almost all the settings maxed, but since then it has played smooth as butter with not even one single frame stutter.    Would Absolutely recommend 10/10			"

												Not really one for writing a review, but lets see.Shadow of Mordor is one of the few games in the last while that I've thoroughly completed, I have 100% on the main game (though not yet all the achievements) but haven't yet touched the DLC.The game for the most part is fun, though if you start getting sidetracked completing the side missions and collecting the pickups and completing the legends of the weapons, you become too powerful and the game largely loses any challenge. Indeed I would argue that I found the last 3 levels too easy. (Yet can easily start getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked when swarmed by Cragors)The music is superb, it really does a great job of setting the mood and mostly doesn't end up feeling reptitive. The voice acting was also really well done, I was particularly taken with Torvin.Graphically its fantastic, even on my paltry 1680x1050, the diveristy in the Uruks really makes the world feel alive.That said, the AI is very blind! You could be standing around 30-40 feet away from Uruks in an open field and they won't see you. Its kind of awful, after a while unless a mission calls for it there really isn't much need for stealth.I enjoyed myself, but I felt after 20-25h of play that it just felt like it was a grind.			"

												Almost two years since it was released, there still hasn't been anything like SoM's Nemesis System featured in any other game out there. While SoM can be a bit draggy in places, the Nemesis System keeps random exploration exciting - it feels like you're playing an MMO at times when you encounter enemies that remember you and hold grudges against you. (I was kind of hoping another WB Games release *coughMadMaxcough* would have this feature, but no such luck. Shadow of Mordor remains a unique experience because of this mechanic.)The Photo Mode, introduced in a post-release patch, provided me with hours of fun, even after I had completed the entire game. And the graphics are stunning.			"

												Can't really say anything that hasn't been said but I'll give it a go...(TL;DR below)Basically the game takes the ""Assassins Creed"" and Batman ""Arkham"" series,looks at them and says ""Meh...let's throw in some super powers for the hell of it!"".The game seperates itself from both of those games however with how the gameplay is tied into the nemesis system.Every encounter feels new and different thanks to the nemisis system, which causes the enemies you fight to respond to you in different ways depending on how you've encountered them before. The system is really well implemented and I honestly hope more games use it, or some version of it, in the future. As it adds an extreme layer of personality to the game as a whole. Enemies feel like actual characters to you rather than cookie-cutter ""soldiers"" that are all the same regardless of what you do.Example: While fighting you throw a guy into a fire, but you get interrupted before you can kill him and have to bail, the next time you encounter him he laughs at you for your failed attempt to kill him, but has secrectly developed a fear of fire, (which you learn of through careful espionage), and you can exploit this to weaken him this time and secure the kill.Graphics and sound-wise the game is stunning, with some jaw-dropping animations.The voice acting is stellar with the dialog between the main character and the side-characters really highlighting this.HOWEVER:The game feels a bit on the small side. With only 2 main areas you will be re-visiting a lot of places, but the game will usually have you come at an area from different directions each time so it does feel less repetitave.TL;DRGameplay on its own : Good              7/10Gameplay PLUS Nemesis : Amazing  10/10Graphics : Fantastic                            8/10Sound : Great                                      8/10Overall: 8.5/10The game is really excellent, great fun, and different each time you pick it up. A must buy for any Stealth/Action Fan.			"

												An excellent non-canon adventure.  It's very similar to an Assassin's Creed or Arkham game (specifically, AC movement right down to reproducing the glitch where you can occasionally not grab things if you climb a wall at an angle, and Arkham's swarming enemy battle system.)  However, that definitely doesn't do it justice.  It circumvents most of the design flaws of both titles and adds a lot of brand new (to me) stuff.First and foremost, AC and Arkham games tend to be paced quite poorly.  They give you all these abilities in the first 6 hours or so of gameplay, and make a game that takes a good 50 hours or so to do everything.  Shadow of Mordor holds things back from you until something like the 4th or 5th last core mission of the game, so you don't get bored with the same old abilities.  Speaking of abilities, all those experience-earned abilities are paced superbly - I had exactly 1 big fight left when I got the last of those abilities.  Point is, AC and Arkham games are both big enough to outstay their welcome.  Shadow of Mordor doesn't.  Second, there's the variety of things to do.  Some of them aren't all that useful (why throw daggers for minor damage when I can pull out my bow, line up a headshot and get a one hit kill (and a chance to terrify a couple of orcs into fleeing in the process), but a lot of that is in playstyle.  (The guy who feels the bow/slowmo combo is cheating (and let's face it, it's totally unfair) might quite like those daggers I'm so dismissive of.)  Assassin's Creed tends to give you a laundry list of gimmicky tools when all you really want is your sword(s), pistol(s)/throwing knives, and hidden blade; Arkham Asylum (the only Arkham I've played to completion) gives you gadgetry that increases your mobility.  Shadow of Mordor gives you the ability to brainwash an orc, order it to kill its friend, then make its head explode when its finished.  Or the ability to hop onto a Graug (which is to trolls what gorillas are to humans - recognizably similar but significantly stronger, stupider and better at smashing things) and rampage through an orc camp.Speaking of the brainwashing thing, I think they made a significant error, at least in marketing.  They really played up the signifigance of this ability, but it doesn't appear until about the 3-quarter mark in the main game.  And you're quite limited as to what you can accomplish with your minions - rank and file troops can just be used in the area (which is fine), captains can only murder other captains, become a warchief's bodyguard, or backstab the warchief he's guarding.  Warchiefs, the top ranking orcs in the game, can murder Captains as before, and have the ability to challenge other warchiefs in a ""riot"" - 1 warchief and several orcs on each side, fight it out and see what happens.  Near the end of the game (SPOILER WARNING - LOOK FOR ALLCAPS), you can lead a group of possessed warchiefs in larger battles, (END SPOILER WARNING), but you can't do anything on this kind of scale ingame.  I'd love to take the Warchiefs and Captains of Nurn (who are, in my game, virtually all under my command) and march them up to Udun (the first area, where the command structure was rebuilt after I killed everything of rank in the first half of the game) and start a war between these two large groups of Orcs.  It would be great fun.  It would also probably murder my computer, but that's no reason not to include it - there are much better computers than mine.  It's still fun, it could just be better if they'd added a few more options.On the technical side, the game is largely brilliant.  The graphics are definitely excellent - Udun is a perfectly appalling place - a blasted ruin - and Nurn is eerily green and pastoral (apparently it's canonically the area of Mordor left fertile in order to provide food for the Orcs).  Only in the heat of the most intense battle in the game did I once experience a minimally noticable drop in frame-rate.  Load times are rare and take merely seconds (and include little snippits of Tallion's history to distract you from the fact you're staring at a loading screen), despite this immense level of detail.  By far the best implementation of background loading (and appropriate use of the extensive amount of RAM available on the computer).   The one unfortunate result of this is that Orcs spawn in at very short ranges.  While I never actually caught them popping into existence (except on the minimap), there were a few missions I was trying to accomplished by stealth (that is, silently murdering everything between point A and point B) where I was seen by Orcs in places I had cleared out seconds earlier.  Fortunately, the game rarely forces you to take a stealth approach, so getting caught just moves from the amazingly brutal (but stupidly easy...by a Metal Gear Solid fan's standards) stealth to the wild melee of a battle through an Orc stonghold on alert.  And when you're not in a structured mission, you can always just run away if things don't work out - strongholds often have so many orcs that fighting them all just becomes impractical.  In short - if you liked Assassin's Creed and/or Arkham Asylum games, but wanted to mind control enemies, ride troll beasts and creatures I can only describe as being the result of genetic experiments involving a rhino and a lion, this game is your chance.  Just don't consider it official Tolkein canon; even the basic premise of you and a dead elven wraith working together to cheat death breaks canon in many ways (death is absolute for men, wraiths are half-living creatures, not undead, etc.)			"

												Definitely the best lotr game I've ever played, and the Nemesis System I guarantee is going to be the new in-thing that every game dev is going to copy! It's hard going back to other games, now. I've been spoiled by Shadow of Mordor's excellent AI and all the little stories within stories. The game is quite fantastic, but there's a few complaints I felt I should voice:-Graphics- I couldn't tell the difference between low and ultra, apart from a performance difference-Glitches in the controls/parkour system would get me stuck inside walls quite often to where I'd have to restart the mission.-Almost impossibly hard in the beginning, by the end you are godlike so after you finish it there's not much motivation to continue collecting things/doing side missions-Controls seemed sluggish and laggy at timesThe pros, though, definitely outweigh the cons. However, if I could buy it again, I would definitely buy it for a next gen console, not the PC. If you're going to buy it for the PC, make sure you get it on sale, because it's relatively short (I'm at 90% done with only 37ish hours on it) and the controls can be wonky at times.Overall though, if you love lotr you'll probably love this game to pieces. It's an excellent addition to the lore. on a scale of 100, I'd give this game a 85.Review Update: It was so good I bought it again, this time on Xbox One and it performs much much better on the Xbox One, so if you have a PC that isn't top notch, consider getting it on PS4/Xbox One			"

												I recommend this game though it just feels like the ending was rushed. For the early part of the game you must think out your mission before acting. You use stealth more and pick your battles. By the end you are over powered and the final boss is little more then cut scenes. I thought I had further to go in the game but instead it just ended abruptly. Sure, the game is lather, rinse and repeat but that describes almost every game. It was still a good game and it had a clear story that made sense. It could have been a little better but it sure could of been a hell of a lot worse.			"

												This game feels like Arkham City mixed with Assassins Creed, and I love it. The Nemesis system is very refreshing and the captains are badass. The only bug I've encountered was an issue where I was missing certain sounds during a fight. All I could hear was my footsteps, but as soon as I did an execution it fixed itself. I would definitely buy this game if you enjoyed Arkham City or Assassins Creed, and you like Middle Earth. I've spent maybe half my time actually pursuing the story because just stealthing around killing Orcs is so much fun. The fighting gets more complex as you progress with new enemies and abilities, so the combat stays pretty fresh. The strengths and weaknesses of the captains and warchiefs makes you try different strategies and alter your playstyle to kill them. Every time you die the Orc or Uruk who kills you is promoted and they get stronger each time they kill you. This really makes you want to track down your nemeses, it also makes killing them very rewarding. I'd definitely reccomend this game especially if it is on sale.

												Well. I have played a little over six hours of the game and I feel that I understand the game well enough to make a review.In the six hours I have played, I have barely done any story missions, and that says alot. I am not implying that the story is bad, I just got so involved in the nemesis system which brought me away from the story.So, here we go.Story, 9.5/10. Personally, I'm finding the story very interesting, and I love the inclusion of golem. I find the idea of Talion being banished from death a very cool and fun way to explain what happens to him when he dies, instead of just respawning with no explanation.Combat, 10/10. All of the combat animations are very fluid, and the combat is very responsive, and I get enjoyment out of slicing Uruks' heads off. All of the executions are /VERY/ satisfying.Nemesis System, 10/10. This system is absolutely WONDERFUL. It is very important to look at your targets' strengths and weaknesses, you will know how you can exploit them. Multiple times, I have killed a target, and I stumble upon him once again, though he has metal in his head from when I shot him with an arrow. Another Uruk just refused to die, he kept coming back, though I gave him a large scar across his face. When you encounter enemies that you believed to be dead, some sort of hatred fills you, and it is very satisfying when you get to kill them a second time.Keyboard/Mouse controls, 9.5/10. The controls have worked very well for me, and I have had no real problems. They don't take much getting used to, either. Overall Rating... 10/10! This game is a solid contendor for Game of the Year. It is a wonderful game, with a wonderful story and gameplay. This game is worth purchasing at full price.			"

												Its Batman Arkham meets Assassin's Creed, and thats not a bad thing.With the elements from the nemesis system on top of the Captains/Warchiefs, this game is actually what Assassin's Creed should be. Throw on top of that an excellent copy-cat of the Batman Arkham combat system, its an excellent game. Highly enjoyable.			"

												It feels like you're playing an Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series merge, as almost everybody have said, but with a plot set in Tolkien's Middle Earth. This is the perfect combination. This game is amazing, but I feel it lacks gameplay time. I just ended the main quest in about 12h and this really disappointed me. Anyway, I'll probably continue playing until I get 100% playthrough, mostly because I loved every other aspect about this game. Graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is wonderful, the gameplay is perfect... Buy this game.			"

												Pretty good overall. The combat mimics the Batman Arkham games, and the stealth and exploration reminds me of Assassin's Creed. The nemesis system is amazing and always seemed to surprise me even when I thought it couldn't anymore. Main story? Eh, kind of bland, also very short. For those of you who appreciate LOTR lore, I'd be careful with this game's interpretation of it because at some points it made me go, ""uh... that's odd?""Might give it a 7/10 because of the nemesis system, honestly. It's very good, but after you're done with the main story and you've collected everything, there's honestly nothing else to do in the game besides achievements.			"

												9/10I'll tell you what you really want to know.  It. is. a. blast!  Runs great, no bugs, great graphics.  3rd person action with very smooth combat system.  I love everything about the game.  I only have 1 note to make.  The timing to counter with the Y button gives you the perfect amount of time but the A dodge does not.  You need to keep an eye on the animation to dodge A attacks.  Don't count on the A button to let you know.  By that time its too late.If you like good looking action games, this one is a no brainer.  Buy for sure worth full price.			"

												This game is amazing, you can beat the main story in a day, or you can be cool like me and spend 100 hours to complete it. Why, you ask, did i take so long? because unlike most gamers i dont care as much about the story, the game play is amazing, the way enemies remember you time after time is awesome and i was having so much fun going around hunting caragor and graug that i forgot all about doing missions. The captains are pretty cool as well, They all have diferent abilities, fears, weaknesses, and hatreds. So with 1 captain you can shoot him in the head and kill him instantly, but with a diferent captain he will be immune to ranged and stealth attacks so you have to face him head on. The gameplay itself is pretty much the same as Assassins creed, when i described the game to friends i told them ""Lord of the rings and Assassins creed had a kid"". Even after completing the main missions its still a lot of fun to run around mordor expanding my army and taming Dire caragor. After all of that however, there is still one little problem i had, and its a big one! (if you get that joke you the real MVP)The final boss fight was extremely disapointing and, for me personaly, far too easy but i wont spoil details, play for yourself if you want to see why i feel that way.

												  Here we have a game i can recomend to anyone who likes action games. It does not really matter if one likes the Lord of the Rings or not, this game doesn't require you to have prior knowledge or set you in any super immersive lore. Sure it has lots of stories to it, but it can be just skipped to play the game. The world is set up really well, i don't remember seeing something like the same stone in two places, so the overall layout is pretty unique.  The combat is very dynamic and leaves enough room to make your own fighting style.  The overall playthrough is great, though i'd like the storyline to connect the two areas better and the control over the character could be slightly better. Overall i'd give it a 91% rating.			"

												What attracts me:- Good varieties of Orc in terms of look, character. There is the brutal macho looking Orcs, the skinny stealthy archer, the greedy nerdy looking ones which adds to the fun of watching various cutscenes along the way- Talent trees upgrade makes you stronger of course but is not everything to the game. Some level of skills are still required (timely click / mouse movement / keyboard)- Weapon upgrade & runes allows mix and match to suit different play style and blends well with talent tree- You get to play warrior / stealth / archer to your liking- Commanding an army of Orcs felt really cool- Very nice graphics & smooth transition into cutscenes during game playCons (of DLC):- Rune farming is too random, and too many useless runes- Need the options of ""Retry"" on very mission as oppose to having us run a long way back to restart mission- Need difficulty options. Game is on the easy side after you learn the mechanicsConclusion:- All in all, extremely fun game and well worth even the full price. One of the most enjoyable games I've played- Must get if you like Dragon Age, Divine Divinity,  Elder Scroll Skyrim [Middle Earth comes top among them for me]			"

												SHADOW OF ARKHAM'S CREED ...I'm sure that I'm not the first person to point out how much this games plays like a mash-uo of the Arkham and Assassin's Creeds games, just set in Middle Earth.  That's not a knock on the game at all, though (at least in my book).  If you liked those series (and most people did), you're going to like this game.  Period.That's not to say there is nothing original.  The nemesis system, for example, is quite fun, especially when defeated foes come back at exactly the worst possible time.  I was running a mission to defeat a pretty tough dude (for my level at the time).  There I am slowly wearing him down, trying to pick off his elite guard, dodging hurled spears ... and two other orc captains show up for revenge.  What was already tough fight suddenly because hilarious and insane.The open world is also quite nice.  Sure, there are tons of side missions ... but never underestimate the sheer joy of just walking around the countryside at random, clearning out camps and strongholds on a whim.  There's something deeply satisfying about picking off archers from a distance, stealth killing your way around a small encampment, or just walking brashly into the middle of twenty-thirty orcs, and emerging victories several minutes later.  On a side note, this makes it a game that can still be very rewarding in 15-30 min segments, if that's all you can manage on a particular evening.If you're still not sold, this game is on sale quite a bit.  I got the whole GOTY shabang for $10.  That makes it one of my biggest steals in years.Finally, if you don't buy it, all the hobbits will die.			"

												This game feels like Arkham City mixed with Assassins Creed, and I love it. The Nemesis system is very refreshing and the captains are badass. The only bug I've encountered was an issue where I was missing certain sounds during a fight. All I could hear was my footsteps, but as soon as I did an execution it fixed itself. I would definitely buy this game if you enjoyed Arkham City or Assassins Creed, and you like Middle Earth. I've spent maybe half my time actually pursuing the story because just stealthing around killing Orcs is so much fun. The fighting gets more complex as you progress with new enemies and abilities, so the combat stays pretty fresh. The strengths and weaknesses of the captains and warchiefs makes you try different strategies and alter your playstyle to kill them. Every time you die the Orc or Uruk who kills you is promoted and they get stronger each time they kill you. This really makes you want to track down your nemeses, it also makes killing them very rewarding. I'd definitely reccomend this game especially if it is on sale.

												The gameplay is pretty similar to Batman. It's very fun and not boring. The game might be hard at first but it'll get a little easier as you are familiar with the  game. It took me 20 hours of gameplay to finish the story and that is with exploration and doing the sidequest. The sidequest can get repetitive but its amazing how they have different settings or different ways to do the quesnt even tho you are using either only a sword, knife and bows (I'm not talking about the power struggle quests). I think its because of they gameplay itself. The story was quite good actualy, *SPOILER ALERT* Discovering the story of Calebrimor the ring maker or the wraith inside your body was pretty fun and the mini boss battle that you encounter after going deep into a cave or sneaking trough the orc stronghold  to find the ""left overs"" of Calebrimor's past was really fun compelling*END OF SPOILER*This game is pretty much similar to other games or you can say this game is a mix betwen Batman and Assassin's Creed in terms of gameplay. But what makes it unique? THE NEMESIS SYSTEM: this is a cool new system that is added to this game. Basically it give the orc or uruk captains and warchiefs different personality and the voice acting is very well done on those orcs and uruks.My only complaint is that the story and map is too short and small for a 40 GB game. also the last boss fight was a joke and dissapointing !-_- The only bossfight that i enjoy truly was the first boss ""the Hammer Guy"".Final Verdict : 9/10			"

												This is a wonderful game, good looker as well.  The game gains even more depth if your into lore, the story is told through different outlets such as: main story, artifacts, events that happen between you and Sauron's army, even through load screens! One complaint I have is with the ""clown car"" effect when you get a fortress alerted. I litterally spent an hour just hacking up orcs...no thats not stretching it, it was litterally that long with constant respawn *high alert fortress* I eventually took off and let it cool off, but to me that was the most silly part. Combat is fluid and smooth, but once you get the hang of it, it really is autopilot, you might still die..but that will be some jank on your part ;) Overall this is a great game, and very much woth the asking price. Pick this up, and enjoy some middle earth, and ""Arkham"" style combat.			"

												I don't know much about The Lord of the Rings but my experience with this game has been spectacular, what with the combat, the story and the open-world that allows you to go around and murder warchiefs and captains for power and runes. The graphics are beautiful too. Shame I only have a GTX 650. Also, if you're looking for a game to blow off some steam when you've had a bad day, I highly recommend this one. This game also allows you to do hilarious things like grab a Uruk and throw him off the ledge, throw a Uruk into a fire and give them bellyaches by poisoning their drinks. :D			"

												The Lord of the Rings game I've been dying for, for so long.The gameplay is epic, with like most people already suggesting, the nemesis system is a stroke of genius!The story is good, if short, but with a terrible ending. They have really done well researching a gap in Tolkiens lore and filling it in their own way which was incredible. The ending sucked! QTE to finish?! Poor! But i believe the real ending they made has been taken out as DLC (Celebrimbor vs Sauron?! sounds like it to me) In general it should have been a far more developed story as well. They really did have a good thing going but havent capitalised on the foundation they have put down.Its not perfect and it lacks in depth but as a first attempt its brilliant! They have layed a good building base to build up from. With the gameplay down to a tee they can now really bring us a game of epic scale should another be made. My rating will be a tad biased as I have been desperate for a decent Lord of the Rings game now for far too long!!!! But I definitely give it a solid 8.5, 9 of 10.Roll on number 2 where I hope they can improve upon it!Edit:So with all things considered my angle on this game has changed a bit. (It took watching the battle of the 5 armies to make me realise) As much as I do love this game, and I do. Its just not my vision for Middle Earth. Once again you take on the role of a man out of all the bloody brilliant races! The batman style of combat in my opinion is not suited for Middle Earth.... Its ok for batman simply because its a regular occurance that he would be fighting 5-10 opponents and beating them down, but Middle Earth is all about scale! Its about armies clashing, orcs by the thousand teaming over you like a wave of bloodshed! This game is just Batman Middle Earth.... You are constantly in control you constantly have the upper had and your more powerful than any of your enemies no matter the size. And it bores me! And the worst part is really your on your own. Tolkiens main message is about fellowship and overcoming an evil that is greater than you are. By these respects it misses its mark. Its still the best Middle Earth game in a very very very long while and the best we will probably see for just as long. But its just missing emotion. And that is what a Middle Earth game has to have to truely capture what I want to see.And YES I most certainly have high standards for the best lore I know and ever will knowIn terms of changes to how I feel about the game the I have in front of me... Well there is almost no replay factor. Side quests suck, collectables pointless, you become super man with all the power-ups you purchase and you just end up with a game of press 2 buttons together to watch the same old animation of Talon chopping an orcs head off totally destroying the stealth aspest. Warbosses become boring as they often have insta kill weaknesses such as stealth kill or headshot to the face. Either that or they are almost impossible to kill because they have a shield but you cant volt them as they block that and you cant use finishing moves on them and so you have a stale mate of wack, stun, wack, stun until eventually they die. It just does not have the depth or breadth to keep you entertained past the first play through. So far DLC has been more of the same old same old kill warchief stuff so nothing to note on that either. Still..... More than worth your money even for the one play through!			"

												I purchased this game as a fan of the story, and as a means to evaluate my new high-end PC. Both of these expectations were met with solid satisfaction. The combat and Nemesis systems are revolutionary; that said, the game is surprisingly short - even when aiming for 100% completion. Right away, the combat makes you feel like a badass. Later on, as you gain upgrades/abilities, this feeling is amplified until you become quite unstoppable - even when surrounded by HOARDS of orcs. Even the toughest enemies become painless to overcome. The story was pleasing to follow, especially if you're familiar with LOTR; perhaps even if you're not. Albeit strange at certain parts, I found myself wondering and delighted to uncover the ""secrets"" involved with this lore.In the final battle(s), you are of course pitted against what you expect to be the most formidable opponents; only to be slightly disapointed by the lack of difficulty. I felt like I really took my time with this game, exploring the landscape, creating conflicts, welcoming massive battles, and earning 100% completion. In all, I believe I put about 30 hours in to do so. If I were to for some reason start over, (this game offers no desire for replayability) I could probably go from 0-100% in half the time. I have not purchased any DLC yet as they all appear to be lacking.In closing, let me say that this game offered me one of the greatest experiences I've ever had gaming in the shortest amount of time. I am hopeful for a sequel, or at least some decent form of continuation. Overall: 9/10			"

												It feels like you're playing an Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series merge, as almost everybody have said, but with a plot set in Tolkien's Middle Earth. This is the perfect combination. This game is amazing, but I feel it lacks gameplay time. I just ended the main quest in about 12h and this really disappointed me. Anyway, I'll probably continue playing until I get 100% playthrough, mostly because I loved every other aspect about this game.

												Shadow of Mordor is one of the best RPG's I have ever played. What would be a repetitive combat style is kept fresh and exciting by all of the new mechanics that get introduced throughout the game. The open world is fun to explore and full of just enough danger to keep you in check. The nemesis system is an extremely interesting new mechanic that is used extraordinarily well in this game. Shadow of Mordor, however, does have one major flaw [listed in spoiler text] that prevents me from alloting it a 10/10 score. That flaw is the final boss battle. It is literally a 10 second long quick time event and is extremely dissapointing given the drama, intensity, and tension that comes before it. An enormously bland ending to an otherwise masterpiece of a game.  Score: 9/10 would very much recommend to anyone who is a fan of the RPG genre.			"

												The story is mediocore and character development is way too sparse for me to care about its protagonists.  The nemesis system is interesting, but since there is a steady stream of new orc captains and no noticeable effect in the game world, it feels a little short of what it could truly be.  However, the combat system feels great and is fun to use and I find myself coming back to smash more orc faces.  Combat is the right mix of challenging and fun in the beginning, but becomes a little too easy later in the game when your character is becomes way too overpowered.  Even then, the unending swarm of enemies in a stronghold keeps the combat interesting.			"

The Nemesis system is the coolest thing I've seen in a game lately, and for once I DIED in a game, loooooooots because alot of orcs are difficult to fight early game. This game is well worth the purchase, and there will very hopefully be sequels from what the ending has shown!Monolith, you did done good, you really did.			"

												This game, along with Dark Souls 2, is in the running for my Game of the Year. The combat is basically the same as the Arkham games, although I felt that at first it wasn't as flowy but over time it became just as flowy as the Arkham series. The story itself is pretty good. The plot is well done and the cutscenes are gorgeous, and the amount of outside lore put into the game by Monolith is outstanding, and it enriches the world deeply. The nemesis system is the elephant in the room. It's definitely the most innovative system I've played through in a long time. I remember my nemesis Mugluk Graug Slayer would simply refuse to die. I must have ""killed"" (if you don't behead said Uruk, there's a chance that he can come back) him at least 5 or 6 times and he kept coming back with a vengeance. I also had a hilarious experience with an Uruk by the name of Gunza the Rhymer. I beat him every time he fought me, and every time he came back he look more and more messed up in his face. In our final encounter, he retreated, only to be promptly eaten by a caragor (the Middle-Earth equivalent of a lion). Encounters like this make the game super fun and super addicting. I give this game a 10/10. It fulfilled all of my expectations and has given me a great time. I look forward to scouring Mordor all over again!			"

												This game so far has ticked all the boxes.Combat - As many have said, its like batman/AC. After unlocking techniques combat becomes very interesting.You have your average slice and dice finishers, to branding (mind control) in the middle of a fight and even brutalizing orcs to make others run away in fear.Story - I won't say I know all the lore to say it doesn't trample on some things, but I'd say its a decent story. It had some nice surprises too.SUFFER ME NOW - Dominating the minds of orcs will never get boring. Ever. Especially after its one that messed up a previous mission for you or flat out killed you.Death/Captains - If you die to a Captain (or Warchief) they will mock you the next time they come across you. So not dying has become a matter of ""not being insulted"". I also noticed a Captain make fun of me for having low HP in a fight, so that was cool too I guess.I could say so much more, but then I'd end up rambling. All in all, you won't be dissapointed in this game.			"

												8.5/10It's a great game, well polished and the game mechanics are an awesome change of pace that gives the AI the life that most games never see. I feel like this IP has a lot of potential, a lot like playing the first Assassin's Creed. It just felt like there wasn't quite enough variety or secrets to the game. Everything was pretty cut and dry as far as story goes, though it was done perfectly. The voice acting and the dialogue was very well done.Perhaps it was the setting that they had to work with or perhaps it was that they spent a lot on the system and didn't have time to give it the extra umph it needed. Most firsts don't quite fill out and the same applies here. It's just missing a bit of mystery, a bit of story, and could use a bit more variety and challenge. I've played AC and games like it enough that the combat was easy to master. It didn't matter what was going on I became invincible about 3 hours in after I got used to the hints in combat.TLDR: 8.5/10 I would definately recomend this game. I think the franchise has a lot of potential to become something great if you just look at the gameplay and mechanics. I'm not sure how much they should continue the story though (won't work the further you go with it) The mechanics and AI can go into every game ever though. Please developers learn to envolope things like this into your AI.			"

												After paying basically no attention to this game pre-release I didn't have high expectations. Being a fan of AC and Batman AK a game that sorta combined the two while adding its own flavor seemed like something interesting. After watching some youtube gameplay videos I was hooked. Bought the game and so far I'm about 10 hours in and absolutely love it.The combat is fantastic and the ability to use your powers,sword,dagger,bow seamlessly is great. Movement is much like Assassisn Creed but a little rougher at some points.Using direction keys instead of where you look and pushing forward takes some getting used to but once you get over that its simple and smooth. THere is a pretty big lag of direction in the game and alot of the ins and outs you will need to learn on your own by playing. I highly suggest doing a search for ""Shadows of Mordor"" newbie tips to try and familarise yourself so you dont get smashed.Oh, and the nemesis system is pretty cool. I got mobbed by like 100 orcs and went down in a glorious fashion. Some random NPC orc got the killing blow on me and turned into a name nemesis with his own skills/rank etc just for killing me in-game. Pretty cool stuff.			"

												A better assassin game than Assassin's Creed, which a great implementaion of Arkham-esque combat. The Nemesis system is where it really shines, which allows Orc Captains to be manipulated or hunted down. In the event of them killing you or certain actions being acheived (escaped, burned but survived), they will remember you and in some cases the character model will be updated to reflect this. Graphics-wise, I can run it constantly above 60, textures can be a bit lackluster but it has some superb lighting and weather effects. Finally all of the voice acting is superb, with the original actor for Gollum being used to give it a real authentic feel. I give this 9 crazy elf wraiths out of 10.			"

												Simply put this is a great game. I have played 17 hrs and only 37% complete so there is lots of content for a single player game. The combat is a lot of fun especially when you start getting the upgrades. Nothing beats exploding an Orc's head and watching the others run. Well most anyway, some don't get scared of that stuff. The death threat system is tons of fun and gives you lots to do if you want to break away from the main mission. I think I played the first two hours and didn't even start a mission, there are tons of Orcs around to have fun with.The combat system makes the game more than just hack and slash. The stealth element gives you other avenues to explore and you will learn when use it and when to run in like a mad man.. You will most certainly die which will stir the pot among the Orcs and change the game. Kill one and change the game again. The gamaeplay is smooth for me on a GTX 770 and Intel i7, all settings high. I have encountered no noticable bugs and had no problems changing settings in the menus to get things how I want them.The game is a good mix of elements that keeps things interesting and fun. There is enough content to feel like you got your moneys worth and more. Two thumbs up. "

												I cant say that i have had this much fun playing a game in years. You can bust♥♥♥♥♥speed through the main story line. But really you will have missed everything that is amazing about this game. there are hundreds of fun things to run around and pick up and see. Unlike other games the ""collectables"" here all tell a storry and have involved voice acting and really add something to what you are playing through. I've been looking for somethign that I didn't like about the game and really, the times i wanted to rage quit weren't from the game problems it was the fact that some  freaking orc killed me for the 8th time in a row. In those moments its SO nice to have the sandbox play style where you can just go do somethign else for a while. all in all i have put 25 hrs into this game so far can am at the last main quest line... and im NOT finishing it by choice. im running around doing evertyhing else in the game because its just THAT fun. i cant wait to see what dcl they come out with.

												Free-flowing combat and an open world game, fans of Assassin's Creed and Batman games will enjoy this.The heirarchy system or orc captains and warchiefs made for a good few hours of assassinations and battles that seemed overwhelming at times.Difficulty seemed to decrease as the game progressed, as unlocking more powerful skills (in particular the brand) turned the tide in my favour. I suppose it'd be dissapointing if the MC didn't improve at all, but I believe a lot of the fun lay in plotting how to approach a situation and attacking at the weaknesses of the enemies. Near the end of the game I felt near-invincible and could charge in without much thought.Deffo worh a look if you like the genre, you may feel that you've seen the combat system before, but it's fluid and viceral, making it extremely satisfying to behead that pesky Uruk who had ambushed you. LOTR knowledge not really needed, I wasn't a buff on the books/movies myself but still enjoyed the story.			"

												After playing it for about 8 hours, I've come to really enjoy this game. It's tuns of fun. And I mean TUNS OF FUN! I still haven't really progressed in the story because I keep wanting to complete every side-quest/collectible there is. The combat is very fluid (think of the Batman Arkham series but now you actually stop your attacks to block enemies) and the challenges are well-made. My only complaints are aimed at a few clunky things when it comes to special enemies:1. Some Orc Captains seem to keep ""evading death"" in my game, a good example of this was this one time where I snapped a Captain's neck using stealth, his name popped up with the red X over it. But when I hit ""Enter"" to see the battle report, I noticed it said he'd gained power and after leaving the ""Army"" menu, I was brutaly mauled by the now-undead captain who then got a promotion for killing me...2. My other issue comes from shield bearers. I'm at the point where if I have to kill anyone with my arrows or by sneaking, it's them. They're just to werid to fight against. I get ""L-Shift"" prompts above there heads before they attack but hitting it doesn't do anything. This makes them incredibly annoying to fight against as they drop me to nearly a third of my health when they hit.Other than that, the port is great! The graphics are excellent and very well-detailed, I get a stable 80-90 FPS with my 7970. The climbing/parcour aspect of the game works and isn't too weird (the wraith enhanced you with magic but you're not overpowered). On a side note: I would've liked to get to know Talion's family a bit more before they're killed. As it stands, the game starts with a 15-20 minute cutscene/tutorial on the basics of how to play and they use flashbacks for you to see moments you spent with your family but, honestly, I didn't really care when they died because I didn't get to know them. I would've prefered a more ""assassin's creed 2"" type of deal where we spent about an hour or two with the main character's family before they get killed.Other than those few issues, the game plays really well and is really enjoyable so far. I recommend it to anyone even if they're not a fan of the Lord Of The Rings or Hobbit movies/books.			"

												Most squabble when it comes to its playstyle being similar to Batman: Arkham City, but I have to disagree.   While there are mission points and the like that are a call to that type of open-end game, Shadow of Mordor seems to keep it alive.   I've not progressed very far just yet, but I have to say that taking revenge on a captain that has killed you, is damnably fun.  I think I've only completed four missions thus far and had the misfortune of encountering a higher ranking captain.  A heavy strike from which was enough to send me to half-health.   It's ridiculously fun for me and I encourage others to try it out.  It also has a fun set of lore to find as well.			"

												Definitely different.. and in a good way I think. I enjoy playing, I have become quite talented at taking on mass amounts of orcs. Game stutters on occasion, but usually only a second or two at most to resolve itself. Might be because the vram on my card is pretty much maxed out. Game says it requires 1gb vram for low texture quality, 2gb for medium, 3gb for high, and 6gb for ultra. I have a gtx 690, which is only a 2gb card. But I have two 2 gb gpu's on one pcb so i figured why not bump the texture setting to high and see what happens.. Game runs great and most times stays at 60fps or above (except when it stutters on occasion.)Great game, I enjoy it so far. Ubi take notes.And here are my specs just incase any of you want to know because of my stutters occasionally..-intel core i7 3930k @ 3.2GHZ stock clock -NVIDIA GTX 690 -32GB DDR3 RAM @ 1600mhz-3TB HDD @ 7200rpmAnd the game is being run @ 1920x1080 EVERYTHING EXCEPT texture quality is on ULTRA.

												A lot of people did comment on the very nice Nemesis system. The combat, movement and open world style are taken from games such as Assassin's Creed and Arkham franchises, and those are also fun. Overall a fun game, I´d recommend it.The only problem I found are the boss battles. Very, very underwhelming. No epic feel, easy, offer just about no closure. Not going into spoilers, but I was reeealy disappointed with the ending, one of the crappiest fights ever for a final boss, and left me bitter about a good game. And i was expecting more army battles stuff sort of like the Lord of the Rings movies.			"

The game plays extremely well and it's easy to get lost in hours of slaughter. The enemy ranking system was a unique experience that kept the game from feeling repetitive. It also may leave you wanting revenge over and over again. All in all this game is a must in my book.			"

He gained a personality, traits and weaknesses,  I decided to get my revenge and hunt himn down.We meet. Grogbur the Flame MongerLong story short, I end up putting a dozen arrows through his face.

Now Im going to crush your skull with my hands!""Needless to say, me being an impeccable badass, I kill him again!VICTORY!Or so i thought. Another hour of orc killing i meet another Orc Captain.Grogbur the Flame MongerWHAT! By now he has changed completely, he has scars all over his face, new traits  (Invunrable to ranged attacks, THEY LEARN!)We fight..HE WINS!HE GETS MORE POWERFUL!I NEED REVENGE!.... He kills me again.....He gets stronger, now a top level Elite Captain.This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of an orc starts hunting me down, Throwing his spears ( which are now ON FIRE!)He kills me again.This is it.He needs to die.A lengthy battle ensues, sweat blood and tears are spilt.VICTORY!for now, I've not seen him since.

												So far I am really enjoying this game, I have wanted Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor for a while now and managed to pick it up on sale for £10.99. I would have paid much more toward the £30 mark and still felt I had got my money’s worth.It’s surprisingly fun repeatedly killing uruk’s, I thought this would be something I would get tired of fast however the variety in characters, combat style and story has kept me coming back for more.If you have been a little disappointed with the LOTR games over the past few years this is truly a redeemer for the franchise.

												One uruk killed me right at the start of the game and continued to kill me 3 times after, so I decided to track him down and kill him. Found him in the plains of Mordor and drained him because I needed some elf shot and it would kill him for good (or so I thought). So I play through a few more story missions and I come across him again, this time he's amassed a band of uruks and his face was so badly burnt. So after an epic battle I killed him once more but as per usual he kept coming back with his scarring getting worse and worse until it got to the point where he had to wrap a cloth around his head to hide the scarring, then on the 6th time he came back to life I chopped off his head and he was finally gone. For the rest of the game I played thinking that my old nemesis was dead and gone until it got to one of the final missions. That same stubborn uruk showed up again as one of the final bosses.This game is superb, the nemesis system is one of the best gameplay features that I have seen in a long time and will give you some pretty memorable moments. All the orcs have so many different personalities and traits that it never gets old watching uruk captain's rise, fall and betray each other in the ranks of Sauron's army. Even regular goons may get promoted to captains if they kill you in a fight which adds to the replayability of the game.Overall this game has been one of the best of 2014 by far despite it's somewhat weak and difficult to follow storyline, it's always fun to play and I would reccomend it to anyone.9.5/10			"

												I wasn't expecting the game to be so entertaining. It's not that the story is the best thing ever; it's good, but not great. The gameplay is great, with the tools Talion slowly amasses feeling like toys that you're free to play with. The real gem is the Nemesis system, which lives up to the hype. All of the orcs have individual patterns of behavior, but they are also affected by their environment and fellow orcs. For example, executing a captain causes the orcs to scatter in terror, while causing a retreat actually engenders an ordered withdrawl with forces moving in an organized manner. Messing with the orcs is possible and fun. My favorite trick is Shadow Stepping into a captain with Vulnerability to Ranged and executing him on the spot just to watch his little orclings panic.			"

												This is Inglourious Basterds the video game, with a few small changes such as you are no longer in Germany you are in Mordor, and you won't be killing Nazis, you will be killing Orcs.Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an amazing game which I can't recommend enough, while the story is fairly simple the main focus of the game is killing Orcs in violently brutal but graceful ways, like a Ballet dancer with chainsaws attached to his/her arms.You play Lt. Aldo Talion, who goes through some emotional scarring early on which basicly fuels the fire for the Orc killing machine.  You become the terror of Mordor, stealthing or rampaging through Orc camps with devastating efficiency.It's also worth mentioning the Nemesis system, it's an incredible system which can make an Orc remember your encounter should he kill you or flee from a past battle.  Everytime an Orc kills you, he will remember and you can be sure he'll be a smug git about it, and in doing so you gain a little rivalry which is extremely satisfying when you take take sweet revenge.If you enjoy Assassin's Creed or the Batman Arkham games and really just want to kill things, then Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is for you.(If you would like to see gameplay, I have a  video series on this game which you can check out on my  YouTube channel.

												A great game by Monolith. A combination of Batman's Arkham combat system and Assassin's Creed stealth. But if just by that, it's a mediocre game. What makes it interesting is the Nemesis System. A system where the enemy can become stronger in time or by killing you. I can't say much about anything else but I do really enjoy this game very much. Do give it a try.			"

												A great game with a unique concept to the FPS hack and slash genre. The fight sequences a fluid and reminds me a little of the Batman combat engine.The game has an indepth story line which lets you step into the shoes of Middle Earth ranger who comes back from the dead and finds himself also being bewitched by a ghost. The most unique thing about this game is creating and amassing an orc army at your disposal during fight sequences - this comes later in the game and is well worth the wait to get there.The leveling systems are two-fold. Character and weaponry or which you can also upgrade your weaponry from drop runes which you insert into the weapon allowing you certain benefits. Highly recommend this game to everyone... 10/10			"

												What can I say? Finally we have a modern video game holding Lord Of The Rings IP, which is worth playing! This game is a must own for pretty much any gamer out there.I love the gameplay, It feels smooth and you really get into the character, regardless of the pretty all-out start of the story cinematic in the beginning. Combat is very similiar with AC and Batman franchise, so most of you will get in fast with the game. Combat is great, it's fun, it looks great and I love the variation in moves our character Talion holds. Also there are few approaches to combat and you can go for your own combat style and improve Talion alongside your style. It's great.Nemesis system is absolute killer and makes the true fun for the game. I love watching how Orc captains and warchiefs rise in ranks, fight each other. I love the fact that I can become a kingmaker and intervene a duel between captains, make one of them run away and spare his life, while I slay the other.Side missions are fun and I think the medium length is well-thought per mission.Exploring is fun, but I think there could be slight improvement in this regard, but this is just nit-picking.Final verdict: no severe bugs, lot things to do, nice features and all settings customisable to your liking. Must own game, buy it now when it is very cheap for the next 24hours!			"

												One of the major reasons why I bought this game was the nemesis system; and it surely didn't let me down. I had some truly epic fights throughout the journey, that no other game can simply offer. The fact that any orc wandering in the world could be promoted to captain, is thrilling.The world is very immersive and full of exploring. For completionists there are many collectables to find and for people who just like to roam around without destination, this game has you covered. Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor offers something to everyone and I would highly recommend it. "

												Okay, so this 1 Uruk Captain, Ûgash the Hunter killed me like 15 times, getting his power up to 20 or something. The reason for this was that he had only 1 weakness: he can be damaged(not vulnerable) by ranged. The problem was that the sucker had such good traits (Ambush, sneaky, group of followers and he was ranged) that it was almost impossible to kill him. Now I am at about 60% in the story and tried my luck at him yesterday.There he was, in a Stronghold with alot of Uruks, waiting to be killed, so I went into my bow mode, did 7 headshots and used my teleport kill ability to finish him off. Satisfied looking at all the Uruks running away, getting an awesome rune that gave me 50% extra sword damage, I noticed something was not right...Out of nowhere, 2 Elite Captains ambushed me and obliterated me!Well, 1 nemisis killed and 2 ♥♥♥♥ers took his place...Awesome game, 11/10			"

												I have racked up 40 Hrs on the game and completed every single achievement. The only thing that I can say is that is is jaw-dropping. My PC is not the best when it comes to running games, but I can run this with all setttings at high, so compatibility is no issue. I can only say one thing: I WANT MORE!The good:This game is amazing graphically. The story blows your mind. I mean, like, wow. Also it has Gollum, which in itself earns merit. The game is immersive and pays homage to Tolkein's wonderful world. The executions are brutal and they never get old. Although people say the map is small, and I suppose it is compared to other open-world games, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I never found the map's size to be an issue for me. It is very much the perfect size for a game of this calibre. And the beasts... Whether it be riding into battle with a Caragour and hearing the enemies cower in fear, or watching them get eaten by Graugs, those beasts are deadly. They are just as formidable friendly as they are foe. Never gets old. The cherry on top for this game which really sold me was the Nemesis system. It is the first time I have played a game where you can get revenge on the exact piece of sh*t AI who killed you. No death is from a generic Uruk. if you are killed, you will be able to brand that son of a b*tch for death and hunt him down. There is something deeply satisfying when you revenge-kill an Uruk who killed you previously. It totally sold me. I fell in love with this game with just the Nemesis system. It deepens the game a great deal. This game should have been GOTY. When I saw the trailer I was seriously excited and hoped to hell that this would not disappoint. It surpassed my axpectations.The bad:I hate having to fill in this section because this is by far one of my favourite games. There are a few things wrong, however much i wish it were not so. First off, there is no New Game Plus mode. this is kinda disappointing because I really wanted to play this game again with all my OP abilities. The story is very short if you do not do side missions (of which there are loads!!!) so to maximise fun it is recommended that you do, otherwise the game would probably be over in 10 hrs or so. The Season Pass is a disappointment for me. If you don't intend to buy and DLC, ignore this. I got the Premium Edition for a steal of a deal of £24.24 on sale. MY VERDICT: get this game. Regardless of the price, I would have gladly paid full price for this having known what I know now. It is worth every penny. BUT: Do not get the Season Pass unless it is on sale. This is the most disappointing part of the game. So far, the Season Pass has yielded very little to offer. The most noteworthy is the Lord Of The Hunt DLC, but the Warband Missions get kind of tiring, despite adding a competetive edge to the game. I hope that the upcoming Bright Lord DLC will be just as good, if not better. If you still wish for DLC, I suggest that you buy Lord Of the Hunt (and maybe The Bright Lord too?) DLC separately and save yourself the money, but GET IT. It will not disappoint.			"

												I wasn't expecting the game to be so entertaining. It's not that the story is the best thing ever; it's good, but not great. The gameplay is great, with the tools Talion slowly amasses feeling like toys that you're free to play with. The real gem is the Nemesis system, which lives up to the hype. All of the orcs have individual patterns of behavior, but they are also affected by their environment and fellow orcs. For example, executing a captain causes the orcs to scatter in terror, while causing a retreat actually engenders an ordered withdrawl with forces moving in an organized manner. Messing with the orcs is possible and fun. My favorite trick is Shadow Stepping into a captain with Vulnerability to Ranged and executing him on the spot just to watch his little orclings panic.			"

												Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is one of the few games now a days that is worth every penny spent. The combat; fluid. The story telling; dymanic. But above all, it brings forth a sense of duty, and also a sense of anger. The game ocassionally makes you question if you are any different from the Uruks themselves, filled with anger, hate, and above all, striving for power. The game is very well done and is very playable even without a controller. Even not strong Lord of the Rings fans will find comfort in the fluid game dynamics, combat, and countless hours of things to do. You can spend the first 5 hours with out even completing the 1st mission. Make this an item on your next purchase list.			"

												I've only scratched the oozing, bubbling surface of this open world game and I forsee many hours being spent skulking through the ashlands of Mordor.  The combat is intuitive and fun, if not a little easy at times, and the climbing and running about the world are accomplished easily.  Your enemies have a lot of personality and someone took great care in developing each one into its own persona. The rune and stats upgrade screens are a little too small and unwieldy, as are a lot of the menu screens, which may be a result of the console port.It's almost like a nice meaty sandwich with high quality meats and cheese - stuffed between two pieces of generic bread.  The story cutscenes are beautiful, but you don't really have the connection with the characters and the plot just doesn't seem to stick.Outside of this, I see a future where much black Orc blood will be shed!

												Sauron's Mini-Bosses (review as originally posted on www.thesofaiswaiting.com)The news ticker for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor reads 'Assassin's Creed meets Tolkien' and while I wouldn't suggest that this analogy is necessarily a bad thing, I feel that it does sell the game short. Assasin's Creed may be lean on innovation, but each successive entry proves that the base formula of parkour, stealthy kills, and well-timed parries is still a blast. Shadow of Mordor admirably builds on this through a robust nemesis system that has a few flaws but is ultimately a ton of fun.The Short+engaging nemesis system+highly polished+outstanding animations-throwaway story-familiar gameplay8.5/10The LongThe similarities between Shadow of Mordor and Assassin's Creed are numerous. Each takes place in an open world with collectibles and quests strewn about, combat pits a lone hero against a horde of baddies, and both heavily feature parkour. The AC formula is well-worn at this point and if you absolutely detest it than chances are Shadow of Mordor will leave you disappointed. The story holding the open world together is replete with loose ends, one-dimensional characters, and an abrupt ending that keeps the door open for the inevitable DLC packs. That said, fans of the Lord of the Rings mythos may find more to enjoy here as the background on the forging of the one ring is elaborated and the mortal-wraith hybrid of Talion/Calembrimbor is an intriguing concept even if its full potential goes unrealized. Fortunately, the story missions can be worked through quickly and can be considered a glorified tutorial for the centrepiece nemesis system.As the player slices their way through the faceless horde, occasionally one of the nameless will step out and challenge the player. At first, the system is nothing more than a tool to signal out particular orcs as stronger than others. As the story progresses, a ranking system emerges consisting of captains and warlords who can be pitted against each other and turned to do the players whim. Each named orc is granted a set of procedurally generated strengths and weaknesses and levels up depending on the state of the game world. These unique enemies, while predictable, are not static and will engage in their own side-quests and rivalries while the player goes about their own mission and over time can become quite formidable. Encountering a captain in the wild will lead to a short vignette where they will quip about your recent deeds and highlight the epic combat about to unfold. Captains are neat but are just the appetizer of the nemesis system. At any time, the player can invade one of the numerous orc strongholds and wreck havoc in an attempt to lure out a warlord. While significantly stronger than a regular captain, defeating a warlord can open the way for a dominated orc in the player's pocket to fill the power vacuum and grant control over a portion of Sauron's army. The system is nuanced and the sense of satisfaction that comes with deftly manipulating the lower ranks to ultimately enact a coup never gets old.As one might expect with such a complex structure, the nemesis system isn't without its flaws. The sheer number of hostile captains can be a frustration early in the game where accidentally wading into them can spell disaster for a quest. It's not uncommon to end up squaring off against two or more captains at once which usually means meeting a grisly death. Further, some combinations of strengths and weaknesses can be particularly difficult to overcome and require reliance on cheesy tactics. I was especially irked by how many unique orcs I encountered that were utterly immune to ranged damage. This wouldn't normally be such a problem but arrows are one of the few ways to slow a fleeing enemy down and it's frustrating to see your quarry get away after carving a path to them. Finally, the logic that an orc levels up if he manages to kill the player is sound, but could potentially lead to a virtually unassailable enemy after repeated failures. None of these issues are game-breaking however. Running from a fight is a reasonable course of action when faced by overwhelming numbers, every orc will always have at least one way to kill them, and even the strongest baddies can be overcome with a bit of skill and proper planning. On whole, the flaws are more minor nuisances than anything and don't significantly detract from an overall fantastic system.Aside from the nemesis system, much of what's on offer as been seen and done before. Combat is an ebb and flow of stealth and melee. Picking off archers leads to vicious dagger strikes from the shadows and eventually to full blown open dueling. Get in over your head and retreating to cover for a period will send patrols back to their routes and the whole process can start again. It's fluid and engaging but doesn't break the mould. Progression takes the form of unlocking rudimentary improvements like extra health and arrows - calling it RPG-lite would be generous. Captains and warlords can drop equipable runes that instill combat bonuses but, again, none of these really shake things up beyond providing extra resource regeneration or bonus damage. Finally, as alluded to earlier, the endgame is predominantly a treasure hunt for various goodies across the map with little incentive to find them other than to scratch the completionist itch. While this might come off as overly negative, bear in mind that it's all extremely well polished. The world is deftly crafted providing plenty of avenues of approach and a lots of eye candy along the way. If treasure hunting is your thing, you would be hard pressed to find a better way to do it.Graphically, the PC version has a sizable optional texture pack that requires a top of the line video card to use with any reliability. The jump between high and ultra quality is noticeable when objects are viewed up close but the hit in performance isn't worth it for those who aren't running a beast of a machine. In general, the textures look great but are overshadowed by the superb animations. Whether bouncing between multiple enemies or jumping across ledges, it all feels natural and avoids the usual feeling of canned sequences playing into each other. Special note needs to be made for the brutal kill moves that simply need to be seen in motion to appreciate fully. Sound design meets a high standard with sword swishing and arrow loosing meshing well with the orc battle cries. Music is sparse and generally sticks to the background. While I understand licensing issues, I couldn't help but feel that implementing some of the score from the Peter Jackson films could have kicked the action up another notch. All told, the game exhibits the sheen expected from a big budget AAA title with no major bugs and few hiccups. It's been said that the mark of a great licensed product is that it would work without the license. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor doesn't need the Lord of the Rings to sell the engrossing nemesis system and the majority of the core mechanics have already proved successful in other franchises. Indeed, it stands on its own as a quality title that smartly builds on the gameplay pioneered by Assasin's Creed and the Arkham series. The few flaws it does exhibit are easily forgiven in light of the high level of polish and immense fun-factor.			"

												Ever wanted to deal with Mordor singlehandedly?  Then this game is for you.  The Nemesis system makes this game absolutely amazing, giving it a personal touch that a lot of games lack.  And Monolith does the smart thing of keeping everything else solid so as not to take away from the interesting procedurally generated Nemesis fights with the Orcs.			"
