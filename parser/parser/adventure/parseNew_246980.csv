This is a rather long review, so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Impromptu Games creates a fantastic puzzle mystery which keeps the gears in your brain continually grinding. InFlux offers a serene ambience with melodic music that produces a peaceful environment that is calming.Campaign:Influx is the story of a small ball and its adventure to complete mazes, explore an island, and collect orbs. You must collect orbs in each area in order to unlock the maze that allows you to progress to the next section. The island continually grows as you progress through this amazing campaign and the emptiness keeps you wondering at every turn. I completed the game in about 3-hours, which means it’s not a very long game. You could spend more time exploring the landscape although because of the poor mechanics of the protagonist exploration can seem rather annoying at times. Ambience:The rhythmic music and simplicity of Influx creates at times a very peaceful experience. The game offers a very vivid environment without any traces of even the simplest story. Without a story to follow Influx produces something most games lack, answers. I found myself continually wondering why there were empty houses on the Island, how the modern maze structures formed, why I was even solving the puzzles, and the list goes on and on.Gameplay:The protagonist, a small ball, is able to roll and boost in order to accomplish tasks. There is no point where this character can jump, but by using boosts correctly you can launch yourself into various places. An interesting feature behind controlling the character is that you can boost while in mid air allowing you to change direction. Boosting also slows down time which allows you to gain a view of your environment while deciding how to act in a fast paced situation. Although there are time where controlling the character can be tricky the overall experience is relatively easy. Results: If you like puzzles, modern graphics, beautiful scenery, and melodious music then this would be the game for you. Despite there being more cons than pros I would recommend this game, but only if you can find it on sale for at least 75% off. InFlux is a short, but very riveting puzzle game. If you are a fan of puzzle games then this is the game for you.Pros:+Interesting puzzles and mazes+Beautiful serene scenery+Smooth loading transitions+Peaceful and elegant musicCons:-Poor controls (can be annoying to control the protagonist)-Lack of explanation-Listed control to boost, but doesn't unlock till half way through the game-Attract ability can be infuriating as it forms an orbit rather than just pulling an object to you. -Too short of a campaign			"

												InFlux is a rather unique (from my experience) ambient exploration/puzzle game.  You play as a ball exploring an island and completing puzzles to unlock new paths to continue on your journey.  It seemed like a perfect fit for me and it is somewhat, but I can't help but feel like the game is a bit of a missed opportunity.The island is a visually great place.  While the game doesn't have cutting edge AAA graphics, and it shows, the visual design is very pleasing.  The ball itself looks surprisingly good and the light generated from within adds a nice effect while you roll around.  The puzzles themselves take place in a sort of virtual world which have a nice clean design that is unfortunately marred by some of the most poorly done motion blur I have ever seen with no way that I have found to turn it off.Past the visuals, the rest of the game really isn't up to par.  Rolling around the island can be a chore at times with lots of sudden changes in the ground surface that will stop you or send you awkwardly up into the air.  The puzzles are for the most part quite simple and can be completed with ease, but the levitation fans and vents you come across often don't bring you as high as they're supposed to, and the game's own hint of aiming up in order to go higher when boosting simply doesn't work.The other main issue is performance.  While the game ran plenty fast for me, my framerate was amazingly low for the graphical quality and it makes me concerned about running this game on lower end hardware, even video cards that could manage newer AAA games just fine.  Coupled with this, the game doesn't seem to take advantage of the Unreal engine's dynamic data loading so the game stutters badly whenever it needs to load new data, often at strange places while you move around.  At one point the entire game froze for 2 seconds due to this.So while I'd like to recommend this game, I really can't.  With additional and more complex puzzles, a better controlling ball, and some work in the engine department it could be a really great game.  Where it is now, I'm just disappointed that it isn't more.			"

												The entire time I spent playing InFlux, I kept wondering to myself and trying to discern just what about it was causing me to dislike it so much. But ultimately it became clear that there was no one thing that was so abhorrent as to destroy the game, but a long list of mediocre mechanics, frustrating moments, and missed potential stacked upon each other to create a game that is not fun to play.And you really wouldn't notice this from the outside, so much is the subtlety of InFlux's deeply permeated problems. What appears to be an average, but solid physics based ball puzzle game is instead a amalgamation of poor design decisions and tedious level designs.The most easily called out of these issues is the sluggish and clunky controls of your ball. There is such an absurd amount of momentum attached to movement that it's nearly impossible to retain any control even when moving slowly. It's as if there's a second invisible player playing beside you which constantly wants to go in the opposite direction, and you are left to try and wrestle control back away from them as you try to move forward with anything resembling precision.This of course bleeds into the actual puzzle designs, which naturally require excessive amounts of control and constrained movements in order to complete, something which is nigh impossible given the previous paragraph. Compounded upon this is the astounding amount of tedium built into each and every puzzle, often placing you back at the beginning of long sequences for the slightest mistake, and making completion feel like a brief relief before you're put right back into an even more aggravating level. There's nothing clever or satisfying to find here, just an abundance of cheap failures and unrefined design.This finally ties all the way back around to the clash of styles presented with the presentation. The game is split into two parts: that of navigating a realistic, occasionally rather pretty world ripe with nature, and that or completing the actual puzzles in a sterile white box floating somewhere in the cosmos. The transitions are glaring and abrupt, and turn the parts of the environment that are actually interesting to look at into little more than glorified conduits to carry you from one stale puzzle to the next. This isn't to say the overworld (for lack of a better term) is actually a compelling place to explore, as it feels as barren and underdeveloped as anything in the game, but in comparison to the drab color pallet of the puzzles at least presents an occasional bit of eye candy to counteract the monotony of constantly being in the same room.There might have been some point where InFlux was coming along into something decent (I'd like to think so at least), but if so something went terribly wrong at some point and sent the entire game careening down the crapper. No matter how hard I tried to enjoy it, every single moment I spent with it was nothing but dull and frustrating, leaving me feeling like the game was just waiting for me to give up on it so it could roll over and die like the lifeless creation it is.

												So, this game really is loads of awesomeness. It has an incredibly calm atmosphere, lush graphics, ridiculously smooth gameplay, and aims to bring a new light to problem-solving and virtual puzzles. Its originality in terms of both puzzles and overall gameplay really gives off a great vibe, and in my opinion, it feels like the developers really knew what they wanted from this game. They executed this indie game extremely well and it really shows. I have not had the chance to play this game with a controller, but for a mouse and keyboard(which feels more natural to me than a controller), the controls are perfect. The developers really struck a beautiful balance in terms of how you control the gameplay, and subsequently, how the gameplay controls you. They left the complexity and problem-solving to the puzzles of the game and made the controls simplistic. Perfection.On the topic of the puzzles, they also match this game perfectly. As you can see from the teaser video clips, the puzzles take on this abstract form of obstacles within multi-dimensional cubes of glass and steel. Without spoiling anything(or too much anyways), at first glance you would figure this combination to clash with the original atmosphere of the game, but it's quite the opposite; the transfers are done so seamlessly that the player remains undisturbed, and continues to flow through the calm, dream-like gameplay that is InFlux. Most of the puzzles are simple, a couple of them frustrating, but not so frustrating that you want to turn the game off or bang your head against a wall. They always keep you coming back. At the end of the day, this is a fantastic game with an amazing atmosphere that keeps you coming back for more; and honestly, that is the kind of result you want from a problem-solving game of this caliber. If you are on the edge about whether to buy this game or not, just go ahead and buy it and thank me later. For its miniscule price, you get an experience easily worth ten times the amount(was on-sale for $2.99 when I wrote this review).			"

												Very relaxing, very enjoyable. The zen vibe is palpable. Aided by a cool soundtrack, chill atmosphere, and beautiful landscape even at lower settings.For some reason I had trouble installing it, but once I got it working it was totally worth it.It's largely free roaming exploration and it's quite easy to understand what to do due to it's simplicity.Due to how enraptured I was into the game, it was actually a little shorter than I anticipated. It could really benefit from an additional level or two under a different kind of landscape, like perhaps a snowy tundra, a space level, or a man made system of some kind.Still if you need to relax, but you also want to have fun while doing it, then I highly recommend this game.

												As a fan of marble games like Marble Blast Ultra, and Switchball, it's an interesting blend of the two. It's broken apart into six different hub worlds, each containing 3 puzzle areas. These hub worlds are wide open natural vistas, whereas the puzzle rooms look a lot like those Marble Blast Ultra. Most of the puzzles deal with world rotation, and getting other marbles to designated areas. The movement feels pretty different than Marble Blast Ultra, mostly in that you carry much more momentum, and you don't have a button to jump. They introduce a charge boost though, that accomplishes similar goals. It has a small story being told organically through the world, and it's just a really satisfying time. I'd highly recommend it to dudes that dug Marble Blast Ultra/Switchball/Spectraball.			"

												THis was a game unlike any other in my collection, something chill and relaxing that I could just throw on at the end of a long day and kind of fade away into.  The puzzle engages just enough grey matter to be enjoyable, but are spread out enough that just exploring the world and finding neat landscapes in between breaks up the experience into a joyful take-at-your-own-pace eerie wonder.  It's so rare to find a game which favours and rewards self-exploration for those of us who just like to meander through every nook and corner for idle amusement.			"

												Beautiful and mysterious, though more for lovers of tranquil exploration and spherical geometry than serious puzzle fantastic. Some puzzle areas are well put together, but inaccurate controls bring about a lot of frustration. On top of that one half of the game lacks challenge, while the other half lacks surprise. Add those together and you’ll get a game that never becomes more than the sum of its parts.There are some puzzles worth cracking, but as the scheme behind most challenges can hardly be made out at the get-go, most solutions are revealed by annoying trial&error.Overall 6/10.

												What baffles me is how developers who clearly had the time and resources to make such beautiful visuals and ambience managed to screw EVERYTHING ELSE up this horribly.Multiple times I had to replay portions because the game is, as much as I hate to say it, too open world. It's way too easy to get stuck somewhere you shouldn't be and have to restart. And surprise, the game saves itself very rarely and there's no way to manually save it. It's utterly ridiculous. Several of the settings options also seemed to flat out not work. The game has a lot of those little flaws where they're not big enough to cite for a review, but they pile up. A few examples: Before each puzzle you need to collect an unknown number of arbitrary glowing blue dots lying around the area. ...Why? What's the point of this? It's not like getting them is a challenge or something. They're just lying there. Another example, they give you the ability to gain up speed and ""boost"" forward, yet the collision is so accurate that the bumps in the ground will usually send you hurtling in some odd direction if you ever dare boost across the ground. Yet another ""hyper-specific"" example: There's a point in the game where you activate a thermal vent that serves as a natural cannon. It's right next to you, you get in it, go flying, aaaaaaand- slam into a stalactite. Upon further examination, when you activate the first vent it also activates a second vent slightly back from where you activate them. You have to enter that one. What? Why is the giant vent that EXPLODES right next to me not the correct path? Why do I have to go backwards? It's a pointless waste of time. And I could go on and on about little nitpicks like these.The puzzles themselves aren't awful but they tend to be very straight forward and bland. What's awful with them are the underlying mechanics. Citing Portal as the obvious comparison, in that game you pick up, easily move, and place cubes. Since they're square, they stay where you want them. But that would be too simple for this game. You have to use your magnetism powers to attract or repel spheres that just roll around everywhere. I can't for the life of me conceive a good reason for this awkward and frustrating control scheme. In the end, Influx is visually and thematically beautiful, but not enough so to excuse the incredibly poor gameplay and massive amount of bugs.			"

												Amazing environment and love the interactions with objects.  If you are a bang bang shooter up type you won't like it.  If you are of the MYST genre and like atmospheric environments, you will love it.That being said, there is a lot of inconsistency in the game saves and it's down right frustrating.  I don't understand why the developers made this feature so user unfriendly since the ability to save your progress is probably the most important feature of any game.Be warned that unless you just leave the game running on your computer, you won't be able to save any progress that you have made on your own.  Rather, it seems mostly random.  For a while it seemed like it was saving at each glass building once you entered.  But I found that NOT to always be true.  Occasionally after you have finished in the glass building and are dumped into the next environment, thinking that your progress has been saved, you exit, you find upon reentering you are back at the beginning of a glass house puzzle, and not necessarily the one you were last in.Also, if  when bouncing around and playing in an environment, you land ""inside"" a rock or piece of graphic, you often can't get out, even with the power surge.  And if you bounce into a section of the game you've already completed (because they sometime run side by side) you more than likely can't get out.  Murphy's law dictates that these are the times when the game chooses to save for you.So I would rate the in game exerience an A+ but the whole saving thing a big fat ""F"".Oh, there is a feature called go to last checkpoint.  But that again is up to the game to choose and not you.			"

												After compelting the second puzzle-cube I must have exited out of the wrong side of it, because the game locked my progress. I could no longer enter the cube (there were not enough 'blue orbs' left to activate the torch), I could not get around the cube. After jumping into the ocean the game reloaded me back onto the wrong side of the cube; my progress was completely haulted.Up until this point I found the game boring and full of perplexing design decisions. More than half of my time investment consisted of ""non-game"" elements: rolling the ball through long boring forest corridors, collecting blue orbs with no explanation, no decision-making, and no challenges to be found. I can't comment on the difficulty of the puzzle elements because the game broke on me so early, but what I experienced was a frustrating camera and somewhat janky controls. The two puzzles were uninteresting.1/5			"

												Intriguing but ultimatly pointless game. Racing a ball in an open world environment sounds fun. Unfortunatly, the execution is flawed. The open world is full of bugs (I played 10 minutes, I got stuck about 5 times) -you cannot explore the world per say, you have to follow a path from one puzzle house to the other, any sort of deviation and you will either stay stuck bugged out and reset, or you will drown and reset; in other words the open-world feature is useless, very demanding and moslty left unseen- and the camera/controls feel unatural (I played with a PS3 controller).Now that I purchased it, I wonder what's the point. Oh well.If you want rolling balls, don't get InFlux, buy Rock of Ages instead !			"

												The main problem with InFlux is that it doesn't matter that you're a ball.  Rolling physics games, like Marble Madness, rely heavily on conservation of momentum as a game mechanic.  InFlux does not.  You have very good control over your movements and can arrest your forward momentum at any time.  Moving slowly often makes the uneven ground difficult to traverse, but that's more an annoyance than a gameplay mechanic.  There's no incentive to dash madly through levels, not in the least because you spend the navigation levels searching for hard to spot motes of light that you need to unlock the next puzzle.The game has some ramps, but you don't so much roll up them as you hit them at speed and bounce into the air.  Once the game introduces the boost mechanic all semblance of ball relevance goes right out the window, as you can use it to easily turn on a dime at tight angles and even essentially freeze time in mid air to target perfect landings.  Overshot your mark?  No problem, just boost again and turn yourself around.There are some puzzles that involve rolling a ball into a receptacle but that ball is not you.  It's a different ball.  And you don't manipulate it by hitting it like a cue ball or a bowling ball -- you have telekinetic powers.  These puzzles would have been much better if you were the ""scoring"" ball and the game actually forced you to behave like a ball.But instead, InFlux is just a mediocre first-person puzzle game with some reasonably pretty landscaping that is in no way relevant to navigation by a ball.  You might as well be a tiny person with a gun that fires attracting and repulsing waves -- in fact, I have definitely played games where I was a person and my momentum was more difficult to control than it is in InFlux.  At the end of the day you are a character with a motor skills deficiency trying to solve spatial puzzles.  The net result comes across as unfortunately frustrating.It's obvious that the developers put a lot of work and care into this, but it suffers badly from some poor design choices.  I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone but the most diehard of spatial puzzle fanatics.  I definitely don't recommend it to anyone looking for a ball physics game.			"

												Tl;dr: Only buy it if your specs are way above the recommended.I really wanted to like this, mainly because eh... go Melbourne? ;) But running this on a machine on the higher end of their recommended specs (with which I can play alot of AAA games just fine) and even at the lowest possible graphics settings, I'm having serious performance issues. Lag, stuttering, constantly clipping through rocks, together with controls that feel sluggish make this just impossible to enjoy for me.Judging from the split reviews, I'm assuming a higher end PC might be able to play this game fine, and that it may be actually fun. It's certainly an entertaining idea and visually potentially pleasing (if you can run it). I also enjoyed the soundtrack. But seeing how I can't really play it enjoyably despite having the devs recommended specs, this is getting a downvote from me. P.S.

												Not a bad little game. Graphics and atmosphere are nice. The platforming is fun, I only wish there was more and a little less puzzle solving. People are right, control of the ball is pretty poor. Sometimes just from moving a bit you go flying forward and you can usually never stop your momentum which is annoying. Trying to attract and move the other ball can be kind of annoying and isn't super realistic or done well. There is no story at all. The developer is cool because he's involved on forums and talked about how the game did and how money went before and after the game, which was a cool perspective to have from the developer. 6.5/10.

												It's a fine game but nothing really to write home about as far as I'm aware. It has semi clunky controls and no story of any sort. It's got a cool atmosphere and background and some nice puzzles. Beyond that there just really isn't more to this game. I'm recommending it but only if you're a fan of puzzling and platforming and if it's cheap. Like I said it's a fine game but there are simply better games at this price point.			"

												Chill and beautiful. Puzzles aren't too hard, and the mechanic of flipping cubes around is fun. The outside world is fun to explore. There's just enough story to keep you going. And the whale <3It has some bugs here and there - enough that I put the game behind me for a year or two after getting stuck. But I'm glad I finished it - it's a lovely experience. I'm sure our heroic glow ball had important buisness to attend to in outer space.			"

												Got this on the week long deal, and for what I paid, I'm pretty impressed.  Makes good use of the Unreal engine, the environments are well built and with the settings turned up it's a good looking game. The natural hub environments contrast nicely with the more artifical puzzle aspects.  Gameplay wise, this doesn't provide any real additions or major change-ups to the puzzle-platformer genre, but executes it nicely in a comfortable and relaxing style.  Usually the goal is to move color-coded spheres into the matching recepticles using a fairly diverse set of standard puzzling mechanics, including push/pull, lifts, buttons, and level rotators. Gamepad support worked flawlessly for all aspects (I used an Xbox controller, you'll want something with two joysticks), and I didn't encounter any bugs.  It was a bit annoying that sections of the hub environments would load during roaming, and this did create some lag, but the load times were fast so they didn't last long, and didn't occur too often.  Overall a good game for the price.			"

												Overall, this game is a very atmospheric experience. Between the hybrid of natural and abstract environments, you will find an immersive world full of puzzles waiting to be solved.Controls for the most part were very responsive. (I used an Xbox360 controller which the game immediately recognizes and alters the menu screen accordingly.) Controlling this sphere reminded me of the Morph Ball from the Metroid series assuming Samus was stripped down to just pulsing magnetic fields and using speed boosts to get around.The game's puzzles offer a decent challenge on what you are supposed to do. I think only two puzzles glitched on me, but in both cases, the puzzles did eventually work leaving me wondering what I did differently.In terms of game time, this game is on the short side. I spent about 3 hours give or take on my blind run of the game. To be fair, I can think of one other abstract game that's probably even shorter and still gets lots of praise anyway: Portal.My one real complaint is the apparent compatiblity issue with Windows 7 32-bit OS in which the game apparently runs out of memory and crashes. Thankfully, the forums offer a workaround which certainly made the game palyable for me.			"

												InFlux is the equivalent of a drop-dead beautiful girl who charms you with her wit before tripping over nothing and falling down a flight of stairs.I can't really describe the game--it's a weird mix of abstract puzzle-solving and gorgeous outdoor environments. The puzzles themselves are clever but never venture into crazy difficult territory. I do wish the game relied less on me accidentally coming across the solution rather than letting me look around and solve it myself. That said, most puzzles still give a very pleasing ""aha!"" reward.Navigating the world that links the puzzles is, for the most part, pleasing, but the ball you play as controls awfully. Expect to fall off cliffs, get stuck in the level geometry, or lose control numerous times. Overall, the controls are sluggish and, at times, unresponsive, which hampers the experience when you're starting to get into the game. Also, the camera is awful, sticking to walls as you rotate puzzle chambers and generally being a nusiance.The environments are large and a joy to speed through, and the game even gives a word-free story that is surprisingly well-paced. It's very weird to see a game like this not only include a story, but do it in a way that feels surreal and captivating, rather than forced in. For me, the drive to explore this beautiful world was what kept me playing, and the game rewarded me with jaw-dropping vistas and a beautiful ambient score.In short, InFlux is GORGEOUS and a great buy for puzzle and non-puzzle fans alike, as long as you can put up with the awful controls. Also, the game is taxing on lower- to mid-range machines.			"

												Hello,I loved the game concept; I've had InFlux on my wish-list for ages, and finally got it from Humble Store 2 days ago.I'm a little upset at some of the issues I've had so far though :|There is lag, which is ridiculous. I'm playing it on 800x600 and normally I run games at much higher resolution with zero issues.The flash when you get into a puzzle or out of it, is  pure pain. I had to emphasize that, it's just that bad. I hate sudden full screen flashes in games, and have left many games as a result of them, if there is no way to dim or remove them, I will not bother any further.And the worst issue of all was, if I get a puzzle that takes longer than a minute to solve, I get nauseated, might sound like I'm exaggerating, but I am not. I get a headache and feel sick...I was looking forward to playing this game, sigh...			"

												The poor controls really ruin this game. There is a lot of mouse lag, a camera that moves on its own every time it bumps a wall, and sluggish control of the ball itself.It looks visually good, but it's not really pleasant to play. I feel bad that I had to spend $4 to learn this since it looked so good in the videos.Doesn't work well with Nvidia 3D vision, since the reflections are all wrong... and there's no .ini file where you can set graphics options to remedy it.

												This is a very mellow game, great chill soundtrack, and puzzles which can be at once simple and frustrating.  The environment is lush and welcoming, and control of the sphere feels natural.  However, I felt that the game seemed short.  There is a fine line between having too few puzzles and too many, and the size of each of the levels could have crossed that line with another set of 3-5 cubes, so I understand why the developers made this decision.  As with numerous other exploration/puzzlers, plot can be a secondary concern, but the motivations and background of the events in this game were murky at best.  A sphere falls from the sky and powers up the machines for the next part of its journey.  Why were the machines here?  Who built them?  Sadly, one is left with more questions than answers, but it may be left to the player to ponder and draw one's own conclusions.I will say too that I initially had some issues with it stuttering fairly heavily when loading new areas of larger maps, even after turning my settings all the way down.  I was ulitmately able to solve that by counterintuitively turning the settings up or on, but is more likely an issue with the Unreal Engine.All in all, though, this game is definitely worth a few hours of your time if you enjoy puzzle-type games.

												I wasn't particularly interested in the game from previews. It came with some bundle or another. I thought I'd just check it out to pass some time this evening. Turns out it was oddly engrossing and I spent about 5 hours solid until I had completed it. There's no explanation of what's going on or where to go (think almost Dear Esther) but with puzzles strewn throughout which use magnetism and rotation to solve. Think one of those perplexus puzzles, except there's switches, and you're trying to get one or more colored balls to a goal using your ball. Very challenging at times, but never frustrating. Graphics are pretty great, though my card can't handle them anywhere near full power. I oddly recommend giving this one a shot if you can get it for cheap.			"

												This was an incredibly good game as an interactive piece of art!The gameplay is also fun and casual, but by the end, I felt a deep and lingering sense of attachment to the ball, the whale and the setting - despite the lack of dialogue or any obvious displays of narrative. It may be the fact that the ball had no way to communicate and no one to communicate with, and must therefore keep the experience of its journey internalized throughout the game, that you feel for it more: the silent protagonist. But this feeling may depend on the sensitivity of the player.Another point of praise goes to the soundtrack, which was beautiful, relaxing and fitting to the game.Technically, the game was sound, with some areas left for improvement. The camera reaction to world collisions can be jarring, and coupled with the strong motion blur used by the game, may cause a few people eye strain or motion sickness. Loading models sometimes caused momentary pauses in the middle of gameplay; and jumps in model level-of-detail are sometimes incongruent.Overall, I recommend you in buying this game. :)			"

												Take this yes with a _massive_ grain of salt. I can't simply bring myself to say ""No, do not buy this game"", because to be honest I enjoyed it. However, there are a lot of things holding the game back.First off, let's talk about what I enjoyed about the game. The premise of the game is to complete a bunch of puzzles by activating a certain box, which is by far and away the most inadequate explanation for a game, but it's the most I can say without spoiling the game. This is a very interesting concept, and I did have fun solving the puzzles. It's very important for a puzzle game to leave you thinking ""Boy, I solved that puzzle! I'm pretty smart!"" On another topic, this is a very ""artsy"" game, and the atmosphere has to be (and is definitely) executed beautifully. The ""story"" had me wondering what on Earth, or where on Earth, I was. The minimalism put me in the position of having to wonder exactly what I was doing, and it definitely had me guessing, in a sort of existentialist way. This all comes together to make a nice game, and I believe that lots can be done with this premise!Now let's talk about all the glaring downsides of the game. This game is absolutely gorgeous. I think. I wouldn't know, I played on low graphics settings and at times I found myself rolling up a hill whose texture looked like I was rolling up / through a set of stairs. Then again, I'm playing on a Dell i5 laptop, so I wasn't expecting much from the graphics department. The low settings may also explain why whenever I plunged into water that kills me, I see myself falling below the game world for half a second. Or is that the physics engine? One of those two departments has to fix that.Speaking of game physics, this is to me personally the most infuriating flaw of the game. More than once I have found myself stuck _inside_ the ground. Other times, when I break the sound barrier, I fly _into_ rock formations. No, they don't shatter, I just seem to become one with the rock. That's easily escapable though since rocks are actually made of air in the middle. There's also this one part where there is a current that drags your ball to the edge... of a pool... for some reason... and if you don't act quickly you're going to be stuck there for the next few minutes trying to boost your way out. Finally, there are parts where you will encounter the infamous Invisible Wall. Even though the game is trying to take you in one particular direction, it does it in such a way that, if you didn't have the Invisible Wall blocking your way, you can hop onto the top of the edge of the area that you're currently in. I was incredibly let down when I saw this. If I was able to roll on the edge of the arena, that would have given me the feeling that I'm ""beating the system"", and mastering how to control the game.On a personal note, I was disappointed with the lack of difficulty of the game outside of the puzzles. To access each puzzle, you had to wander around a world collecting X-thingies to activate Y-thingies, and open the puzzle. It turns out that you only need to collect three X's to unlock each Y. This killed my ambition to go hunting for X's, or spending effort to catch the X's that are hard to reach, essentially eliminating a possibly very interesting game mechanic.This last oversight is so big to me that I have to count it as a flaw. No level editor? Really??? The level designs were really impressive in the game, and here they are not taking advantage of the potential creativity of their audience. A level editor would practically have the players make the game themselves, minus the artsy portions.So why do I say ""yes"" when the list of downsides is more than thrice as long as the list of upsides? I feel that there is so much potential with this game, and I am willing to bet that Impromptu Games is not done with it yet. It may not be the longest game (though I feel that for the given premise the story length is perfect), and it may look incomplete, but I firmly believe that the Devs have more planned for InFlux. Perhaps a game patch, a level editor, or multiple story arcs with each journey eliciting different emotions. Whatever it is, I'm excited for the future of this game.As for the price, I'm very confident that the Devs can make this game easily worth $10 and then some. But for now... it'd be best to wait for the Steam sale.			"

												Take your time and enjoy the beautiful scenery, or else the game becomes unplayable!Suffers from graphical issues and long loading times on all but the best hardware. It loads the hi-rez textures of the beautiful scenery in the background. However, if you roll around with any aspect of speed, the game will stutter and lag while textures load. This becomes very obvious when you unlock the ability to boost and jump. Long jumps will almost always result in a 1-2 second lag while the textures around you load.			"

												I really liked the idea of this game, but it started to punch me in the face as soon as I discovered how many glitches there are. The pysics are a little shaky but not laughingly funny either. The first time I played, I didn't see a save button so I assumed it would auto-save as soon as I completed a level. haha. hahaha. nope. I quit and had to replay the first three levels again. I came up to the fourth level and I somehow managed to convince the game I already finished it, without even entering it. That would seem nice, but I couldn't get past it in any way, so I was basically stuck. right. reboot the game. start all over again. oh no wait, I didn't. I stopped.Oh and the tutorial at the beginning does not explain how to enter a level, and it leaves you to figure that out too. (Hint: It's the little floating thingies, you'll need three of those)I do seriously not recommend the game. sorry.			"

												Puzzle platformer where you're a ball. You can roll and boost to move and you can attract and repel certain objects to accomplish goals.As a puzzle game it's pretty decent. The art and settings are nice, gamplay is fairly smooth, and the music fits the mood into a nicely relaxed atmosphere. The main menu is a bit obtuse. Some clipping and invisible walls (i've gotten stuck inside a boulder and shot myself into tree branches, though the latter I could escape from), plus your ball isn't big enough to get over some terrain types, so that can halt your momentum in some areas as you find ways around and sometimes in the later areas you can find yourself on small ledges that weren't meant to have paths to progress so you have to kill yourself.You get generous checkpoints and don't have to reload if you fall somewhere and ""die"", but you can't save progress in the middle of an area and leave the game. If you come back you can go to the area you were in. but it will be as if you just got there for the first time and all puzzles need completing, so make sure you have time for 3-4 puzzles, at least.If you want story about why you're a ball, what your goal is, why these puzzle places are around, I'm afraid the game gives nothing on that front, which is too bad. There's enough unique things about the setting and gameplay to interest you about the reason for it all.Overall an enjoyable experience, though.			"

												I've played this game for 4 hours, and I still don't have a clue what it's about, or if I'm anywhere near an end, or even a middle... I love it!InFlux is a neat, relaxing game where you take control of a small metal ball and do pretty much two things: 1. roll around looking at the pretty environment devoid of any other presence despite obvious signs of previous haitation and even civilization, and 2. roll around in giant glass houses where you push buttons and guide other objects to goals to move on to the next area.While exploring this strange place, you'll find small lights that you can attract to follow you, and you need to gather at least 3 in each area to unlock the glass house for that region; I think this is brilliant, since it gives an excuse to explore the gorgeous landscape while breaking up the pace of the puzzling glass houses and still giving an excuse to go slowly through the game.You'll also get access to abilities as you progress, like being able to push or pull some objects, charge up a speed boost, and slow down time for more precise manuvering; these add a freshness to the play, and the speed boost specifically can be used to pull of some really amusing tricks, including jumping over/on top of mountains or clipping through walls. in the short time I've played, I even managed to find a relatively large skip in the game using a clip in one of the early glass houses, which really appeals to the speedrunner in me.For some negatives, if you're playing on a laptop more than maybe a year old, you'll probably experience some slowdown or lag, which for me is a pretty important issue. Additionally, as far as I can tell, there isn't really a point or story in the game; that might not be a bad thing, and maybe later in the game I'll learn something about why I'm alone in this big world and the complete absence will make sense, but for now, it's just a bit of a bother to me. finally, while the controls are fairly easy to use,  it does take a bit of getting used to, and momentum plays a major role, meaning hairpin turns aren't feasible, and you'll have to constantly modify your speed and direction to keep going even in a straight line, a problem that's just compounded when you factor the environment filled with slopes, bumps, rocks, logs, and even just uneven ground.Now the positives, first and foremost, the beautiful atmosphere! Your journey takes you through fields and mountain passes, caves, small villages, mountains, beaches, and A FREAKING VOLCANO! Combined with the very mild and unobtrusive audio, the experience is one that I'll probably remember for quite some time. Speaking of the audio, the backround music is faint and plesant, even in the glasshouses where it changes, it only serves to set a mood, and it does very well. Even the sound effects are simple and quiet, which is a major plus for me. The puzzles in the glass houses are also very well done; you are introduced to new mechanics slowly to give you time to understand each new concept and play with it for a while. You can press a switch to turn the entire room on its side, get blown up by a giant fan to a higher platform, be launched by a catapult, and tons of other things that will take up too much space in this already lengthy review to go into detail about. And having mentioned the controls in the negative section, I feel like it's only fair to mention that they are always fair. You'll never feel like the ball was just ignoring your input, and you always have plenty of room to move around so the tiniest mistake won't ruin your progress.So tl;dr - I would definitely recommend this game. $10 isn't asking too much, and I think it's well worth it for the experience you get. If you're okay not having a ton of direction, you want something relaxing and calm, you don't mind thinking a little, and you apreciate beautiful things, you can't go wrong checking this out.			"

												I'm not a game critic by nature, so I'll just say this. When I play Influx, I have a lot of fun. It's a somewhat calming game, until you get to a part that needs control precision, then it's possible to get somewhat...agitated, however it is still a fun experience.			"

Buy? Likely(TL;DR? See Summary)Overview and GameplayThere's not a ton to say about InFlux other than it is clear that the college that the developers attented, RMIT University, is clearly a million times better than the scamtastic joke that is ITT Tech that I went to for game design. InFlux is a simple and fairly relaxing ball puzzle game that is best described as Marble Blast meets Q.U.B.E. . If you played any 3D ball puzzle game like those or Super Monkey Ball, then you have a rough idea. The game world is continuous in InFlux, as you gather orbs of light with your attact ability spread across an island paradise and drop them off into to totems/torches that activate puzzle segments. You then can enter these segments which are relatively easy puzzles involving trying to get an orange orb into an orange box (in one case, there was a second, green orb and box). Solving the puzzle activates a pillar of light and when all the puzzles in an area are finished, some sort of sequence will activate, allowing you to the next area. Puzzles generally involve rotating the room or parts of the room with blue switches and moving yourself and the ball around with the help of platforms, air vents, and bouncing mechanisms. The hardest part of the game and puzzles is probably the platforming, and I belive most gamers, even those not good a puzzlers should be able to solve most of these relatively easy puzzles.PresentationI really like the art style, specifically of the ball, it's lighting effects and look and sound of it's abilities. The island has a nice asthetic, though graphical quality is comparable to a mid-era PS3/360 game - textures up close can be pretty muddy. It's unclear as to what or why anything in the game world is happening. You're a high tech looking ball with an internal light source and ""magical magnetic"" ability rolling around what looks like a real world, primitive tribal island where human-like life exists or used to exist. There are tree stumps and man-made structures all over the island, but no signs of life beyond flora and a single whale-like mammal you encounter a few times in the game. *Mild Spoiler* It is implied that you are from another world OR that you are trying to escape this world. *END SPOILER*. Regardless, it is never made clear exactly what the story or plot really is; you roll around the level, entering puzzles that seem to take you to another dimension, finish them and eventually leave the entire location. That said, exploring the world is mostly calming, especially thanks to the very nice Chillwave/downtempo soundtrack from Johnathan Yandel - I have added it to my Bandcamp wishlist.ComplaintsMy few complaints are minor. Due to the level design and physics engine, your ball will easily hop around on some ground surfaces on the island, even if it is an apparently flattened trail, but this isn't a problem in puzzles and most of the game. I had a couple bugs where I got stuck behind geometry and once even went straight through a wall on a puzzle room - in that instance, I didn't see how I could complete the room without that exploit. Platforming is annoying as the ball doesn't jump and instead propels, bouncing off anything it hits, which sometimes means you will miss jumps or worse, bounce off a wall into oblivion. Thankfully, lives are ""infinite"" and you are generously returned to a checkpoint. I also had a bug where I lost some of my sound for the attract ability. Lastly, I'm confused into why I'm even playing this or what I'm doing exactly. InFlux ALMOST has the mark of something pretentious, but never clarify or signal much of anything.SummaryStill, it's a nice puzzler that likely won't strain your brain, time, or wallet as it can be completed in under 4 hours and costs only $5. I enjoyed my experience, and I recommend it to fans of the genre and casual/semi-casual gamers. I even recommend it to gamers that don't like puzzle games - since the puzzles are generally easy. However, all that is the biggest drawback to some of the biggest fans of the arcade/puzzler genre: there little content or challenge, and next to no reward.			"

												This is a very relaxing, easy going exploration and puzzle game. The puzzles are just enough to make you think but not enough to stump you. The exploration has very gorgeous setpieces and scenery. The soundtrack is alright and the controls are good, but not stellar. That can really be a blanket statement for the game as a whole: ""good, but not stellar"". Still, I'd recommend it if you can pick it up for a couple of bucks.			"

												You control a ball which you roll through the landscape, collecting a few blue bulbs that follow you around which you use to unlock a glass building. This building is a puzzle where you have to put another ball into a box by pushing it around and rotating the building. Repeat this a dozen times. That's the game pretty much.A few things: It's short; 3 hours without rushing. The puzzles are easy and can be solved by just trying a few things. The exploring is restricted to small parts of the island at a time. The game lags a lot when loading an area, which is pretty often at the beginning but became less later on (or I got used to it). There is a hint towards a story, but we're talking about a ball here. No replay value. Definitely not worth the full € 9,99!It's not great. Get it at discount if you enjoy casual exploring/puzzling and don't have a slow hard drive.			"

												It's moderately pretty, but the trailer makes it looks a heck of a lot more exciting than it is. The puzzles give you no sense of satisfaction when you complete them because the solutions simply work themselves out -- you just press the button and move the ball into the goal and stuff happens... Not to mention the ""collect the scattered/hidden blue dots to unlock the next puzzle"". The entire game is just arbitrary and uninteresting. I could go on, but... Just save your money, please.			"

												This a game that alternates between puzzles (the main content) and exploring (or getting from the puzzle you just finished, to the next).  Unfortunately it becomes dull very quickly.The controls for the ball are clunky and unweildy, and a very slow start up time to get rolling makes it very frustrating when you hit a wall or the ball stops (which is all the time).  The puzzles themselves are tedious, and monotonous. Only challenging because of the clunky controls and not for their actual puzzle merit (although perhaps later game they get better - I don't know, I burnt out very quickly).I generally found the exploration much more enjoyable than the puzzles, but found myself very frustrated that I even had to complete a puzzle to explore more areas - for a game who's focus is the puzzles this gets old very quickly.Not really worth it, felt like a waste of time.

The path to the next area was blocked so I assumed it was part of the puzzle of the game to unblock it. After wasting a lot of time experimenting and then looking online for a solution, I found out that the area was just blocked because of a bug.

Find a hearing put on by your local government, sit through it, and offer feedback to the certainly bemused local bureaucrats. Argue on the internet.

												I came expecting that this game would be similar to ""Marble Blast Ultra"", which is where I thought these developers got thier inspiration from. The reason this game isn't fun is because the controls are way too lose. While the ball is in motion and you wish to turn it to another direction but the ball takes a few seconds to get out of its momentum. Sure in real life the ball might do this but this is game, too much of reality can hinder a game. Also another annoying thing is that the ball doesn't roll smoothly since the ground is bumpy but again reality. This game might of been fun if the controls where more tight.			"

												The game stutters terribly, the controls are really sluggish and imprecise. The gameplay outside the 'greenhouses' is pretty linear and only serves to be pretty. The gameplay inside the lighthouses suffer from the controls and camera problems.Example: The greenhouse can rotate and crush your camera to just a few ""inches"" away from your sphere thing, and then it'll take you like 10 seconds just to recover the camera. All the while, I felt really sick to my stomach as I was forced to zoom in on the sphere that closely.Additionally, you also can't Alt-Tab without graphical errors that require you to Quit Back to the Desktop.Don't be fooled by the Pax Australia badge, that apparently isn't a sign of quality. This game isn't much more than a final project for a game design program.			"

												I sincerely wish there were more games like this. The gameplay is smooth, simple and solid, though it keeps along a similar theme. There's a touch of narrative, not in spoken word or in text, but in exploring the environment and seeing the wonders that are there. A part of me wishes to keep going, to explore more of this fantastic setting. What is the mysterious blue ball and the glass puzzle houses? Why are they intermixed with what appears to be native villages?The soundtrack is nice, soft and comforting, aiding in an almost tropical experience. Yet, there is an undercurrent of mystery in it.For those that are a fan of Portal, this is a must have.			"

												*STOP*. Save your money.Terrible puzzle game, terrible anything.The game tries to focus itself around visuals and fails. It’s using the Unreal 3 engine so the visual engine power is there but the game does not use it (considering its focus this is rather silly). Level layouts are ugg, invisible walls, bad layouts (dead ends),  getting stuck in crannies (rocks, between puzzle button ramps and walls). For a game that you'd expect to be movement to be fluid it’s just the opposite, lots of  slow breaking to stop, turning around,  hitting ramps at the wrong angles and thus drop to a complete standstill.... Far, far from fluid...The game flow, I expect, ’s supposed to be a pattern of explore -> puzzle -> explore -> puzzle-> ... etc. Iit’s just executed so poorly, the explore sections are clearly supposed to be *ooo look at the visuals* but it’s more like *oo look at the visuals that look like they are from a game 4 years ago and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (yes I've gone into the settings and jacked everything up). If you stop to look at anything you immediately see beyond the superficial polish into cheap, lazy visual effects.Furthermore a lot of the ‘exploring’ (feels more like walking around Disney world without a map, looking for a particular ride) is to dead end map sections (you’re on an island with all the outlying water being cordoned off with rocks or bundled timber? Looks really silly), where your entire purpose for going down was either to discover keys (blue floating balls) or the absence of keys, either way you have to stop and turn around. All the exploring is through like… hiking trails very bumpy and therefore very little room for any fluidity and gets repetitive as well (“oh look another trail with… tiki huts… ooo so different”).The controls are loopy (e.g. forward+ left should result in the ball rolling left, but instead is like an invisible force is pushing the ball diagonally (like a kid playing with a hot wheels car)), the game is buggy (especially with the boost feature, found myself going THROUGH walls and other solid objects and dropping outside the world or in a place I could not get out of (like inside the model of a tree). Or once I touched some water and then for the next ten minutes I heard the obnoxious water splashing sound looping over and over.My overall impression is that this was some team’s grad school project and they had a great team of modelers, content artists but the game designer and programmers were not so great...The skills you learn are extremely repetitive, e.g. use 'mouse buttons to repel and attract rocks, here now have twenty rock walls incase using this skill didn’t sink in the other twenty times!’ Or the flipper things, have to use them thirty times in a row; it’s all highly repetitive…The puzzles are lack luster, very little thinking, just obnoxious trial and error: “oh you got all the way to the end of the puzzle lugging around 2 heavy balls using the attract? Well oops looks like you stepped on the wrong button which requires you use the balls to activate (no way you could have foreseen this). Now watch the balls fall off the platform and roll back to the beginning of the puzzle, DO IT OVER NOW!” Highly repetitive, very little to no satisfaction for solving puzzles as most are extremely monotonous. Its crap; all in all the game does nothing new (kind of mandatory for a puzzle game) (ok there is ONE new thing, the puzzle maps do flip but really has little effect on your skill repertoire), nor does anything particularly well and it all feels like some poorly executed grad project with no direction other than five people shouting out ill contrived ideas at a meeting table in a student library. It even sounds lame when you describe the games concept out loud “you are this ball thing rolling around the environment up and down ramps placed on hiking trails and occasionally solve puzzles”. Overall *HIGHLY* repetitive and very mundane.			"

												Really lovely puzzle game. Not too sure on what the story (if there is one) seems to be but the level design, music and just general flowing style of play make this game really cool.You get to explore a lovely designed environment and have to complete some mind-bending puzzles which just makes this game more fun.
