												Rarely does a sequel capture essence of the original so well. In Monkey Island 2 SE, you will have more of everything! More islands to explore, more bizarro characters, whacky plots & harder puzzles! I still remember all those years ago getting this on 11 floppy disks back on the Amiga & how much longer it took to complete than the original just a year or so before!Guybrush Threepwood returns, still regurgitating the story (to those that will listen) of how he vanquished LeChuck. This is old news now, so Guybrush sets out for more fame & fortune to a new island, and a new adventure .. the hunt for the Big Whoop treasure! Our dimwitted hero also will come across many of the memorable characters from the first game, but as as you can guess, his luck takes a turn for the worse pretty quickly. I won't say much more on the story other than to point out it is most enjoyable with some great dialog & some truly funny moments. Although one thing I didn't like so much compared to Monkey Island 1 was the ending. I thought it was clever when I first saw it all those years ago as a kid, but now it seems not to fit the game very well .. don't let that disuade you from trying it though as its still a great adventure (and besides, you might like it!).Fast forward about 25 years to the Special Edition re-make; no more floppy disks to swap out & improved graphics/sound/interface, plus a 'modern gamer' friendly hints (& highlighting) system to point you in the right direction when you get stuck. Certainly the help system can take the frustration out, but something I would recommend avoiding to really get the most satisfaction out of the game experience. Progress should be earned & figuring it out yourself is so much more rewarding!Another timeless point 'n' click adventure! One of the best from the era!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												I grew up playing LucasArts adventure games and I was 6 years old when I played Monkey Island II for the first time. There was no internet to use when I got stuck, I solved every puzzle by myself. But playing it after 20 years was a bit frustrating and to be honest I had to use some hints. Thanks Monkey Island for making me use my brain again.			"

												The intuitive interface, the evocative backdrops, the witty story full of good jokes, the challenging riddles, and the iMuse, the program that allows the music to change slightly from an environment to another one, make Monkey Island 2 one of the best Point and Click adventure ever. Also the improved character design and the addition of achievements make this special edition better then The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition.			"

												For me this is a masterpiece of adventure-games!A part of gaming-history!The early Lucasarts adventures were great, including Monkey Island 2. I actually started gaming on the pc with it, that's why it is and always will be my favorite adventure game.I never played the special edition so far, but it's really well done!I like the idea of switching between the old pixel-graphics and the new special-edition. Actually, i didn't missed the old one, though it still has it's charme, as they did a great job with the new graphics (but i still can't forgive them completely what they had done to Guybrushs hair in the special edition for monkey island 1..ugh).Even though they kinda overhauled the graphic, they still managed to keep the spirit and charme from the old pixelated graphics. The sound is great as always and the spoken voices add a lot to the atmosphere.I recommend this to all adventure fans out there.If you didn't played this so far, shame on you and catch up on it...now!!This is a straight 10 out of 10 LeChucks!

												A classic point and click adventure game that ended up getting a graphical ""upgrade"" and some additional polish. As I had played the game in the past I had a real hard time with the new graphics as they did simply not feel right and decided to remain in the classical style (big plus is that the game allows switching between the old and new look instantly at any time by a single press of a button). It does add voice acting which is a pretty nice bonus to the experience. If you love these kinds of games just get it.The game has mostly story achievements but has three missable achievements and one ""speedrun"" that you need to keep in mind.  The speedrun is fairly easily done but might require an additional playthrough if you don't play quick during your first one.Time to 100%: 3-6 hours			"

												The Special Edition of the sequel is just as good as it was for the first one. We have the same areas but completely redrawn. Attention-to-detail is just excellent: switching between the new and the old version happens on the go with just a press of a button. Here you can clearly see how similar the new graphics are to the old one in terms of design elements.Voice acting and sound effects are, of course, very good once more and they immediately get you hooked up! One notable difference compared to the previous episode is the more-easy-to-use action selection. Also, we have now extra features such as the concept arts that are accessible via the main menu and gradually get unlocked as we make further progress in Guybrush's journey. Additionally, developer commentaries are available at various scenes - the creators of the original game discuss the fun they had with the making of the game and the various obstacles they had to overcome  due to technological constraints. Oh, and in case you missed achievements from the first now you have a dozen of them ready to be unlocked.This is a great game just as the first one and it only brings back fond memories of my childhood. I can only recommend this to the fans of the good old point-and-click adventure games and I do look forward to playing Day of The Tentacle which is the absolute must after the Monkey Island games!

												In the early 90's my family and I went to a town called TÃ¸nsberg and I got to visit my favorite store, namely Software City. They stocked games for all kinds of platforms, including the Amiga. I had an Amiga 500 at the time with an external disk drive and was going to purchase a brand, new game. On the shelf it was, Monkey Island 2, and I just had to have it. I took it home and was amazed at the vast amount of floppies. 11 disks I believe it was! The game itself was a blast, even though I nearly developed ""disk swappers wrist"" from taking floppies in and out of the drives all the time. Anyway, Monkey Island 2 became one of my most dearest games and I still have it on the shelf in the office.Now for the Special Edition. I tried it, instantly loved it, and I will come back to it in the future when I fancy some MI2 adventuring again. This version is just like the old classic, just better in all aspects. And you don't have to swap floppies all the time, as well as waiting for scenes to load. Everything is quick and beatiful.If you've never tried Monkey Island 2 before, you really should. It is one of the timeless classics that'll keep us entertained for years and years to come. A point-a-click adventure of the highest grade. A+++.			"

												I recommend staying with classic graphics/music and turning on voice acting. The voice acting is great and features the original cast of the third game, but the new graphics and music don't fit as well. They seem like loose adaptations done entirely to justify the special edition that would be cool on DeviantArt or something but don't work as well for gameplay, plus the original music and backgrounds are fantastic.

PrepositionImagine a little girl sitting in the ""PC room"" of her daddy somewhere back in the year 1993. She's playing with a doll and a semi-functional Transformer, because her brother always broke things. Daddy was talking with a good friend who was there for a visit, mom cooks dinner and the brother played on his GameBoy. Then daddy stood up, gave the little girl a kiss and said ""Bye"", because he's on his way to do some music, together with his friend; because that's what he does, after his normal job. Before he left, he turned around and hugged the girl. ""You can play with Pappas PC if you want. Should I load Lemmings for you?"" The girl shook her head. ""Nah! I wanna play this funny looking game you and your pal were watching!""And so she started her very first adventure ...GraphicsEvery pixel bleeds love, atmosphere and quality. Animations are superb and the scenery amazingly detailed. It really looks like you're in the Caribbean and are watching a cartoon.SoundWell, back then it was limited to the computers sound card and we had the standard Sound Blaster. Nowadays its better, of course. Nothing to say about that, it's ... well, they're sounds. Like in every other game. But that's not negative. MusicThe main theme was the first thing I learned on my daddy's Synthesizer keyboard. It was my favourite tune; I loved it and I still do. In fact, I just listened to a remake of the main theme, 5 minutes ago on youtube.

Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is the second game in the amazing Monkey Island series and probably my favourite point and click to this dayI've never been a huge fan of point and clicks because I prefer more fast paced gameplay but I was begged by a friend to try the Monkey Island series just once because it is his favourite franchise ever. MI2 went above and beyond anything I could have ever expected.Monkey Island 2 is the second part in the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood who is, to put it politely, a rather rubbish pirate. After defeating LeChuck and 'rescuing' his love interest Elaine, Guybrush is back in search of a new story to tell and decides he will find the legendary Treasure of Big Whoop. But LeChuck has other plans....Monkey Island 2 Special Edition brings you the original game with some added bonuses such as entirely remastered graphics, fantastic voice acting, new music, a much better and more intuitive interface and an added hint system (which might just be needed for those new to the franchise). There are also various bits of behind the scene commentary and art and for those of you who are like me; ACHIEVEMENTS. It's one of the few games I actually wanted to completed every single achievement as some were pretty amusing. You can choose to play in the remastered edition or the original and can switch between them at any point quickly and easily.You'll spent your time exploring the Caribbean trying to uncover the mystery of Big Whoop. Along the way you'll meet some new faces and some old ones (used coffins popular these days) all of which have larger than life personalities, classic catchphrases and undefiable logical. You'll find yourself talking to every single person you encounter because you know they'll have something good to say.You'll be faced with challenges, puzzles, riddles and even the odd untraditional 'sword-fight' (I've heard you are a contemptible sneak). You'll experience the wonders of love (or at least try), make new friends (and many, many more enemies) and finally make your name as the greatest pirate ever (â¦). LucasArts were able to create something fantastic with Monkey Island, combining great gameplay, a wonderful story, loveable characters and perfect humor to make a point and click adventure that'll keep you coming back time and time again. It never feels boring and it never gets old, no matter how many times you've heard the jokes, it just brings back that nice warm feeling. Part of me feels that I missed out on something amazing never getting to play Monkey Island as a child but I am so glad I had a chance to experience it both in it's original glory and remastered. It's a shame LucasArts are no longer around to create games because they created some masterpieces in their life. Monkey Island is one of the best. "

												I heard about the series when I was young, but never had chance to play the game due to lack of PC at the time. Later, I wasn't keen on jumping to a pretty old game I was never invested in. Then the remakes came out.What you need to know is that I laughed. A lot. For a game being this old, to make someone else laugh so many years later is quite an achievement in my opinion. If you never played the original games like me, and want to have a good time in a company of a very stylish, entertaining and funny story, then please, don't miss out.			"

												Oh, Guybrush. What a delighfully loveable fool you are! Welcome back to my computer monitor. Your antics as you search for the Big Whoop! continue to cause me a great deal of uncontrollable laughter!I am thrilled to have the opportunity to play this and the original Monkey Island game again. I have played through the game both in it's original form and in it's stunning makeover. Both are enjoyable. I found it curious, however, that the controls were different in each game. I certainly found the classic point and click interface in the original to be easier, which did hamper my playthrough of the new version. Either way it was still very enjoyable. Dominic Aramato's voiceover was, as always, fantastic.To those who enjoyed these games back in the early 90's I would abosolutely recommend them to you now. To the newcomers I would only ask if you have the patience to solve puzzles, possibly even take notes along the way, and do you have a sense of humor. If the answer is 'yes' to all three, by all means, come aboard!8/10			"

												So... this is my 100th review. What game should I review? One special to me, maybe? How about MI2?But...? MI2 isn't my favorite video game -- The Witcher 3 is.But...? MI2 isn't the best Monkey Island game -- the first one is probably funnier and more memorable.But...? MI2 isn't even my favorite Monkey Island game -- I liked the 3D episodes better, even if they're universally panned for their terrible 3D models.But......... MI2 will always be the first video game I fell in love with. The one that I spent tons of money on when I had expensive long-distance phone calls with a friend to try and get out of the jungle, back when we didn't have the Internet.And this flawless remastered edition gives it justice.The lesson to remember: never pay more than 20 bucks for a computer game. INCLUDING phone bills.			"

												As in the case of the first title, the special edition remake works well and Monkey Island still has it even today. The UI is much better than in the first part's special edition, so playing feels a bit smoother and more relaxing. There's also an audio commentary by the devs, if one is interested.The new graphics are good, but the truth is, MI2 had stunning graphics back in the day, and I actually prefer the old ones to some of the new ones this time. However, it's easy to toggle between the two and check out how the action looks in the other version. I played this game in Spanish like I did the previous one, just for fun to learn a word or two, works well like that also.Recommended not only for fans of nostalgia, but also for new players looking for a relaxing trip. One just has to remember that you can't do anything wrong or die in the game (well, technically you can in one scene, but that doesn't count here). That's quite different to most games and might sound boring at first, but it isn't.			"

8/10 Even with nostalgia goggles off, still is an amazing adventure game & remasterAfter the occurrences of The Secret of Monkey Island (orig. 1990, remaster 2009), we revisit Guybrush in Monkey Island 2: LeChuckâs Revenge (Lucas Arts 1991, Special Edition 2010), several years after his defeat of the ghost pirate LeChuck. Now, more mature, as his beard clearly indicates (even though some bartender doesnât believe him), Guybrush feels unfulfilled as life has been in a rut since LeChuckâs demise. In search of a new adventure, he ventures off to find the buried treasure Big Whoop, in doing so, he accidentally initiates the events that lead to LeChuckâs resurrection.

About the GameMonkey Island 2: LeChuckâs Revenge was the first PC titles Iâve ever played when my brother borrowed it from one of his friends, and later on became to be the first PC game Iâve ever owned myself. It sparked the fascination for the adventure game genre and I own both the DRM-free retail version of the game, as well as a subscription to this Steam version because of the admiration I have for this title.


This whole scene was greatÂ 
A Screenshot of Monkey Island 2: Special Edition

The story and puzzle designs are far superior to the original. The many side characters have much more of a personality and the pixel art when switching back to the old graphics is just stunning. The Moon Logic has been toned down, so that most things make sense once you think about them. Of course there are sequences like âIf this is XX, how much is this?â that bring back uncomfortable memories, but these are minor dents. The new music and voice-over, and audio commentary really add to the experience. The achievements, though a nice addition to the game, were uncreative. Achievements in later remasters, like Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle, felt far more rewarding for players (re)visiting these crazy worlds.


I prefer the old library design over the new oneÂ

ConclusionIf one had to be honest, then one should point out that the game suffers from being too long. The entire game couldâve ended before the Dinky Island segment, instead, even though Dinky Island has a couple of very memorably bits, seems like it's been added to be added. The gameâs world is also very vast, in so far that players have to solve puzzles on three different islands simultaneously. This might definitely scare newer players away from the game, especially in this day and age. The only nitpick I personally had though was how Elaineâs face was redesigned in this sequel. She looked much better in the remaster of Monkey 1.			"

												Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a 2010 remake of MI2, the sequel to Secret of Monkey Island. It's a point-and-click adventure game, the ones that would want players to tear hair out. Classic and all. You can switch between remake and original mode on the fly, so you can always beat the game in original mode, if you aren't interested in Special Edition part much. Well, almost, as easy mode was removed from the game.Monkey Island 2 is quite an excellent sequel. It kept the charm of the first game and improved on it. Main hero grew and got himself a little beard, trying to look like handsome pirate. Moved on with his life, telling everybody of that one time he defeated Le Chuck. The graphics are as beatifully drawn as ever, even if backgrounds weren't cleaned well from pixel artifacts from scanning. Not only that, but this time around the music adds another layer of amaziness, playing nice melody in each scene, unlike the first game which used soundtrack sparcely. Game used iMuse for soundtrack, which means that it has more complex transition between music and other such manipulation, which, well, in all honesty is not so noticeable outside of the first location in the game. I am not sure which Sound Card style the original uses in this version, but two things: it's not SoundBlaster and it sounds fantastical. Maybe Adlib. Not sure exactly.As far gameplay, it's the Monkey Island sequel, alright. You get to talk with interesting characters. You will get to choose your own reply in dialogue a lot of times, even though it's never impacts the outcome. Hey, it's cool to choose your own way of saying ""I'll be back!"". The game is quite linear, as expected, though you can often chooce on your own which line of puzzles you was to beat first, walking around all the locations. Sword'fighting' is gone completely. And puzzles here are as big of ridiculous nonsense as you could get. The situations and puzzles tend to be quite comedical, but as said, they aren't exactly always good. There is few good ones, and many would make you say ""oh, that's clever"" after solving. Yes, some of puzzles may appear as clever, but no way that you may figure or make sense before solving them, which is shame, most often because of you have to do something random or it just would have never made sense doing in real life. Using monkey as a wrench because of ""monkey-wrench"" pun? Clever, kinda, but nonsense.Quite a shame that most adventure games tend to prefer comedy over common sense. Kinda what killed the whole genre in the end.The game is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is set on a single island, as you try to drive criminal person related to Le Chuck away off island, all while ruining everybody's else life. In the second chapter, you get two more islands to explore, so you get to ruin more lifes and get to get even more hopelessly lost, trying to search for 4 map pieces, because developers putted puzzles all over the islands. Thr third chapter picks up the pace (and has awesome music for trap) and the last chapter... well, remember how in the first Monkey Island the last chapter was all about kicking butt? In this one your own butt gets kicked with same awesomeness. Quite panic-y and unique experience for adventure game.And sure thing, about Special Edition itself, which is supposed to improve on MI2 experience. Almost, as it removed ""Monkey 2 Lite"" mode, easy difficulty of sorts, which is supposed to have less puzzles. They probably decided that the new hints system does the job of helping new players just fine, and it does. As well as ability to highlight objects on screen. Special Edition feels much more refined and complete than Special Edition of the first Monkey Island. You can still easily switch on a fly between remake and original mode. The new interface is not painful like and goes well with mouse. As usual, improved graphics were added, with cleaned up background art and character art that not everybody may dig. Le Chuck looks weird in this one, like pre-rendered model, with way too smooth walking animation with choppier talking animation. Voice acting was added, with music getting improved as well, which not everybody may like too.And sure thing there is some new stuff in, as it now got Steam achievements, for people who can actually pass the first puzzles. New developers commentary mode which can be activated in some scenes to listen to. Not too much of it, it looks like they were recording developers as they were replaying the game and then inserted some of their comments into the scenes. There aren't too many of them either, it feels as if some of the more interesting moments were ignored out. But otherwise, jolly. And you get to unlock concept arts too.And you can play original version with voice acting too, if you feel like it. Though it seemed that disabling voice acting completely would make dialogues go too fast, so just lowering voice volume to zero is more recommended.So yes, excellent remake of a excellent adventure game, as long as nonsense puzzles is what you enjoy. Or you can just abuse hints system and enjoy comedy.			"

												In my humble opinion, This is great example, a great standard(Etalon) of how to do remakes-re'release(of old games) or how they should be!Recipe is = pure love to the original+painstaking attention to every details+diligence+good talents/taste.If only in someday, someone, will make a remake in the same way for DUNE(1993)...mmmm ;)upd: oh, and simon sorcerer 2, will be awesome too!)-on topic, about the game:Monkey Island 2 - is that case, when people say ""quality, proven by time"". Still great music, not bad dialogues, good design of locations and the main - good adventure spirit...in one word, still enjoyable! Even for newcomers, i thinkso much flashbacks.. ;DPS: Also i recommend to check...hm no..not recommend...you Must check Deponia! Rufus(protagonist of D) - is just Guybrush Threepwood's brother in dystopian future, itself xD			"

												It's a LucasArts game from their adventure game era of the 90s.  Enough said.  This Special Edition of Monkey Island 2 is perfectly done and recreated exactly as the original is and was.  You get to hit a key to go from the original to the special edition if you like and the best part is that it switches on the fly with a cool transition.  They really did not change a thing other than the added voice overs and the graphical upgrade.  And the graphical upgrade is absolutely beautiful in its own Monkey Island cartoony way. This game, the original at least, is an absolute classic.  Unlike Sierra games, their competitors at the time, you don't have the ability to die or get stuck in a LucasArts game.  This gets rid of the frustation that these other games may have created.  However, this doesn't mean that puzzles are difficult at times, because they are.  One of the best parts of the game is the humor, so be prepared to laugh when you are swordfighting with insults.			"

AUDIOGreat OSTVISUALFlexible EyecandyDIFFICULTYToughVIBEDevilishCRAVINGClassic Point 'n clickON SALESometimesPROS: Voice-acting is superb, environments are exceptional. iMUSE works beautifully in this, making the soundtrack feel alive. The game is completely unaltered, and concept art from the original development decades ago was used to fill in the blanks instead of simply extrapolating from what could be seen. The puzzles are just enough of a challenge, and the game is a fair length for a point n' click adventure. Guybrush and all other sprites look fantastic.CONS: Final boss has issues (not game-breaking) that could've been polished in this remaster. Hints make the game far too easy, though achievements at least discourage their use slightly. Story gives you a bit of a run-around, so you'll be revisiting the same places multiple times.WORTH:  It's worth every single penny.OVERALL: A true genre-definer. This is everything a remake should be; True to it's origins, created with passion, bursting at the seams with creativity. Very few point & clicks match can compete. If you get stuck, you can check out my comprehensive Steam walkthrough to unstick yourself! I've also made a Steam page for the plethora of trivia in MI2, with more monkeys than you can shake a stick at!SCORE:9/10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Full Review Coming Soon "

												Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a 2010 remake of MI2, the sequel to Secret of Monkey Island. It's a point-and-click adventure game, the ones that would want players to tear hair out. Classic and all. You can switch between remake and original mode on the fly, so you can always beat the game in original mode, if you aren't interested in Special Edition part much. Well, almost, as easy mode was removed from the game.Monkey Island 2 is quite an excellent sequel. It kept the charm of the first game and improved on it. Main hero grew and got himself a little beard, trying to look like handsome pirate. Moved on with his life, telling everybody of that one time he defeated Le Chuck. The graphics are as beatifully drawn as ever, even if backgrounds weren't cleaned well from pixel artifacts from scanning. Not only that, but this time around the music adds another layer of amaziness, playing nice melody in each scene, unlike the first game which used soundtrack sparcely. Game used iMuse for soundtrack, which means that it has more complex transition between music and other such manipulation, which, well, in all honesty is not so noticeable outside of the first location in the game. I am not sure which Sound Card style the original uses in this version, but two things: it's not SoundBlaster and it sounds fantastical. Maybe Adlib. Not sure exactly.As far gameplay, it's the Monkey Island sequel, alright. You get to talk with interesting characters. You will get to choose your own reply in dialogue a lot of times, even though it's never impacts the outcome. Hey, it's cool to choose your own way of saying ""I'll be back!"". The game is quite linear, as expected, though you can often chooce on your own which line of puzzles you was to beat first, walking around all the locations. Sword'fighting' is gone completely. And puzzles here are as big of ridiculous nonsense as you could get. The situations and puzzles tend to be quite comedical, but as said, they aren't exactly always good. There is few good ones, and many would make you say ""oh, that's clever"" after solving. Yes, some of puzzles may appear as clever, but no way that you may figure or make sense before solving them, which is shame, most often because of you have to do something random or it just would have never made sense doing in real life. Using monkey as a wrench because of ""monkey-wrench"" pun? Clever, kinda, but nonsense.Quite a shame that most adventure games tend to prefer comedy over common sense. Kinda what killed the whole genre in the end.The game is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is set on a single island, as you try to drive criminal person related to Le Chuck away off island, all while ruining everybody's else life. In the second chapter, you get two more islands to explore, so you get to ruin more lifes and get to get even more hopelessly lost, trying to search for 4 map pieces, because developers putted puzzles all over the islands. Thr third chapter picks up the pace (and has awesome music for trap) and the last chapter... well, remember how in the first Monkey Island the last chapter was all about kicking butt? In this one your own butt gets kicked with same awesomeness. Quite panic-y and unique experience for adventure game.And sure thing, about Special Edition itself, which is supposed to improve on MI2 experience. Almost, as it removed ""Monkey 2 Lite"" mode, easy difficulty of sorts, which is supposed to have less puzzles. They probably decided that the new hints system does the job of helping new players just fine, and it does. As well as ability to highlight objects on screen. Special Edition feels much more refined and complete than Special Edition of the first Monkey Island. You can still easily switch on a fly between remake and original mode.

This game is a refurbished edition of the old school stuff from the 90's, with a much easier to use playing style, not the 3x3 grid of actions, it is all point and click still but in a different way. Loved the refurbished look and the ability to hear some optional commentary. Sound refurbish of one of LucasArts best games, from their best series.			"

												If you grew up with LucasArts adventure games back in the day of the 286 and 386, then it is safe to say that nostalgia will have its way with you as it coerces you to buy this game. It was refreshing to see the wonderful art updated but still stay true to the pixelated masterpiece of yore. The coolest feature is a toggle key that transitions from the modern art to the original graphics, and can be used anytime through out the game. So go ahead, oldschool adventurer, relive the hijinks of lifting Largo's embargo, participating in spitting contests, and finding the map pieces to Big Whoop. I thoroughly enjoyed going back through this game (as well as the original Secret of Monkey Island) after all these years. The jokes and humor still stand up, and I still find myself telling people, ""How appropriate.. you fight like a cow"" to their puzzled faces.			"

												Stan's baaaaack!You can tell this edition was made with a much larger budget, more refined tools, and a lot of lessons learned from the haphazard first game's remake. It's now a pleasure to play the game and listen to the banter, at least until you hit those infuriating puzzles, instead of a chore of fighting the interface and being let down by speech delays. The beginning of the game in particular is a must-play, chock full of hilarious banter. I wasn't as amused by Guybrush's total amoral sociopathy as his bumbling cluelessness in the first game, but the supporting cast definitely made up for it, especially once Stan shows back up into your life. I just wish he had another cameo near the end!The puzzles this time around do reflect that increased sociopathy; this is not a game made for the faint of heart, and being stuck is a regular occasion, especially since it's such a huge world with so many locations available and so many items in your possession later on. In the end, occasionally hitting the walkthrough kept me from rage-quitting a few times, and some of the answers really made me question the devs' sanity.But it's all part of the package, and what a package it is. Do yourself a favor and snap this up, even if you've played the original through already!			"

												Wow. This game is MUCH better than Monkey Island 1 in every aspect. The story is longer, the artwork is better, the music is better, and they fixed the most annoying thing in Monkey Island 1: the action selection for items. It is so much easier to look, pick up, push, talk, etc on objects now than in the first game. If it wasn't for the fact that this game's story ties to the first one, I'd recommend skipping the first game and just buy this one, but playing the first game gives some context for this one. It even comes with some insightful audio commentary from the designers while you play the game. I think it's hard to make a comedy adventure puzzle game because you want to work jokes into a puzzle that many times causes the puzzle to not be solved logically which makes it incredibly frustrating to the player to figure out. Thank God for walkthroughs.Pros:+ Great artwork+ Great music+ Great voice acting+ The audio commentary was nice+ Great improvement on action selection on objectsCons:- Some puzzles felt quite random/silly making it hard to figure out logically			"

												Monkey Island 2 may be the best point-and-click adventure game ever made, which means likely the best that ever *will* be made. The art (original), music, characters, puzzles, and story are all fantastic, and the ""remake"" is not so bad itself (unlike the sparsely animated and mediocre remake of the first game). If you haven't played this, you should; if you have, why not go back for another spin?The adventure game I helped make, Primordia, contains several elements of homage to the Monkey Island series, but like almost every adventure game made since the mid-90s, Primordia's puzzle design pales in comparison to this masterpiece.  In my opinion, other aspects of point-and-click games have matched the golden age, but puzzles haven't -- they range from the stupidly easy (""accessible""!) to the nonsensical (""just like the old days""!), with the ""best"" being mostly logical but mostly boring.  In particular, modern adventure games lack the complexity of the best older games, and Monkey Island 2 is at the peak of this complexity.The puzzles that make up its first part are a masterpiece of pacing, structure, logic, and fun. What you see is the product of experienced designers with the skill and resources to do things right.  The game is careful to supply motivations for the puzzles before you reach them, using visual cues and map layout to almost subliminally guide the player such that he knows what he wants and can start formulating a plan rather than -- as is often the case -- merely taking everything that isn't nailed down and using every item on every hotspot.The middle of the game is less effective in this regard because it is so open.  This is a trade off to be sure, and there is a good argument that such openness is *also* a hallmark of a great adventure.  But nevertheless it feels like the middle lacked the same care and attention, and many puzzle-chains lack a logical connection or a strong sense of progression toward a goal.  Nevertheless, the middle of the game contains what I think is the finest single point-and-click puzzle (""single"" is a bit of a misnomer because it is in fact multi-part), the spitting contest.  This puzzle weaves together the three main stands of adventure game puzzles (environmental/timing; inventory/combination; and dialogue), and requires several lateral but logical epiphanies.  Other puzzles in the middle are also good, but that one's the best.The game also contains the best finale of any adventure.  Adventures struggle with how to have a suitably difficult puzzle and a showdown with your adversary.  King's Quest V does pretty well in this regard, but most don't.  MI2 nails it with a puzzle that requires you to apply logic from earlier in the game in a novel fashion, while also ""remastering"" the finale of MI1.  And the ending that follows is notorious...Anyway, if you like point-and-click adventures -- either as a player or a designer -- it's an absolute must-play.  And unlike some other games I've recently revisited (e.g., Loom), it turns out that it wasn't nostalgia that made it seem so great.			"

												How do you follow up one of the best adventure games of all time? With one that's almost equally great of course! Monkey Island 2's just as clever, funny, and challenging as the first game, so it's just as enjoyable. This time around the special edition's new voiceovers transfer to the old graphics/sound effects when you toggle them back and forth, though, but that's certainly a good thing. It just doesn't quite ascend to the same height that the original did.			"

												Monkey Island 2 has gone down in history as one of my favorite games of all time. It improves just about everything from the first game in every possible way, a game that was already amazing. The writing is hilarious, the characters are memorable, the artwork is outstanding, the story is phenominal, and it's just a charming game all around. Now, I can't call it perfect -- I think some of the puzzles are a bit too ridiculous and have really cryptic solutions, so expect to have to consult a guide or use the hint system every once in a while.The remake itself, on the other hand, is so-so. The voice acting adds a lot of hilarity to the game, and I love the addition of the audio commentary since I'm a sucker for behind-the-scenes stuff. I also like the new, much easier to use and quick interface. However, the update falters in the visual area. The style of artwork for the backgrounds just does not sit well with me. Something about that watercolor style just does not seem quite right. One thing that provides a double-edged sword, though, is the embedding of the original game within this new edition. With the press of a button, you can instantly switch between the old style and the new updated style whenever you want, making it really fun to go from low to high resolution. Unfortunately, they had to compensate quite a bit to accomodate for this. The animation does NOT translate well to modern graphics, and especially not from 10 to 60 frames per second. What one pixel was many years back is now twenty pixels, and it's incredibly glaring at times. I think Rapp Scalion's animation got treated the worst; his reforming animation was one of the visual highlights of the original, and it's now really choppy. In fact, you barely even see him do the thumbs-up before you leave him for good. Overall, the animation is just way too all over the place for my taste.Still, I can't fault it for what it tried to do. It's a decent remake and I am grateful they went through all this trouble just for us. If you have not played this game yet, go on ahead and give it a try. I fully reccomend it to anyone who is in for a good adventure game.			"

												One of my favourite games ever, and one of the classic LucasArts adventures. Its absolutely fun -- and this remake is even well done. Good voice acting, pretty graphics and great music amplify what is already a superb game. The original version is totally fine even today.			"

												The 2nd game in the series and in my opinion a much funnier and better game than the first.  Also, they've managed to get a bigger budget and better artists for the special edition, the art is much better than the first.  Nostalgia is obviously a huge factor for me, I've switched back and forth a number of time between the original and updated version, I enjoyed the game as much as I did back then, because of it's humor but I understand that these games were designed to sell Walkthroughs back in the 90s when people didn't have access to the internet and bbs systems were a niche thing.

												Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is a great addition to your downloadable library.Here we have one of the best point-and-click adventure games. The story is engaging and hilarious, the characters are all fascinating, the music is catchy and it looks beautiful. The puzzles remain hard but the introduction of a hint system really helps you when you are in trouble and the ability to swap to classic view is a real treat. The added voice acting and how you are now able to use them in the classic view is also a welcome edition.			"

The game is set in a different location from the first and most of the characters are new, therefore you could pick up and play this game without playing the first beforehand.			"

												Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is an excellent remake of the outstanding sequel. Much of the remake work is similar to the first game, though there are more improvements around for an even more refined and polished game. The continued story in the sequel holds up well to the first game, and a nicer remake overall does wonders to making the game experience be a pleasure.Since this game is a direct sequel in terms of story, it is definitely recommended to play the original Secret of Monkey Island first. Gameplay is much the same of point and click adventure games. In Monkey Island 2 SE, there are a few more touches to smoothly play the game. Rather than interacting and having to bring up the entire list of verbs, right clicking brings up all available actions that can be used. This is very useful since some actions canât be used on some objects, and it helps to see all available actions that can elicit a response from Guybrush. Item interaction is also easier, with the game defaulting to certain actions when using them. These two features are especially useful for scenes requiring some quick actions, which appear more often in MI2.  A new hint feature appears in the form of object highlighting. It definitely helps for rooms with many objects, where all the objects in the room are shown by pressing Left Click and Right Click together. Also new is the Direct Control mode, where Guybrush can be controlled directly rather than using click actions. This is definitely useful for controller users who want to sit back on a big TV display. The old Classic mode switching ability is still present, and it also allows players to hear the new voiceovers while using the Classic mode UI. Overall, the same point and click gameplay is in MI2, though things definitely changed up for better navigation and controls to make things more comfortable to use.The same great redone art style is employed throughout the game like in Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition. Overall, the redone artwork is better in MI2, since the first game did have some stiff and not very refined looking artwork. The backgrounds are a touch more fleshed out and look beautiful, and some of the character animations are smoother too. A select few characters use some 3D animation and move smoothly, perhaps a bit too smoothly from the originals. Still, the overall art quality bump in the sequel is great, with rich environments and distinct characters like the first game, but with even better quality.Music plays a big role in the Monkey Island games, and this game still does it well with the remade songs. The sequel has some outstanding music work, much like the first game too. With the gameâs soundtrack sounding great, it is nice to appreciate some of the subtleties of the music as well. Some of the themes are reused in certain areas and at times the current song slowly fades into another song when the room changes. They are very nice small touches that make playing the game feel great when they happen, and the recorded instrumentation is always a nice touch on the original MIDI compositions.The story of Monkey Island 2 continues from the first game, focusing mainly on Guybrush Threepwood and LeChuck. I wonât elaborate on the story much since it does draw from the first game a lot, though I will say I noted that this game is slightly darker and more dramatic than the first game. There are the seriesâ classic funny moments, though there are just some actions the player has to take and some story directions the writers made that makes the tone just slightly different. Itâs a solid Monkey Island game though, with great moments and a well-crafted story for those who played the first game.The remade sequel provides a nice experience, comparably better than the first game in certain parts.  Gameplay is mostly the same, though a few additions to make navigating the game smoother are welcome touches to use. The art is still great to look at, and there are some considerable improvements in quality from the previous game. The music is outstanding as ever, with some subtle transitions and arrangements being employed on the soundtrack for a great listen. Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a remake that stands up to the original game, with well-deserved refinements that make it a blast to play through.			"

												This is the second installment of the Monkey Island saga (remastered edition).The graphics are really well executed & the art style faithfully mirrors what the characters originally looked like (especially the main character).In this version, the portrayal of the protagonist - Guybrush Threepwood - is most definitely my favourite (there's a total of 5 versions of Guybrush).Now onto the gameplay:MI 1 was already a bit of a fuss to play (having to go back & forth a lot of times), but at least you got to travel within 1 isle (at a time) for the most part.MI 2 is very similar, except the fact that more than one island is involved this time and you're expected to hop frequently between places... by ship AND on foot.And because of this, it is very easy to lose track of game progress and the respective objectives.I can't count the times I felt clueless, despite the fact I had a vague idea of what was expected or what I needed to do.Some of the parts developed in an absurd manner and left me feeling confused.So, at some point you might find yourself rushing through (while using the hints system) just to get over the crazy-making island-hopping part ASAP - I know I did!In order to preserve your sanity, you may want to consider using a guide for this, so as to keep the game enjoyable.On a brighter side; the in-game music may help easing the nerves a bit due to it's gentle, calming sound.The characters are just as enticing as they were before (thanks to the fluent & natural voice-acting & exquisite design), and in the end this is what helped me bear some of the more painful moments during gameplay :).

												Verry funny game, you'll want to play through twice just to get all the LOLZ you'll miss from doing a 100% speedrun.  This remaster was well done.If you use a guide and skip all cutscenes you can, you can do a 100% speedrun in just under 2 hours... speed demon cheevo reqs you to complete the game in under 3 hours. (ppl have done speedruns in under 1 hour, but 2 hours is what I did it in, without speed-saving reloads, doing all cheevos in 1 trip, and not having played this game in years.NOTES: Spoilers!!! Good places to save for *LOL* saving time, and notes not covered in Burg's guide (great guide to use!):1.  save @ start of Ch 3 because of hall/panels puzzle.  It's random, look at your spit-encrusted paper for the key. 2.  save before opening the big door after hall/panels puzzle so you can reload after the 5 mins later cheevo. 3.  save before wandering through jungle on Dinky Island so you can wander aimlessly, looking for the phone for the 911 help desk cheevo 4.  after falling into pit with chest, you'll come to a totally black screen.  DON'T PANIC!  Save, and run your cursor over the screen until you find the light switch.  Reload, and move the cursor back to that position. 5.  save @ start of tunnels, bc final ""battle"" is about to start, and you'll want to spend time getting the Helium Inhaler cheevo. 6.  save after you mix the voodoo doll ingredients into the bag in the alley from the original game. Once you go back down and stab the doll, it's all over.  "

												This game is a TOP 10 on my games list!Let me tell you why. First: One of the most enjoyable characters to play as (Guybrush Threepwood). Second: The puzzles are amazing in this game. Without giving too much away, what made the game fun was the fact that you had to move from island to island using things from each to solve puzzles on other islands. Third: Outstanding music! Love pretty much every toon in this game. There is only one part of the game (has to do with the storyline, but the story in general is a good one) that I didn't particularly like from the whole game. That is a pretty impressive feat! I give the game a 9.5/10If you don't take my word for how amazing this is, then look at some of these reviews.http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18643/page20 (Ranked #8 on adventure games of all-time)http://www.pcgamer.com/monkey-island-2-special-edition-review/ (90/100)http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/08/monkey-island-2-special-edition-lechucks-revenge-review (8.9/10)You might be saying to yourself that the graphics are awful because the game was made back in 1991 or that you hate the new graphics because you liked the old school version. Luckily fans of both can play both by hitting F1. Also this Special Edition is a real treat as voice acting is provided for the new and old school art depending on which one you would like to play. The clunky controls that the first Special Edition had are gone with new and improved ones in their place. So don the adventurer's cap and become ""Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!""Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			"

												First off, it's obviously a classic. Buy it.So, to the point of me leaving a review. I had the crash-on-launch error that many others are getting (Windows 10 x64). I tried EVERYTHING to fix it, but now I found a solution that works (for me at least).First, it's definitely caused by a weird GPU issue. I fixed it by deleting the game and then re-installing it afresh. Then I plugged my HDMI cable into my onboard Intel graphics, ran the game for the first time with the fresh install and it loaded up perfectly. Then I closed the game, plugged the HDMI back into my Nvidia GPU, crossed my fingers and launched the game - it worked! I have restarted my PC since and, even several launches later, the game still launches fine on my Nvidia GPU.			"

												iâm so glad LucasArts continued on from their successful remake of the first Monkey Island game to re-make Monkey Island 2. i had even fonder memories of this game from my childhood. and i thought their last re-make was near-perfect. well this re-make is even nearer-perfect!you can still switch to the classic version at ANY point in the game, which is fully awesome, thereâs outstanding voice acting and brilliantly re-recorded music and awesome new hi-res art, but this time around theyâve added the ability to keep the new voices when you switch to classic mode and also the new version has a stylish hotspot soft-highlight function so that you donât miss any interactive areas. the new 2D backgrounds are gorgeous! and the characters are all done in 2D animation also, which is rare these days, but they look GREAT and basically copy the classic movements from the original game SmileAs a direct remake, it does suffer from the less-developed game design of the time, like having its share of illogical puzzles and an oversized inventory (which you can fill even further with items that are never used for anything, making already tricky puzzle-solving even more frustrating). but LucasArts have largely offset these problems by including a mostly-sturdy hint system so that you wonât be frustrated for long.In terms of pure fun-ness to play, it didnât quite match up to my childhood memories, and i did prefer the recent addition to the series âTales of Monkey Islandâ which i only just finished before playing this, but as an updated trip down memory lane, this was all class. i wonder what LucasArts will re-make nextâ¦			"

The solutions for some of the puzzles, while they are creative and hillarious, are sometimes illogical. This illogical solutions could make you stuck in the game for really long time if you don't want to use any hint or walkthrough. To keep the pacing and excitement of the game, I suggest to use the in-game hint system everytime you get stuck. It's better than spending hours (or even days) searching for the solution yourself or using full walkthrough that can ruin the exploring and discovering experience. My only dislike with this game is the story itself, the last 2% of the story is just... badly written. CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			"

												Yes.This is what The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition should have been.  We all know that Monkey Island and MI2 are classic great games for the fun humor and story, but this update actually improves gameplay.  In the first Monkey Island Special Edition, I was constantly switching to Classic Mode because I found the controls easier to use than the clunky update.  MI2's interface makes the gameplay much more fluid with the ""right-click and dial"" feature.Other positives: beautiful artwork, enjoyable voicework, audio commentary, can switch into Classic Mode (if needed).Absolutely worth it, even if you played it way-back-when.

												Much like The Secret of Monkey Island. This is a faithful remake of a classical game. On top of the features such as voice acting - classic to modern swapping - and improved music that the original had. This also features an option narration by the creators of the series. I found the narration to be distracting and often would interfere outright with what would happen in the game making playing the game and enjoying the commentaries and either or choice. If you enjoy adventure games and never played this one you would do yourself a favor of picking it up. If you have played it before you would probably want to secure a permanent place for it in your steam library. And whichever the case supporting the remaking of old time classics when it is done with this level of skill and tact can only benefit the gaming community as more games get remade. You do not need to have played the original game to enjoy this one and in terms of hours of content for money this is probably the better option if you had to make a choice.			"

												I played the original Monkey Island 2 long ago, and loved it then. This remake gave me an excuse to play it again, and it's just as good as back then.Gameplay-wise, it's standard fare for SCUMM engine games: you talk to people, combine stuff with other stuff, give stuff to people, and use all that to solve puzzles. The puzzles could be very head-scratching (especially a particular one towards the end of the game), but for the most part, it was manageable. Being a game focused on humor, some puzzle solutions were absolutely hilarious, once you figured them out. Compared to the original, they really didn't change too much in terms of gameplay, other than changing up the UI a bit so that it's a bit closer to Curse of Monkey Island. What I mean by this is that you have to open up an inventory screen, instead of having it present all the time on the bottom pane, and you click and hold the right mouse button over an object to get a list of options to do with it, instead of having those options always present in the bottom pane like old SCUMM games. It wasn't anything big, but I think it streamlined the gameplay a bit, not forcing you to scroll to the bottom of the screen all the time for actions, though it was annoying to switch to an inventory screen to use items all the time, especially for time-critical puzzles.As expected, the music was redone from its original MIDI format. This works well in some places, but what made the music in orignial Monkey Island 2 really special was the seamless transitions of songs with the iMuse engine. They replicate the transitions here, but I felt that, beyond a couple of tracks (like Woodtick), the transitions in some songs as you went from one area to another in a location are a bit forced, compared to the original. This is a side effect of having pre-recorded songs play, instead of having MIDI play and change instruments/notes dynamically, but that's my only gripe.New from this remake from the original is the voice-acting, which I felt really added to my experience, and really made it worthwhile to play the game again, after going through the orignal so many times before. As with the Secret of Monkey Island remake, you have several of the Curse of Monkey Island cast reprising their roles for recurring characters, like Dominic Armato for Guybrush and Earl Boen as LeChuck, and as always, they do a superb job. Some scenes in the game were actually a lot funnier when delivered with actual voice-acting this time.Also expected from this remake was the overhauled graphics, which made things less pixelated, and added some frames of animations in some areas. However, despite that last bit about added animation frames, the game mostly uses the same number of animation frames as the original, which look really weird with the updated visuals. If you have ever played Street Fighter II: HD Remix, it's a similar to that, where graphics are now HD and more detailed, but the number of frames is the same as the original. It's a bit off-putting, but not too big of a deal. Walking animations for Guybrush and LeChuck have far more frames than the original, though, which looks really nice, but it's just kind of weird to have that where everything else pretty much has the same number of frames as the original game. In fact, in some places in the remake, there are less frames of animation, like with Rapp Scallion's resurrection, which was very well-animated in the original, but was choppy in the remake. I'm unsure why this is, but it bothered me why they did that.Story-wise, this game is nothing that amazing: you're Guybrush Threepwood, a sort of loser pirate that defeated LeChuck last game, but still doesn't get any respect, so you are looking for the famous treasure, Big Whoop. The game relies mostly on humor to keep your attention, and in that regard, it does its job very well. I sometimes just replay parts of the game to go through all dialogue options, as they all typically have very interesting outcomes.The game also includes the original version in it, which you could switch to at any time, like in Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition. It's a nice feature for those who want to play the game in its original form.I'd say this is a definite pick-up for any graphic adventure enthusiast, and especially for fans of the Monkey Island series or LucasArts adventure games.

												I like this game. I normally don't play a lot of point and click adventures but this one has a good sense of humor. And the graphics have been redone quite nicely (too bad the number of frames for animations is still the same which results in awkward looking movements). The fact that you switch between the old graphics and new graphics on-the-fly is an excellent feature. Everyone wins; purists as well as newcomers to the Monkey Island games or genre. Other than that, some of the puzzles are a bit hard but that's because of the new interface most likely. You can't go wrong with this one, mateys !!! Aaarrrr ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												Monkey Island series was the second Point 'n Click Adventure game I played.The first one was a very enjoyable game, but the second one's smarter jokes and funny moments made it to be the best one of the two.If you put all the things ending throws at you all together you will understand how genius it is. Lots of people did not understand fully and was led to dislike the ending, rather confused.When I was playing this game, I didn't plan to play Curse of the Monkey Island, the third installment to the series, anytime soon, but I immediately started playing as the ending was so amazingly crafted. The puzzles do make sense and are sometimes very funny. The dialogues are fantastic and when you finish the game it leaves you the feeling of wanting to go back just to meet the characters of the game again.Unless you are a person who strongly dislikes Point 'n Click Adventure games, you should really check this game out. Highly recommended for everyone.			"

												Pirates of the Caribbean: LucasArts Revenge was working title for the original game.  George Lucas wanted to make game using Disney ride after failing to get compensation for Disney's film The Black Hole, a rip off for Star Wars film.George Lucas very angry man after this.  He manage to get Darth Vadar to get voice job on Lion King.  This way Vadar manage to make obscene messages in stars.  Years before Rescuers film also contain lady showing ankle!  Filth!Disney try to sue Lucas for copyright infringement but Lucas convince judge that ending is the beginning of Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.  Simon the Sorceror later use Presto from same cartoon.Monkey Island 2 game was huge success, despite most people playing game thanks to floppy disk piracy.  Special edition still fun game despite age. Remaster is far better than Secret of Monkey Island remaster.Warning game contain many spoiler for Pirates of the Caribbean, such as when Guybrush dress as Elizabeth Swann.			"

												Monkey Island 2 is not my favorite in the series (it's in fact third, behind 3 and 1). But, before talking about the game within the series, I'd rather talk about the game itself. Here's the points:- Graphics are extremely similar in style to Secret of Monkey Island, both in the Classic and Remake modes. Classic looks super pixelated but otherwise very consistent and pleasing, Remake has gorgeous art but characters have the same issues than with the prequel: ""animations"" consist of two frames alternating, characters look like bobbleheads, they don't look at each other when talking and Guybrush's perpetual half-profile pose is super awkward. Watch a video and decide whether you like it. Background art is very good in both cases, though the Remake mode makes easier to spot certain things that you can interact with. Which is nice.- Gameplay is identical to Secret of Monkey Island and is kept very tight and self-contained for the first part of the game. Then it opens up, letting you hop between three islands. That's not a problem per se, and in fact some of the new additions like a library catalog to peruse are very nice. The big beef I have with MI2 is that a *lot* of times you'll find yourself having to backtrack between locations two or three times, even if you followed a guide step by step. Some puzzles are a bit convoluted, but it's no Discworld.- Music is great. Some songs return, some are new and I have no complaints about neither. I prefer the old MIDI tracks over the newer ones.- New for MI2:SE are achievements and... classic mode with voices! Which means I was able to play it through without having to rip the tracks and running it on Scummvm on the side. I could also use the Hint system, with which I had some experiences where it vaguely pointed me where I had to go (great), told me the solution super patronizingly while not telling me the intermediate step I needed to do first (not so great) or straight up crapped out and told me I had to do something I had already done (opposite of great). Overall it worked mostly well though.Overall Monkey Island 2 is a very well done game that looks, sounds, reads and feels like the first one, with some unfortunate choices regarding backtracking, somewhat more cryptic puzzles and a *really* stupid ending and payoff that Monkey Island 3 would try its hardest to disregard. Nevertheless, it is a better product than MI:SE off the box and definitely better than 4. Still on the Olympus of point and click games, only surpassed by its better LucasArts brethren.8.5/10.			"

Some of the puzzles were so fantastical, you felt cheated.   Overall the game is too slow.  I lost interest towards the end.			"

												I really wanted to like this game; and I did like a lot of things about it. It's very pretty to look at and the music is nice. The characters are distinct and interesting and the dialog is endearing, funny, and delivered well. And the story's not bad...mostly.The reason I don't recommend this game is that it's too hard. By that I mean that a substantial number of the things you have to do to advance the game are completely idiosyncratic. When I have to break down and consult a walk through for a point-and-click game my reaction to learning the solution usually falls into one of three categories:1.) ""Well, I feel stupid for not identifying that obvious and imminently reasonable solution.""2.) ""Oh, that was clever. I bet figuring that out on my own would have been satisfying.""3.) ""F*** you, game. That makes no sense.""About 1/3 through the game, my wife and I broke down and checked a walk through because we had a bazillion inventory items and a half dozen hopelessly stalled leads. The solution was soundly in the ""F*** you"" category. So were the next two solutions that we had to look up shortly thereafter. At that point we threw in the towel and just sailed through the last half of the game with a walkthrough. I have no shame. We're adults and have stuff to do that doesn't involve spending six months rubbing everything on  everything else in an attempt to move the plot forward. Also, the genuinely clever and funny dialog? It gets a lot less funny when it loops 100 times while you're standing on one screen for 15 min clicking on all the things with all the other things. Admittedly, once we just followed a walkthrough, the game wasn't half bad in a visual novel kind of way.So, yeah. I guess I could recommend this game (especially for the $2.49 it is at time of writing) if you are ok with  playing through with substantial help of a walkthrough or are 11 and have months to click on all the things, forever. Or if you're psychic, I guess. Also, I thought the ending was really lame, though that's kind of a taste thing. Personally, if I had slogged my way through this without a walkthrough I would have been mad.			"

												About thalf way through the game my save files reverted back to an older version even though it shows progress percentage at the right amount. I lost items and story progress. Also you need to talk to a certain character but they don't offer the choice to talk unless  you get him zoomed in by clicking a location next to him, which is illogical. Without a walk through the game is impossible unless you have thousands of hours to click literally everything and try every possible combination. I appreciate the humor, graphics, and music but the actual game play is very frustrating when you know the solution but the execution is made ponderous by the game designers.			"

												Unsurprisingly, ""Monkey Island 2 Special Edition"" (MI2) suffers from the same miserable ending that the original 1991 version did.  That ending irritated me to such an extent 23 years ago that it was the only thing I remembered about the game when I replayed it here as the ""Special Edition.""  But, the ending isn't the only problem with the game.  But, wait.  Let's start with the positives:  nicely updated graphics from the original, fewer hunt-the-pixel problems than ""Secret of Monkey Island"" (SoMI) and better interface for verbs and inventory from SoMI.  Unfortunately, the overriding non-ending bad aspect of the game is that most of the puzzles are obscure to the point of not being solvable without hints and cheats.  In SoMI, the puzzles were more in the line of quests and a fairly logical means of pursuing those quests.  In MI2, the puzzles usually consist of randomly looking for things to do in the hopes that there will be some obscure connection to something else you've done or picked up (or will pick up).  Many times I had to go through the hints and scratch my head wondering what the connection was between what I was supposed to do and the process of getting there.  That disconnect and randomness, coupled with the horrible ending just made the game non-fun.  So, unfortunately, I don't recommend it.			"

												Why would anyone review a game that is over 20 years old? Well sonny, pull up a seat around my fireplace. I have something to say about your rose colored glasses of nostalgia; they don't hold up under the bright light of progress. Games like Monkey Island were amazing when they first came to the market. But then people learned how to make them better. By the end of the adventure game era there were games that had character stats. They had divurged so distinctly from their roots that they were dangerously close to becoming something else entirely. They could have very well have gone from that to point-and-click adventure RPGs, but they didn't. Partially because ""THE AWARD WINNING POINT-AND-CLICK-ADVENTURE-ROLE-PLAYING-GAME"" is really not that catchy, but also because it made a lot more sense just to make a genre of games that appealed to a broader audience et al, Diablo. CDs came out and it allowed first person point and click games like 7th Guest and Myst to survive on the growing nostalgia of older players who remembered their childhood. But these developers didn't realize that humor had been the major appeal of adventure games until much later (Psychonauts?), after a glut of super serious adventure games that took most of that humor out of the equation. If you're old enough, and have played adventure games, I bet there's more than a few jokes from these old games you still remember. Remember the name of the final boss in Myst? I thought not!""Hey â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, I thought you were going to review Monkey Island!"" you squawk in your whiny, cracking prepubescent voice. Okay, okay... Monkey Island died long ago. It's humor only funny to folks who like archaic computer programmer humor. It's pixel-hunt-click-the-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-stethescope-combined-with-a-solid-gold-packet-of-gum-on-the-featherless-parakeet-logic no longer fun for anyone because they're already solved it a long time ago, or they don't have 4 hours to spend on one puzzle when there's videos of girls in bikinis french kissing cute kittens on YouTube. (I'm watching one as I write this.)Give this game a pass. Give everything made in this nostalgic vein a pass. Yes, even the new stuff like walking dead. Give your money to developers who are working on the next big idea, not pandering to your inner 13-year-old in some desperate grab to cash in on the IP.Or heck, give it to me. I will spend it on booze.			"

												It's not that often the first sequel outshines the whole game-series, but in the case of the Monkey Island franchise, it is indeed true. With this remastered version, the game is avaiable to those poor souls that did not experience the game when it was first released (like myself), including both the original graphicsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥well as the beautiful graphics of the remastered edition.Highpoints of the game is the charming, weird and utterly hilarious humour it offers. Main character Guybrush Threepwood's interaction with this weird universe is a prime example of comedy done right in video games. The newly added voice acting is also perfect, enhancing the original game with even more personality. Last, but not least, the puzzles are as hard as ever. It takes a lot of your brainpower and wits to come around the obstacles the game throws at you. While some puzzles may seem a bit too random at first glance, there is actually a brilliant meaning behind them.I have nothing bad to say about this game, the gameplay is excellent, the controls are easy to use, the music is excellent, the puzzles are hard, and the humour is top-notch. But make sure that you play both the original game as well as the remastered one.			"

Not only can you play the enhanced version but also, with the press of a single button, the original version.Only small word of criticism is possibly the new inventory system but after a bit of getting used to it works.

Now that I played the remake all the memories came back and I realized, that I enjoyed this version as much as the original.

												Wow! The hardest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing point and click adventure ever! This game was waaaaay too hard. Part of the challenge though comes from being punished for trying random things. There's so many different screens you gotta walk through to get to different locations that I didn't feel like trying every wild idea that came to my mind because it took so long to do everything. Only after cheating did I realize the clues that were being offerred. I gotta say I did like the Monkey Island 1 special edition more and Tales from Monkey Island more than either of the 2D games. What I really like about these special editions, though, is the ability to switch back and forth on the fly between the new souped up graphics and the original primitive ones. It makes me so thankful for the advanced technology we have now. Note: the ending was pure tacked-on rubbish.			"

												This may sound like blasphemy, but to me Monkey Island 2 was a disappointment back in the day. I thought that some of the puzzles were way too obtuse, and I thought the ending was as nonsensical as they come (and I HATE the inclusion of Star Wars references - yes, I know it's LucasArts, but still, you don't need to mention Star Wars in all your products!). This remake surprisingly makes things a bit more bearable - maybe because of the hint system, which alleviates some of the frustrations of the game, or maybe because the voice-overs help to give the characters even more personality. But the newly hand-drawn hi-res graphics are pretty awful - the new artist is nowhere near as good. Still, this remake is recommended, just because it doesn't irritate me like the original once did. 7/10			"

												LeChuck is back! And this time he will bring his ghostly - or not so ghostly now - presence back to the coasts of the Caribbean! This time he's looking for revenge, and Guybrush finds himself in the search of a big and ancient treasure, so valuable and powerful that nobody could find it. Or could they?This time the game will not be set on MeleÃ© Island (TM) but rather in a group of islands from which our Mighty Pirate (TM) will need to do the usual to get to this forgotten treasure and to a legendary island even more difficult to find than Monkey Island (TM)... it was something like Pinky, or Minky, or Dendi, or something like that. An island so ancient it was forgotten by men and pirates throughout the entire Caribbean. Either way, one of the best adventures from Lucasarts has now met Special Edition, which means new voices, remastered music and new art. And for the nostalgic, it still keeps the original layout, with the pixelated graphics and the MIDI music. A pearl in the bottom of the gamer's ocean is now floating in front of your ship, plunder it now!			"

												All of the good design that went into Monkey Island 1, but more of it. This doesn't feel like a cash-in or a retread. It's a great game in it's own right and a fittingly absurd second act in the series. The special edition is as flawless as the remake fo the first game--excellent voice work, lovely art, hot-swapping between classic and special edition, and every detail clearly considered with care.I think this game is stronger than the first in just about every way. It's longer, it's more varied, the puzles are mostly well considered  (though there are a few ridiculously nonsensical stumpers, as seems to be inevitable in this genre), and behind the excellent humorous writing is a little more meat to each character's bones.It's a shame some of the other classics (Grim Fandango?) haven't received the same loving treatment. The quality of the remake is almost as impressive and enjoyable as the game itself. This is how you bring back a classic.			"

Still a brilliant game with amusing conversations, excellent music, and nice graphics - I adore both the old and new visuals. The audio commentary is also worth listening to, some amazing details are revealed about the game by the creators. Monkey Island 2 was one of the games I played a lot in my childhood and helped to cheer me up and develop my English skill. I hope I don't have to wait much for Curse of the Monkey Island SE.			"

Set after the events of finding the secret of Monkey Island, Guybrush Threepwood find himself a near-nameless hero as the Govornor has stolen his glory. You'' make your way around Scabb, Phatt and Booty in search for a buried treasure on an unknown island. You'll learn of the reason behind LeChuck's name and why he and Guybrush will never truly be free of each other, bring people back from the dead and you'll lock Stan in a coffin.I played this game in its classical form, even though the remastered graphics do look very nice. I grew up playing LucasArts adventures, so I prefer the classic looks. It was delightful walking around the environment, chatting to Hernon and everybody in the game. It's a nice, casual experience with no pressures for time - so you can soak all the fun in.Along with the classic looks, the amazing story which is still new to me and the gameplay, you'll find some fairly challenging puzzles which many don't pertain any logical sense. The game doesn't intend to make the puzzles easy, but provided you explore enough, and remember all you can it is a simple experience without the hair-tearing frustrations these types of games gave to gamers in the 90's.I am eagerly waiting now, along with a horde of communities, for the re-release of the final chapter of the Monkey Island trilogy. I may fire up SCUMMVM for this yet, but I'm all in favor of breathing life into these old classic - especially the LucasArts classics.I definitely recommend this game, it'll make you think, laugh, and you'll have a great experience it all around - provided you don't mind something a little slower than Quake or COD - as examples. It's cheap and great value so go and get it!			"

												This game so crazy... Seriously, I love it!This game might be the funniest part of the series. Its humor is unexplainably crazy, I don't know what else to say.The special edition makes it even better. They've given much detail to the original environment! Every single pixel fits to its drawn line of the special edition.The riddles are not too hard and not too easy, but without help you might find yourself lost in some parts of the games. But it wouldn't be Monkey Island then, so it's great!This is a good and worthy sequel to the first game. Totally worth it's money, very funny addition to your library. A must have!			"

I couldn't read one of four books, which I had taken from the library by looking at it. I needed to return the book to the library and take the same book again and then could be able to ""look at"" it and get info from the book I needed. And in LeChuck's fortress in an episode with Guybrush and Wally beign hung all the controls suddenly disappeared... =/ And I couldn't continue playing.			"

With a superb updating of the original graphics, a lush re-recorded soundtrack and great voice acting plus additional developer commentary, Monkey 2 SE is nothing short of the best thing LucasArts have done since Grim Fandango in 1998.

												In all it's mystery, it's still just as funny now, even though it has a new soundtrack. Monkey Island ended on such a great final note, I was surprised there was a sequel, but not surprised that it was this good.I still love Monkey Island and it's still just as confounding, humourous, and fun in this sequel. It's still a point-and-click adventure with a great (not for sale) soundtrack, quirky characters and ironic settings. Everything is there to love, even the confouding unanswered ending that begs a sequel which has yet to come, making it one of gaming's greatest mysteries. If you haven't played either of these games in the decades they've been out, they are definitely worth your time.			"

												An old point and click adventure remastered for the modern consumer this is a must have for point and click gamers! Made during the time of LucasArts golden age of point and click adventures. Full of dry wit and humour the game doesn't get old. Can be easily completed in just one sitting doesn't mean that this should be overlooked. Indeed the puzzles were inventive and at times a challenge, while still being a lot of fun. The remastered edition improves graphics, music score and voice acting (which is done well). At any point in the game you can go into classic mode as well! If you ever played the likes of Myst or the Indiana Jones games you're going to enjoy this.			"

												I found the sequel to the classic Monkey Island to be an enjoyable playthrough for the quirky story, genuine laughs, loveable main characters, and, of course... the nostalgia of playing this game in my youth.However, some of the game's puzzles and progression make absolutely zero logical sense and ultimately leave you frustrated or completely stuck until you consult a guide. It often feels as if the game was intentionally designed to be confusing (but don't worry - your hint is just a 1-900 call away on the old school Lucasarts game hint line). Thankfully, these days we have the internet and don't have to rely on expensive phone tip lines, so I found myself looking up hints on google when I was stuck, and then realized I never ever would have figured some of the puzzles out on my own due to how obscure or downright unintuitive they are. Most of the solutions make no sense whatsoever and are random 'use X on Y combinations in Z order' or 'do X and Y and Z within a short time frame' with no foreshadowing hints or other logical normal reasoning behind them.Surprisingly, even with these faults (which have to be forgiven somewhat since the core game itself is over 20 years old), MI2 is still a fun graphic adventure game to play through if you enjoy the Lucasarts point-and-click games of yesteryear and want a trip down memory lane with this remake that includes improved graphics, a slick UI, and pretty decent voice acting. The story, characters, and humor will charm you and put a smile on your face. This is definitely an enjoyable game that was made with a lot of love. Just keep a guide handy for when you get stuck, as that's how the game was obviously intended to be originally played when it first came out back in 1991. My Rating: 7.5/10			"

												Humorous, challenging, and worthy sequel to a great game. The controls feel much improved, and as with the special edition of the first one, the graphics can be switched between the nice hand-drawn style and the old school pixelized with the press of an F key.2 minor gripes with this game - as mentioned with the special edition of the first game, the hint system was just too tempting to use particularly with my second issue - sooooo much back and forth.There are multiple puzzles where once you find a puzzle you have to go to an completely different island for 1 item or to talk to 1 person and then immediately go back. And most of the time there isn't really some foreshadowing or clue as to where to find what you need for that particular puzzle. Or it might not even really be a puzzle, it might just say I need this, and you're like ok that's obviously at this place, but you still have to waste all the time traveling. Some back and forth isn't bad but at times it feels like cheap padding to make the game slightly longer.One big complaint - I thought the ending was really, really, stupid. If you've played the 3rd game it doesn't seem so bad but it mightâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥you off if you can't find the 3rd game because the ending scene is sooooo dumb and very out of context with the rest of the game.Hopefully they release a special editon of the third game :)Overall though, it is exactly what it should be: an entertaining point and click adventure, and a great sequel.

I like the upgrade in visual and I also played it old school as I first played it. some things even change so you can see some reward in playing both styles. I never got tired of this franchise sense of humor and Guybrush is one of the best characters I know. Also the commentary is good sometime hilarous, sometimes informative my only suggestion si that they could add more comments! HAHAHA. Anyway I enjoy it and will still every time I play this and the others titles of this serie (the only one I didnt play or purchase is monkey4).Please do the monkey 3 special edition and I ll buy it.

												The original game is VERY old, so a lot of these things probably need not be said, as the internet is full of reviews already. It's the weakest Monkey Island in my opinion, but the jokes and characters are solid even if the puzzles and plot are convoluted. Even for someone who has played it multiple times (like me), a lot of the puzzles are frustrating and needlessly so. The ending of the game is so bizarre that it's no wonder they sort of gloss over it at the beginning of Monkey Island 3 and pretend it didn't really happen. However, IF you are a fan of the Monkey Island games, and IF you want to play this one, the Special Edition is the way to go. Not that I've got anything against pixelated games (I thrive on old LucasArts ones), but the art is great. Unlike the first Monkey Island Special edition (which had Guybrush with the most hideous hair imaginable), all the characters are well-designed, the remastered music is excellent, and the dialogue is 100% worth it. (Dominic Armato is a GOD.) In general, if you're into adventure games, it is probably worth it to give this one a try, but take with it the caveat that Secret of Monkey Island (MI1), Curse of Monkey Island (MI3) and Telltales' Tales of Monkey Ilsnad (MI5) are all much better candidates. But if you're a completionist or a Monkey Island fan, you would be remiss in not purchasing the Special edition.			"

It's also extremely hard and complicated, but you can always use hints if you are stuck, which is a nice addition to the remastered version. To be absolutely honest, I prefer the first one, but LeChuck's Revenge is also a must-play. Oh, and the commentary by the original developers is very interesting. Don't worry, there aren't any spoilers in the commentary so be sure to check it even if you are playing the game for the first time.			"

The artwork is beautiful and it's great to hear the voice of Dominic Armato as Guybrush. He's the perfect voice for Guybrush. Hearing him say Guybrush's lines actually improves the tone of the game and make it more comedic. I would recommend this game for people who have played the other games, and want the nostalgia. Otherwise it's easily skippable.			"

The fact that you can also choose to play the game in its old retro mode was really cool, but that might be because I'm a fan of the Monkey Island franchise though and enjoyed playing these games as I grew up.

But, the evil guy Largo LeGrand (the ruler of Scabb Island) has found a way to return LeChuck to life. Now, if Guybrush won't find ""Big Whoop"" before LeChuck, the world gonna destroy.So, Monkey 2 is a nice game.

												Wow! The hardest â¥â¥â¥â¥ing point and click adventure ever! This game was waaaaay too hard. Part of the challenge though comes from being punished for trying random things. There's so many different screens you gotta walk through to get to different locations that I didn't feel like trying every wild idea that came to my mind because it took so long to do everything. Only after cheating did I realize the clues that were being offerred. I gotta say I did like the Monkey Island 1 special edition more and Tales from Monkey Island more than either of the 2D games. What I really like about these special editions, though, is the ability to switch back and forth on the fly between the new souped up graphics and the original primitive ones. It makes me so thankful for the advanced technology we have now. Note: the ending was pure tacked-on rubbish.			"

												This may sound like blasphemy, but to me Monkey Island 2 was a disappointment back in the day. I thought that some of the puzzles were way too obtuse, and I thought the ending was as nonsensical as they come (and I HATE the inclusion of Star Wars references - yes, I know it's LucasArts, but still, you don't need to mention Star Wars in all your products!). This remake surprisingly makes things a bit more bearable - maybe because of the hint system, which alleviates some of the frustrations of the game, or maybe because the voice-overs help to give the characters even more personality. But the newly hand-drawn hi-res graphics are pretty awful - the new artist is nowhere near as good. Still, this remake is recommended, just because it doesn't irritate me like the original once did. 7/10			"

												I found this game to be much better than the original monkey island game. The ending is well worth it. But the game can be long only if you feel like your running everyonewhere only to find that what you needed was where you just left. Just have patience, an open mind, and a sense of humor and you'll like this game a lot. I loved it.			"

												This was an interesting attempt to revive a LucasArts classic, with beautiful graphics and easier gameplay with predefined point-&-click actions.Pros: Well remastered graphics. Good overall experience. You can switch to the classic look any time (English only). It's Monkey Island.Cons: Can't skip some sequences or scenes. Some voices are dull or monotonous, or might be a voice acting issue. Not so bad thou. I found an annoying issue with the books at the library, at least in the spanish version; the translation makes the titles change but they won't be re-ordered, so it can be a little confusing.With that said, I still prefer the classic version.

												One of the best point-and-click adventure games I have ever played, it has a good story, good artstyle, and puzzels that will make you think outside of the box.The only downside that I can think of is that the game can be REALLY long if don't know what you're doing, and even if you did, it would still take a lenghty time to beat, but you'll never get bored or tired of the game, so don't worry.Now go and play it!

												This is one of the best adventure games of all times, the humor is incredibly great, the characters and story are very well written... it has pirates in it.Seriously though, from all the Monkey Island games this one is the best, It's one of those games I play at least once every year and is still great.The original game is really great and it was my first adventure game back in the day, but I found the Special Edition to be quite cool if not more than the old one, the cursor commands have been improved quite a lot since the Monkey island 1 special edition and the art was much better reinterpreted than the previous special edition as well which makes it even more satisfying to play with.My only gripe towards the Special Edition would be with the ""skeleton song"", I was expecting it to be a more ethereal sounding catchy fun instead of the ear drilling terribly voiced tasteless thing they came up with.
