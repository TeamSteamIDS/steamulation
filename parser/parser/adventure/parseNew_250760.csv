												I've kickstarted this game the very second I saw it and I was not let down.This game really brings back the memories of how games were when you and I was only children. The nostalgic ""8/16 bit"" look makes you think of the old NES/SNES and MSDOS days when you sat up hours straight because you could not save or you just could not stop (just one more level). This has all that and more. Remember the annoying sounds and music that some games had due to the very primitive soundboard. Well forget about that with Shovelknight because the music is just beyond awesome. Everything about it screams well done, and there is also a person in the very first town that you can talk to if you want to change the music in case you find it repeatative. Just gather more notepages and he can play more songs.This game is filled with hidden treasure, fun jokes, awesome characters (a horse in a dress!), lovely artwork, great enemies and very well done boss fights. The game is like a combination of Duck Tales, Super Mario, Mega Man, Faxanadu and many more epic titles + more. If you are looking for anything to tickle the old nostalgic nerve this is the game for you. Even thou I have tried words can't describe how awesome this game is. Try it for yourself. You won't regret it.TL;DR  10/10 this game is awesome go buy it!			"

												I cannot recommend Shovel Knight enough because it fails at being bad so hard. You might as well grab 15€ from your wallet and burn it if you are a fool. You will get no joy from this if you don't have what it takes, you little piece of garbage. I don't want to go anywhere near this game if I don't have enough time to sit back and properly enjoy it again. I assure you that you will feel the same. The 8-bit music will drive you insane with nostalgia, the controls are disgustingly good, especially if you have a decent controller, the art looks like it was made by an 8-year-old prodigy genius blessed by angels. All in all, I rate this game 1 if we're using a simplistic binary rating system where 1 means 'recommend', and 0 means 'do not recommend'. Buy Shovel Knight if you are a sucker for games that are good.			"

												Shovel Knight is a 2D side scroller platforming game - it was developed and published by indie games developer Yacht Club Games in June 2014. The game was initially released on PC, 3DS and WiiU and then later ported to PS3, PS4, Xbox One and the Vita in early 2015 - it has also made it's way onto the Amazon Fire TV platform too. GameplayYou play the role of an anonymous character, as you collect treasure in this 2D world. Your characters main attack is, you guessed it, his shovel which has various uses throughout the game, the main one is being used to hit enemies around the head with. You can also use the shovel to dig up treasures hidden in dirt found around each level.  The shovel also comes into the platforming side quite a bit too, you can use it to jump on top of other enemies to bounce up to higher points in order to reach harder to reach areas for extra treasure.  I especially liked the way the game handles death, each time you die, you will drop three sacks of treasure, which deduct off you total - when retrying the level, the three sacks remain where you died allowing you to pick them up again, this of course leads to some interesting gameplay elements when you die in a pit of emptiness or other areas where it is impossible to get to without dying again.  Throughout the game you also encounter various traders which will let you spend your hard earned treasure to upgrade your character with other secondary abilities, whilst these are not always needed in order to progress in the game, they certainly make it a lot easier - the upgrades can consist of health upgrades or extra items.Each level also has an end boss to it; plotting you against some classic NES boss fights, requiring a degree of platforming and classic hack and slash moments. The boss fights are well really done and each has their own unique battle style. GraphicsThe graphics in Shovel Knight are some of the best 8 bit style graphics I have seen. We are seeing this graphic style becoming ever popular on Steam, and it's nice to see a game put so much extra care into producing a well made looking product. Each of the levels are colorful and full of vibrant colours, the animation on all of the monsters and NPCs are really nicely put together as well. This game really will give you a nostalgia hit if you are an older gamer. Audio/SoundtrackThe audio and soundtrack in Shovel Knight is just amazing - so much so that it was released for individual purchase on release of the game. The soundtrack was worked on the gentlemen who also worked on the Mega Man theme tune too. This is another aspect of the game that will really give you flash backs to your childhood if you played on the NES/SNES. DifficultyI found this game to be particularly difficult - again this is down to the platforming side of it because I am god awful at the genre, but the boss scenes are also sufficiently challenging as well. You have to work out the bosses attack patterns in order for you to take as little damage as possible because sometimes, some of their attacks are unavoidable so damage is inevitable. The platforming side has some hard moments in too, whether it be the levels where you have to navigate across floating platforms in complete darkness with only a few glimpses of light from lightning storms to see where you are going. The difficulty is nicely paced and doesn't ramp up too quickly, allowing you to get to grips with the gameplay before throwing you in against the really difficult stuff. Level DesignEach of the levels in Shovel Knight are really well set out. Each level has its own theme and its own style of enemy to fight against. Throughout each level there are plenty of opportunities to show off your platforming skills for reaching difficult to reach ledges and navigating moving platforms over pits of darkness just to get that one health upgrade! Along with the the abundance of treasure to find in each level either by just killing enemies, you will also find mounds of dirt on the ground and up walls which lets you put your shovel to work, these normally result in thousands of treasure coming out so keep and eye out for them.  Along each level, you will come across a number of checkpoints, these checkpoints can either be used as just that, or you can destroy them, rewarding you with even more treasure, but renders the checkpoint useless, so this should only be used when you don't mind having an awful lot of backtracking to do if you die. I made the mistake of doing this twice on two checkpoints without knowing the consequences and I thoroughly regretted it when I realized what I had done, especially when it was the last two checkpoints before the boss. Game Length and Replay-abilityA full playthrough of Shovel Knight took me just around ten hours to complete - I thought it was a very good length game for it's price, and upon completion the game, you also unlock the ""New Game+"" mode which is something I really look for in any sort of game like this, so it was nice to see. I actually thought this would of been a nice game to incorporate local co-op in someway, but sadly there isn't any element of multiplayer. With the extra game mode, you could easily put about twenty hours into this game, something you don't very often see from Indie titles. Technical IssuesWith Shovel Knight being a 2D experience, the graphically options are very limited, however you can play the game at full resolutions all the way up to 4k, granted it doesn't make that much a difference on the appearance side of things, but it's nice to see it being supported. With full controller support, you should really be taking advantage of that, as with all platforming games - I tried playing with the keyboard and it was just a train wreck trying to get through the platforming...ConclusionTo sum up, Shovel Knight is a game that will be welcome in 99% of people's library, even if you didn't experience the games on the NES/SNES, you will still get a huge amount of enjoyment out of this game. The graphics are gorgeous, and soundtrack just rounds off this game to be an almost masterpiece. I can't think of anything negative to say about the game. For the price of £10,99, this is an absolute must buy for any gamer out there.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots. For my full review, please visit Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]CAN YOU DIG IT, SUCKA?I'm sorry. I had to.This is the best Megaman game that's been made in nearly 2 decades.This game is a very very high-quality tribute to the games were popular during the late 80's/early 90's. The influences are obvious - The character itself, the level design, boss fights, graphical style and music are very reminiscent of the early Megaman games. The level selection pays tribute to the slightly-less-than-linear level select screen of Super Mario Bros. 3, where there is a general direction of progression, but you may be given the opportunity to stray from the path at times. The shovel jump mechanics are a less-than-subtle throwback to the pogo stick in Ducktales. Most importantly, however, is that the controls are both simple and responsive. If you miss a jump, it'll always because you missed the jump, rather than the game itself boning you. As with most 2D platformers on PC, I would strongly recommend a controller (with the Xbox 360 controller being the standard).The difficulty of this game is often spoken about. The game is fairly difficult, but I do have to stress that this game is NOT Nintendo difficult. The difference is mainly that although Shovel Knight does have challenging sections, there is rarely a point in the game that is strictly unfair. Most of the time when you die, it'll be more of a ""dammit, I messed up"" than a ""this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" type of thing. Furthermore, unlike many NES games of old, there is no limit to the number of lives you have. Instead, dying causes you to lose a portion of the gold you've collected, which gets left at the point at which you died. You then spawn at the latest checkpoint and have an opportunity to obtain the money that you dropped. This means that there are rarely any parts of the game that require extensive replaying of the same areas over and over again. Seasoned platform gamers (for which this game is most likely targeted at) will probably get through this game without too much of a struggle. Newer gamers however are likely to get stuck and potentially frustrated at various segments of the game. With that said, regardless of how difficult you may find the game, each level you complete will feel like an accomplishment. As previously mentioned, both the graphics and the music in the game are very much influenced by game such as Megaman. The graphics are, in a sense, ""beautifully ugly"", in that it is an 8-bit style game done in high resolution. The music is more or less the type of chiptune that you'd expect from a game like this. It's catchy, yes, although I found the music less memorable than the NES titles that inspired this game. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good NES-style 2D platformer. Yes, the price of this is currently relatively steep for an indie game (as it has never been bundled or, to my knowledge, gone on special for any significant amount to this date). With that said, as PC gamers, we are spoilt for choice. We live in an age where, on Steam, and with the overabundance of bundled games, we are able to get decent-quality games for very cheap. From a value-for-money point of view, I would recommend getting much cheaper-but-high-quality 2D platformers such as Super Meat Boy, Limbo, Braid, Spelunky and a host of other games well before you got this one. However, if you're like me and time is a considerably more limiting factor than money, then Shovel Knight is the best value.In other words, I strongly believe that Shovel Knight is the best 2D platformer currently on Steam, bar none.

A game which people will write love letters about.A fantastic work of art which takes you back to the 'golden age' of gaming.Simply a must buy.Developer: Yacht Club GamesPublisher: Yacht Club GamesRelease Date: 26th June, 2014Kickstarter is something really fantastic isn’t it? I can’t count how many times it has given us good games. Not to mention that those games wouldn’t have never seen the light of day if it wasn’t for Kickstarter and all of the Backers. Just another reason to thank those Backers.Shovel Knight is like a dream come true. It looks, feels and plays itself like a game from the, how I like to call it, golden age of gaming. The NES/SNES Age. Actually I’d go as far as to say it’s a love letter to the genre itself … just like Axiom Verge.Or no I’d even go as far as to say that Shovel Knight is a game people write love letters about.It’s beautiful. It’s magic. It’s so much more.Now let’s get into it shall we?StoryYou slip into the role of the one and only Shovel Knight. A Knight wielding a Shovel as his weapon. Sounds crazy right? You’re on a journey with Shield Knight as you stumble upon the Tower of Fate. Inside both Knights find an amulet, a cursed one, and Shovel Knight passes out. Upon awakening Shield Knight is nowhere to be found. Thus, he starts to live a depressing life in solitude up until the day on which the Evil Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter show themselves to take over the land.Will Shovel Knight take up his Shovel and face evil? Or will he continue to live his life in solitude and forget about Shield Knight?Well that’s as much as I’m going to spoil the story for you.AtmosphereOh where do I begin? The sound, the look, the feel, the gameplay … a perfect harmony. There’s not one point which I could point at and say ’You don’t fit in here! Begone fiend!’. Really everything works together.If you grew up with the NES/SNES or games like this you’re also struck by Nostalgia. The game certainly has it’s charm, not only for veteran players, but for new players as well. There’s so much love and detail in every character and level that you just happen to fall in love with the game.But don’t get me wrong. Shovel Knight knows exactly when to be cool and stay old-school and when to be hip and defer to a more modern approach. The larger sprites and the variety of colours is something you wouldn’t be able to find and enjoy on a NES/SNES. That’s one advantage of being able to develop and play a Retro game like this on the PC.I grew up in the 90’s and let me just say that back in the day this game would have been acknowledged like a work of art. The way enemies behave, the more than fitting and catchy tune of each level and not to mention the boss fights … It just takes you way back in time and you just remember games like Mario, Mega Man or Castlevania.GameplayPretty straight forward. In the beginning it’s you and your Shovel vs the World. You can jump, of course, and you do have two different kinds of attacks. By pressing the Attack Button you, obviously, attack and by jumping and pressing down you perform a drop attack. But wait there’s more!After some time, and collections some treasure, you’ll be able to buy Magic which helps you to defeat enemies or even a Fishing Route, which you can use on specific places for some treasure.That’s actually pretty much it there’s to say about the gameplay. The game’s really pretty straight forward just like the games used to be back in the day. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to learn or that the game is for babies. Au contraire mon frere! You’ll have to learn and memorize the movement and attack pattern of the enemies in order to slay’em.VisualsWhile I might have talked ‘bout it earlier let me again get into it.The game’s a work of Art. It looks beautiful and it’s a perfectly example that pixel games aren’t dead and should never die!There’s just something else ‘bout games with such a retro feel and look. Especially nowadays where everyone’s focusing on making their games as real and photorealistic as possible.While this isn’t a bad thing per se … I feel like even if you don’t like games with an art style likeShovel Knight you’re missing out on so much by default. Play the game. But don’t only play it. Feel it. Embrace it. Get lost in it. There’s so much love and detail in every character and in every level that I can’t describe how important it is to just play and enjoy it.CheatsThe game does feature several cheats. One where you start at the last level, or with a specific Armor and whatnot. Keep in mind that if you use cheats of any kind that you'll be unable to unlock any achievements so using a cheat code is just for people who want to rock the game in a fancy way.You can even increase the challenge with said cheats if you want.The most known cheat would be the so called Butt Mode. Stop the giggeling!Okay it actually is rather funny. Here's what it does. It replaces recurring nouns in the game with the word Butt. So if you want to feel like a 12 year old again or just want to have a laugh every now and then this is the right cheat for you.I won't list any more cheats tho since they're easily found on numerous sites.What else can I say?To be honest with you folks … I could say so much more about the game but I believe I’ve made my point. That point would be:Buy it. Play it. Feel it Love it. Enjoy it.The game is worth every penny and if you happen to see it on sale go ahead and buy it on the spot. It’s a game which deserves your money. It gives you so much back in return.It’s seriously a game which you either end up loving or writing love letters about.			"

Video review embedded below.Shovel Knight is quite possibly the best faux-NES game I've ever played.It's an homage to 8-bit glory, in love with the past but never constrained by it, taking everything that was ever great about the era and bringing it together with a modern design insight. There's a purity driving the experience, distilling the essence of classic 2D platformers without sacrificing depth or refinement, continually asking you to reevaluated your expectations as it pours out an abundance of creativity. It gave me something I already loved and then found ways to make it better, as I made my way through with a stupid grin on my face like I was rediscovering games again for the first time.There's this fundamental mechanical understanding at the heart of Shovel Knight that forms the invisible glue holding it all together. Every platform, enemy, and secret area is tuned so perfectly to how the game plays that playing it feels almost instinctual, like you knew before even picking up the controller exactly how everything works. And that's likely in large part do to how much Shovel Knight borrows from the games that built the genre it resides in, but there's never a feeling that it's ripping anything off. It's entirely its own creation, with its own quirks and strategies, but playing it is so natural and fluid that it feels like an old friend that's been hiding all these years.Shovel Knight's understandable nature shouldn't be mistaken for simplicity, as the burden has simply been shifted from interfacing with the game to relentless level designs and boss fights. Progression always feels earned and satisfying, be it a treasure chest at the end, a tricky enemy, or just managing to clear a difficult platform sequence. But Shovel Knight also never falls into the realm of being unfair. Its rules are plainly laid out and death is simply another learning experience, as you figure out new ways to tackle a situation. No matter how many times I died it never seemed as if the game was cheating me, and I always wanted to rush immediately back in to try it again.Where so many 8-bit games require root memorization and perfect execution, Shovel Knight doesn't want to waste your time or break your abilities; it wants to teach you how to play better. Success is rewarded and brings with it new challenges such as destroying checkpoints for a bigger reward, or secret areas you couldn't access or weren't aware were there before. It made me want to seek out everything there was to see, to take on the biggest challenge to discover new tools and places, and never failed to have something cool to show me at the end.Playing Shovel Knight was probably one of the more nostalgic experiences I've ever had with a game. It reintroduced me to that raw joy and excitement I had when I first started playing games as a child, but without the memory shattering disappointment that so often comes with revisiting the things I used to love. It stands on its own as a brilliantly executed creation without dismissing that which came before it, familiar yet completely inspired and so unbelievably fun with every swing of your shovel; the sort of game I feel compelled to tell others about and all but force them to play in the hopes they experience what I did from the very first screen.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]

												""Shovel Knight."" I think it is safe to say this is one of the most hotly anticipated indie titles coming out this year... I'm trying to figure out how Yacht Club Games did it. Did they boil a vat of nostalgia stew using ""Dark Souls"" bones for flavoring; a stew Carl Weathers and Samwise Gamgee themselves would be proud of? No. Did they lock ""Dark Souls"" and ""DuckTales"" in a candlelit room with Barry White blasting? Maybe. However they have done it, they did it. The crazy ♥♥♥♥ers did it. They made a fun game, an homage to why we started gaming in the first place. This is not the greatest game in the world, no. It is simply a tribute. A great tribute nonetheless.It is a simple premise: Shovel Knight and his warrior BFF Shield Knight got their pixelated butts whooped.  Shield Knight is MIA and Shovel Knight took an early retirement. But now a new and evil force is out in numbers - the Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter. Shovel Knight heads out on one last quest, to restore goodness to the land. You travel from level to level, dispatching enemies and platforming very similarly to ""Ducktales,"" complete with treasure collecting and atypical weapon use. You have two attacks (along with some magics) to deal a variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and tactics. It is deceptively challenging. Not ""tear your hair out and sacrifice your firstborn"" challenging, but a fun challenge. There are secrets to find as well, so keep an eye out for things that look out of place.The levels are wonderful... each one is unique and beautiful to boot. I am getting tired of pixel games, honestly. All these RPG Maker games... hideous and same-y. But ""Shovel Knight"" is gorgeous. It reminds me why pixel-style art made a comeback in the first place. Everything flows and you'll find yourself taking dumb damage because you are busy staring at the background and stages.The gameplay,charming story, and excellent levels are great but the soundtrack, to me, is the star. I equate the ""Shovel Knight"" soundtrack to that of the ""Halo"" soundtrack. It is integral. It is inspired. It is catchy as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the boss fights. Amazing. Think ""Dark Souls."" Every boss has his or her own special style, one that you have to master. Expect a challenge.This game is cute. It has heart. And it wears its influences on its sleeves, from the bonfire checkpoints to the treasure chest brimming with pixelated treasure. ""Shovel Knight"" is not a risky game; it is not doing anything new. It is doing something tried and true. But it does it honestly and with its own unique charm. ""Shovel Knight"" is a blast.			"

												Looking for another fake retro game by lazy developers cashing in on oversaturated trends? One with immature memes, pointless obscure NES references, low-effort pixel graphics, and trial-and-error difficulty that'll make you pull your hair out? Good, then look at literally everywhere else, and stay away from Shovel Knight.Unlike the useless piles of Super Meat Boy clones and the uninspired puzzle platformers, this game does something that nobody has thought of before: it shows us the reasons we love retro gaming by removing all the things we hated about it. Take out the punishing difficulty, unintuitive physics, blinding-speed reaction times, tedious grinding, and ridiculously stressful objectives, and it turns out, yes, there’s still something left to love about the old games beyond masochism and nostalgia, something that was lost over the ages. Difficulty is not hard, but not easy; it's about just at the right level to feel satisfying when skill takes over. The controls and jump arc are simply perfect. There are tons of secret tricks that aren't explained, but will make you feel smart when you discover them yourself. Tough challenges become simple if you find clever ways to use your items. Graphics use the retro color palettes to great effect and can only be described as sweet, shiny eye candy, nothing like  the crappy MSPaint doodles you'll see in other pixel games. It's got powerful, energetic chiptune music that doesn't always make sense, but is catchy and gets you pumped to play -- every track is like some offspring of the Wily fortress music from Mega Man 2 and Castlevania 2's Bloody Tears. You can wreck enemies with the Downstab from Zelda 2, the Deluge from Faxanadu, the microphone from Kirby's Adventure, or even a fishing rod -- or sneak past them with invincibility, if you've got magic power to spare. Best of all, the challenges are rewarding and simply a joy to play from beginning to end -- you'll never feel afraid of what the game has in store for you, you'll just want to see more. And even if you die, you can even get your stuff back if you dare to try again.Believe the hype. As of now, I consider Shovel Knight the best fake retro game of all time. If you don't get why the retro fad is even happening in the first place, how so many gamers could possibly have such blind nostalgia for such old, technically inferior games with chiptunes and pixel graphics, this game might just show you why we all love retro gaming and why it will never go away. A rare 10/10!			"

That moment when people actually know what ""retro inspired"" means! There is no reason not to try Shovel Knight, no matter if you like or dislike the old-school games. Quality is timeless.Shovel Knight is, to put it bluntly, simply excellent. It oozes with a deep understanding of what made the games of old so memorable, but it also understands why they were frustrating and what was wrong. Taking from the first pile on fixing the second one is what the devs did, and boy is it fun!The game is a classic platformer. ""Classic"" means that the levels are relatively short, but each and every single one is crafted of unique parts, introducing a gallery of stage-specific enemies, mechanics and hazards. No two screens are the same, and every segment you will find yourself shovelling through features a new trick or a more intense version of the one you already saw. The latter bit is very important: the devs don't just throw brand new stuff at the player mindlessly, they introduce mechanics in a sensibly ""easy"" (for a given stage) situation, then re-use the element in harder, more devious deathtraps. And then combine them, because if there is something that old-school games did well, it was appealing to our masochistic tendencies.Now, I might just be bad at games, but Shovel Knight is difficult. Difficult in all the right ways, mind you. The controls never betray you, they are consistent and snappy. There is more than enough customisation to make the game respond to your preferred way of controlling, so you will never fight the game. Kudos for featuring the control scheme doable on NES gamepads, but still allowing monkeys like me to bind Relics to a separate key.The difficulty comes from the need to figure out the proper approach and then execute it. Sometimes, the player will be expected to take advantage of some more nuanced mechanics, prominently down-slash cancelling through activation of a Relic. The tricks can be learned throughout the game and usually, you can make your way through things without them, albeit at a cost of your health or gold.Gold is what, in my view, fixes the frustration of the old games. There is no life counter of any sorts. You die, you drop gold that will hover in the air; if you can make it from the checkpoint to the place where you met your end, there is a chance to recover your hard-earned coin. If you find yourself dying again prior to that, however... well, the old bags will disappear for good and new ones will spawn. Quitting the stage will reset your possessions, so you can attempt the level as many times as you want, losing nothing. It is a fair system and I found myself learning the levels slowly over many, many tries.One word about the audio-visual side, as everybody probably saw it from trailers already but it needs to be said: phenomenal. The tunes are catchy, fit the environments and moods of every stage and fight. Accompanied by a very well done pixel art that clings to a style fitting the entirety of an adventure, it enhances an already great experience into something truly fantastic.Also, the makers are releasing free updates with new adventures featuring different characters. That's just a cherry on the very top.			"

												Shovel Knight.Initially, there was a single campaign, now named Shovel of Hope.Then came Plague of Shadows, allowing you to play an alternate story from the viewpoint of one of the game's bosses, with completely rewritten story, dialogue, and even some entirely new stage segments alongside the game poking fun at itself (the powerful Relics you'd find as Shovel Knight? Useless trinkets you trade away to the very merchant you buy these from in Shovel of Hope.)Then came Specter of Torment, upgrading all owners of Shovel Knight to Treasure Trove including all three campaigns, local co-op, and - which I believe is a nice touch, as the lack of female combatants in the Order of No Quarter personally somewhat bugged me - a gender swapping mod, allowing you to pick a gender for each character.Female Shovel Knight except that everyone assumes (and talk to her as if) she is male because of that god damn helmet you never see come off? Sure. Body: Female, Text: Male. Done.And now we're getting yet another campaign for King Knight, co-op for the other campaigns, a four-player battle mode - all for free!And those who don't have it can buy Treasure Trove for 23 bucks. I mean come on, think of mainstream games like Call of Duty or something - 60, 70, 80 bucks for maybe 10 hours of gameplay?I don't see why Yacht Club Games wouldn't be one of my favorite developers out there.

												At $14.99, I wasn't ready to purchase Shovel Knight.  After all, there are AAA titles from well known companies that go for less.  I've played through more NES classics than I can remember.  Bubble Bobble, Castlevania, Contra (sans the Konami Code, you scrubs :-P), Mega Man 1-6, Metal Storm, Super C, and The Legend of Zelda are a few that come to my mind while trying to make a quick list of some titles I've completed.  I wish I could tell you that I beat Battletoads, but I'd be lying.  The prospect of reliving the genre with a new game sounded too good to be true.  I've played newer ""retro"" games, but even when good, they are rarely able to resurrect the experience the older titles.When I heard about the release of Plague of Shadows, it wasn't enough for me to buy this game.  I thought, ""Playable boss character? So they probably replaced the main character's sprite and gave him a projectile.""  So I kept waiting to catch sale.  I finally purchased it at $10.04, and it still took me months to get around to playing the game.  After 30 seconds into the first stage I felt like an idiot for sleeping on this title for so long.  If Shovel Knight had existed during the NES era, it would be the type of cartridge people would be happy to pay $75.00+ for today.It manages to completely capture the essence of the genre without feeling derivative.  The developers have somehow managed to create a product that draws from the good parts of the 8-bit era while ditching unecessary artifacts.  The colors, sounds, and animations are candy to the eyes and ears.  I knew I was in for a treat mere moments after jumping into the first stage.  I was even more impressed upon making it to the first town and interacting with the people there.It took me roughly 9 hours to complete Shovel Knight's adventure for the first time, a feat which apparently can be accomplished in less than 45 minutes by highly skilled speed runners.  The game encourages you to play through again with New Game+ (higher difficulty) and as Plague Knight.  There is also a challenge mode and many Feats (achievements) for you to attempt.  I'm currently two stages into my Plague Knight file and don't think I could be more amazed by this game.  Rather than opting to lazily reskin Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games gave Plague Knight his own storyline and unique playstyle.As if Shovel Knight didn't have enough replayability, the developers are planning to release additional playable boss characters.  It is difficult for me to imagine them topping the existing content, but I should probably have a little faith after already underestimating them so grossly.   Is this game worth $14.99?  Absolutely. Buy Shovel Knight now.  If you are a fan of platformers or seeking NES nostalgia, you will dig it.			"

Steel Thy Shovel!Now THIS  is a game! Shovel Knight came out of no where and has delivered on every aspect of what a game should be and how a developer should act.I can not put into words how great a game Shovel Knight is, but let's give it a try.I first bought Shovel Knight on the Wii U. Instantly falling in love, I decided to also buy this game on Steam. Although it looks way better on my 1440p IPS monitor, I gotta say, the Wii U Gamepad made it more fun to play on the Wii U. It's funny how Shovel Knight did the best job utilizing the gamepad. (Pikmin 3 was a close second.) If you've made it to Plague Knight, then you know all about having to switch your potions and spells around constantly in the menu. The Wii U makes that super simple with the touch pad.Anyways, back to the review..The graphics for this 16 bit game are absolutely gorgeous. Yacht Club really knows their color schemes. Every single level pops. Every single boss and NPC and character are memorable because of the way Yacht Club has designed the colors to coordinate with each other and really leave a lasting impression. That, coupled with the music, creeps deep into your childish nostalgia chambers, and pulls out all your feels time and time and time again. Yacht Club themselves seem like some really cool developers. They offer the game at a very reasonable price. They have given us a free expansion. Treasure Trove is soon to drop, which promises more content at a slight increase in price. However, by this point in time, I just want to throw money at them. The controls for this game are beyond what I expected for a 16 bit game. They're so tight and smooth at the same god damn time. It pulls you in. It makes you want to pogo off an enemies head. It makes you want to get to the next unique enemy. And then, they do it AGAIN with Plague Knight, who is a little tougher to play with, but still just as fun and engaging. Tl;drBelieve all the hype. This game is perfect. The music, perfect. The graphics, spot on. The gameplay, top notch.  The game is ♥♥♥♥ing perfect.			"

												Simple, retro-styled gameplay coupled with tight, responsive controls and a stellar soundtrack all come together to make Shovel Knight an instant indie hit. Shovel Knight is the tale of a knight with an unconventional weapon out to take down the Enchantress and rescue his beloved. Giving nods to old 8-bit titles such as Mega-Man, Super Mario, and Castlevania, Shovel Knight shows us that retro still holds up even now. Borrowing all of the best bits and pieces of each of those titles and making them it’s own, Shovel Knight perfects each aspect and delivers a thrilling game experience.PRO-----------------*Simple, tight controls*Detailed 8-bit environments and animations*Retro gameplay and mechanics*Lots of sub-weapons to mix up your arsenal*Collectibles*Mini-games*Challenging boss battles*Amazing soundtrack*Effective upgrade system for health and magic*Tons of secrets to find*New Game +CON-----------------*Bad? There isn’t anything bad about Shovel Knight!*Ok fine, If you have to have a con, it’s that the game isn’t nearly long enough for how awesome it is. If it were a 200 hour adventure, it MIGHT be long enough.Shovel Knight's greatest feat is disguising itself as ""old school"" when it's design philosophy couldn't be any further from it. This title is a game every fan of retro classics of the NES era should own, and it’s available on a variety of platforms, including Steam and the Nintendo 3DS.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												I just played through an unforgettably groundbreaking adventure that was all at once Mega Man, Duck Tales, Zelda II, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Castlevania, even a little Dark Souls, all wrapped into one rich and fertile package with the raw, earthy gameplay refinement of a Treasure game, (Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy) and prepared by the fine green thumbs of Game Design at Yacht Club Games (Previously employed at WayForward and responsible for some truly awesome stuff) and all graced by the glory that is Jake Kaufman's golden rays of musical sun, as well as a couple tracks from Manami Matsumae who was responsible for some of the classic Mega Man series soundtracks.In other words, this is some of the best, most delicious, fresh-grown and ripe-off-the-vine gaming goodness $15 can get you at this moment in time. I couldn't sling dirt on this game if I tried, I just dig it that much. If any of the above made you want to enjoy some sidescrolling platformer goodness in spades, or excavate a hole in the ground just to escape all the digging puns, don't hesitate reading silly reviews, don't bury yourself in doubt, (oops sorry I did it again) just see for yourself how tasty and wholesome this Shovel Knight stuff is. You won't regret it.P.S. Just watch out for the 'pits' ;)			"

												Shovel Knight is one of those games that you instantly fall in love with. It borrows from all the best games (Zelda 2, Megaman, Mario 3, Ducktales and Castlevania) while retaining a style and humor all its own. It has incredible platforming, a lot of items, but the thing I loved the most was the design of each one of the characters from The Order of no Quarter. WOW! The environments and characters have so much detail and personality to them, it's surprising to see that level of detail in an NES 8-bit style game. Yacht Club did such an amazing job with this game. It gives the nostalgia off the NES and it does it by it's classic-style game play. If you like Mega-Man, Link's Adventure, and other 8-bit adventures, then this is for you.			"

												It really is as brilliant as everyone says.Yes, this is absolutely going for a classic 8bit art, music and gameplay style, but it's way better than just some nostalga gimmick.Basically, if you've ever enjoyed any kind platformer and haven't played Shovel Knight, play Shovel Knight.The only thing I don't like about it is the checkpoint and gold recovery system. I had to train myself to stop going after my dropped gold when it's in a tricky spot, otherwise I just keep dying and losing all my gold. That plus sparse checkpoints meant a lot of replaying the same section over and over. It's a lot less frustrating once you've gotten over the difficulty curve though, which took me about 6 hours and most of the game.			"

												This is the second time I've purchased this game after beating it almost a dozen times on the Wii U version. It's the best Indie platformer ever made. It recognizes the roots of video gaming without repeating its mistakes. There are literally no negatives to this game. At all. The level design is great and the player always has interesting choices to make. It's all the good things about nostalgia without the annoying things.Just buy it.Plague Knight: Harder than the original, but well worth the entry learning curve. It probably gives the player the most freedom out of the ones currently out. It's a little slower and more thoughtful than Shovel Knight, but that really isn't a bad thing. My personal favorite out of the three.Specter Knight:Definitely the coolest out of the three of them, but also the easiest. The game is very, very straightforward and feels on rails most of the time. Not a lot of freedom in the levels to explore or go off the path. It's also the shortest game. It's worth a playthrough, but it lacks the depth and breadth I expected from the last two. The story is good as, if not better, than the first two campaigns.			"

Posted: November 9, 2016
 In Short - Shovel Knight. A NES inspired 8BIT inspired asthetic platformer that I loved. It seems the reviews here are split down the middle. Some love it. Some hate it. And it is hard to tell which side to go with without experiencing the game yourself. But fear not, for I, _BillCipher, am here to review the game. So if you are on the fence whether to buy it or not, read on. More In Depth - Shovel Knight is, as previously mentioned, a retro inspired platformer. Taking inspiration from such classics as Castlevania, Megaman, Super Mario, Duck Tales and more. Despite this, however, the game brings on its own new ideas; no more jumping on or whipping enemies, instead it's time to shovel them! That's right, you play as a knight that uses a shovel instead of a sword. This shovel is not something to laugh at, however, because not only does it dig treasure, but it kills enemies pretty effectively. You start the game with just a shovel slash, however through the game you obtain further attacks through finding secrets and buying upgrades. For example, you can buy a charged slash. You can also find 'relics', extra weapons with various uses. The phase locket makes you invincible momentarily, the propellor dagger launches you forward, attacking any enemy in the way. These relics can be used to spice up gameplay, reaching secret areas never accessible before and killing enemies in sort of 'combos'. There is a limit to this, however. Every time you use a relic it uses some of your magic. How much magic it uses depends on what the relic does. When your magic depleats all the way to 0, you cannot use your relics any longer. But, occasionally an enemy will drop a bottle of magic, picking it up rewards you with extra magic so as to carry on using your relics. You can also upgrade your magic capacity with gold you collect throughout the stages, to be able to use your relics more. Speaking of secret areas, Shovel Knight is ripe with them. Every stage has many, many secrets, rewarding you with relics, gold or music sheets. Music sheets are one of my favourite additions to the game, it is a genius idea in my opinion. There are two songs you hear in each level; the boss theme and the level theme. If you find a music sheet in a level, you can trade it to the bard in the village. Not only will he give you 500 gold for it, but you can also talk to him and he'll play the music of any music sheet you have returned to him. This way you can listen to your favourite tracks at will. This is even more ingenious, due to the game's amazing soundtrack. And when I say amazing, I mean amazing. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a game, up there with Hotline Miami and Undertale. DLC Back when Shovel Knight was Kickstarted, Yacht Club Games promised not only the main story but branching stories with other playable characters. And only recently did we get one of them, Plague Knight. We have also been promised Spectre Knight for next year (which has now been released) and King Knight some time after. Plague Knight's gameplay is something I loathed at first. It seems confusing but once you get ued to it, is a really fun concept. Plague Knight does not use a shovel, funnily enough. Instead you are given bombs. Yep. Bombs. Along with bombs, if you hold the attack key you can do something called a 'bomb burst'. A bomb burst is there to replace some of the mobility lost when switching from a shovel to bombs. You launch into the air and then fall back down. However, you can customize this with buyable upgrades. One shoots a bullet every time you burst, another lets you float slowly to the ground instead of falling straight down. There are quite a few of these to buy, helping change the experience to whatever suits you. Not only this, however, but there are tons of customizations you can buy for your bombs. At first, you can throw three bombs at once, the fuse is medium length and it explodes on impact. However, you can buy changes these things. For example, you can buy an upgrade that makes the fuse longer, letting the bomb bounce all the way across the floor to a far away enemy. Another upgrade makes the bomb arch up and then explode. These are changeable during the level at will, but you can only buy new upgrades between levels. This just increases the comfortablity of Plague Knight. It lets you choose what style you'll go with. My problem with Plague Knight lies there, however. It is intimidating to new players. When I first started playing Plague's campaign, I saw the customization menu and was immedietly confused. What are those tonics? What does that powder mean? What is arcana and why don't I have anything for it? While I eventually learned through playing, it didn't make me want to play. I played the first level and then went back to Shovel Knight for a little while. It is a very fun system, with awesome mechanics, but it just isn't easy to pick up. Achievements Oh boy, Shovel Knight's achievements. It was simultaniously fun and painful completing Shovel Knight's achievements. But I obtained 100% of them. (I don't have 193 hours for nothing. But I've played way more offline. My time in this game is probably around 300 hours.) Shovel Knight includes achievements for both the main game and Plague Knight's campaign. Some are fairly straight forward, for example there is an achievement for finishing the game. But then.... Some of the achievements are near impossible. Some of the hardest to do -  Complete the game without dying. Complete the game without falling into a bottomless pit. Destroy every checkpoint. Complete the game in under 1 hour and 30 minutes. Complete the game without spending any moneyAnd that is only a few. There are 65 achievements in Shovel Knight as I write this, and I don't doubt there'll be more for the new campaigns. Shovel Knight's achievements are perfect for an achievement hunter. PROs and CONs PROs -  A beautiful soundtrack. Elements of older platformers with a newer spin. Beautiful graphics. Enough achievements for an achievement hunter to have a good time. Two full campaigns, with more on the way. A challenging New Game+CONs -  Some enemy placements and platforming elements that are just unfair. Adding onto the above, parts of the game that are simply too hard cough Propellor Knight cough. I'll put it out in the open; Propellor Knight is just annoying. Some parts of the game you can just pass off as being NES difficult, but Propellor Knight's stage is just unacceptable. A steep learning curve when it comes to playing as Plague Knight. A pretty mediochre final boss. Quite easy to beat. Random dips and curves in difficulty, not relating to how far you are in a stage, or in the game, for that matter. I found Treasure Knight (sixth boss) to be harder than Polar Knight (ninth boss). Of course, you can choose somewhat the order in which you fight bosses, so maybe this is my fault. Final Thoughts - Shovel Knight is a fun game. I enjoyed it. However do not buy it unless you are up for a challenge. The game is not easy and if you want to 100% it, you'll really need to put some time into it. I'll recommend it, but I can assure you not everyone will enjoy it. You need to really appreciate difficult retro games + platformers in general to get into Shovel Knight, especially in the later levels. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   "

												I already have shoveled my way through this game in an entire night, since Yacht Club Games let Kickstarter backers play the game early. I may have missed some stuff, but main game-wise, I've dug up about what's offered here.As a fellow Kickstarter backer, what do I think of this game? Well, to put it shortly...I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED THIS GAME! I'm really glad that this game saw the light of day, unlike some other Kickstarted projects out there, and I am content with how it turned out. Yacht Club Games, I applaud your efforts here.Shovel Knight is pretty much as if someone took Mega Man, DuckTales, and the Metroidvania concept and threw it together in a 2A03 blender set to VRC6, threw in some modern enhancements, and released it out to the world for everyone to try. This game really feels like it could have been on NES, from the graphics to the audio all the way down to the core gameplay. Yes, I know that there are instances of proof that part of the game can't be done on NES, but who cares? I felt like some of the added changes helped with making the game much better, in the long run.The story itself is pretty much like other NES games: Forgettable. But come on, you're not here for the story. NES games were never recognized for that. The dialogue spoken throughout is also pretty cheesy and full of puns, which I think adds to the charm of the game. You can probably get a good laugh out of it, or at least a smile on your face.In contrast to that, the gameplay is just excellent. As I said, it's a mix of Mega Man, DuckTales, and Metroidvania stuff. You can slice at enemies with your sharp shovel, bounce off of them to inflict damage and reach higher terrain, and use an assortment of side weapons. The side weapons are definitely built for combat, but most of them are also coded to aid in exploration. There definitely will be levels where you need to use a certain item to advance through, which I think is excellent...though I wish there were more levels/areas in the game that did that, too. But aside from that, you can go through the whole game with just the shovel, like how you can go through all of a Mega Man game with just the Buster.I think that the difficulty is fairly set. With how the levels are designed and how the gameplay is handled, it's really your fault for failing, which I appreciate with games like this. It also makes you learn the game's mechanics instead of giving you an unnecessary tutorial, which I also like. You can also give yourself a better challenge by destroying the checkpoints, which give you more gold in exchange of having to start from a previous area of the level upon death. With New Game+, you start with your previous equipment/upgrades, but you take more damage, can't find food in the levels, and you have less checkpoints in the level. Definitely for those who want it NES hard.The level design is superb. Yes, they are linear in nature, like with every NES game. But all the enemies/platforms/items are fairly placed out across the place to synergize with the gameplay. There are also plenty of secrets hidden in each level, which gives an excellent risk vs reward feeling of finding and completing each secret area. They also provide a nice place to test out any relics that you find, if you do find any.While difficult, I think that the game is also rather forgiving. You don't have a lives system, and you don't get a game over for dying so much or for any other condition. That said, you do lose some of your gold upon death, which you can recover in the same area that you died in, akin to Dark Souls. I like this...but I have a bit of a gripe with it, too (explained at the bottom). I think that the checkpoints are properly spaced out throughout the levels, which aids with some of the forgiveness that the game offers. Either way, if you fall, just get back up and try again. It's not game over unless you make it game over.I like how the bosses are handled. They don't really have a pattern, but a set list of moves that they choose to execute depending on the situation. These moves are pretty easy to pick up on, and they definitely fit the theme of the boss.The graphics for the game are just nostalgic glory here. I know that some of the colors in the palette in this game could never show up on a NES game...but I don't care. These added colors really help with the mood and design of the levels/enemies. Yacht Club Games did amazing with making sure that they would work on the NES, similar to how Capcom could get more than three colors on a single sprite. Just great authenticity. The animations are buttery-smooth, too.The sound...OH MAH RAWR! It's just...too good. The music done in this game was composed with Famitracker, but uses an expansion chip called the VRC6, which was only available in some Konami games for the Famicom, notably Akumajou Densetsu (Castlevania 3). I consider this one of the best expansion chips for the Famicom, and I really was excited to see it being used for this game. Oh, unlike some indie retro games out there, the sound effects in this game really do sound like they could have came from the NES, so kudos to that, as well.If I had one complaint about this game, it would be how the money bags are sometimes spawned upon death. I've had moments of not being able to reach any floating bags, all because they would be in an area that's impossible to return back to safety, especially over bottomless pits. I hope that a future patch can resolve that.One play session will vary on your skill level. For me, I beat the game in a bit over 7 hours with 84% item completion for my first playthrough, though it seems like it's an average of 4-6 hours for everyone else...and less than 1 1/2 hours if you're really that good at the game. There's New Game+ for those who want to extend their time with the game with a better challenge. But either way, with the quality of the final product, I say the price is justified.Overall, as a PC gamer, a NES gamer, and a Kickstarter backer, I really enjoyed this game. It's by far one of the greatest games I've played this year, and I'm really happy that this game was completed. I can't wait to see what else Yacht Club Games has in store soon, either for this game or for another. If you're a fan of retro games (especially the NES), you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.			"

												For us, older gamers, we see the nostalgia - and that is like icing on the gaming cake, but for someone who's fresh to it, they don't care about pixel art; they don't care that the soundtrack is compatible with the original N.E.S. units; they don't care that it references Mario 3, DuckTales and Megaman. All what they see is the game and the game is super solid!

												There are a lot of video games. Many try to capture a retro style to win over a nostalgic crowd, or try to pull a more unique art style to grab people's attentions. Others tell deep stories that hook you in, make you feel invested, like you have to get to the end. Few try to sell on quality gameplay alone, something that's genuinely fun to play.Few games do all three. Games like Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus, Bastion, Transistor, Earthbound... And now, Shovel Knight.From start to finish, Shovel Knight is a fantastic game. In the first level, it teaches you how to play subtly without throwing it out at you in a text box, much like Megaman X had done years ago. The controls are simple, each move shown to you as you accomplish it on your own without heavy handed guidance. Even the ability to identify an alternate path or a hidden wall is subtly placed into the world, so you always know what to look for. And everything is used throughout the game from then on, in new, creative ways each time, through platforming and combat.There's more to my mentioning of Megaman. Shovel Knight uses the original color palette of NES... The very limited number of color choices presented is clear in the still vivid scenery. It stays true to its nostalgic feel. Each world is unique in more than just appearance as well. The variation of enemies is absolutely beautiful, new types of critters appearing in every single stage. Even Rats, re-used throughout the game, are fought completely differently each time. From little Helicopter Rats to ones that outright explode when killed.And finally, the story. The prologue is simple, a tale of fallen heroes... Many more than you'd think at first. But Shovel Knight gets up, and goes to fight the good fight. The story builds up further in short conversations with enemies. It deepens as you fight your rival more and more, until you learn something about him that changes everything. But most importantly, this game is about saving Shield Knight... And when Shovel Knight dreams, there's only one thing he dreams of.Buy Shovel Knight. Don't wait for a sale. Play it.Catch her.Addendum:Years pass, things change... While this is a great game, this is currenlty the worst version of Shovel Knight on the market. PS4 has an exclusive level and boss. Xbone has an exclusive level and boss. Wii U gets challenge modes, some type of diary, and even co-op.The PC version has nothing extra, no redeeming features other than being a great base game and extra campaign. But why does the PC version have to be the worst on the market? It's a scummy thing of Yacht Club Games to do, punishing PC players for being just that.			"

												Shovel Knight is fantastic. I'm sure you've already heard that a million times by now because this game has been hyped up by just about everyone that has played it. Well, there's a good reason for that. The reaosn is... it lives up to the hype. It's one of the best games made in year. Perhaps one of the best game EVER. Shovel Knight is a 2D platformer where you run and jump around swinging your shovel at enemies and objects. You can also use your shovel to bouce off of enemies and objects as well. The gameplay is very similar to that of Mega Man and Ducktales. You also get some pretty cool powerups along the way, by them secondary items that use magic, or just upgrades to your main gear. You get them by buying them with gold. You get this gold by collecting gems throughout the levels. When you die, you lose some of your gold and get sent back to your last checkpoint. However, if you get back to the place where you died, you can reclaim your gold as it is separated into three floating sacks. Pretty nifty way to punish you for dying without limiting you to a number of lives. The levels are picked from an overworld map very similar to the style of Super Mario Bros 3. There are even some enemy encounters on the map that aren't associated with specific levels or locations. There are also a few towns to visit, which is the root of a lot the game's humor along with serving as the main hubs for shops. The great thing about Shovel Knight is how it really commits to the retro style. It's all pretty faithfully 8 bit in visuals, sounds, music... almost everything. It also controls like a dream. It might be intimidating at first, and you might assume it will be classically NES hard. Well, it's not too tought. Believe me, there are harder games out there. I may not be able to beat most Mega Man games, but Shovel Knight wasn't too much of a problem. The game can get tricky, even a little frustrating at times, but it keeps things interesting by constantly throwing new things at you and I never found any part of the game to seem hopeless. Whenever I had trouble with a part, I knew it was because I was doing it wrong, not necessarily because it was just incredibly tasking. The balance is great and is only further aided by the tight controls. There are also a good number of secrets for you to keep your eyes peeled for. The presentation is wonderful. The 8 bit art style is very charming, and the setpieces are very detailed. Not to mention all the pretty colors used. The sound effects are very satisfying, from jumping, to hitting enemies, so collecting treasure. The music is amazing. Just listen to the title theme and try not to get totally pumped for this game! (SPOILER ALERT: It can't be done.) Everything just comes together in one glorious package of pure awesomeness.Complaints? I guess I have a few, though they are very minor... but... well no game is perfect, Not even this masterpiece. For as retro as most of it is, a few things are modernized. The scrolling background and some of the colors and sound capabilities... plus a lack of slowdown... most of that might have been a bit much for an old NES game to handle. Also, there are lots of checkpoint, which isn't very classically inspired. You CAN destroy them for gold so that there aren't checkpoints but... they are there by default. There's also autosaving and achievements which can't be turned off. These things aren't bad. In fact, they are all here for a reason, but they DO break the retro style a tiny bit. That's all. Also, there's no multiplayer options. I mean, online would also be breaking the retro style, but local mutliplayer, co op, or switching off on deaths or something... that would've fit just fine. However, I assume the game would need to be made a lot differently if two players were involved in the quest, so I can't really complain for something the game didn't do and honestly didn't need to do. Perhaps in a sequel, eh? ;)Overall, this game is great. The controls are so tight and are coupled with fun and intersting gameplay. The difficulty curves quite nicely. The presentation is incredible. Even little details are well done, giving each boss knight their own personalities rather than just having them be generic themed bosses at the end of themed levels. There's a certain cohesiveness. This game is amazing. It costs $15, and is well worth it. It's worth even $20, honestly. In fact, if this game had a physical copy, I'd be willing to pay $30 for it! It's THAT good. It's a must have, and even now is making me reconsider what my favorite game on Steam is because it's just so great. Buy it now. Don't bother to wait for a sale. The sooner you get this game and start playing, the sooner you will be happy. You're welcome.EDIT: There wasn't enough room to add my full review of the additional Plague of Shadows content or my thoughts on challenges. The challenges are fun if you're into that, but I found them a bit annoying. The Plague of Shadows campaign that has you playing as Plague Knight is basically like a second game, with lots of new and interesting gameplay and challenges that spice up the familiarities. If the $15 wasn't worth it to you before, it sure should be now with all of this great content.10/10 Would shovel again.

												Taking the best parts from DuckTales, Zelda II, Castlevania, and the Mario series, Shovel Knight is a delightful and colorful action-platformer by the newly-Kickstarted Yacht Club Games. If you had to condense your memories and nostalgia of staring glass-eyed over your NES into a single story, you'd probably come up with something like Shovel Knight.The titular Shovel Knight must traverse the land, fighting the villainous knights of the Order of No Quarter to save his beloved Shield Knight. Each level takes it's own Mega Man-esque theme and runs with it, from romantic flying airships to an explosion-prone potion laboratory. Gameplay is extremely tight, graphics and sound make the most of 8-bit aesthetics, and a New Game Plus allows Shovel Knight to bear some much-needed difficulty fangs in the spirit of brutal, Konami-esque difficulty.However, my recommendation for this game comes from it's free DLC, Plague of Shadows. It manages to spin the game's story from a boss's perspective, from heroic gallantry to a touching story of loving others and yourself. It's one of the most genuinely sweet love stories in all of gaming.The updated gameplay mechanics are a delight as well.This game is throwback a la Jeet Kun Do - taking all the useful and best parts, discarding the frustrating and archaic, leaving an airtight, short-but-dense romp for maximum fun. For those seeking fun, plain and simple, Shovel Knight delivers.			"

												I should start by saying if nobody wants to read this 1,000 page essay over here, I'll help summarize it into 3 words: buy this game. If you're still here, carry on.I had heard of all the critical acclaim for this game, so this year I decided I'd pick it up on sale. After plenty of patient waiting, I conviniently noticed it 33% off on my birthday, when I recieved some steam cards. So, I bought it.Holy ****, I wonder why I waited so long.Graphics:This game looks fantastic. While pixel art is nothing new to indie games, where Shovel Knight exceeds is it's faithfulness in replicating old NES graphics while simultaneously being goregeous. Only on subsequent playthroughs did I notice the moving cogs in the background of Tinker Knight's stage.Sound:The soundtrack by Jake Kaufman achives exactly what the graphics do; it shoots for authenticity with the game's retro feel while simultaneously providing one of the best indie game soundtracks that I've heard, right up there with Undertale.Story:Very simple, but it's effective, and yet again distinctively retro; it mimics the era when game stories lacked the ability to offer cutscenes that added up to be the length of actual movies, so instead gave you a compelling reason as to why you're playing this game. Also, the game's characters (particularly the bosses) give a good sense of personality through little dialouge, and the ending twist is pretty original.Gameplay:Now this is where the game truly shines. Let me first off say that the control is damn perfect; no cheap deaths here, it's always your fault. Shovel knight starts off with a basic swing and a pogo-style downward strike, but by collecting treasure he can upgrade his arsenal with new abilities, armor, items, and more. Now, I'm the kind of person that doesn't even use ""mana abilities"" in most games (stuff tied to magic meters and the like), but I found myself frequently using this game's relics; I found almost all of them to be extremely helpful in at least one case. The level design is also fantastic; the game's stages take familiar ""world"" tropes (the ice level, the fire level, etc.) and put new twists on them (said ice level features a platform capable of creating rainbow bridges, and the fire level features goo that turns the lava into bouncy slime). Each level is also chock-full of secret rooms which I find to be perfectly hidden: they're not ""kill yourself in this particular pit"" or ""hit thos wall with no indication"" invisible, but completionists will have to keep a good eye out for them. These rooms contain more platforming challenges and danger but reward the player with songs, purchasable relics, or more treasure, creating a nice risk/reward mechanic. And the bosses are memorable and fantastic. Replay Value:An initial run through this game shouldn't take too long (depending on what kind of player you are, should take you anywhere from 5-10 hours approximately), there are plenty of achievements to keep you busy, which range from finding those secrets to harder subsequent runs. I don't normally 100% games, but this game is so frickin' good (for all the reasons mentioned above) that I was more than happy to find a reason to keep on playing. (Note: the game also features a challenge mode with some custom platforming runs and boss rushes). Cons:Yes, I had a few flaws with this game. A few. The main one is that swapping relics can take you out of the action at times, but this is minor and easily overlooked. Also, Tinker Knight isn't a great boss... I think that's it? BONUS: Yacht Club games being the generous overlords they are have given us mortals a WHOLE NEW DLC CAMPAIGN FOR FREE. ****-KING FREEEEEEE. A campaign that adds a new character, with his own abilities, own upgrades, own relics, own story, own achievments, own challenges, level design changes where some areas wouldn't work out so well for him, and overall just a big overhaul of the game with it's own suprising and entertaining twists on the main game. Is it as good as the main game? Admittedly, no. But this could have easily been a $10 purchase, and I would have gladly loved it just as much. But it's free, and basically doubles the amount of value for this game. Someone needs to show these guys to devs like OVERKILL (Payday 2). Conclusion:Buy this game. You do not need a sense of nostalgia for the 8-bit era (as I can testify; I wasn't around back then). You do not need to be a fan of 2D platformers (even if you dislike them. this is one of the best ever; no understatement), and the very very very least worth a try). The amount of detail, work, and passion that went into this game shows with gusto.			"

												Shovel Knight is a game that brings back the good old NES days. Truth is, Shovel Knight fails to do one thing: Disappointing me. Shovel Knight is not only easily the best game of 2014 so far, but it's one of the best I've played in recent memory. It's greatness can be rivaled with others like Mass Effect and Minecraft. Shovel Knight is easily one of the best platformers of recent memory, too. The Rayman games, for example, were highly praised with their cute visuals and awesome soundtrack, but Shovel Knight takes these visuals and makes it hardcore nostalgic and the soundtrack into an 8-bit unforgettable masterpiece, thus making it far superior to that series to me. They say that ""Nothing is perfect,"" however they also said, ""Nothing is impossible."" Where am I going with this? This might just be one of the few perfect games that I could've ever encountered.GraphicsThe graphics take you back to the time when realistic graphics weren't the big thing. Shovel Knight successfully recreates the graphics from an NES game like this and also modernizes it with some new colors and also the amazing animated backgrounds. The characters, and more specifically, the Order of No Quarter, look outstanding. They're all knights, yet the creators were able to make each one unique. To me, King Knight was the best looking of all of them and really went well with his theme. However, they all look nice. Well, besides the Black Knight, who looks pretty ugly. However, you only encounter him less than 5 times in the game, so that isn't much of a flaw.GameplayThe gameplay, again, recreates what the NES games, and even games from that time and older did. They had the simplistic controls with no holding hands. Sure, it took a while due to how many last gen games I played since they all hold your hand, but it was easy to get adjusted to them. It also mixes some of the greats, like Mega Man, Zelda, even a hint of Mario. At first, the levels appear to be repetitive, but then you realize that they become more and more unique as they go on, and the bosses were amazing. No one was too difficult at all. There was the occasional rage, but I expect that from a game that wants to recreate the NES era. Speaking of difficulty, this game has been talked about because of its easy difficulty compared to the real NES games. This is true, but like I explained earlier, Shovel Knight does not hold your hand and also the bosses can make you rage when you go against the more notorious bosses like Plague Knight, Frost Knight, and Spectre Knight. In the end, you realize that the difficulty is easier compared to Mega Man and Zelda, however it's harder than the modern games like Call of Duty. It's a perfect balance and I see nothing wrong with it.StoryThe story is straightforward. Shovel Knight had a companion named Shield Knight, who tagged along with him on his journey. However, one day, Shield Knight sacrificed herself to stay in the tower while Shovel Knight could get out alive before the tower seals. Shovel Knight, mourning the loss of his comrade, becomes a farmer and does cheap work. However, one day, the Enchantress, who is the main antagonist of the game, opens up the tower again and the Order of No Quarter, consisting of King Knight, Spectre Knight, Tinker Knight, Mole Knight, Plague Knight, Frost Knight, Propeller Knight, and Treasure Knight, begin to spread their evil throughout the land. Shovel Knight realizes that Shield Knight could be alive in there still, and he also wants to get rid of the evil knights who spread their terror. Overall, I enjoyed the plot and loved the last few minutes of the game. The ending was wrapped up effectively and told a great, yet simple tale that I saw no problems with.AudioThe audio also highly impressed me with the good old chiptune soundtrack, and even had a few contributions from one of the all-time greats known as Manami Matsamune, who made the Mega Man soundtrack. The music is cheery, fast paced, and also unforgettable. The boss themes especially peeked my interest and made the bosses even more terrifying. Tinker Knight's theme 'The Schemer' also made you think that there's more than meets the eye. The sound effects are simplistic and hardcore nostalgic. You will not be disappointed.ReplayabilityThe replayability is very strong in this game. You can play different playstyles with the armor selection towards the middle of the game, beat Shovel Knight on New Game+, defeat the bosses without dying, and go achievement hunting. The achievements can keep you busy and the New Game+ makes it even more rage-inducing. You will get quite a bit out of this game unless you're a one-and-done kind of guy. In fact, if you are one of those kinds of people, why are you reading this paragraph?VerdictShovel Knight stands out among the crowd as one of the best games I've played in such a long time. Platformer fan, nostalgia fan, medieval fan, whatever you are, this is a must-buy for anyone on Steam and is one of the games you NEED in your Steam library, along with Garry's Mod and a few others. This game does something few games have ever done, and that, my friends, is have no significant flaws that ruin the experience. You NEED this game. You will not be disappointed.Graphics- 9.5/10Gameplay- 10/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 10/10Replayability- 7.5/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:10/10:.+Amazing chiptune soundtrack+Awesome characters+Floors it on the nostalgia pedal+Simple controls+Balanced difficulty+Strong replayability+Difficult achievements+Modernizes the NES visuals			"

												Genre - 2D Action/Platfromer with RPG elementsThis game was clearly designed for nostalgic purposes and it does the job well. You control the shovel knight and can dig, and bash enemies with his weapon of choice. You fight through various stages and will face various puzzles, traps and enemies, but with even spaced checkpoints you won't pull your hair out too much.I have just earned the halfway achievement after dying many times but I still think this is a great game. The level design is challenging but not too unforgiving if you have a bit of patience. You can also upgrade a bit against the bosses allowing a hard fight to become more reasonable (Dark Souls style). There is a lot of humour within the game adding a few giggles to your progress. I would recommend using a controller to make the game more fluid.They recently released a free DLC that adds a whole new challenge as the Plague Knight, but I think it will take me a while just to finish my first playthrough.  I am pretty crap at these type of games, which normally means they have to be pretty good just to keep my interest.			"

												This is the first game that made me feel ""i didn't give this guys enough money"".The music, the characters, the gameplay, everything in this game is so perfectly lined up in such a way, that it doesn't matter if you have or have not played games from the 90s when you were younger, you will enjoy every last second of it.When i'm trying to come up with something that i don't like about this game, is that there isn't anything new for me to try. But even that doesn't count because the developers are giving us free updates of the game, bringing new playable characters, and new game modes.Yacht Club Games made a perfect job with this game, and they still do, i never knew any developers so responsive with the community, and with such a love with their game.Buy this game at full price, it deserves it and much more.Now if you'll excuse me, i got shovel knight copies to buy, even the console ones...

												Rating: 5/5 (Magnificent)Let me present you some numbers: Shovel Knight is supposed to be beaten in 8 hours. I'm going for 100, AND I DON'T PLAN STOPPING.This game is, like, very good. Awesome. Perfect. I really can't describe it.The second I started it, I was hit by the FEEL of this game. It's like you really started your NES or SNES once more. The first thing that popped in my head was ""omg, Mega-Man X is back"".So let me put this straight: Shovel Knight is the absolute leader of the platform revival.The platforming is supreme, 8-bits graphics are polished and well animated, soundtrack makes me puke rainbows. If you stop jumping and shoveling for some seconds, you'll start to notice the creator's  love for this game irradiating for your screen like the heat of an old-school star.You may think this game is overpriced, but ABSOLUTELY it's not.I paid full price and don't regret a cent.And that was before the expansion. Now Shovel Knight is 2 games in 1, by the same price AND MORE IS COMING.So, please, buy this.You'll get yourself two campaigns, nostalgia, killer soundtrack and devilish platforming all in one packaging.I just can't stress this enough: if you remotely like platforming, BUY THIS.

This game is great. Bought it full price. Worth every single penny. This game deserves your attention, and so does Yacht Club.

												So, another retro-style 8-bit game pops up. Many may think that the style is horribly overdone today and will pay no attention to Shovel Knight.I have a message for those of you - if you like platformers at all, DO NOT IGNORE THIS GAME.Shovel Knight takes place in an unnamed kingdom, under threat by the Enchantress and the 8 Knights of her Order of No Quarter. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Yeah, the Mega Man comparisons can be pretty plentiful, especially since the Mega Man series is what I usually see as the best platformers ever made.STORY:The story is pretty run of the mill, protagonist (Shovel Knight) and his companion/lover (Shield Knight) roamed the land in search of adventure, until one day, Shield Knight was taken from him by the dark power of a magic amulet. Don't roll your eyes just yet, because it gets good. While the story is simple, it deepens as he game goes on, through little bits of dialogue you may come across here and there.-----MINOR SPOILER - KEEPING IT AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE-----There's a sequence near the end that shows that Shield Knight is not a flat, boring character used just to provide a love interest for the main character - she has her own merits, and is an equal, and that sequence shows just how well they work together and how much worse off Shovel Knight is without her. All that is shown through gameplay that lasts...about 3 minutes, 5 tops.----------So, the story actually stands up pretty well.MUSIC:Holy hell, this soundtrack is incredible. The tunes are extremely catchy, and, strangely enough, I would actually encourage you NOT to listen to any of the music outside of the game until you've heard it inside. That's right, I'm counting music as spoilers for this game. Jake Kaufman has done an amazing job as always. Mega Man 2 always had my favourite 8-bit soundtrack. Up until I played this game.MINOR SPOILER: There is one track in the game that has taken my place of best sad 8-bit song from Mega Man 3's Proto Man Theme - Shield Knight Requiem. You'll know which track this is when you play the feels inducing sequence it goes with.GAMEPLAY:The game plays brilliantly, the jumping is precise, the controls, while a bit weird at first (A and D for left and right, W and S for up and down, J to attack and K to jump) work very well once you get used to them. The level designs are all done very well, with specific mechanics and enemies being used in each of the Knight Lairs, and in each specific Lair alone, keeping the game fresh and interesting and, most importantly, challenging, as you have to learn new adversaries and mechanics to deal with. Almost all deaths in the game feel like your fault, something you can improve on.The bosses work differently than most bosses I've seen in platformers like these. In other platformers, the bosses will have an attack pattern, performing attacks in a pre-determined sequence. Learn the pattern, and you can take the boss down with ease.Not the case here - the bosses in Shovel Knight have set attacks, but completely lack any pattern. This makes the bosses do their job MUCH better - testing the player's skill. You have to learn their attacks, not the pattern - you need to learn their attacks and make sure you know how to counter them.The checkpoints are a point of interest, because, save for in the first level and the final level, checkpoints can be broken to yield vast amounts of money, rendering the checkpoint beyond use. Death does not punish you by knocking off a life, leading you to an inevitable and frustrating Game Over. Instead, dying takes away some of your dosh, which you must then recover in the next life if you want it back. Sometimes these flying bags can end up in awkward or downright unreachable places, which, while annoying, could be viewed as punishment for messing up, encouraging you to improve. This checkpoint system means skilled players can receive a large monetary bonus if they so decide. Of course, getting cocky and then messing up after destroying checkpoints can send you from any length through the level all the way back to the start, so choose wisely.LENGTH:The game lasts around 5 to 6 hours, depending on your skill, on the first playthrough, an ample length, but it's packed full of secrets to find, one of the most notable being the Music Sheet collactables. 46 sheets are out in the world, hiding wherever, which can be returned to the village bard, who will pay you 500 gold for each, who can then play them for you - the music sheets in question form the game's soundtrack, so you can listen to your favourite tracks (provided you found the sheet) while scurrying about the village.On top of that, there's a New Game +, unlocked after beating the game for the first time. This makes checkpoints much more scarce, about 2 per level, where once there may have been 3 times as many, healing items are almost never found, the most healing you'll get is the Ichor Of Restoration (given by the Troupple King (I could explain what a Troupple is, but you're better off finding out for yourself)). Trying to beat the game like this is even harder, and would probably add a fair bit of length to the game (I say would; I've not actually been able to finish New Game + yet.)VISUALS:The design of the levels and foes, aesthetically, is brilliant, with each stage's looks, features and enemies having their own style, keeping the game looking new and interesting. The game was designed with a limited colour palette, to mimic the NES's restrictions. Of course, not all parts of the game, such as the parallax scrolling or a few colours the NES's limits prevented here and there, but overall, the game stays very close to the 8-bit era it's based on, with the UI looking like it's come straight out of Castlevania, and the overworld map being very reminiscent of that from Super Mario Bros. 3.OVERVIEW:Shovel Knight is an 8-bit platformer that has elements from previous games of the era, and uses them magnificently. it excels in all areas. It's not just a retro 8-bit platformer aspiring to be like the classics - it's better than the classics.It's challenging but enjoyable, and has enough of its own merits to stand tall, without needing to use nostalgia as a crutch - the NES era was not my childhood, that was the PS1 era. So if Shovel Knight's not sucking me in with nostalgia, then it must be something else giving me this rampant love for the game.The early Mega Man games used to be what I considered the best platformers.That title now belongs to Shovel Knight.This game is EASILY worth the £11 (or reigonal equivalent) price tag.If you enjoy platformers, are looking to get into the genre, or are a veteran of platformers, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.

												God damn, this game is good.Speaking of the base game (Shovel Knight, not incl. the other free expansion campaign) it is amazing. I've never played games from the era that this is retro to, but that just shows that it's amazing in it's own regard.Controls are tight, levels are interesting, and it has just enough of a simple story to be compelling. 10/10 would reccomend.

												I have played this game as it has been continuously updated, and each time I am blown away by the amount of work that the developers put into Shovel Knight.The core game with Shovel Knight is a blast, with challenge that is tempered by checkpoints that you can use, OR you can destroy them for currency. You get to choose how punishing death is. The level design, the hidden areas, the quick pace, it all adds up to a great game.Months later, they release a new character, which is practically a new GAME. The mechanics, items, and story takes the core game and forces you to play it in a much different (but still fun) way. Plague Knight trades a short-range shovel for bombs that have an excellent span of usefulness and custimization. THIS game is also a blast.Today I see that my game updated. What I am greeted with is YET ANOTHER GAME. I have a new character available that (again) has new mechanics, new items, and a new story. The opening was brilliantly designed to teach the new mechanics, and it's not long before you're deep into a save file because you're having too much fun.Kudos to the game developers, and thanks for continuing to support this game with fresh content!

												So firstly a rather large caveat: This is probably the worst platform to get Shovel Knight on.The Wii U, 3DS, PS3, PS4, PSP and Xbox One versions of Shovel Knight all have one or two bonus features thrown in.That having been said these are bonus features and their absence doesn't detract from the overall experience.The Main GameShovel Knight is a solidly crafted game which combines retro gameplay and aesthetics with some more modern elements.Shovel Knight has a simple but charming story of the titular Knight venturing to vanquish evil and find his lost companion, the world of Shovel Knight is made vibrant through it's characters, levels and music. All in all, a sublime game.But wait there's more!Shovel Knight has three planned free expansions, the first of these 'The Plague of Shadows' has already arrived and blew me away in terms of what to expect. Plague Knight was difficult to control at first with his erratic playstyle but in time I was blasting away with the best of them. Seein the world of Shovel Knight through the eyes of the mad alchemist was also a treat adding more dimensions and depth not only to Plague Knight but also to the other inhabitants of the Valley through how differently they interact with Plague Knight compared to Shovel Knight.The Second of these campaigns 'The Specter of Torment' is currently scheduled for spring 2017 and I await with bated breath!In conclusion, if you like retro inspired games Shovel Knight is a must have and well worth it's price tag.

												This game has many great things going for it. The content is amazing and the controls feel tight. When you die you feel like it is your fault and not the games. The plauge knight expansion is also amazing as shovel knight and plauge knight are as different as day and night. The story for both shovel and plauge knight were suprisingly deep and I realy came to care about the characters. I do somewhat worry about how Yatch club games will be making their money by giving out of these free expansions, as this is one of the games I would happily pay for its dlc. Here are some of the pros and consPros: -Excelent controls-Great story-Shovel knight and Plauge knight play very differently-Great bosses-Exellent music-Interesting Relics/Arcana-The random Npc interactions-Good looking 8 bit styleCons:-It is a bit too easy to get all of the Relics/Arcana, along with any other upgrades, in the game and you will eventually have all of this cash but nothing to spend it on except maybe health potions, and that is only for Plague knight. And while  in plague of shadows they try to extend the amount of time it takes to get all of the upgrades by using cipher coins, which I am perfectly fine with, except even then it still felt a bit quick.Conclusion:Despite the one problem I have with the game, it is a relitivly small problem. The positive definetly outway the negitive. If a friend of mine asks me about any good games I have played Shovel knight is one on the top of my head. I can easily recomend this to anyone. I can't wait for Specter of torment to come out.Final Verdict: 10/10			"

												Shovel Knight is a must play game, not only for platformer lovers but for everyone. It offers about 20 hours of gameplay after free DLC (Plague of Shadows) and these 20 hours are spent only during campaign while the game offers more. For those who don't want to read the whole review, I'll try to catch it in few words. The game is really fun, amusing and replayable. Also it offers many challenges and unlocks, so if you are still wondering if you should buy it, JUST BUY IT!For those carrying on, let's talk about GAMEPLAYIn Shovel Knight you can play campaign and after finishing it, a new game+ can be started (enemies hit harder, there are less check points and food platters will spawn a bomb instead of regenerating health). The game offers 2 playable characters : Shovel Knight and Plague Knight (obtained after finishing the game with Shovel Knight). It takes 8-12 hours, to complete the campaign with one of those characters, depending on how good player you are. Playing as Plague Knight feels like totally diffrent game (the whole gameplay mechanics is changed). All levels differ from each other. Once you' ll land between cold mountains and suddenly you'll be in a middle of volcano. Besides splendid campaign, developers added optional challenge mode which introduces player to another level of insanity. Freaking 26 levels created just to make your life harder, all of them completely irritating. You can play with controller or keyboard. Both options work flawlessly.Now it's time for in-game STORYI'm not going to lie about it. The story is just really simple, but the simplicity makes it even better. It's hard to not spoil the story talking about it, so I'll say that playing with diffrent characters makes the story diffrent. Whenever you meet someone and start a dialogue, you will be amused and surprised how funny the conversations are.Eventually we came to a point where glorious PC gaming master race takes place. GRAPHICSThe graphics looks beaufitul, the colors are bright, there are many details. Every single detail is well-made and matches with the rest of the level. For those who want to play the game in 4K resolution, ultra settings etc. etc. etc. there will be small disappointment... IT'S ALL PIXELS and no matter what you do, no diffrence will be seen on any 4K monitor or any other. I mean the game will look lovely no matter what.SOUNDTRACKSI'm not a music lover so I'll just say that it's just great. Music varies from slow, atmospheric songs to faster and lively ones.At the end comes REPLAY-VALUESo not much to say..... YES THIS GAME IS SO SO SO REPLAYABLE. Every second spent in this game will be enjoyed by kids, teenagers and adults, no matter how many times they complete it. You will want to replay some maps just to get more collectibles, unlock some achievements or just to challenge yourself. Summarising all upper things, there is only one thing to say : This game is perfect platformer for everyone. Developers made a 2D game with retro graphic and soundtrack and they made it well. Shovel Knight's got everyghint it has to have : good gameplay and good replayability. There is nothing more needed for a game to have and I would recommend this game to everyone.Thanks for reading my review! It was fun to write it for you all. I hope it's helped at least few of you! :D			"

												I think I can safely say this is my best Indie game of all time period.The graphics and the gameplay mechanics are very retro, so its not something that is completely new.However, the amount of execution of this game is just done too well. Yhatclub done it too well, that they even put Modern Nintendo to shame. The level design is just too god like. The difficulty is fair and challenging but not frustrating.It's also has fixed difficulty, meaning that everything is designed around that difficulty and works perfectly.sound design is retro and bit old, but the melodies that you will hear in the game is just beautiful and enjoyable.The length of the game isn't too short, but at the same time not really that long. So you can pretty much replay the game any time you want. In fact, you can practice speed running this game, which is also actually fun to practice the game without dying or fall into the pit. Again this is mainly because the game is genuinely fair and the level design is just so well designed and fun so you can enjoy this game so many times. And I truely appreciate Yhatclub game because they are giving you the free DLC which is Plague Knight campaign. In this DLC you get to play as Plague Knight which is one of the boss in the game. The level design is actually same as regular campaign, but the layout of the each levels redesigned around the ability that Plague Knight can perform. So in the end it actually feels different and you have to play the game pretty differently. They are planning to giving out more free campaign DLC which you can play as Spectre Knight, Kings knight, and adding 4 player battle modes for Freeeeeeeeeee. Yes all of the campaign story is also based around the each characters. This sounds to me that Yhatclub is just giving too much for everyone. Thats how much I enjoy this game and that is how much I appreciate Yhatclub. and Hopefully Yhatclub is the new game studio that shines even more in the future. Thank you Yhatclub.내가 아직까지 해본 인디 게임중에서는 최고라고 자부한다.그래픽이나 게임플레이는 고전 닌텐도 플랫포밍 액션 어드벤쳐 게임의 감성을 가져왔기 때문에 사실상 신선하다고 보긴는 어렵지만.. 레벨디자인은 거의 오늘날의 닌텐도 조차도 놀라게 만드는 수준의 레벨 디자인에 너무 쉽지도 너무 어렵지도 않은 매우 적절하게 난이도가 고정되어있어서 제작자의 의도가 제대로 딱딱 맞아 떨어지는 구성에 고전적인 사운드 디자인이지만 멜로디 구성은 기억에 남고 스테이지 마다 숨겨진 아이템들과 레벨속에 숨겨진 구간을 찾는 재미도 있는데다가 게임의 길이도 너무 짧지도 너무 길지도 않아서 게임을 깨고 난뒤에 스피드 러닝 하기에도 매우 안성맞춤인 구성에플랫포밍 게임으로써 매우 어렵지는 않지만 플랫포밍과 진행자체에 있어서 조작에 대한 어느정도 정확도가 요구 되기 때문에 여러번 플레이해도 너무 즐겁다. 또한 스테이지 마다 고유의 보스배틀이 있는데 보스 배틀의 경우 공략법만 알면 그다지 어렵지는 않지만 충분히 기억에 남는다. 또한 이 게임은 돈주고 DLC를 살필요 없이 왠만한 추가 콘텐츠 게임들을 업데이트를 통해서 공짜로 뿌린다 더 웃긴것은 그 공짜 컨텐츠가 너무 혜자라는것 현재까지 추가된것은 게임내의 보스 캐릭터중 하나인 역병기사로 플레이 할수있는 또 다른 캠페인을 만들었는데 이게 레벨 구성은 사실상 메인 캠페인과 비슷하지만 역병기사의 의 능력에 맞게 레벨 구성을 재구성 했기 때문에 느낌은 사실상 매우 다르다.거기에 더해서 스펙트레 나이트편 스토리 캠페인,킹스 나이트 스토리 캠페인, 4인 로컬 배틀 아레나와 같은 컨텐츠도 미래에 무료도 업데이트 할 예정인데 비록 시간은 걸리고 있긴 하지만 이렇게 개발을 하는데 시간이 걸리는 컨텐츠를 100% 무료로 뿌린다는건거의 자원 봉사수준이나 다름이 없다.스토리는 거의 텍스트방식이고 좀 낡은 스타일에 꽤 단순한 플롯라인을 갖고있지만음악과 분위기가 딱딱 맞아 떨어져서 억지감성이 느껴지진 않고 오히려 감정이입하는데에 있어 매우 자연스럽다.쉽게 말하면 단순하지만 그래도 애잔하다.정말 오늘날의 닌텐도도 절대 못할 스토리텔링이다.놀라운건 스팀 친구들중에서는 아직도 이 게임을 안한 사람이 너무 많다는것.

												I was saving up some money till the holiday sales, and I really wanted Shovel Knight, but then the cash appeared and I could buy it at Full Price, at first I thought I was hasty and wasted cash, but after playing it, I can safely say that this is my favourite game of 2014. Not only did it fulfill what I expected, it actually exceeded my expectations, it's challenging, you'll rely a lot on skill, the level design is so amazing I haven't been this frustrated ever since I played megaman again 3 years ago. It is a delicious mix of Castlevania, Megaman and Ninja Gaiden. The Retro graphics are enjoyable and the pixel art is amazing, its pretty hard to sprite in that style without making it look out of place due to the lack of limitations.Yatch Club Games really nailed it with this game. If they ever announce a Sequel, I would gladly play it if its as enjoyable as this game was. Sincerely, best Ten Bucks I ever spent. Worth a lot more than AAA games I bought this year.tl;dr 10/10 megaman knight ninja belmont play it would pay twice the actual price			"

 Well, Shovel Knight... in a two words - freakin' awesome! How I should say, it was a nice game, created by Yacht Club. The story about Shovel Knight (Plague Knight if you finish'd first campaign, and there another one coming up in April) that just lost his love, Shield Knight in Tower of Fate. After that, the Enchatress sealed the tower with magic, Shovel Knight gone wandering the land. The rest of story you need to know by yourself, because there will be strong emotion moments, puns, and other goodies. Prepare a shovel, sir, cuz' we gonna dig! "

												As the industry grows and creating games becomes more feasible for small time development teams amazing games spawn from nostalgia and peoples love for their past favorite games. Shovel Knight perfectly encapsulates the community wanting their retro game feel, while still maintaining a modern experience in flow and glitch-free gameplay. Pulling from the experiences of Mario 3, Zelda II, Megaman, Duck Tales, and other retros games Shovel Knight mixes these all in a pot and gives us something we couldn't experience on a NES by expanding on colors and gameplay that the system would not have allowed at the time. That's what makes Shovel Knight appeal to so many of us. The game itself is fantastic. The action platforming and game design makes you feel like you are playing a Castlevania Megaman love child. Each zone has its own theme (a castle for king knight, a graveyard for spectar knight etc.) drawing from the best part of Megaman; its uniqueness. And the stage has hidden areas and challenge rooms giving you the exploratory feel of a Castlevania game. Your trek to the boss is challenging, but not frustrating and the game allows you to make things more difficult for yourself by rewarding you for destroying checkpoints. Defeating a stage always feels like a true accomplishment because the boss battles are hard and long fought. Once completed you are back to the overworld where you may be met with random encounters, challenging areas to test your skill, or fun banter with merchants and towns people. Combine that with masterful music and beautiful artstyle and you find almost no issue in the game.The only issues one can bring up are sadly the game is too short, and the difficult cap may be high for those new to platformers. I myself had a hard time in many areas and I adore games like this. A lot of trail and error is involved, but with deligence any player should be able to finish the game. On the issue of the game being to short. I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing. A game as good as this is bound to leave a player wanting more and wanting more is what all games should leave you feeling. I do not hamper on Shovel Knight for being to short because it is my own selfishness that wants 20 more bosses and stages, endless music, and new and greater challenges. Overall Shovel Knight is an easy 10/10 and I have taken my nostalgia goggles off even for this score. I may seem biased, but even if I didn't have history with the aforementioned games Shovel Knight would still be a fantastic piece on its own. For those new to platformers and this style Shovel Knight will be a refreshing challenge and a wonderful gameplay adventure. For lovers of the old platformers this is the game we have been waiting for; all your favorites wrapped up in a new intersting experience that will both satisfy your thirst for nostalgia and leave you begging for more.

												Platformer perfection. A love letter to days of gaming past where games were challenging but not unforgiving and stories didnt take themselves too seriously, only rather than just be a love letter, they improved on every aspect of platformer gameplay and made what might be considered the most perfect game of all time. Literally perfection.11/10.			"

												As one of the few games I've played and actually completed over the past few years, it's no hard thing to say that Shovel Knight is easily one of my favorite contemporary platformers. The world building and designs are as charming as its many influences and it manages to provide an ethralling and challenging experience for even the most hardened of retro platforming veterans. This is definitely a MUST buy for fans of any of Nintendo's finest.			"

												One of the best platforming games I have ever played and definitely the best of the current era. It's made in the style of an 8-bit classic so will appeal to gamers of that era most but I think lots of younger gamers will enjoy it if they give it a chance.Lots of replay value with secrets and upgrades to buy and find, not to mention the extra campaign after you complete the main game with more DLC campaigns to come soon.The game can be challenging but it's fair, practice and patience are rewarded.A must buy for any fan of the platforming genre or anyone looking to try one out for the first time - this is an example of how it should be done.

												This game totally nails the nostalgia factor by implementing the best parts from a variety of old school games and modifying what didn't work with them. It is a combination of all the best, from the presentation to the mechanics to the music. Not to mention the devs are including FREE expansions. The first one, Plague of Shadows, is already released and is well worth playing through. The next one (featuring Spectre Knight) Is set to be released soon! But more importantly, there's a frog that tells puns. 100% recommend			"

												Oh boy, this game. Shovel Knight is a superbly developed platformer that adds various genres from older games into the mix; You have some influence from Megaman regarding your freedom of choice in which stage you can pick first, Super Mario (for obvious reasons), a little Metroidvania in there, and some LoZ. While it may be quite a task to list which game mechanics have been inspired by specific games of the genre that I've aforementioned, I'll spare you the details and point out the good points of this phenomenal revival of the classic platformer.-Good story, with the cliche of saving the ""princess"" (Shield Knight), but nevertheless a good story-An expanse map that features the areas and territories governed by other enemy knights you have yet to face. Plus, side quests of all difficulties can be accessed, allowing for more replay value even after you beat the storyline!-There is a Mana mechanic included, which allows you to pull off special moves during any tough situations! -Digging and harvesting jewels is practically the backbone of this game. While this may sound like an effort, it's actually quite addicting (and easy) to rack up thousands of jewels in-game. Plus, you can reward yourself by upgrading Shovel Knight with more health and mana! However, it's just as easy to lose money as it is to gain; the difficulty of the game is reasonable, and if you're not careful, you may find yourself losing scores of that hard earned cash.-Armor Upgrades that alter your defenses, attack capability, and general physics in platforming. Each one has its pro's and con's well balanced in such a way that no armor is ""stronger"" than the other.-In addition to your Armor Upgrades, you gain access to Shovel Upgrades as well during that same point of the game. Again, each has its pro's and con's. These moves deplete your mana bar varying in strength of the attack respectively.-Each knight that you battle is equipped with a quirky personality, generally regarding it's motif. This results in commendable characterization. And the dialogue is memorable as well.-Amazing soundtrack that captures the moment of each stage setting. Ultimately, this game is a must-have for all you avid old-school gamers out there. As stated before, a little bit of everything from the classics have been incorporated into this game, so it never grows stale. Would highly recommend! "

												Almost a year back I bought Shovel Knight - and damn, was I hyped beforehand. All those flashy reviews praising it all over the place. Then I played it - finished it in two sittings and I liked it. It was good. It had charme, controlled just fine and had a decent difficulty. I had a fun couple of hours with it, but all in all I wasn't as impressed as I anticipated to be. I played through it a second time though - for Butt-Mode alone - so kudos to the developers for that :DAnyways, Shovel Knight got an update – and this update did it for me. Plague Knight, for me at least, is very enjoyable to play. I love the countless options to suit his abilities to your playstyle and I love to go at this game with a totally different way of thinking. The levels themselves haven't changed that much (although they've been adjusted to Plague Knights abilities), but still this felt like almost a new game. Shovel Knight and Plague Knight play considerably different and playing as Plague Knight elevated the game immensely for me. Now let's get to the other changes. The story in Plague Knights campaign is wholly different from Shovel Knights. It plays out as an alternate universe of sorts, where Shovel and Plague Knight's paths cross from time to time. Plague Knight has his own motives, his own hub and even a sensible setup for this hub to make sense in the original universe. There are a lot of small touches, which make the story interesting and give you those ""aha""-moments with regards to Shovel Knights campaign.  For example:  The Hall of champions does not sport ghosts as main enemies, but Knights. This gives you the feel, that you as Plague Knight set up the Hall of champions for Shovel Knight. You destroy the knights and thus make room for the ghosts. Plague Knight has his own expansive set of upgrades, which comes in several forms. Upgrades for his basic bomb throwing, his charge-bomb-jump-thingy, his ""up+x""-move and his cloak. Theres is a ton of options for you to play around with. I got stuck with the Samus Aran-Way of doing things. Jumpy spin attack + the ability to bounce of walls. Died this way at times - totally worth it!Anyways, as a free update, this is totally worth your time. Some may not like Plague Knights kinda ""sloppy"" movement and his jumping ability - but it does give you a new challenge and provides you with a cutesy story along the way.For me, personally, this update was the kicker Shovel Knight needed to get my full approval. It was a good game from the start - now it is an excellent game, worthy of your undivided attention.Btw: Yacht Club Games, please keep your love for details at this awesome level you got going. Small touches, like Percy (being a horse and all) actually kicking a lever, instead of using it normally – this is the stuff that makes me smile from ear to ear!			"

												Rather than go over all the wonderful things that make Shovel Knight an excellent game, I'd like to spend my review talking about an issue I've seen brought up in the majority of the negative reviews Shovel Knight has recieved.Among others (which are highly based on personal opinion, such as the usefulness or lack thereof of the collectible relics), the complaint that stands out the most to me as absolutely unforgivable is complaints about frequent death.Particularly, the difficulty of platforming in many areas and the quote-unquote ""liberal"" application of instant death traps, such as bottomless pits, spikes and lava. I have a few issues with this.1. Allow me to get the obvious out of the way: Perilous Platforming is exactly what Shovel Knight was aiming to have to begin with. If you didn't want it you had no business playing. This is exactly what you were told it was going to be.2. IT'S NOT EVEN ALL THAT DIFFICULT. It seriously is not that bad. There are no areas that require you to have absolutely, pixel-perfect jumping precision in order to progress through the area. None whatsoever. Not even for side-areas such as secret treasure rooms. None. The difficulty of the platforming in Shovel Knight gets so overblown in some of those negative reviews that it's honestly sickening.3. YOU GET CHECKPOINTS -AND- INFINITE RETRIES.Shovel Knight doesn't use an ""extra lives"" system. If you die, your punishment is simply ""you lose some treasure"". Then you respawn at the last checkpoint you activated to try again. And again. And again. Ad infinitum or until you give up (but it shouldn't take you that many tries because, again, it is seriously not that bad).This isn't like Mighty No. 9, where you have to collect 1-ups so that you won't game-over and get booted out of the stage entirely. As long as you hit a checkpoint you are gauranteed to make progress.Shovel Knight is worth your time. As long as your skin isn't paper-thin I promise the platforming won't be that much of an issue.

												I initially purchased Shovel Knight to play on my 3DS. I instantly loved it--enough to buy it again for my ps4. Shovel Knight is a simple game that derives its primary mechanics from classics like Duck Tales and Castlevania. Where it outshines all of its inpirations, however, is in how efficient it plays while lending itself to backtracking and exploration. What you end up with in Shovel Knight is a metroidvania-esque game, with the rhythmn of a 2D platformer that offers an addicting collect-a-thon experience. Level design is the backbone of platformers, and in Shovel Knight, the levels are crafted with tremendous care. Every nook and enemy placement is deliberate. If you see a skeleton on a strange platform far from the traditional path, there is a high chance that it is leading your eyes somewhere. The way the game goes about teaching you its fundamentals also indicates how much love the devs have for the older classics. There are no written tutorials, but you quickly learn each new mechanic as they come from the brilliant obstacles that quickly follow. The last level in the game is a culmination of everything Shovel Knight has to offer and is worth paying for alone. The bosses in this game are spectacular. They gave me a Dark Souls vibe when I first experienced Shovel Knight on my 3DS. Their sprites were unique, attractive, while at the same time disturbing. Even the mini bosses are loveable. It's hard to play through Shovel Knight without having a handful or two handfuls of favorite encounters. Beyond their aesthetics, their pattern design is also top notch. There are no fair encounters, and deaths are usually the result of a lack of knowledge or timely reaction. You will see yourself playing levels over and over for gems,  achievements, and missed relics that are used to traverse new locales so the OST plays a big role in keeping the momentum going. Fortunately Shovel Knight is jammed with mysterious tunes that amplify the lighthearted, yet dark fantasy atmosphere that it is going for. Perfection does not exist, but if you are itching for a platformer that is close to it, then this game is your answer. Shovel Knight is oozing with years of love for a genre that has taken a backseat amongst the mainstream where graphic giants, FPS, and action games now rule. Shovel Knight is a love letter and a reminder that 2D platformers are still relevant and hide enjoyment wrapped up in simplicity. 9.5/10			"

												This game. This game is good. Here's why. 1.) This game is in 8-bit. Most kids/adults who play this game get a very reminicent feeling of playing on every 8-bit gaming platform. That's sorta the build of this game, trying to be like none of the other indie games out there, but yet not going out of the way to be different. It does something simplistic, bringing you back to the 80s, 90s, and 2000s with 8-bit video games. 2.) The soundtrack. Really should be under the 8-bit criteria, but still good none the less. This game's soundtrack was cleverly designed to bringing back some nostalgia with classic SNES and NES music from popular videogames. And what more could be said? It's ♥♥♥♥ing catchy! You could dance to this (Plague Knight). 3.) The DLC. Adding one of the villans to the very exclusive playable character list is actually a smart idea. And with his entirely new gameplay, caused my 45 deaths with shovel knight to shoot up to 145 deaths. (I suck, he's hard.) The only mistake in the DLC is Vat (the item) comes mid-game and is really the most used utility that you'll get. Most of the items I had I never really used. (Stoneskin potion, Running feet elixer, big boom) They cluttered up my quick select menu, causing me to die because I didn't want to pause the game. 4.) Plot line Plot: You're a serulian knight with a kick♥♥♥♥♥shovel on a quest to defeat the enchantress and find out what happened to shield knight. You fight other knights. Simple as that. Nothing more, nothing less. It's fine like that. Last thing I need is to be playing Kirby: The Amazing Mirror and have a backstory about Kirby's dark past fighting depression with binge eating. Verdict: Aw ye.			"

												Amazing game. An action-platformer that combines the best of Mega Man and Duck Tales to create an experience that is both fresh, rewarding, and fun. The difficulty feels balanced throughout the game, eventually getting much harder as you get towards the end. But by then, you should be able to handle the obstacles the game decides to throw at you. Very fun, and I reccomend it to everyone. Probably one of the best games to come out this year.			"

Posted: December 3, 2016
												One of my favorite games that I've played in a while. It seems like I've been in a series of platformer games lately, and so I got into this game finally - turned out to be quite a masterpiece!This is one of the highest raved games in the past year or so, and I think it's well-deserved. In fact, the developers are nice and keep working on free content getting added to the game, such as the Plague Knight expansion. I've finished both the original game as well as Plague Knight - both are incredibly worth it! Plague Knight added a whole new way to get through the game, an entirely different methodology to playing. It even did things like turning one of the easiest bosses in the game (while playing as Shovel Knight) into one of the hardest.The general premise of this game is that two knights, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, get separated from one another in a cursed tower. Eventually, Shovel Knight finds a way to get back to the tower and look for Shield Knight. He chooses to fight his way back through a set of evil knights blocking his path, saving people as he goes along as a classic hero.The game has a few flat-panel cutscenes along with tons and tons of text dialogue as you talk with citizens in towns, the evil knights, random characters like the Troupple King, and so on. To move around in the game, you actually have a world map that you go across, unlocking sections as you complete levels, similar to a Super Mario Bros 3 world map. Occasionally, little enemies will pop up on the map blocking your path, causing you to complete side levels or mini-boss fights if you try to move through them.Your main weapon of the game is your shovel itself, allowing you to normally attack enemies, among other things such as jumping over and hitting them as you fall down, thereby bouncing back in the air. You also have a power attack if you hold down the attack button and unleash it after Shovel Knight lights up flickering. As you play along with the story, you'll find that you collect money and can buy upgrades for your character, such as maximum health increase, or special armor that will give you power-ups in various ways.Shovel Knight also finds special powers, called Relics, such as stealing health from enemies, throwing anchors, among other things. Some of them are very attack-oriented, while some are support such as getting across dangerous paths. These use up a magic bar which is another power of Shovel Knight that needs to be upgraded like his maximum health mentioned above.Like a retro platformer, each level has checkpoints, but you cannot leave the level and come back to the checkpoints. Therefore, if you choose to exit the level, you lose everything that you obtained up to that point. Or vice versa - you will regain anything that was lost, such as money if you have died a lot. Each level has a special Relic to find in a hidden room along the way, but there is a character who will charge you a fee to buy the Relics.Some of the hidden areas in levels require Relics to access them, so you might want to re-visit them if you unlock some special powers later on. Further, each level has music sheets to find, another collectible for the game. These allow you to listen to the soundtrack via a town character, and he'll also give you some money each time you return a sheet.The game definitely requires a bit of work to get used to its style of platforming, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a lot of platforming cliches, such as the occasional room where you must run while the screen does, or a tall room where falling will very likely mean death. Thankfully, these don't occur that often, so it is not like the game will be a big pain for you. All in all, I believe the challenge of the game to be very balanced.Graphics and sound are both perfect for this game and its style overall. Everything looks beautiful. Everything sounds beautiful. I have absolutely no complaints. In fact, some of the songs in this game are ones that I can listen to over and over and over. The overall environments for the levels and the world are amazing.Shovel Knight is really worthwhile for its price. You will have tons of fun with it, and once you finish, you can move on to the free expansions and get new gameplay!			"

												If Megaman and Ducktales had a love-child, it would be this game. Controls are smooth, graphics are just right, and it has th perfect amount of difficulty. The soundtrack steals the show though, it is AMAZING. You can download it here for FREE, but you can give any amount of money to the composer if you choose to do so. (you should) Link can be found here: http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shovel-knight-original-soundtrack My only complaint is that I've personally experienced some framerate issues, but it could easily be my computer and not the games optimization.

												This game makes you feel like you're in the 90s, it sucks you into that world, and your train of thought start going all retro. Typical from Mario is to check if pipes are actually usable, here it's the walls you break. Some of them have marks on them, some do not. Anyways, to the point.I started the game for the first time the other day, and I fell in love instantly; the graphics, the sounds, the attack of Shovel Knight, the enemies and jumps, everything was perfectly connected and pleasant, I thought ""Man, this is one of those games that makes you want to play constantly!""The fist 3 hours I had loads of fun, visiting villages, getting the roamers on the map, the random bosses, the hidden stuff, the upgrades. I simply loved it, and everytime I closed the game, I couldn't wait to boot it up again.But then, the feeling-good gameplay stopped, and I found myself thinking ""I really want to end this level, it's not enjoyable like the others, and hope the next one is less frustrating"", alas, the next level never was more enjoyable, at contrary, it was harder and less fun to play.Also want to mention that one thing that I don't like about the game, is how they try their best to make every level different, that means that you won't play the same style of level again; for example, there's one level that consists of winds pushing you around, and you being smart and using it to your favor, that was fun, but that mechanic only lasted 20 mins, once the level was done, you won't see the same background/music/enemies again, and it happens with *every* level.I loved the first levels of the game, but they never appeared again, and that made me sad, because they were far more pleasant.Another game mechanic that I don't think is done right, is the ""night"". Basically, it makes all the screen black and you don't see neither the character, the enemies, nor where you put your foot, unless there's a thunderstorm (one each 5 or 6 seconds that lasts for 0,5s) or a hole in the background which lets light pass through. It was frustrating to constantly die due to an enemy hitting you without you noticing, and falling to the depths; losing coins for something you have no control over.So, basically, after the first 3 hours, I started not feeling good playing the game, it was death after death after death, and it didn't make me feel good like the way Dark Souls saga does after accomplishing something, sometimes I thought it was pure luck that I was still alive.Game is short, some mechanics will make you pull your hair out, and you never get to enjoy the levels/mechanics/enemies that you love again. However, the gameplay is extremely fun, using the shovel is so entertaining and original/creative, that you just can't wait to see a pile to dig, or a normal enemy to use it, the sound is spectacular, and the graphics are pleasant to your eyes, it's one of those games that you want to watch at everything in the screen to notice the great details in it.Up until hour 3; 8/10, after hour 3; 5/10.I don't normally like plataform games; I hated Super Meat Boy, couldn't play side-scroller Sonic games, loved Ghost n' Goblins, and loved Cave Story. If you have more or less the same taste as I do, you might have the same opinion on this game.			"

												Shovel Knight begins as most adventures do. Two adventurers, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, are off on a journey when they come across the Tower of Fate. Inside they find a cursed amulet, which knocks Shovel Knight out. When he wakes up, Shield Knight is nowhere to be found. Shovel Knight becomes depressed and begins living a life of solitude, until one day the Evil Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter arrive to take over the land. Shovel Knight takes up his trusty shovel and makes his way to the Tower to defeat the Enchantress and her Order. Why he’s got a shovel in particular is never really made clear, haha.While simple, the story does it's job. It keeps you interested and gives you a purpose. This of course is accented by amazing gameplay inspired by old school retro classics such as Mega Man, Castlevania, The Adventures of Link, Super Mario Bros, and even Ducktales. Shovel Knight borrows a few mechanics from some of the aforementioned game, but succeeds in making them its own. You can use your shovel to attack enemies, as well as dig up piles of dirt to find treasure, gems, and coins (these serve as your currency). You can also do a downward plunge attack, very much like Scrooge's pogo stick in Ducktales. This is pretty much all you can do, that is until you get your first relic. Relics are your sub-weapons, similar to Castlevania, with each use costing Magic to use. You can swap between relics at anytime via the inventory screen. They each have a specific use, like the Phase Locket allowing you to temporarily become invulnerable, or the Fiery Wand, which allows you to shoot fireballs in a straight path in front of you. Relics are found in one of two ways: either by finding the NPC Chester hidden in each stage, or by buying it from Chester in the first town. Buying it from him in town is more expensive though! In addition to these attacks and relics, you can also purchase abilities and armor upgrades in a later area. The range and variety of enemies is impressive for any game, retro or otherwise, and there are some particularly good Mega Man-inspired boss battles. They all have their movement patterns to learn, but rather than just shooting a red flashing body part three times each encounter always has a more complex puzzle element. In Shovel Knight boss battles are things you actually look forward to as a culmination of the level’s ideas – not a semi-interactive cut scene before the next stage. Where the game doesn’t excel quite as well is the level design, which vacillates between making clever use of the shovel and more generic 2D platform arrangements. There are a lot of cleverly hidden secrets and shortcuts though, which together with the fact that you have to collect dropped gold from your corpse when you die is as reminiscent of Dark Souls as it is Super Mario World. Instant death whenever hitting a spike pit seems excessive punishment though and even if the checkpoint-ing is relatively generous the platforming gets so difficult by the end that it still won’t be enough for many less experienced gamers. Shovel Knight himself is also quite heavy for a platform character, although after an hour or so play you simply adjust to his slightly slower rhythm. In most cases the game understands exactly when to stay old school and when to defer to more modern design theories. Even the visuals aren’t really anything like a NES. The number of colours and larger sprites are PC Engine level at least, which may seem inauthentic but allows for much more interesting visuals while still maintaining the retro tone. Shovel Knight’s creators clearly understand that while graphics are never entirely timeless good gameplay is, and if Shovel Knight really had been released back in the early ’90s it would’ve been rightly acknowledged as a great example of its art. The soundtrack for the game is fantastic. Each level has their own catchy tune, as does each boss fight. As you collect songs from the stages, you can sell them to the Bard in town for 500 gold each. Then at any time, once you've returned a song, you can request that the Bard play it in town for free! Good times are had by all.Shovel Knight is a fantastic call to nostalgia and is a well-designed game overall. There's also a New Game+ feature where enemies deal more damage to you, and 45 achievements to collect in all! Thankfully you don't even need to open the Steam overlay to see what achievements you have, because at the main menu you can select ""Feats"" so see all of your accomplishments. The game is playable both with and without relics, so the game is as challenging as you want it to be. Can you dig it? I sure can!

Recommended: A lot of games go for that 'retro platformer' feel out of an ease of development and miss the mark when it comes to the charm and feeling of those games.  Shovel Knight is not one of those games.  It's a compelling and wonderful little retro platformer with an amazing attention to the little fine details.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Shovel Knight is a beautiful, solid game and Jake Kaufman's best work in my opinion. (From what I've heard, among his pretty vast amount of work anyway)HOWEVERI DON'T recommend this game to anyone who can't handle insta-death situations. They exist in this game, and they are *annoying*Dying in the same spot, losing half or more of your money, and going through the same segment in a level can be very infuriating.Basically, if the difficulty of Megaman games ruined the Megaman games for you, don't get it. Not that they're the same games, by any means. It just kinda has the same feel of difficulty to me. Some people have compared it to Zelda 2, but I've never played it. So I can't really make that comparison with certainty.Anyone else who loves getting their♥♥♥♥♥♥pounded into dust, get it. You won't regret it.			"

												It\'s almost flawless. It\'s an old-school Megaman style platformer, with old-school difficulty. It\'s brimming with fun, personality, and polish. Every aspect of the game oozes the love that its developers have for games. Expect excellent level design, gorgeous graphics, a kicking soundtrack, a surprisingly engaging story, and a plethora of hidden easter eggs and extra features.The only complaint I have is in the Dark Souls-like recovery mechanic. When you die, a proportion of your wealth is left where you died. In Dark Souls, it is left a few seconds behind where you died, so you can safely retrieve it. In Shovel Knight, the bags of gems that spawn where you died would often not be reachable without you dying again.This was definitely frustrating, but do not let it sour you on this gem of a game. It\'s well worth its asking price!			"

												There's really nothing that can be said about this game that hasn't been alreay said.It's basically perfect.My brother's friend shared this game with me through his steam library, but once I started playing it I had to buy it myself because the developers DESERVED my money. I'll just list out everything great about this game that has been stated hundreds of times before:Tight platforming, classic but compelling story, amazing artwork, and a soundtrack so good that I cannot comprehend how it can exist in the mortal realm. This is quite possibly the best game I have ever played. 11/10			"

												I can't believe I haven't written a review for this yet.I actually backed Shovel Knight when it was still a kickstarter project, but when I did so, I did because while it was an idea that I thought sounded kinda interesting, it was also something that I could see as a serious passion project and something that I wanted to succeed.  The fact that it did succeed and did so brilliantly is just glorious icing on the cake.TL;DR: I think Shovel knight is a fantastic game.  One of the best I have played in years.So, I think Shovel Knight is a wonderful game.  The characters are fun and enjoyable.  The stages are well designed and fun to explore, there's variety in every stage, challenging bosses, an interesting story, AND on top of the base campaign, the developers created what is basically a standalone expansion and gave it to everyone who has purchased the game, for free.Shovel Knight makes very obvious callbacks to games such as Megaman, Super Mario World 3, DuckTales, and others.  It takes so many beloved aspects of what is now considered ""retro"" games and pays homage to them so well that it even exceeds what they were.  This is not just a ""oh, let's get a lot of nostalgia in this game"" kind of situation.  Instead, Shovel Knight is a game that is made as though it were still in the NES/SNES era, and yet it seeks to take the things that made those games classics and improve on them further.If you enjoy NES/SNES platformers, I highly encourage you to give Shovel Knight a try.  I do not think you will be disappointed.			"

												I know it's a little early to post a review for this game (at least in my opinion) as not every feature has been implemented yet. However, I still wish to review the game as it is with the three current campaigns we have. (Plus a pretty cool rename)First off, I need to go ahead and say this, every campaign plays differently from each other. I'll go more into depth of that later. I love the pixel art of this game. Call me a nostalgia addict, but I really love this game's visuals. Everything is so well animated, and yet so detailed. As for the soundtrack of this game, Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman strikes again with his excellent compositions! (Seriously, I can't get enough of this guy's work)The gameplay of Shovel Knight's campaign, Shovel of Hope, can be simplied as a ""Mega Man-like Ducktales adventure"" by some people. And I can't disagree with 'em. I can't shake off the feeling I'm playing a Mega Man game, yet it isn't Mega Man. The plot is, while not very innovative, still is kinda engaging. However I don't think plot is important, since after all the gameplay is where it's really at.  I ended up caring for everyone in the story, even the knights you go up against of the Order of No Quarter. The balance is very fair towards beginners, but it becomes more challenging at the end. There's no real penalty of death other than losing gold, which you do have an oppertunity to get back. This penalty mechanic applies to every character, as of now.Plague of Shadows however, is where things become obvious the game plays very differently between different characters. If you're familiar with Star Fox Zero, the game had a long learning curve with its controls, they were pretty functional and fun once you get used to them. Now, why did I bring this up? Plague Knight actually feels the same way. Instead of using a shovel, you're using potions. I can't really explain how this goes, but there's a lot of customization with how you can create your potions later in the campaign. Once more, the balance is fair, but it expects you to have beaten Shovel of Hope and had a grasp of what to expect out of levels.Then we get to Spectre of Torment, the most recent campaign as of this review. I don't know where to begin with this. Not only is this a prequel to the stories of Shovel of Hope and Plague of Shadows, but it also has entirely new mechanics to play around with in levels and bosses that aren't as familiar as they seem. Also you get to play as what some people call ""the Edgelord"" himself. While it is a new style of gameplay, it's much simpler to grasp over Plague of Shadows in my opinion. As for the difficulty, there isn't much of a difficulty curve at all, except for the last levels of the game (in which it spikes a lot). Unlike the previous two, you're allowed to choose every Order of No Quarter stage right from the beginning. Meaning, no world map.All n' all, I'm very satisfied with what we got with Shovel Knight. While they could have stopped with the Shovel of Hope campaign, they went far and beyond and are fulfilling every kickstarter milestone that was accomplished, and even making the campaigns feel like different games rather than ""copy and paste"" everything.While the price has been increased due to being more than one ""game"" now, I still think it's worth the price of admission, especially with King Knight's campaign being released sometime this year. So what are you waiting for (unless it's a sale), ""Steel Thy Shovel""!			"

												Absolutely recommended to any platforming fans.  Shovel Knight perfectly delivers on all gameplay fronts with clever level designs, awesome boss battles, and a great Mega Man X-ish powerup system that rewards exploration.  This is all wrapped in high quality production value packaging, dripping with NES-era Capcom nostalgia.  Shovel Knight features a consistently catchy and upbeat chiptune soundtrack paired with an excellent array of color palettes.This is the best 2D platformer of 2014 thus far.			"

												Shovel Knight does something that has never been done before.It manages to capture literally everything that was so charming, memorable, and fun about the side-scrolling platformers of the 8 and 16 bit eras and genuinely create a new game out of that exact mold, but without a single one of the negative characteristics that make many of those older games feel archaic today. If you were to round up a group today's best game developers who grew up with an NES, Genesis, or SNES in their home, and send them back to 1991 to make a game with all the knowledge and skill they had in 2014, Shovel Knight is what you would end up with.This game is stellar. I really can't find anything bad to say about it. As I write this review in July of 2014, it's easily the best video game I've played this year. It's very popular and very trendy nowadays to make ""indie"" games using pixel art, but no game of that style that I've played has even come close to what Shovel Knight is doing here. This is a labor of love by people who love video games, and who have loved video games for a long time.Anyone who doesn't play this game is doing themselves a disservice, especially if your a gamer of a certain age. Few video games are capable of magic. Shovel Knight is one of the ones that is.			"

												""For Shovelry!"" This NES-esque platformer captures the spirit of retro gaming by combining quirky characters, iconic gameplay elements from Castlevania, Ducktales, and Zelda II, and a FANTASTIC soundtrack that I still listen to every day (kudos to one of my favorite VGM composers, Jake Kaufman)! Forgiving in the way that there are no game overs and plenty of ways to get past each screen, ranging from pure shovel tactics to using an invincibility charm to bypass it altogether if something gets too frustrating. For the hardcore (like me!), the game offers plenty of freedom to make your playthrough VERY hard through its achievements! I cannot describe how awesome it felt to hear the staff roll theme reprise after completing the game without dying.Pick it up for yourself and your friends! Let's all appreciate the EPIC homage to retro gaming that is present in Yacht Club Game's SHOVEL KNIGHT!			"

												I have played many games in the era of NES. Megaman. Metroid. Rygar. Ducktales. Castlevania. Super Mario Bros. Legend of Zelda.All of these games. These challenging, challenging games, and its here in 2014, where I find a game that absolutely trumps each and everyone one of my NES favorites. It has the level design, the aesthetic, the music, the artstyle, and most of all: The challenge.This game is by far, one of the most fun, and sometimes the most challenging, of all the 8-Bit Classic Platformer type games that I have ever played. This game takes all of my feelings for Mario Bros. 3, Ducktales, Castlevania, Megaman, and just, combines it into one sweet package. -When you play, the system that acts as your ""lives"" so to speak, is replaced with instead ""loot"". In stages, you collect gold, treasure, gems, and jewels from either chests, mounds of dirt in the ground that you dig up, or secret parts of the wall where you'd have to hit as if Castlevania in search for chicken. When you do die, however, your total loot will be decreased by a good chunk, and three bags of loot will fly up into the air awaiting for you to recollect them when you return from the checkpoint.-Speaking of chicken, you do have a lifebar like Castlevania and Megaman, which you are able to fill up by finding either random apples or carrots strewn about the stage, or finding a platter of chicken/turkey in the walls. However, those platters don't always contain chicken.-Jump and Attack. With Jump, you basically jump. You can attack while jumping, so theres that out of the way. With attack, you are able to either slash the air, or dig piles of dirt and rock laid around the stages to collect treasure and gems. At some points, you are able to slash at certain blocks in the walls, and collect more bountiful treasure, that which acts as your lives. When jumping, if you hold the down button, your shovel will point to the ground like Scrooge McDucks cane, and you can jump off of, and deal damage to enemies, or jump off of blocks of dirt and sand. Some secrets will require you to have an enemy or two alive to jump up to higher heights.-When you move, The momentum of Shovel Knight as you play him feels somewhat like Megaman and Simon Belmont's movement speed, if not just a little bit faster, but far more manouverable. This helps give people that played games like Castlevania and Megaman a familiar sense of movement from old games, and give people just getting into this type of game a comfortable feeling for whats in store.-The music made by the Jake Kaufman, or known as ""Virt"", along with some added tracks by Manami Matsumae, who herself composed the music for Megaman, is absolutely top-notch, and gets you rearing to go into this 8-bit Adventure. It is very upbeat, and action-packed, and pairs well alongside each stage you'll visit.-The Challenge you'll find in this game is somewhat subjective, but from what I have found, the challenge aspect curved up at an excellent pace. It starts off somewhat slow, letting you get a feel of the game at first, and then gets progressively harder and harder, but never making your deaths its own fault, but rather your own for either going in too hard or messing up on your own prediction. This is a game much like Megaman and Castlevania, where you are required to assess each new situation, sometimes with great caution. Unlike Megaman, however, but more like perhaps, Super Mario World, you can run in to several checkpoints throughout the stage, represented as a clear crystal adorned atop of a golden shaft sticking from the ground. Run past one of those and you'll activate it. IF you're feeling risky, you can get yourself some extra loot by striking the checkpoint three times, and gain a good few hundred in treasure, but destroying the checkpoint in the process.The bosses you'll fight are all represented as Knights, and unlike Megaman, but more like Castlevania, no boss will have one single weakness, but with each item you find, you'll have a variety of different ways to go about beating them. And as well unlike Megaman, you can redo the stage, and as well re-fight the boss. That can be taken as awesome or annoying, personally I thought it was cool.If you don't take my word for it, then let me say this. I haven't bought a game, or have gotten a game the ""legit"" way since 2012, not unless someone gifted it to me.This is one game, which I tell you here and now: You should not pirate this. Yacht Club Games, deserves every pound, penny, dollar, ounce, ruppee for making such an incredible, challenging, and fun game. Buy this game.			"

It has the level design, the aesthetic, the music, the artstyle, and most of all: The challenge.This game is by far, one of the most fun, and sometimes the most challenging, of all the 8-Bit Classic Platformer type games that I have ever played. This game takes all of my feelings for Mario Bros. 3, Ducktales, Castlevania, Megaman, and just, combines it into one sweet package. -When you play, the system that acts as your ""lives"" so to speak, is replaced with instead ""loot"". In stages, you collect gold, treasure, gems, and jewels from either chests, mounds of dirt in the ground that you dig up, or secret parts of the wall where you'd have to hit as if Castlevania in search for chicken. When you do die, however, your total loot will be decreased by a good chunk, and three bags of loot will fly up into the air awaiting for you to recollect them when you return from the checkpoint.-Speaking of chicken, you do have a lifebar like Castlevania and Megaman, which you are able to fill up by finding either random apples or carrots strewn about the stage, or finding a platter of chicken/turkey in the walls. However, those platters don't always contain chicken.-Jump and Attack. With Jump, you basically jump. You can attack while jumping, so theres that out of the way. With attack, you are able to either slash the air, or dig piles of dirt and rock laid around the stages to collect treasure and gems. At some points, you are able to slash at certain blocks in the walls, and collect more bountiful treasure, that which acts as your lives. When jumping, if you hold the down button, your shovel will point to the ground like Scrooge McDucks cane, and you can jump off of, and deal damage to enemies, or jump off of blocks of dirt and sand. Some secrets will require you to have an enemy or two alive to jump up to higher heights.-When you move, The momentum of Shovel Knight as you play him feels somewhat like Megaman and Simon Belmont's movement speed, if not just a little bit faster, but far more manouverable. This helps give people that played games like Castlevania and Megaman a familiar sense of movement from old games, and give people just getting into this type of game a comfortable feeling for whats in store.-The music made by the Jake Kaufman, or known as ""Virt"", along with some added tracks by Manami Matsumae, who herself composed the music for Megaman, is absolutely top-notch, and gets you rearing to go into this 8-bit Adventure. It is very upbeat, and action-packed, and pairs well alongside each stage you'll visit.-The Challenge you'll find in this game is somewhat subjective, but from what I have found, the challenge aspect curved up at an excellent pace. It starts off somewhat slow, letting you get a feel of the game at first, and then gets progressively harder and harder, but never making your deaths its own fault, but rather your own for either going in too hard or messing up on your own prediction. This is a game much like Megaman and Castlevania, where you are required to assess each new situation, sometimes with great caution. Unlike Megaman, however, but more like perhaps, Super Mario World, you can run in to several checkpoints throughout the stage, represented as a clear crystal adorned atop of a golden shaft sticking from the ground. Run past one of those and you'll activate it. IF you're feeling risky, you can get yourself some extra loot by striking the checkpoint three times, and gain a good few hundred in treasure, but destroying the checkpoint in the process.The bosses you'll fight are all represented as Knights, and unlike Megaman, but more like Castlevania, no boss will have one single weakness, but with each item you find, you'll have a variety of different ways to go about beating them. And as well unlike Megaman, you can redo the stage, and as well re-fight the boss. That can be taken as awesome or annoying, personally I thought it was cool.If you don't take my word for it, then let me say this. I haven't bought a game, or have gotten a game the ""legit"" way since 2012, not unless someone gifted it to me.This is one game, which I tell you here and now: You should not pirate this. Yacht Club Games, deserves every pound, penny, dollar, ounce, ruppee for making such an incredible, challenging, and fun game. Buy this game.			"

												Solid game.Music was well done but only a handful of tunes really caught my ear. It's like Mega Man, Super Mario 3 and Simon's Quest. I saw elements of all 3 of those games. Over world map, travel from dot to dot. Shovel Knight following the Master Robot formula with the...""antagonists"" being *something* knight. Aslo, in the game you can purchase items, upgrades and gear switching between them in the midst of combat and exploration!From a gameplay standpoint, it's a very solid game. The story is as in depth as you'd expect it to be and the level deisgn and enemy types provide a challenge but not one I found to be difficult. It isn't easy, but it isn't hard either.Pick it up. On sale or not...Now, let me say this...the base game is solid but I really loved the Plague of Shadows DLC. It opened up a whole new way to play the game. New mechanics, new weapons, access to areas not seen before, hilarious minor characters, a behind the scenes look on what is going on while Shovel Knight is traveling/battling, a character that I found to be endearing and most importantly a rather interesting, if predictable, story.The ending was wonderful. It's simple but was one of the few endings in any form of media (written/watched/played) to make me ""daaaaaw"". So Again, on it's own Shovel Knight is worth it but when you add in the Plague of Shadows story line? It's well worth full price.			"

												I've only had Shovel Knight for about two days as of this review, and I can already say that it's one of my favorite games of all time. This game does everything right. -Incredibly fun gameplay, easily the best platformer I've ever played-Perfect controls (I played with a controller)-The best usage of 8-bit graphics I have ever seen-Great animations, even for an 8-bit game-Fantastic soundtrack-A simple, yet enjoyable story with fun characters and a great ending-Plague Knight, an extremely fun and unique character with his own story-Playing Plague Knight even adds more depth to the original story and characters-Upcoming free content updates with more characters. No paid DLC!This is the only game I have ever played that I think truly deserves a 10/10. There are literally no cons to this game I can think of. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is if you aren't into 2D platformers, but even then, Shovel Knight is a great way to get into the genre. What are you waiting for? PLAY THIS DAMN GAME			"

												I'm not someone who is great at Nintendo-hard games, which includes many of the pixel based indie games that have come out the last couple of years. Shovel Knight shines because it offers something to players who are nostalgic for the days of old without also yearning for a difficulty beyond imagining. It does have modes for those who are masochistic, but I can also enjoy it's amazing soundtrack and awesome boss fights while playing on a level that's a bit more manageable. future updates with alternate playable characters and other modes will only solidify Shovel Knight as a standout among its peers in the years to come.For more of my thoughts on Shovel Knight, be sure to check out my full review of the Specter of Torment campaign, which has been published over on TechRaptor.https://techraptor.net/content/shovel-knight-specter-torment-review "

												This game is amazing.  It not only successfully replicates the aesthetic and design philosphies of the 8bit era games that it's paying homage to (primarily Mega Man) but it manages to, in my opinion, be straight up better than those games in nearly every way.  Even if you found titles like Mega Man 2 to be too archaic for whatever reason, Shovel Knight adds in enough modern convenience through the likes of intelligently placed checkpoints to allow practically anyone to succeed.  For those wanting a more traditional challenge, you can manually destroy those checkpoints to get bonus gold - a great example of scalable difficulty.  The audio visual aesthetic is sublime - it does its best effort to stay within the confines of the NES's hardware while cheating slightly to expand upon the color pallette and allow environmental/lighting effects.  If you're even remotely fond of chiptune music, the OST here should be enough reason for you to check this title out.  Seriously, just pick this title up.  Only downside is it's quite short - taking around 4-6 hours for a playthrough.			"

												Though I am not usually the biggest fan of platformer games, Shovel Knight managed to surprise me.  I purchased it after having heard the rave reviews and I must say that I was not disappointed.The game at its basest level almost reminded me of the classic Megaman games, though, instead of an arm cannon you use a shovel to defeat your enemies.  That same shovel is also used as a pogo stick to bounce off of the environment as well as your enemies, and is a tool that the game requires you to master especially toward the end when timing and control are all that stands between you and a gruesome death.The map phase of the game takes place on a map that is reminiscent of Mario Bros. 3, with levels, towns to purchase items from, and adventure locations sprinkled across it.  Each of the levels that you play has a theme based around the boss, and each of these these levels unlocks an ability similar to those that that particular boss has.  By the end of the game you're capable of swapping between a large supply of tools acquired from previously defeated enemies, some of which are dangerous weapons, others are invaluable tools.  Combine this aspect with the ability to purchase health and mana upgrades, a variety of items, and armor and weapons, and you've got a significant amount of lite-RPG added into the formula.The story is rather light in the game (as you might expect) though it does convey the sense of urgency that Shovel Knight has in rescuing his love, Shield Knight, from the clutches of evil.  As far as action-platformers go, I was pleased with the story and it kept me entertained.I would definitely recommend this game to any one particularly enjoys action-platformers with a touch of RPG, and would suggest the game to anyone else who has an open enough mind.  Just be prepared to scream obscenities at your computer screen for half an hour until you finally experience the sweet taste of victory.			"

												Shovel Knight is a gem.It is an action-platformer wearing the armor of an 8-bit NES game, but at it's heart it plays like a brilliant modern platformer.I personally did not like the graphical style when I saw screenshots of the game, but as soon as I started playing it I thought that with all the animations and unique settings, it looked good. The 8-bit music is great and suits perfectly the game.Now that the style is out of the way, I will focus on the flesh of the game:The Shovel Knight has to battle through 8 levels and their associated boss before being able to tackle the final levels and the final boss. A few other levels or boss fights exist on the world map, which is presented in a style reminiscent of Super Mario Bros 3. Unlike Super Mario Bros 3 there is only one world map to explore, so the game might appear short (around 8-10h), but each level is long and received so much care and is so unique that Shovel Knight is really a tight experience that doesn't overstay this welcome or feels like a repetitive grind.I started this section with the description of the levels on purpose, because each level is actually very unique and has its own gameplay quirks and its own visual style and its own original boss fight. This is really where the game shines, in its variety of situations associated with an excellent level design. The Shovel Knight is able to perform a drop-down attack with his shovel, which will be at the center of the gameplay. Some harder sections require to navigate through screens only with drop-down attacks. Some platforms can only be activated with a drop-down attack on a switch. Some secret places can be accessed through a drop-down attack then rebound on an enemy. The combat features a lot of different enemies with their own visual style and attacks. Unlike recent Rayman or old Mario games where enemies feel more like a moving obstacle rather than a dangerous threat, Shovel Knight requires more subtlety and fighting skills. A secondary attack which can be equipped with a wide range of magic powers helps deal damages or evade them.The only real controversial point about the game is that a player loses money upon dying. The money can be retrieved on the location of death, but it can sometimes be impossible to retrieve. The good thing is that there is an incentive not to die even though there are no finite ""lives"" and that it creates mini-challenges, the bad thing is that some levels can squeeze their fortune out of the player and will make it harder on already struggling players.Overall, Shovel Knight is a polished game full of personality made by talented developers, it offers a tight and satisfyingly challenging experience, and shines through its perfect gameplay and excellent level design. An easy recommendation for anyone looking for a good action-platformer.			"

												There's something very magical about this game. As of right now I'm 3 hours into it & already halfway through the Shovel Knight campaign and I can't wait to play the other 3 campaigns. Addicting gameplay, decent story, good humor, just an overall simple good time.It's the perfect mix of quite a few of our beloved nes classics and that's a beautiful thing. Let me tell ya, Shovel Knight may be heavily inspired by famed classics, however, it feels like something totally original. In other words, it's not too copy cat-ish. Everything about this game is enjoyable, nothing frustrating can be found here.My only complaint is that the bosses are a bit too easy. It's apparent that the developer didn't only make this game for retro platformers but newcomers as well. I recommend this game to anyone who loves classic platforming games... namely Megaman, Mario, Golden Axe or even the rpg known as The Legend Of Zelda.			"

												Do you like megaman? Do you like knights? Then enjoy this game, which is essentially knight megaman! While many games will throw in some pixellated graphics and say ""there it's retro"", Shovel Knight seems to have been made by people who actually get what made these retro games fun.The controls feel solid, yet I do find it easy to sometimes accidentally use an item when I didn't want to. That could just be me however. The soundtrack is done true to style and incredibly well, you'll most likely be looking up the songs pretty quickly after hearing them.The story is basically any NES game's story, a simple tale of saving the kingdom from an evil force. Nothing much, but then again, that's intentional! Not every game needs a sweeping plot full of twists and turns, after all. The dialogue is full of humor, whether intentional or not.The game may be a little too difficult for some, full of moments in which you'll be thrown into bottomless pits by knockback. The difficulty is just as retro as the rest of the game, which isn't always something people go for.All in all, if you enjoyed the platformers of the NES days or are just looking for a difficult yet fair platforming game for the PC, get Shovel Knight.P.S.: Use a gamepad.

												i have no nostalgia for the NES, i grew up on a diet of playstation with a smattering of mega drive.it's important to bare this in mind, as many of the 8-bit style nostalgiafest indie games out there really don't do it for me, due to the fact that they cater exclusively to nostalgia.This, however, bucks that trend. Shovel knight is just... everything about it is perfect. the controls are sharp, responsive and precise; the game itself is challenging without ever feeling unfair; the music is some of the best i've heard in a videogame and the level and character designs are nothing short of pure genius. usually i can think of a single bad thing to say about a game, but this time? no. nothing comes to mind, infinitely replayable, beautifully made and just so satisfying to play- Shovel Knight is better than most of the big-name games that you see in the shops for £40.if you haven't already bought it then you are seriously missing out, so fork out that money, yacht club deserve it.

												This game is probably the only platformer I have ever played in which I have always had fun throughout every tiny step or largest jump. Every stage have a new music specifically for that stage, each of the stages being nothing short of memorable. The stages themselves are enticing and perfectly made for pros and newbies alike. It is difficult, but it is never the game's fault: allowing anyone to keep going without ever feeling bad towards the game's design. Overall: THIS is how a retro platform (or any platformer in general) should be made. Truly worth the $15 dollars, and has hours of replay ability.If anyone doubts, you can view this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJZtGKFNc15ZoHqtzi25cAmPiV_Igkd9FEach video is split by the stage, so no spoilers if you don't want them.

												This might be the most rewarding game I have played since the 80s when I first got into gaming.  It truly is a NES classic, but even better because it doesn't take itself seriously but still delivers serious entertainment. I sunk almost 40 hours into this game just to unlock 100% of the achievements and I have never dedicated or enjoyed a game enough to do that.Their achievement set list is just hard enough to keep you coming back for more after beating the game, but not enough that it is impossible for the average player.  I love games, but I am in no way in the same category as speed runners, but somehow because I loved this game enough I learned the patterns I needed and pushed through anyway.  Beating the Sub Bosses in New Game + might have been the hardest thing I have ever done in recent years.I really DIG this game!			"

												The Plot - It's simple,  a bit foresseable, with few important characteres, but matches with this kind of game, wich major objective is unite past with present in a video game.  The Gameplay - It's wonderful, 'cause at same time that you look at yourself playing a game that looks like a new Mario game, Shovel Knight inserts new kinds of environments in the game and ways to match new kinds of gameplay with this ambients. One example is  the levels of propeller knight (with wind introduced in gameplay) and polar knight (with different forms to interact with ice .The Graphics - Nothing to comment about it, it's a old school game with old school graphics too.Therefore this game can match perfectly to old school players, but it worth be played by all gamers because Shovel Knight honors old school games with inovations that justify the title of best indie of his year of launch.

The music is great (gj virt), the gameplay is smooth and engaging, and the plethora of content makes me feel I really got my money's worth. The fact that they put out a whole new game as an free expansion, and they're working on two more is just icing on this cake.			"

												Do you want a love letter to classic Mega Man and Castlevania? Add in touches of the Duck Tales pogo and Adventure Time-esque NPCs, and you're getting the idea.  Sure, plenty of games are trying to do 8-bit retro now, but Shovel Knight is possibly the most polished, well designed example of how it should be done right.Graphics:  Obviously there is more detail than an original NES game, but everything is bright and clear like Mega Man.  Enemies and projectiles stand out so nothing is ever cluttered.  The designs are unique on regular enemies as well as the bosses and NPCs and everything is animated well.  The stages all have their own personality and look great.Sound: virt (with a cameo by Manami Matsumae of Capcom fame) has made a catchy chiptune soundtrack which fits the game well.  I have to give him extra credit for each Order boss having their own boss theme, which I certainly wasn't expecting.  I'm waiting on the physical cd to see how well it works outside game, but I have every expectation I will still enjoy it and it definitely is enjoyable in game.Design & Challenge:  Perhaps over everything else, the level design is where the game really shines.  You can tell how much work went into getting this just right.  Playing through just once so far I died plenty, but with repetition over difficult parts you can see just how smoothly a stage flows when done right.  Just as a basic playthrough things were never maddeningly difficult, however the feats (achievements) are certain to test the very best platformer veterans. Fun:  This game is very fun!  It has it's own style and clearly a sense of humor, but what will get me back to it is the feeling of getting that platformer on Nintendo that you will go back to time and again, even if you blaze through it. I highly recommend this game!			"

Shovel Knight may get heaps of attention for how well it tickles the nostalgia glands, but don't let that fool you; the game is as joyously fun as it is pixel-pretty!  Now, it isn't nearly as demanding as neoretro platformers like Castle in the Darkness or Super Meat Boy, but I think that's a big part of its (well-derserved) popularity.  Even players who are inexperienced in the genre can muddle through Shovel Knight and take in the candy-colored sights and sweet blippy sounds and feel satisfied -- but it does take skill to finish it with finesse.  So what the game lacks in lacerating challenge it makes up for in surprising mechanical depth.  I think that's quite a feat!  I would be remiss if I didn't emphasize how wonderfully strange the world of Shovel Knight is.  Certainly, beloved sword & sorcery tropes are invoked, but I don't think we've ever encountered a sawed-off warrior who uses his spade-blade to deflect projectiles, pogo off enemy heads, unearth buried treasure and properly extinguish campfires.  Oh, and he worships an elixir-spitting forest god who is half-trout, half-apple.  I've said too much!  Get the game and experience it for yourself!			"

												It starts out like DuckTales, and by the end it's Mega Man.  This is extremely high praise.  The perfect platformer: somehow they managed to make a game of moderate difficulty that is fun and doesn't have any cheap shots.  Really enjoying the NES aesthetic, they nailed it pretty hard but it doesn't feel held back by it at all.			"

												TL:DR this game is great and you should pick it up!But A longer version on why it's great is because, it's just great, the devs are still updating the game too, I think a year ago or so they added Plague Knight as a character and there is also new game + for both characters currently in game and I think that'll carry over to the upcoming other two (Specter Knight and King Knight) but beyond that since this game has been out for a while now I've noticed alot of people are mainly liking it because it's nostalgic, even without the nostalgic feel I think anyone can get into the game and it generally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that people would solely buy this just because it reminds them of how games where back in the 1980s, I'm proabaly just saying that because I didn't grow up back in those days but the point is the game is perfectly fine without nostalga, like anyone in their right mind today can buy this game and enjoy it no matter how nostalgic the person feels about the game, had to get that off my chest, I hate how nostalga is a way to determine if a game is good or not, this game is good because it has loads of content with more in the pipeline, really great level design and has a good difficulty to it, not because of nostalgia. Sadly the only down side is the game is really short, I was able to beat Shovel Knight's campaign in around 12 hours and that's including NG+ and the same goes for Plauge Knight, so yeah it's a short game story wise but it makes up for it with lots of challendge modes and collectibles and like I mentioned earlier it has NG+, other then that one tiny nitpick, it's a great game.Spector's story came out today, it was a lot better then Plague's story because the levels were almost completely redesigned and the bosses were all really different from the other story modes. A fantastic update that increases the value of the game!			"

												As of late, a lot of games have been released which are trying to recreate the feel of games from the NES/SNES era. Some of them are quite good, while most of them don't quite hit the mark. Shovel Knight doesn't belong in either of these categories. It belongs in the category of ""nailed it"". Upon starting up Shovel Knight (which I had been waiting for for a very, very long time), I was hit by music that reminded me of the music I heard in games I played as a kid. Progressing through the game, the rest of the music got even better, one of the tunes still stuck in my head after I put the game down. Music isn't the only thing the game has going for it, though.The graphics look just like you'd expect a game inspired by the NES/SNES era to look like: pixelly, and gorgeous. The backgrounds are beautiful, the enemy designs are awesome, and the boss designs are absolutely incredible. The gameplay is tough at times, but the controls are good enoug hthat with a bit of practice, the tough areas can be conquered with ease. The dialogue is hilarious at times (there's an NPC that you can interact with solely for puns), and at other times it can be pretty cheesy. There's plenty to do even after you unlock everything from the shops (collecting the different songs, collecting all relics, New Game+, etc.). With that all said, that doesn't mean there aren't a couple things I didn't like. The lack of shovel upgrades, for example, is rather disappointing. However, these small qualms are very much shadowed by all the positives that hte game offers. Having already beat Shovel Knight the first time through, I can say I'm already prepared to hop back into New Game+ and continue the adventure. Even after that, there's still perfecting each stage and boss.Through all of that, I'd say that Shovel Knight is definitely worth the $15 and you should pick it up as soon as you possibly can if you were even remotely interested in it. Any fan of platformers (especially Mega Man) will adore this gem.To sum it up in just three words: I dig it.			"

												For a moment just picture our favorite Blue Bomber Megaman from the NES era. Now replace his Buster Gun with a Shovel Blade, swap out his armor for some plate mail, slap 2 dirty great big horns on his helm and you have yourself the glorious Shovel Knight. After a minor delay (which felt like forever) Shovel Knight has blessed us with its 8-bit grandeur. I truly dig the game from its 66 piece color palette to its beautiful NES style audio. Its not the most difficult platformer in the world so newbies shouldn't have much trouble but the experienced platform gamer will still find it rather satisfying to play. The controls are simple, easy to learn and reasonably responsive, the level and boss design are awesome and the story is...ahh...so so... But in Shovel Knight's defence, it's more about the gameplay and thats where it shines most brightly.To sum it all up, Shovel Knight is sure to please anyone who enjoyed NES gaming as a past time, because it takes the best parts of some real classics while still feeling fresh and unique. This review is rather brief but I honestly just want to venture back into gaming history and slay some more Order of No Quarter!			"

												2 words, F****** Amazing. If you where a fan of any of the old Mega Man games then i can garantee that you WILL love this game. If that didn't sell you then i assure you this game has amazing pixel art, level design and dont even get me started on this excellently crafted soundtrack. Also if you buy this game and go to the creators website you will be able to get a free code to a free dlc called Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows which adds a whole entire new campaign in which you play as one of the bosses called Plague Knight and later in 2017 there will be another free campaign titled Shovel Knight: Spectre of Torment in which you will play a prequel story as Spectre Knight. If you are willing to pay the money for this game then i would DEFINITELY suggest using a controller as it is way more comfortable than keyboard controls			"

												Is the Shovel Knight an Perfectly Realized Ultimate Savior and Most Supreme Indie Game of All Time™? Is this the must have for everybody?Is hype real?No. Definitive no. But that doesn't mean that this game is bad. It's pretty far from it actually. Shovel Knight is an extremely well polished 8-bit retro throwback, that checks all the objectives of great 80s platformer. Visuals are pretty spot on, sountrack is not bad and game really plays well. Unfortuntely it misses a massive points for lack of originality. This is basically an ""Mega Man with a shovel"", at least the core gameplay that is. Gimmicks are from MM. Character speed and jump height are from MM. Enemies are heavily inspired from MM. Even some particular screens of the levels are pretty copy-pasted. I would forget this completely, but unlike other recent platformers that are wrongly accused for lack of originality, Shovel Knight could really use some more charm and unique flavors in gameplay and presentation. it doesn't mix many concepts and doesn't add anything new. It realizes one concept and nothing else. Fortunely this concept is realized pretty well.This game is also not for casual players. While this isn't particularly hard game, it offers no difficulty settings and 80s One Hit Death Spikes are plenty, sometimes amping up frustration. Luckly those moments are not that prominent in comparison to the whole game. Otherwise it goes smooth with 60FPS, clevel boss designs and satisfing enough gameplay.No. Hype isn't real. I played some better platformers recently, but Shovel Knight is still a not bad experience. It's pretty much worth $15, but I would suggest taking it, like me, with at least -33% discount. Be a fan of platformers and don't expect miracles and you should be fine.			"

Video: http://dai.ly/x3jt1akShovel Knight is a platform game, just extraordinary, takes you back 20 years, when the games had a care more ""profound"".The style of the game is definitely retro, as well as the soundtrack and gameplay.The game becomes more difficult, with huge bosses!The levels, have secret passages and extra you can enhance both the weapons that the armor!So Shovel Knight is definitely a masterpiece, maybe just a little short, but there is the possibility of playing the new game +, to unlock new things! (Below is the Italian full review)  Shovel Knight è un classico gioco di avventura/azione con una straordinaria giocabilità, indimenticabili personaggi e uno stile retro a 8-bit. Se ti piacciono i giochi in perfetto stile platform, con una splendida grafica, umorismo, frivolezza e tanta passione, Shovel Knight è la scelta giusta!Features: - Grafica retro in stile 8-bit. - Diversi extra da sbloccare- Impara a usare svariate reliquie magiche come armi. - Accumula ricchezze per potenziare armi e armatura. - La mappa globale ti permette di svolgere le tue missioni in un ordine unico! - Supporto completo al Gamepad- Supporto alle Carte e Achievement di Steam Parere personale: Shovel Knight è un platform, semplicemente straordinario, ti porta indietro di 20 anni , quando i giochi avevano una cura più ""profonda"".Lo stile del gioco è assolutamente retro, così come le soundtrack e il gameplay.Il gioco diventa sempre più difficile, con boss enormi!I livelli possiedono passaggi segreti ed extra da scoprire e si possono potenziare sia le armi che l'armature!Insomma Shovel Knight è assolutamente un capolavoro, forse solo un po breve, ma c'è la possibilità di fare il new game +, per sbloccare nuove cose!Voto:

												So, Shovel Knight.  This game is ment to be a nice throwback to the NES era of gaming.  The fuel for this game is nostalgia, through and though.  Also much like the NES era of gaming, you could have games about, roughly any sort of weird nonsense you can throw together and alot of it would stick because it was origonal.Shovel Knight plays like alot of your favriote games if you are old enough to have been raised by Nintendo.   You play as the title character, Shovel Kight, who is an honorable knight who weilds a fearsome shovel to vanquish his foes!  Shovel Knight himself is likeable, though his backstory cliche' he really is the honrable type, and trys to talk his way out of a situation before being accosted.The Level designs are great, unqiue, and each one offers a diffrent experience (Personal favriote and most hated is the graveyard level.), there are two towns, a host of bizzare characters within, and all of the bosses have just about as much personallity as you do.  The other knights are also based on simmiler gimmicks, like Plague Knight, King Knight, Specter Knight, and each boss battle is rather enjoyable.The game does take a measure of skill, it starts off nice and easy and has a gentle learning curve to never make it frustrating.  There are also plenty of hidden easter eggs and secrets strewn across the levels for you to find, from music notes, to more gems, to strange fish-fruit people.  Shovel Knight himself has a large arsonal of relics to use, each also new and unique with that perfect edge of fun and nothing feels worthless.So, overall if you crave the olden days and tripple A hasn't been scratching your itch for awesome RPG like settings, or if you permanatly wear your nostalgia goggles I can recomend Shovel Knight to you.For Shovelry!

												Shovel Knight is by far one of the greatest ""8-bit"" platformers i've ever seen. It has slick gameplay, simple mechanics, fluid difficulty, an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic soundtrack, AND ACTUAL 8-BIT VISUALS (Not one of those attempts like the ones you see that take over 75% of greenlight. Go ahead and look. About 15% are minecraft clones, 5% are DayZ clones, and the other 5% are actual good games, and this is one of good ones.), and tiny bit of comedy here and there. I havent finished the game yet so i dont know if the game is either long or short, and I dont plan to look at any other reviews to check if so, but i do know that there is an achievement where you have beat the game in 1hour and 30minutes so i guess that just about explains it. Now i'm going to narrow down the game for you and will put a few shovel puns in here because I am a horrible person.You're a knight with a shovel. The shovel doesn't have mystical powers. It does have special abilities with just a few purchases, but all and all, It's just a normal, blue, steel(?) shovel, you dig? Your land is being taken over by a bunch of evil knights, and you could just take them down one by one, but oh no! Your partner is missing, so you have to do it anyway...(what???). But hey, don't throw in the trowel! With enough upgrades and support from the people you encounter along your journey, you'll surely dig those big bad knights a grave or two. (It hurts. The puns are actually hurting me.)I've been anticipating this game for a very long time now and was not at all dissapointed and I hope the developers at Yacht Club Games continue to make great games like this in the near future.9.5 out of 10			"

												First of all, I'm one of those people who wasn't in age to play the NES era, I always found it overrated by people who think that this was the golden era of gaming because they had full nostalgia glasses most of the time. I'm still a fan of games like castlevania, megaman or the mario series, but most of the other games are not very good and hasn't aged well in my opinion.Saying this, I love shovel knight, is a game that made a good mix of 8 bit gameplay with modern gameplay. This is a game where difficulty is skill related and not unfair like some games from the NES era. The levels are well designed, with tons of secrets locations that require some strategy to reach. Also the shovel mechanics are remniscent to the duck tales series, which is great since makes the plataforming very funny.Graphics are great, isn't like most indie games where one has the feel that they used nes sprites for laziness or skill rather than artistic direction. The animations are superb and do a good job on telling the emoions of some characters. I's true, Shovel Knight pulls things that couldn't be used on a real NES, but still, is a game that feels close to those game from the final years of the console.Music is also good, nothing to write home about but makes his job well. The writing is also well done, it has a great sense of humour and the story gets an emotional ending that will make you want for more.In conclusion, shovel knight is one of he best games that I had played this last year, is a proof that kickstarter games could work when you put realistic goals, and is a test that you can make 8 bit games this day that doesn't feel lke lazy jobs and that could get the status of timeless clasic,			"

												Great throwback to Nintendo 8-bit era. It draws inspiration from the legends like Mega Man but also brings so many new clever things to the table. Sharp and fluid gameplay, rocking soundtrack with good variety, great artstyle and level design. Offers a decent challenge that can be made easier with various different upgrades and powerups such as new ranged weapons with their own unique twists, invulnerability for a few seconds, or just simple health and magic upgrades. If you want to hunt all the achievements, you need to play the game without dying, upgrades or checkpoints. Could have used some more levels, but atleast now there isn't any filling.Must buy for any platformer or retro fan![Score: 87]			"

The controls are pixel perfect, the upgrades are fun and thoughtful - there is a relatively low skill floor, but high skill ceiling.  Most will find themselves quickly in the mashing downstab trap.

												SHOVEL KNIGHT REVIEWUpdated: (Includes New Game Plus and Plague of Shadows)Shovel Knight is a game by Yatch Club games, and the first I have played from them. Having seen a few previews, and hearing about it, Shovel Knight did look like an appealing game. Originally, I thought it was going to be just another ""retro"" style game, or rouge-a-like, which we've seen an entire flurry of in the past five or so years (many great, others not so much) so at first it didn't hold my attention as much. Having seen a trailer, prior to its release though, I saw great potential. Not only was it more of an action platformer (more of my genre) but the gameplay and presentation looked fantastic, so I had to pick it up there and then.My first impressions of the game were excellent. From the moment the title screen comes on, you are greeted to some fantastic chiptune music, which feels both fresh and new, but yet familiar and nostalgic. This game will definnitely appeal to people who grew up on the NES and SNES, but also anyone who wants to get into 2D platformers. I could easily go on tangents to talk about one thing to the next, but I'll seperate them into different categories.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay of Shovel Knight is what you'd expect from an action platformer. Your shovel is your main weapon, and it can be used both to bash enemies, as well as using it as a kind of pogo stick, to bounce off enemies and obstacles, much like in Ducktales the game on the NES. Speaking of which, the main influences I got from this game were Legend of Zelda (items and map screen), Ducktales (the pogo mechanic) and Mega Man (music and some stages). The jumping in the game feels slightly delayed, but having played countless amounts of old games on Nintendo systems, it's easy to pick up on it and master, like riding a bike. You start off on an intro stage, which teaches you how to play the game, by unfolding events, rather than the much redundant ""text boxes"" or hand holding, which most modern games have today. Shovel Knight makes you feel like you've learned, and earned those victories, rather than telling you what to do. You can also collect treasure either by finding them out in the open, or digging up certain rock and dirt piles or blocks. Treasure acts as your currency, and can be used to buy items in shops. When you die, you drop your treasure in floating bags, which makes you try and grab your treasure bags at the place where you died, or be penalised for dying by losing your money and not retrieving it. After fighting a boss, you're treated to a map stage screen, very much like Zelda II or Super Mario Bros. 3, where you get to choose which stage you want to tackle next, as well as visit the stores, which let you buy items that include health potions, shovel upgrades, armour upgrades, as well as anything that you'd normally expect in a staple RPG game. You don't level your character up per say, but you can buy upgrades. You also unlock spells, which you can use to turn the tide in battle. Certain items will replenish your spells as well. There are also collectable items and secrets in the game, which add as a completion bonus.GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION:Shovel Knight is a beautiful looking game. Crisp visuals with bright colours, and an 8-bit art style in glorious widescreen. This game doesn't look 8-bit just for the sake of popularity, its art style is beautifully crafted, and best represents its genre. I can't imagine what Shovel Knight would have looked like if it was in 3D (or 2.5D if you will) as I can't imagine it looking any other way. Each boss' stage is unique, and has a different colour palette, making each stage look unique. You'll fight in castles, underwater, deep dark caverns as well as up high in the skies.SOUND & MUSIC:The sound effects are what you'd expect from an 8-bit style, with attention to detail down to each characters' text box making a different sound when it scrolls. The music is absolutely fantastic. Composed by Jake Kaufman, with the help of Manami Matsumae (the same person who worked on the soundtrack from the first  two Mega Man games) the music has a very noticeable Megaman-esque influence, as it's bright and very catchy, with each stage having a different but just as memorable tune. If you're a lover of chiptune music, or video game music in general, I highly recommend getting the soundtrack to this game as well.

I'm not 100% sure if you get anything special once you get a 100% completion rate, but for those who aim to get everything, this game offers a lot of replayability, as well as multiple achievements to obtain as well. New Game Plus is offered for those who want an extra challenge. While the base game was quite challenging, it was quite fair as well, and it gave you many chances to learn and try again. This game is easy to learn, but hard to master, so those who want a much harder challenge, New Game Plus will offer that. With less checkpoints, tougher enemies, and more damage dealt upon you, NG+ is definitely more appealing for the ""hardcore"" gamers. Those who found the vanilla game a bit too easy, should definitely check out New Game Plus, as it is much less forgiving, and will have you trying again, and again, and again. This also extends the replayability of the game as well, and almost makes it feel like a new experience. There's also a pretty achievement for completing NG+.As an added bonus, Yacht Club games released an expansion pack for Shovel Knight, called Plague of Shadows. In this one, you play as one of the bosses from the base game, Plague Knight. With slightly different jumping mechanics, and a vastly different arsenal at your disposal, playing as Plague Knight offers a fresh take on the base game, and acts as a distinct play-through of the game, especially for those wanting something new after beating the base game as Shovel Knight. Plague Knight is an alchemist, with many different potions and tricks up his sleeve, and can purchase upgrades in the game very much like Shovel Knight can. You'll also get to see the story through his perspective, complete with some new characters that you meet along the way. Best of all, it's entirely free! In a game market of constant DLCs (Downloadable Content) it's refreshing to see a game company care for its players like this.OVERALL:There aren't many bad things to say about this game. While the jumping is slightly delayed (though it might be my controller/PC setup) it isn't much of a burden. NG+ did get repetitive when I kept losing over and over again in certain bits, but this happens with most hard games anyway. Apart from these minor issues, I can't say anything bad about this game. It has fun gameplay, great visuals and great sound, and it's a game that will make you want to complete it at least twice, which in today's market of ""disposable"" games, it's a nice thing to have. Even before the free DLC, Shovel Knight was already a complete game, and it didn't fall under the bad category of some games, where they release ""the rest"" after the game's initial release. What you get is a finished game, and it delivers. With the flurry of retro style games that have come out in the past, done almost for the sake of selling nostalgia, Shovel Knight surpasses all of that, and what we get is a fresh game that was made for the sake of being a great game. The retro style is not done for parody, and the nostalgic feel comes from within. Shovel Knight is a game that became an instant classic in my books, and to me is easily the best indie game that came out in 2014 (Plague of Shadows was released in 2015). So what are you waiting for? Grab thy shovel, and grab this game. I dig it!Overall Score: 9 out of 10			"

												I would say that nostalgia is the main selling point of this game and nothing else.It has a lot of ninja gaiden style cheap deaths with knockbacks and megaman instant death spikes, prepare to die a whole lot if you're not an uber leet gamer or you're getting too old to play oldschool difficulty games.I'd say taht it was worth the money I spent on it during witner sale, but i will not buy a sequel if there's ever one since I'm done putting myself through that kind of torture.This video pretty much sums up how I feel about Shovel Knight

												When I first saw this game on kickstarter, it was love at first sight. I backed it right away. And this game blew my ♥♥♥♥ing mind...The gamplay, the nostalgic grapich, the music!! Oh THE MUSIC!!!! It was so good I bought it in a pay what you want offer(paid 10 dolalrs to support they guy). It's so amazing that I can't stop listening to it. It's my only playlist for like a week.This game is a perfect 10 for me. It's just...I just can't...Everyone has to play this to realize really how good it is. My only problem with this game is the armor updrages. They aren't worth the money really but if you want an achievement you need to buy them all. I found me going back to a single armor just because it had a small benefit but it wasn't such a big difference. So maybe a DLC with more armors and gamepaly?Anyway but this and buy the soundtrack.

												Whether you're familiar with old school platformers from the NES era or someone who wants to try one out, Shovel Knight will be money well spent. An amazing soundtrack, simple controls, tons of abilities and gear, and level design that challenges your skills and holds a plethora of secrets waiting to be discovered by keen-eyed players, Shovel Knight is one of the best games I've played. The main game may be about 5 hours, but the number of ways to use subweapons and the ability to visit previous stages for extra money (or just to experience the banter between knights) along with a more difficult New Game+ feature adds to the replayability of the game. With a story that manages to be simple but complex at the same time, Shovel Knight has the right things in all the right places. Overall, a fantastic game that's super fun to play, and will bring enjoyment for anyone willing to give it a shot!			"

I've been having so much fun playing it; it reminds me of those good ole days of sitting on my couch with my buds, and ripping through levels on our favorite NES games - but with several distinctly modern conceits throughout.  This is how you to a retro flavored platform game.  I haven't had this much fun, or as big a smile on my face, since I unboxed Megaman 1 for Christmas when I was 11.  Worth every penny and more - I'd pick up anything else these guys decide to make. To the devs - great job.  Fantastic game - thank you for making this.			"

												Shovel Knight is everything I wanted in a retro-styled game. Everything about it is well designed and well implemented. I suppose Mega Man meets Ducktales is my best description; Shovel Knight can jump, slash, and do a ""pogo"" jump on the heads of his enemies.The game has pretty tight controls despite the retro look, and Shovel Knight is a flexible character that, despite getting lots of abilities through relics, doesn't need them. The game takes a Dark Souls approach to punishing the player for death, spurting out some money each time you die. That money can be picked up again if the player manages not to die before doing so.The game isn't very hard, but there is a little bit of a learning curve with shovel mastery. In a way, the game lets you make the game harder by allowing you to destroy checkpoints for cash, forcing you to restart at the beginning of the level if you break them all.Bosses are rather varied, especially considering the sort of game it is. Enemies are, too, as are the environments and obstacles. Shovel Knight can get a few upgrades to his weapon, and a few different armors with different effects. On top of this, he gets 8 ""relics"" that are optional (they don't come from bosses). Health and mana pools can be expanded and there are chalices that act as ""sub"" or ""e"" tanks, except that they are only filled from two particular NPCs and they have three different effects depending on the contents: full HP/MP, treasure magnet and invulnerability for 10 seconds.I wasn't expecting the story to really be much, but it's silly, light hearted and not all that bad.It's around the length of a Mega Man game or Ducktales for a 100% playthrough without a guide, which is about 8 hours, but the game can be completed in a speed run in well under 1:30 or so (there's even an achievement for it). There's a NG+ that makes the game more difficult, and there's a lot of Kickstarter stretch goal content that's not in yet but will be added as free updates later.This game doesn't need a pricecut if you're at all fond of the NES era, and it's well worth the $15 bucks even without the extra content in yet.

												Shovel Knight is one of my favorite games of all time. Granted, I'm biased because I helped Kickstart the game, but there is so much to love.Music is fantastic, the style is wonderful, the color really harkens back to the old NES days, and the game is just fun to play.For anyone who has seen Egoraptor's Sequelitis on Megaman X will appreciate the intro stage. Though, not as story driven as Megaman X (with the whole Vile Encounter), the intro stage offers JUST as much learning for the player. It's brilliantly designed. Just like the rest of the levels and how each stage works very hard to introduce new elements and lets you sweat over the perilous situations you're thrown in.I've seen lots of complaints about instant death. Well of course there's ton, it's a tough game. Are those stages beatable? Of course they are! Any skilled platformer will be able to beat them. Not to say you aren't ;) Just take a breather and try to recognize the patterns.The items were, I feel, very lackluster in comparison to the rest of the game. They felt ignorable, and situationally-important. You could beat the game without relics (there's an achievement for that), so they end up feeling quite useless. Tweaking some of the magic costs might help, but they really aren't that useful until you get the armor for them.Overall, one of the best games you can get today that really tip a hat towards good design. Also, I really liked the story for some reason. It's simple, neat, and I felt something at the end.Also. Butt Mode: ""X&BUTT"" Enter that in the name select screen. You'll probably love it.			"

												SHOVEL KNIGHT REVIEWUpdated: (Includes New Game Plus and Plague of Shadows)Shovel Knight is a game by Yatch Club games, and the first I have played from them. Having seen a few previews, and hearing about it, Shovel Knight did look like an appealing game. Originally, I thought it was going to be just another ""retro"" style game, or rouge-a-like, which we've seen an entire flurry of in the past five or so years (many great, others not so much) so at first it didn't hold my attention as much. Having seen a trailer, prior to its release though, I saw great potential. Not only was it more of an action platformer (more of my genre) but the gameplay and presentation looked fantastic, so I had to pick it up there and then.My first impressions of the game were excellent. From the moment the title screen comes on, you are greeted to some fantastic chiptune music, which feels both fresh and new, but yet familiar and nostalgic. This game will definnitely appeal to people who grew up on the NES and SNES, but also anyone who wants to get into 2D platformers. I could easily go on tangents to talk about one thing to the next, but I'll seperate them into different categories.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay of Shovel Knight is what you'd expect from an action platformer. Your shovel is your main weapon, and it can be used both to bash enemies, as well as using it as a kind of pogo stick, to bounce off enemies and obstacles, much like in Ducktales the game on the NES. Speaking of which, the main influences I got from this game were Legend of Zelda (items and map screen), Ducktales (the pogo mechanic) and Mega Man (music and some stages). The jumping in the game feels slightly delayed, but having played countless amounts of old games on Nintendo systems, it's easy to pick up on it and master, like riding a bike. You start off on an intro stage, which teaches you how to play the game, by unfolding events, rather than the much redundant ""text boxes"" or hand holding, which most modern games have today. Shovel Knight makes you feel like you've learned, and earned those victories, rather than telling you what to do. You can also collect treasure either by finding them out in the open, or digging up certain rock and dirt piles or blocks. Treasure acts as your currency, and can be used to buy items in shops. When you die, you drop your treasure in floating bags, which makes you try and grab your treasure bags at the place where you died, or be penalised for dying by losing your money and not retrieving it. After fighting a boss, you're treated to a map stage screen, very much like Zelda II or Super Mario Bros. 3, where you get to choose which stage you want to tackle next, as well as visit the stores, which let you buy items that include health potions, shovel upgrades, armour upgrades, as well as anything that you'd normally expect in a staple RPG game. You don't level your character up per say, but you can buy upgrades. You also unlock spells, which you can use to turn the tide in battle. Certain items will replenish your spells as well. There are also collectable items and secrets in the game, which add as a completion bonus.GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION:Shovel Knight is a beautiful looking game. Crisp visuals with bright colours, and an 8-bit art style in glorious widescreen. This game doesn't look 8-bit just for the sake of popularity, its art style is beautifully crafted, and best represents its genre. I can't imagine what Shovel Knight would have looked like if it was in 3D (or 2.5D if you will) as I can't imagine it looking any other way. Each boss' stage is unique, and has a different colour palette, making each stage look unique. You'll fight in castles, underwater, deep dark caverns as well as up high in the skies.SOUND & MUSIC:The sound effects are what you'd expect from an 8-bit style, with attention to detail down to each characters' text box making a different sound when it scrolls. The music is absolutely fantastic. Composed by Jake Kaufman, with the help of Manami Matsumae (the same person who worked on the soundtrack from the first  two Mega Man games) the music has a very noticeable Megaman-esque influence, as it's bright and very catchy, with each stage having a different but just as memorable tune. If you're a lover of chiptune music, or video game music in general, I highly recommend getting the soundtrack to this game as well. You'll have the tunes in your head for days on end.LONGEVITY & NG+:The game offers a lot of hidden secrets and items, for those wanting to get that completion bonus. I'm not 100% sure if you get anything special once you get a 100% completion rate, but for those who aim to get everything, this game offers a lot of replayability, as well as multiple achievements to obtain as well. New Game Plus is offered for those who want an extra challenge. While the base game was quite challenging, it was quite fair as well, and it gave you many chances to learn and try again.

With slightly different jumping mechanics, and a vastly different arsenal at your disposal, playing as Plague Knight offers a fresh take on the base game, and acts as a distinct play-through of the game, especially for those wanting something new after beating the base game as Shovel Knight. Plague Knight is an alchemist, with many different potions and tricks up his sleeve, and can purchase upgrades in the game very much like Shovel Knight can. You'll also get to see the story through his perspective, complete with some new characters that you meet along the way. Best of all, it's entirely free!

												The game is a classic.  Gameplay mechanics and stunning artwork feature endless homage to the best of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of retro platformer gaming.  The controls are pixel perfect, the upgrades are fun and thoughtful - there is a relatively low skill floor, but high skill ceiling.  Most will find themselves quickly in the mashing downstab trap.  This is ok.  You should do this.  Downstab all days.  Soundtrack by virt is unforgettable and catchy.  I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Do not mistake this game for another retro-styled plateformer, this one actulaly delivers and is probably already a classic : it takes everything that was good in the NES and SNES times, manage a perfect balance and respect your time. Shovel knight is a wonderfully crafted game where every level offers something different, be it mechanics, atmosphere or music  while giving you the player enought tools to play with. Contrary to the games of old, Shovel Knight dosen't use limited continues and lives, but rather make you loose money in case of failure and link your ability to take risks to the ingame economy, the same way Darksouls does. Even if this game is far from beign very hard, it dosen't hold you hand either and will require mastery and patience for you to unlock all the acheivements.			"

												I had been putting off Shovel Knight for quite some time now. I had worried that I would play Shovel Knight, which was supposed to be a true NES style experience and I would be disapointed in the same way I am when I go back to play a nostalgic game from my childhood. Sometimes you boot up that NES and realize,♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game just isn't what I thought it was.Luckily, Shovel Knight is a game that, how do I say this, it feels like the NES games you remember, even while you play it. Its phenomenal through and through. It eliminates the troublesome elements that ruin the nostalgic experience of playing old NES games such as bad controls, framerate drops, flickers, and unfair arcade driven difficulty.Shovel Knight was an absoute joy for me to play through to 100% progress in about 12-13 hours. The mechanics are fun as hell and before they have a chance to become tiresome you've earned some stellar upgrades that shake things up and allow customization of the way you play.The writing was great and fun throughout, my girlfriend constantly remarked on how adorable and cute things were.The art style was excellent and they made the old school feel new again with great animations and effects. The characters are master class pixel art and totally fun and unique.The game can be extremely difficult, but it mostly always fair and your deaths are usually a result of rushing or failing to regard the mechanics; the mechanics which you are introduced to a steady pace and are ramped up through the game.***** Plague of Shadows expansion ****After I completed Shovel Knight, I played the Plague of Shadows expansion where you play as one of the villains from the Shovel Knight story. This expansion was approximately another 8-9 hours to 100% completion. Just as the Shovel Knight campaign before it, it was excellent. Entirely new play mechanics are introduced throughout this campaign. At first they felt very clunky, but I think that was because I had just played the Shovel Knight portion. I very quickly developed experience with the new skills and found them to be an absolute blast to play with. The levels are quite different and have a variety of new and interesting mechanics to drive a playthrough as this new character. There are clever new collectables, plus some pretty cool easter eggs that explain to positioning of things in the Shovel Knight campaign.I found myself on several occasions getting giddy with joy when encountering characters from the first game and the incredibly clever ways the developers tied in a totally new story than runs parralel with Shovel Knights campaign. The ways this is handled are a riot and lead to many awesome and fun encounters with characters you love from the first game.** Conclusion ** I highly reccomend Shovel Knight as a standalone game, and with the *FREE* Plague of Shadows expansion it becomes even more valuable (plus there are two more boss expansions on the way). This is easily one of my favorite games of all time and I can't wait to see what the next expansion was like. Thank you very much to the developer Yacht Club Games for this astounding piece of videogame history.			"

												I dug up this gem today. Found it in my backyard while I was shoveling the remains of my deceased plants. I hit a rock, but that is okay because I was fighting with diamond and the only thing that beats diamond is another diamond. If diamond was in the rock paper scissors rotation it would be an automatic win. Shovel Knight is in all diamond, thats why he beats rock, paper, scissors, and even shoot. This game combines a lot of elements you see in the Call of Duty franchise such as The Adventures of Nazi Zombies, or Ghost Tales, and even Castlevania: Lord of Duty. This game gets a well deserved rating of Delicious out of Yummy. I would reccamend you have a powerful computer, so many bits.			"

												Shovel Knight is everything I wanted in a retro-styled game. Everything about it is well designed and well implemented. I suppose Mega Man meets Ducktales is my best description; Shovel Knight can jump, slash, and do a ""pogo"" jump on the heads of his enemies.The game has pretty tight controls despite the retro look, and Shovel Knight is a flexible character that, despite getting lots of abilities through relics, doesn't need them. The game takes a Dark Souls approach to punishing the player for death, spurting out some money each time you die. That money can be picked up again if the player manages not to die before doing so.The game isn't very hard, but there is a little bit of a learning curve with shovel mastery. In a way, the game lets you make the game harder by allowing you to destroy checkpoints for cash, forcing you to restart at the beginning of the level if you break them all.Bosses are rather varied, especially considering the sort of game it is. Enemies are, too, as are the environments and obstacles. Shovel Knight can get a few upgrades to his weapon, and a few different armors with different effects. On top of this, he gets 8 ""relics"" that are optional (they don't come from bosses). Health and mana pools can be expanded and there are chalices that act as ""sub"" or ""e"" tanks, except that they are only filled from two particular NPCs and they have three different effects depending on the contents: full HP/MP, treasure magnet and invulnerability for 10 seconds.I wasn't expecting the story to really be much, but it's silly, light hearted and not all that bad.It's around the length of a Mega Man game or Ducktales for a 100% playthrough without a guide, which is about 8 hours, but the game can be completed in a speed run in well under 1:30 or so (there's even an achievement for it). There's a NG+ that makes the game more difficult, and there's a lot of Kickstarter stretch goal content that's not in yet but will be added as free updates later.This game doesn't need a pricecut if you're at all fond of the NES era, and it's well worth the $15 bucks even without the extra content in yet.

												This deserved the awards it got. I love this game, and it's a shame I didn't discover this sooner. I recommend this to my friends and all those who want to experience a casual yet fun playthrough or a self-challenging game. Shovel Knight is described by the older players as a love letter to old 8-bit games and a refreshing nostalgic game bringing back childhood memories. But how about to younger players like me, whose childhood was focused on 3D console gaming? I didn't grow up with a lot of 8-bit games, nor have I completed any of them. But playing this was so fun that I brought my laptop everywhere to play on my free time. All of this is new to me, and I feel so thrilled!ControlsFirst, the game's controls were so simple I mastered playing by the end of the first stage. Unlike the other games I've played, I only have to use (my own binding) WASD, E, left arrow, and right arrow keys. Seven keys. The most I used was around twenty. Simplicity is elegance. ChallengesSecond, its challenges. This game has so many frustrating obstacles (lights off! pits! exploding stuff! surprise attacks! WIND! SPIKES! SINE DAGGERS! SCROLLING SCREENS OF DEATH! I hate you so much). All of these obstacles are cleverly crafted to be hard yet manageable, which when the player overcomes these, it gives a real sense of victory. Well, for me I found the wind physics and scrolling screens hard, but after pwning these parts I feel so happy. Then after completing the entire game thrice, I still feel triumphant.Story, and of course, SpoilersThe main campaign features Shovel Knight on a quest to save his beloved and constantly dreams of her. Simply put: he defeats powerful knights who he never intended to fight, but they're blocking the way to Shield Knight. He even gets to defeat the most powerful evil being in existence. He's a pint-sized dude about to burst from sheer badassery.In the first playable boss update, Plague Knight, an insane alchemist, is developed as having emotions and insecurites. He betrays his ruthless and powerful 'companions' to concoct a potion that can get him all he wants. Turns out he only wants the love of his crush and went his way to be stronger in order to woo her. Aww. His story ends with more heart-tugging and cuteness overload. This game is an excellent example of a vital rule in creative writing: show and don't tell. We get shown how Shovel Knight loves Shield Knight through dreams and (more subtly) gameplay. We get shown how Plague Knight deals with his inner demons (both emotionally and quite literally). In the ending montages, we see the other knights doing what they like to do/what's happening to them, and they all turn out so adorable and somehow, human.DevsFourth, the developers are geniuses. Aside from their good storytelling, they made the best DLC I have ever played, they are chipper devs and insert so much funny jokes in the game, and they have so much passion for this game. The Plague DLC was so great it felt like a new game all over again with radically different mechanics yet we know it's just the same. I have so much faith in them to create equally impressive storylines for the two other knights that are in the spotlight. MusicJake Kaufman's an excellent composer and manages to capture the feel of the stages he composed for. Pridemoor Keep's was majestic, just like how kingdoms are. The Lich Yard's was a blend of creepy and smooth. The Lost City's theme gives an explorer feel. Stranded Ship's song was funky and shows off a powerful thing. Clockwork Tower had a tech-y feel that it somehow reminds me of Portal 2. The Flying Machine's stage song is beautiful. Entrance's theme felt bombastic and victorious. Ascent was a quiet remix of the main theme, and you're so close to your goal. ????'s song was as creepy as Portal 2's Ghost of Rattman or SCPCB's ambience music. Then the finale boss, and the grand finale. Magnificent! Then we get new music for each Knight DLC. Plague Knight's new songs were a boatload of awesome. One felt clandestine, the others chaotic, and two so lovely and heartwarming. Considering that Virt mentioned in a youtube video of a let's play that he was going through so much at the time of these songs' creation, it definitely shows. He's brilliant, and the music is lovely. You should also go here for music, people.  "

												This game just screams 8-bit! The graphics are fitting, the music is awesome, and the difficulty is just right. The first level (which teaches you how to play without a tutorial :D) shows that this game is not messing around, that this game is tough. Also, after beating the first boss I felt satisfied, and a lot of games fail at delivering that feeling.The only con I can find is that the character just feels a bit slow when moving, but it's not a big deal.I would recommend this game to anyone. 9.5/10			"

												Shovel Knight is a amazing 8-bit platformer that takes major inspiration from other classic titles of the same genre like Castlevania,Megaman 2,Ducktales and Super Mario Bros but rather then just coming off as just an omosh to the classics of the 80s the game takes many of the tropes and cliches of those types of typical platform games and does something new with them. For an 8-bit game both the graphics and music in this game are spectacular and  adding a perfect blend of atmosphere and theme. Levels are also brilliantly designed all of wish match the Knight you are fighting Dispite this game being a sidescroller it has major replay value for one thing if your a completionist like yours truly their are songs,bonuses and Steam achievements to earn and if that's not enough theirs a DLC where you play as Plague Knight and Finally Though the game is difficult at times it feels very rewarding to hear that soothing campfire music every time you beat a level and theirs even a new game plus mode that makes the game ten times harder all worth  to see the Enchantress go up in flames a second time. my rating for this game is a 10/10 it's a perfect blend of nostalgia,fun and great platforming goodness			"

												Really awesome game, I loved it. When this was on kickstarter and such and people were showing it off on youtube, I didn't get too excited for it. When It finally came out I decided I would give it a try. It has been a while since I've played a game this fun. It's got action, romance, rivalry, all sorts of things. The story is solid, the controls are solid, the look is solid, the music is fantastic, if you like chiptune. This game took me by suprise by how enjoyable it is. This is one of the few games I would personally give a 10/10, the only other I can think of is Dark Souls. This game will hold a special place in my heart being such a fan of platformers. Very enjoyable, I believe everyone should give it a shot, I nearly guarantee you will ejoy your time spent with it.  Thank you Yacht Club, I can't wait to see what else you can create.			"

												This game is awesome. Truely a return to old school vania action straight up like an 8 bit Capcom game. Excellent humor, great items, good level design, and of course 80's style midi soundtrack. The soundtrack is written by Jake Kaufman (Ducktales Remastered) and Manami Matsumae (Mega Man) so the music is spot on for the feel of this game. It has the simple RPG elements of an old Castlevania game, the pogo jump of Scrooge McDuck from Ducktales, and each level is a themed stage ending with a boss like Mega Man. The world map is set up like Super Maro Bros 3 so you move across the world as you select which bosses to fight and which extra levels to clear. The towns in the game offer spots for the Shovel Knight to level up his weapon, armor, or to collect relics to add to his arsenal. The relics offer unique ways of fighting bosses, clearing enemies, or just skipping through the stages faster. This is a complete throw back to the old platformers of the late 80's and early 90's with a refined set of controls that are silky smooth. All of the elements come together to make this game feel like a genuine title from the NES/SNES days of plaforming glory. I will be playing this game until I perfect it.Hours to beat: 4-5			"

												Ok, I'l just be honest with this. I think Shovel Knight is a FANTASTIC game. The levels are EXTREMLY well designs and all completly unique and each bringing some new mechanic. The bosses are awesome and are unique as the levels themselves( My favorite is Specter Knight). But my few complaints have to be all the instant-death traps, always causing me to either fall into a bottomless pits, lava, and spites; Makeing me feel that my heath bar was useless, and some of the time you can't reclaim your money,and I died ALOT,  (Especialy Propeller Knight's and I have to give alot of respect to ANYONE that had completed the game without dying of falling into a bottomless pit). But that is about it. After the ever challenging final platform puzzles before the boss in each stage that I especialy always die on, you always feel the most satasfaction as you deliver the final blow on the Order of No Quater. And at the end of it I always want to do another level. And when you leave or finish the game, you always will feel, Wow, that was the best game ever. And I can't recomend this game enough.			"

												Shovel Knight is an excellent game. It pulls together the aspects of platforming that make the genre great, and then adds its own touches to make them even better. The art and music are beautifully well done, giving each level its own feel, and also creating a world to be immersed in. The story is not something that should be looked over, either. A story of heartbreak and vengeance. A quest to save his lost love, taken over by evil. The controls are smooth as silk and any mistakes or deaths are completely your own fault.  The only complaint I have is that it was a little short, but I can imagine someone getting a good 15 hours out of this game if they scrounged for collectibles and took more time to enjoy the little things. 9/10			"

												BEST RETRO GAME EVER 10/10Imagine Zelda meets Castelvania, meets Megaman, meets Ninja gaiden(the good one), meets Duck Tales, meets Dark souls.  Yep it's that good.   This game pays the ultimate tribute to some of the greats but not in a cheap knock off way. The pixel art is amazing and the level design and boss fights kept me pounding my fist only to feel rewarded with a swift dose of euphoria once I understood the patterns and got better.  Great job to the developers please make more games like this!!P.S I normally don't write reviews but this game was special.			"

												Basically, Mix together all the good aspects of Mega Man, Castlevania, and Zelda 2 into one. This game has every little jump and swing planned out with secrets everywhere. All in all, Shovel Knight is a love letter to the retro games of the past without overglorifying the fact that it is such. Just one suggestion.

												Shovel Knight is a ""retro"" game that's done the way it should be. The graphics have that artsy and yet truly-retro feel, the gameplay is fun and challenging with various secrets and reasons to replay, and the soundtrack is simply brilliant. From the very first stage you're already bathing in musical heaven. Also you're a knight, fully clad in armour wielding a shovel. Few games will offer you that role.And remember, only YOU can prevent forest fires.			"

												Shovel knight might be one of the best platformer games right now and could be one of the best games this year. The heavy emphases on gold and money is very unique because most games it is just get to the end, but in this game you want to get the money and gold to get secrets and power-ups. The power-ups can differ from shovel,armor,magic or health, all of these make the game more fun. The movement and the attacks feel very fluent and smooth even if you are using something besides the keyboard. Last thing for gameplay, the boss battles are a big challenge but fare at the same time and it feels good to defeat someone better then you.If you are someone how played and enjoyed Super Mario's 3, Ducktales and Mega Man you will love this game. The game has very funny dialogue for so of the characters and bosses. over all, Shovel knight is definitely worth 15 dollars and is very impressive for a indie game. I give Shovel knight a 4.6-5 as a rating, pick up this game if it even interest you.			"

												Been wanting this game for a few months now and I'm really glad I did. The game has that early NES game feel(of course it does, being based off of those): Super fun, but at the same time, very challenging, as well. Think of it as Super Mario Bros. and Zelda 2, but not as hard as Zelda 2. :p I recommend this game if you want a good challenge with some nonlinearity(sort of). As of writing this review, it's about $10 on sale, so pick this up before the sale ends!			"

All the mechanics and level designs are brilliant and fun, as is the 8-bit aesthetic, the medieval setting, the music, the difficulty (challenging but never cheap), the humour, etc, etc. I really dig it. Oh, and you basically get 3 seperate, fully-fledged campaigns without having to pay for DLC (and there's more on the way too). How cool is that? Yacht Club Games have really smashed it with Shovel Knight. Hats off to them.			"

												Easily my favorite game of the 2010s — so far. If you're looking for a grand adventure that will give you hours upon hours upon hours of enjoyment (and equal amounts of frustration!) then give Shovel Knight a whirl. It has three campaigns: Shovel of Hope, Plague of Shadows, Specter of Torment and a fourth (unnamed) campaign for the King Knight character. Four campaigns 100% guaranteed to give you hours of fun.If you like the Mega Man, Shantae, Cave Story, Metroid, Castlevania or Duck Tales NES then you're gonna love Shovel Knight! Alright, dig this jive daddio: Shovel Knight takes the level designs and boss rooms from Mega Man, game mechanics from Metroid, Castlevania & Duck Tales, the map system from Super Mario Bros. 3 and throws it all together in one mindblowingly fun package.I've had almost  40 hours  in this game, and it's never been a dull moment. Yacht Club hasn't let me down; I've thoroughly enjoyed Shovel Knight and I would recommend it to absolutely everyone... unless they get frustrated and/or angry easily. It's not that difficult, just be prepared to die a lot at first.I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the King Knight campaign, and I can't wait to see what Yacht Club Games has to offer with their next game.Kudos to the developers for making the most kickass game of the 2010s. I love you, Yacht Club Games.			"

												Shovel knight is one of the best games i have played in my entire life! Shovel knight has a mixture of old school games like megaman,zelda,castlevania,etc. It is so hard but in a good way, you will rage a lot but it is rewarding at the end. This game is so exciting and entertaining. Shovel knight has the same plot of every old school game, save the princess, kill the witch/villian.In shovel knight you try to save shield knight from the enchantress while trying to defeat other knights like king knight, mole knight, specter knight, etc. and you go on adventures trying to get gold to buy armor and new shovel upgrades, and triying to find music sheets to give it to the bard so he can exchange it with 500 gold. Shovel knight in my opinion is one of the best games of 2013 i'd give it a 9/10.			"

												This is a fantastic example of a solid retro indie game. It has a cohesive art style, intuitive gameplay that doesn't get old, and unique design to every level. With the original Shovel Knight campaign alone, I already thought it was a masterpiece. But Yacht Club Games decided to make two extra campaigns for two different characters, each of which have different gameplay elements and level designs... and they released them for FREE for people who already owned the game. That means essentially 3 times the content that was originally released, and it wasn't sold as expansions or DLC, it was given out in FREE updates. This is definitely a project that other indie developers should take notes from.			"

												   I would like to start by getting this out of the way: Shovel Knight is easily one of my favorite games of 2014. If you're a fan of platformers at all, or you've tried to go back and play classics and been put off by their difficulty, Shovel Knight is a perfect game to start with. While it looks retro, it does an incredible job of melding modern game design with familiar highly refined mechanics and controls to create one of the best games I've played this year.    The story is about 6 or so hours long and full of optional bosses, secrets in each level, and loads of entertaining achievements to try for that give you an extra level of challenge if that's what you're looking for. There is a ton of replayability here, especially considering there is a new game + available as soon as you beat the game the first time that makes the game significantly harder. Also, let's not forget the music -

			Track 1 Artist - Jake Kaufman You can buy the official release of the soundtrack composed by Jake Kaufman at http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shovel-knight-original-soundtrack and the game is available...

												After spending some time with the game, wich ive felt has been as much as a lifetime, Shovel Knight is the hybrid between The Legend of Zeldas exploration and Mega mans Level design creating a world like never seen before,the game is made as if it was a Snes title, what isn't cool about that.Each level is designed and theemed arround each boss that reside there, the game rewards the adventurous to explore the area with even more treasures than you would normaly find and sometimes consist Relics, artifacts with secret powers harnested from mana, obtained from containers found in each level or by fallen minnions.All minnions you encounter is well diverse, meaning dispite their similar appearance from one to an other they always have a trick up their sleeves, this doesn't mean they're not readable, once you figure out what they can do it wont take long until you know what they can't counter againstThe story is well writen and encurage you to continue the journey to the bitter end, atleast it gave me that feeling, can't be sure if anyone else feel the same.Shovel Knigt providesa great challenge from each playtrough you choose to do achive, offering well diverse feats ready to be completed by anyone willing to complete them, and if new game+ wasn't as mutch of an intrest, you can always play the story as one of the other knigts, including their own set of abilities and playstyle along with a different story than the Blue Burrower has.________________________________________________________________If you don't feel like reading trought most of this here's a simplified list:+Well written story.+Great level design.+Diverse enemies.+Multiple playtroughs.-Not much to hate about the game.________________________________________________________________This game simply proves that classics from the Snes era still stand strong after their time has passed, I greatly recommend this title for players who haven't seen any interesting platformers or if you want to jump back to when gaming shined the very brightest.11/10 Would smite thy foe with shovel, again!

												While I suspected retro indies were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this has proven the opposite to me.  I have never had such a joy in platformers ever since I played Mario Bros Deluxe on Gameboy color. The game looks cool, it got very simple but perfect controls and a remarkable soundtrack. It also got the classic difficulty of old platformers, which sometimes does feel a bit exaggerated (dying tens of times by touching spikes and falling in holes), but this could also be because I got used to the infinite checkpoints in modern style games. If you doubt whether you will like this or not, just think of how it was to play the classic Mario Bros.			"

												From every frame of animation, you can just feel the love that went into this game.  From the simple frames of Shovel Knights jump, to the intricate transitions of Specter Knight, you can see that this game was made by people that just love to make games.At its core, Shovel Knight is a mix between Megaman, Super Mario 3, Duck Tales, Castlevania, and Demons' Souls.  It's not so much a ""retro game"" as it is a love letter to video games as a whole.There's also a giant fish that dances to make potions.  He is my new favorite video game character.			"

												So basically, Mega Man, Link, and Scrooge McDuck walk into a bar. Mega Man gets into a barfight with Link who drank too much ""milk"" and tears his mega buster off. Scrooge feels awful about what happened to Mega Man so he finds him a shovel out back and teaches him how to use it as a pogo stick.That's what basically Shovel Knight is, and then some.Buy this game.

												Shovel Knight is a celebration of everything there is to love about platform gaming. Great level design, mechanics, music and there's even a bit of humour in it too. This game is a must-own and given its low asking price and that it's on nearly every platform at this point, you don't have an excuse not to at least give this title a try.			"

												Shovel Knight is a delightful reminder even today that the Indie Industry is still pumping out great quality games. Shovel Knight demonstartes this through wonderful controls that feel nice and are very responsive,great platforming that never feels cheap and you know you can do better, it also has an amazing score and the nostalgic graphics aren't bad but they aren't 3d models obviuosly. Shovel Knight is a must have for anyone who loves platformers.			"

												Incredible game!  So many games claim to be ""8-bit"" these days, but nothing has come as close as Shovel Knight in my opinion.  Apart from the widescreen aspect ratio and subtle parallax backgrounds, the gameplay is very NES feeling.  If you loved NES games like Mega Man, Duck Tales, Castlevania, etc., this game will hit your nostalgia button hard!  However, it's gameplay stands on it's own, and is far from a clone.The combat itself is simple, with a forward slash and down slash/pogo mechanic that feels very similar to Duck Tales.  Shovel attacks can be upgraded, and there are purchasable Castlevania-esque relics which give you magical combat abilities as well.  The map is structured like Mario 3, with main stages and mini-stages.  The stages themselves feel very similar in structure to both Mega Man and Duck Tales, with separate screens, lots of secrets, and engaging boss battles to conclude each stage.  The music is also very well done (and can be purchased on Virt's bandcamp for ""name your price"").  Shovel Knight is full of references to many NES greats, but it has it's own charm and feels fresh and unique in a really good way.I think the best feature of the game is the checkpoint system.  Checkpoints operate on a really nice risk/reward mechanic subtly reminiscent of Dark Souls.  The player has unlimited lives and checkpoints are free to use... However, you can destroy most checkpoints for extra gold and challenge (there is even a feat/achievement which encourages the player to complete the whole game by destroying all checkpoints).  I felt like the gold income vs. upgrade costs kept me hunting for gold, and encouraged me to destroy checkpoints for that extra income.  Yacht Club did a great job with this checkpoint system because it caters to both novice and expert players.  After you finish your first playthrough, NG+ mode doubles enemy damage and cuts over half of the checkpoints out of the game.  The best part about this system is that challenge is available for players like me who want it, but my young children can still enjoy this game as well.Lastly, in addition to NG+ mode, the game has some nice feats/achievements to add another layer of replay value (eg. destroy all checkpoints, finish the game without dying, finish the game in less than 1:30, and more).  There's also a hidden element to the game which adds a TON of new ways to play... For example, it's possible to run the game NG+, no starting items, faster movement, and 1 hit deaths!  I won't spoil anymore :)TL;DR... Buy this game <3			"

												The best 8-bit-like modern game yet. While it obviously takes a lot of inspiration from NES games, it has more than enough original ideas to have it's own identity. Aside from Spectre Knight's stage (which sadly has a shoddy ""lights on/lights out"" mechanic), every stage is fun, challenging and different. The New Game+ and Achievements/Feats add enough replay value. Besides all of that, the music is pretty darn great. Definitely get this if you like NES games.			"

												Shovel Knight ranks among the top of the heap of platformers.Any fan of retro titles like Megaman 2, Super Mario World, or DuckTales will absolutely love this game.Unfortunately with any retro platformer you can expect some difficult levels and areas of the game.The levels get progressively harder, but your skills will have improved enough to push through.No matter how hard or frustrating it gets, Shovel Knight is definitely a loot quest.What I mean is this: You will collect tons of cash throughout each level, and that cash can be usedto buy items, upgrade, and even more loot. The game does not use a lives system like most traditional 2D games,but drops cash every time you die. This may sound easy, but reclaiming your ~$1000 every time you die makes thingsmuch more serious. Many times have I gotten stuck on one screen of the game trying in vain to collect a bag of cash containing $600 and dying again.Money may be the main focus of the game, but that doesn't mean it is essential. Upgrade-less runs are entirely possible, albeit difficult. Even if you aren't attempting to reclaim any cash, you will still get stuck on some setpiece screens, fights, or jumping puzzles of the game. Early in the game I found a level that was particularly dificult compared to the rest and, unaware of the game's shenanigans, proceeded to spend 15 minutes trying to pass 1 checkpoint.			"

												This is probaly one of the best platformers ever made, and for so many reasons this review might take you a while to read, but it will hopefuly let you know this game is definately worth the buy! So obviously your wondering what are the game mechanics? It's a platformer with basic ""shovelry"" combat, also with magic or ""relics"" you can use to access secret rooms or fight enemies, the whole gameplay and mechanics are completely original, ive never seen a game with some of these before! Next would be the soundtrack, which if you planning on buying this is would buy it too, you'll see what I mean once you start going forth into the game! Imagine a game with the tecnology today and graphics and music capabilities, and putting it back into the older style of game, these people have done that perfectly, it has a retro look and theme to it, but it doesn't feel any different from a game today. I could sit in my chair typing on and on about how great this game is, but I'll leave that to you, to play the game and experience the true fun shovel justice this game has to offer!Also, theirs two campaigns, yep... TWO campaigns... Did ya buy it yet? :)10/10 From me, great soundtrack, mechanics, story, and shovels!			"

												Shovel Knight was a game that I have followed from day one, and unfortunately, could not support it through Kickstarter. I always knew that it was going to be an amazing game that easily surpasses other games attempting to be retro, yet fresh. I'll say it now, Shovel Knight is the best game that I've played in years. This game's controls are all SNES-TIGHT (that's a good thing). You can easily follow the momentum of Shovel Knight as he runs and jumps. The difficulty is perfectly in place for the era it is portraying and truly feels like a SNES game. The penalties for dying aren't unforgiving, but it's enough to make you think twice before running around without precaution in certain areas. In the game, you have to collect treasure to earn money and buy upgrades for your health, magic, and equipment. This adds a very nice drive to exploring all of the secret areas available in order to become as strong as possible. On top of superb music, bosses, level design, and a ""perfectly basic story,"" (in the sense that it's not complex because it doesn't need to be for this type of game, which is another good thing) the shovel is what makes this game EXTREMELY unique; you can do so many things with it, like finding magical weapons that a hidden merchant will give you in secret areas of the levels throughout the game. Everything about this game is absolutely fantastic! I literally walked away from this game after beating it with nothing bad to say about it. If you are a gamer that appreciates well-made retro games, it is an absolute must-buy that I would recommend everyone playing.			"

												(TL;DR at the bottom if you don't wanna read the review.)What do you get when you combine years and years of gaming childhood, put it in a blender with a bit of modern charm and let it spin for a long time?You get Shovel Knight, an action-platformer inspired by Mega Man, Ducktales and Castlevania, although, it's really, really, really a lot of Mega Man.Once upon a time in a unknown land filled with danger and treasure, there were many adventures and adventurers looking to earn their fair share, but none were as good as Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, both had a lot of treasure and had a unbreakable companion ship, however, after attempting to bite off more than they could chew, Shield Knight got sealed in The Tower Of Fate, Shovel Knight wakes up to her not being there, and goes into a life of grief, with no proper heroes to fend off the evils of the land, the Enchantress hired seven knights with selfish interests, (Kinda.) and together, they formed the Order of No Quarter, and as evil starts to consume the land, Shovel Knight steps in to put an end to them, and defeat the Enchantress at the Tower Of Fate.So...how many of you are getting NES excuse plot vibes so far?All of you?Good, that's the point, Shovel Knight puts a lot of it's focus on it's gameplay and presentation, it's a huge love letter to old NES games and it starts by focusing on the core essentials of a game like it.The graphics are very dedicated to keeping a NES feel while also not sacrificing certain things for fidelity such as paralax scrolling, although, it does try to keep it's fidelity of certain harmless limitations, such as when the player jumps in front of the HUD and instead of the HUD going over the player, the player goes over the HUD, due to old SNES games making the HUD be part of the background sprites, the color pallete is also very limited, with only a few ""cheating"" colors.The music, composed by Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman i- I DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING, JUST GO LISTEN, IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING RIDICULOUSLY GOOD, THERE IS NO YMMV HERE, ALL OF THEM ARE GOOD IF NOT INHUMANLY FANTASTIC.My personal favorites are ""Fighting With All Our Might"" ""An Underlying Problem"" and ""The Decadent Dandy.""The gameplay...oooooh boy...it's...well...Ever heard of the trope ""Nintendo Hard"" ?Yeah.The game owns up to the glory of NES difficulty, but not to ridiculous levels, just enough to make you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, but never enough to make you ragequit, however, there are some problems with the ""NES difficulty"" part, y'see...Due to it being inspired by Mega Man, it also copies the whole ""level gimmick"" thing, now, there is a difference in having a bottomless pit with platforms, and having a underwater bottomless pit with spikes on the ceiling and platforms that float upwards to make you hit the spikes.Yeeeeeah, the game can be kind of a little TOO hard with the fidelity sometimes, to the point of it even being a bit unfair, some levels can be very hard and trial and error, but while those are passable, THE TOWER OF FATE; ASCENT CAN GO BURN IN A FIRE AND THE GUY WHO DESIGNED IT SHOULD GET ONE LESS PENNY AT THE END OF THE MONTH FOR IT.Oh, and you can also get different armor, relics and upgrades to yourself and your shovel using the gold you find in levels, although, you can just grind the first level over and over and you will have all the money you'll need.Putting aside a it's few flaws, Shovel Knight is a fantastic game, and I urge you to try it, the developers are constantly putting a lot of love into it and there is free DLC content on the way, although, I'm not sure when, and one of them have been released as the Plague Knight campaign.TL;DR Shovel Knight is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic, play it right now.

												I didn't expect much because 1) these 8bit games are being done to death lately, and many are unfortunately a lazy cash grab, and 2) a bunch of annoying hipsters on my list (who weren't even alive when these games were ""cutting edge"" rather than retro) would not shut up about it.All that aside, it's actually kind of ridiculous how good Shovel Knight is. Like, its almost unfair to other games, in the way that you can have some reasonably attractive girls at work/school, but they don't get noticed because this new smokingly-hot babe is making them uglier by comparison. Everything about Shovel Knight IS the best of the NES era. It feels mostly like Mega Man and Duck Tales, with hints of Mario 3 and Castlevania, but it manages its own identity as well, to avoid coming off as a nostalgia gimmick.The attention to detail (if you're impressed by 8bit detail) will blow your mind; the whole game is carefully and lovingly crafted, and this starts to become apparent after the first platforming level, when you can explore some of the minor RPG elements within the towns.However as much as I'd like to say it's perfect, I'd have to subtract at least 3 points for BLATANT lack of difficulty. This game is enjoyable from start to finish, but insultingly easy. This is the only area it fails to live up to its NES inspirations.Oh sure, I died here and there, but it was always due to unexpected knockback into spikes/pitfalls. There is a New Game+ which apparently provides greater difficulty, though I haven't noticed enough of a difference to make me feel like playing through it again right now. One of my favourite things about the game play, is it never provides you with a true ""double jump"". Side Rant: I bloody HATE double jumps. They can work in SOME genres, like perhaps a ""metroidvania"", but never a straight platformer. Putting a double jump in a platformer automatically removes 95% of the difficulty (and this game's easy enough) so merely for avoiding that obnoxious bandwagon, I have to award a bonus point to my arbitrary score. I'll call it an 8. With a higher, and better balanced difficulty, I could easily see this being a perfect 10.    "

This game is absolutely amazing! I had been waiting since the inital announcement of the game and it did not disappoint. The visuals are fantastic. The controls are super responsive and easy to use, and the levels and bosses are all creative! Would highly recommend this game to anyone who is look for a retro-style side scrolling platformer in the same style as Castlevania, Mega Man or many other classics.			"

												While one might argue that Shovel Knight doesn't do anything new; what it DOES do is incorporate a bunch of things you already love into a concentrated beam of platformer/RPG goodness. The best way to explain Shovel Knight is in terms of other games, so here's what we've got:--Super Mario Bros 3 style world map (including random bonus levels and bosses that shuffle around).--Super Ghouls n' Ghosts style platforming, combat, and level design--Duck Tales style cane jump (now a shovel jump of course) and treasure collecting--Dark Souls style experience systemAs you platform and shovel-battle your way through each level, you'll want to find and collect as much treasure as you can get your hands on, since treasure is equivalent to XP and can be used to purchase upgrades.Much like Dark Souls, however, if you die at any time, ALL OF YOUR GOLD will be dropped and you'll be sent back to the nearest checkpoint. You have one opportunity to make it back to your gold and recollect it or you lose it permanently.An interesting twist that is NOT like Dark Souls is that you can actually DESTROY the checkpoints in the level, which gives you a hefty chunk of treasure/XP, but prevents you from using that checkpoint. (If you die, you'll be sent back a LONG way.)There are villages on the map where you can spend your treasure to buy HP and MP upgrades. There are also upgrades for your armor and your shovel. You can also purchase various tools and relics (used to cast spells).The levels in the game start out challenging, but they can get seriously difficult in some places. The first two bosses (the Black Knight and the King Knight) are pretty simple, but once you get to the third boss (the Lich King), the difficulty ramps up quite a lot. The boss battles are well crafted as well. They provide a lot of challenge, but the bosses have patterns and exhibit ""tells"" for special attacks, allowing you to learn the boss' techniques and develop your skill at them.While most of the game succeeds at being very challenging without resorting to cheap surprises or death traps, some of the later levels use tactics that will definitely try your patience. In true Dark Souls spirit, prepare to excessively curse and repeatedly protest that you've had about enough of this bu||sh!t only to keep playing anyway. With both Shovel Knight and Dark Souls, it begins with trying to win for fun; and it ends with trying to win because F*CK YOU, MOTHERF*CKING GAME. F*CK YOU RIGHT TO HELL.Ah, good times.You can replay levels (including boss fights) as many times as you want for extra money.Visually, the game appeals to your nostalgia, but the gameplay incorporates many popular conventions from modern games.It's an RPG platforming adventure, and it's a pretty good time.

												A game that brings you back to your childhood. Awesome gameplay reminiscent of classic NES platformers, with some brilliant 8-bit graphics and a fantastic soundtrack. This game is certainly a labour of love, and has a certain charm that just has to be experienced. It's a standard platformer; with hidden treasures, magic abilities, unique bosses and enemies and a shovel.Can you dig it?			"

												Shovel Knight. Where to begin?Well, first off, it's a platformer. But when you mix platformer AND RPG with story? That's hard to do. But Yacht Club Games created an amazing game with all those elements. You can gather collectibles, buy upgrades, discover secrets, talk to the villagers, and watch a Giant half apple half fish dance for you. Shovel Knight is probably one of my favorite games of all time. If you enjoy fun, clever, and old-school games, you have to get shovel knight.			"

												I was varsity fencing captain in highschool. I won a lot of bouts in both foil and sabre styles, and I was pretty good at it, just to toot my own horn.“James, why are you bringing this up? Just to seem awesome to us readers?”Well, yes. That, and so that I can talk about how a sword feels in the next couple of lines. A sword, let’s say a sabre, feels powerful, and is relatively flexible. It can do both crushing and cutting blows, and is able to cover all five quadrants of your body – Your left shoulder/torso, your right shoulder/torso, your right lower body/leg, and finally your left lower body/leg – effectively and quickly“James, where are you going with this?”Patience, dear reader, and you’ll see. Where was I? Ah, yes. The sword has been used by knights throughout history because it’s a versatile weapon for close quarters, as well as agile and powerful. Whereas lower ranking soliders would be given spears, which were easy to use, the sword required finesse and training to use, as well as (due to the level of skill required to use them) showed the stature of the user. Anybody good with a blade gained prestige based on his combat skill. Famous swordmasters are remembered today, such as Bonetti, for his Bonetti’s Defense.These are great reasons for why a knight would use a sword in combat. Yacht Club Games aren’t paying attention to those, though. They gave the main character of their game a shovel, and it just works. Weapons that are used for a gimmick in games usually turn me off, but in Shovel Knight, it’s used well and feels effectual and powerful to a degree that I greatly admire. Throwing you into the first level, in a way very similar to Mega Man X, and not teaching you anything about how to play, Shovel Knight has you in the action immediately, and learning the controls as quickly as you can, just to stay alive. It teaches these in a very simple manner, with you having time to learn the controls at to adapt to what is being thrown at you in a way that teaches you as you play. This gets the tedious tutorial portion of the game out in a manner that is both enjoyable and fast. It sets up all of the mechanics that you’re going to need, from basic attack functions, to your ability to jump onto bubbles and use them to jump higher, which becomes incredibly important in later parts of the game, when trying to reach out of reach places.After you defeat the first boss in this first level, you’re taken to the Shovel Knights camp, where he is dreaming. A woman is falling from the sky, and you get a message saying “Catch her!”. After catching the woman, Shovel Knight wakes up, and he’s off. Little more is said about the falling woman, at this point. After leaving his camp, you’re teleported to an overworld not dissimilar to the overworld of Super Mario Bros., where the gorgeous sprite of Shovel Knight walks between stages. The first is The Village, where Shovel Knight can buy upgrades and talk to members of the civilisation you are trying to save. This is also where the main collectible of the game is introduced; musical pages, which are hidden all over the game, and once unlocked, reward you with gold and the ability to play that song at will from the bard in the main village. In the village, you also have the ability to buy health and mana upgrades, and new items. There’s a lot more to do there, but I want you to discover it on your own, the game is chock full of secrets.After leaving The Village, you are presented with two levels, both of which are doable immediately. There’s a locked gate that comes down after defeating both of these stages, and two areas that have secrets to them that you can figure out for bonus items and gold.Each level has you facing off against a boss, and is themed around that boss. The first boss I faced was the King Knight, who fancied himself a king, and lived in a castle with some griffons and knights. His level was pretty straight-forward, with lots of twists and turns to go and find more items, which harkens to the games Metroidvania aspects. It’s possible to find items by exploring, so I highly recommend that, as these can come in extreme handy.The boss fight against King Knight was again pretty straight forward, but difficult. He has lots of dashing attacks and stuns, and made for a fast paced battle, one that I enjoyed thoroughly. Each boss has his own unique music to his stage, and also to his boss battle, and these were also fantastic.The boss fights and the stages so far have all been varied and interesting, in their unique styles. The next stage I played, the other one before unlocking the gate, featured levels that were totally dark, and only light up lighting. It was terrifying and challenging, in ways totally different to the first. This variety and change is one of the things that Shovel Knight does so well, and I love the game for it.Shovel Knight delivers platforming puzzles and combat in a way that is just amazing. It couples of the excitement of dodging a swift attack with the thrill of learning an enemies attack patterns, which leads to a thrilling combat system. As well as this, they incorporate the main characters weapon, his shovel, very well. There are spots that have dig-able dirt on them, which rewards with gems and other rewards. As well as this, Shovel Knight is able to destroy certain walls with his shovel, opening up more avenues to explore, which you need to remember if you’re one of those people that wants every last thing in the game.As I mentioned earlier, level design is phenomenal, with parts set up to teach you what will be hindering you in a fair manner, so that you’re not standing with your hands on your hand yelling “NO FAIR!” when you’re killed. Everything is telegraphed, with tricky mechanics shown to you before they are really bought into play. One example of this is during the Mole Knight level, where a green gel puts out fires. You see a slime that is on fire jump into the green gel, and he’s instantly put out. This subtle but poignant hint shows how to solve the next couple of rooms, and is only an example of the way that the game teaches you mechanics. Few games do this that well, and it’s fantastic to see ones that do.Artistically, Shovel Knight looks like an NES game, and it’s awesome. Spirtes are well animated, everything has character, and everything looks like it has been lovingly crafted. Musically, it’s the same. NES-style music, with each zone having it’s own tune, as well as the bosses. Jake “Virt” Kaufman has delivered a masterpiece, as well as Manami Matsumae who also contributed to the project. I would feel amiss if I didn’t mention the sense of humour in this section about the “non-gameplay elements” of the game. The game takes it self in a very self serious way. It stands true to the world it’s created, and treats it as if it’s deadpan humour. One example is the Kickstarter Reward gallery, The Hall of Champions, where you have to pay 5,000 coins to get in, and when leaving, the owner says “That’s what you get for backing something without any knowledge of the end product.” The writers know exactly what they’re doing there, with a subtle wink at the Kickstarter backers in saying “Hey, this is what you guys did. Silly people. ;)”. The story is coming together as I play more and more of the game, but it’s so deep and twisting that I don’t really want to reveal much of it.Shovel Knight is loving crafted, by people that obviously played the Sigma out of Mega Man X, and that beat the bloody tears out of Dracula in Castlevania. Fans of those sorts of titles owe it to themselves to pick up Shovel Knight at the earliest opportunity, as it does them great justice, and in certain areas, even improves upon them. You can pick up Shovel Knight on Steam, and on the Yacht Club Games website using the Humble Widget for $15.99.Reviewed for Indie-Love.com "

												This has all the awesomeness you remember from old NES classics, but without the Nintendo-hard difficulty (mostly mitigated with checkpoints and unlimited lives; you just lose gold when you respawn, with a chance to recover it). The game is VERY reminiscent of Mega Man classics in gameplay. You, Shovel Knight (aka. the Blue Burrower) have to defeat 8 enemy knights (with names like 'Spectre Knight' and 'Plague Knight') before you can enter the Tower of Fate and challenge the evil Enchantress. Ducktales is also a big influence. You collect gems for money, and you can pogo on enemies with your shovel. Castevania and Zelda mechanics are also borrowed, the towns are basically from Zelda II, and the map is reminiscent of Mario 3. The developers also said Dark Souls was a big influence, but I haven't played it so I couldn't say how. Unlike many modern retro-style games, this one isn't overtly a parody of other games, and instead plays the ""knight with a shovel in a NES game"" setting pretty straight.If you have good memories of classic NES games and like platformers, this love letter to classic NES games is a must play.

												This game is like the culmination of ALL the classic, best NES games you had in your library during the late 80's to mid 90's. It got the art style down perfectly (though the color range is not as limited as the NES, thank the gods), the music is authentic and absolutely amazing, and the controls are tight and satisfying as all hell. It's a perfect platformer, action game that also makes any 90's Kid nostalgic deep inside.But here's the ingenious, oh so beautiful thing about the game: It never needed the nostalgia novelty, the NES 8-bit grahpics, the chiptunes, or even the limited NES controls, to actually be so amazing. It's a damn fantastic game, long enough to not overstay its welcome, and every level is designed perfectly for forcing you to master said controls, and new elements.So it may be a tired notion of Indie games using pixel art to pitch itself, but this is a case where the developers had a great game as a foundation, and then made it look and sound like a great NES game... not the other way around. Substance over style here, and damn is the style awesome!			"

												Before Shovel Knight was once a proposed product, I never actually helped kickstart a project before. This was the first game that made me feel confident enough to help invest in the project when it was still very early in development.Many months passed, and now it's finally out. How does the finished game hold up? Astonishingly well, actually. It successfully delivers on the promise of a true old-school, NES-style game with mechanics borrowed from classics such as Mega Man, Ducktales and Zelda II. There's even a bit of Super Mario Bros 3 style overworld map and patroling enemies thrown in for good measure. Also makes the rare accomplishment of emulating the look and feel of a real NES game, whereas most modern-made retro games only manage to capture the look and feel on some level, but not quite all there.Only critique I can give is that sometimes you might find yourself letting go of your left/right direction while trying to hit down for the downthrust attack, but the most recent update rectifies this by allowing you to remap the down key to another button, if you so wish.I can say with confidence that I am proud to have been one of the thousands of backers that helped get this project off the ground. Absolutely fantastic game, and one that I will likely be finding myself revisiting time and time again.			"

Shovel Knight: A Vibrant Homage to the Successes of the PastThis game draws in influences from the era of 2D platformers on the SNES and outputs a modern, beautifully crafted game that would be attractive to those whom are veterans of the genre or newcomers alike. The game revolves around you, the Shovel Knight. Your objective is linear in story but wide in scope. Stop the ""Enchantress."" As she has taken over the land. Yes, not groundbreaking but the story works for this game. The narrative is not even the primary focus, yet it has been entwined with fantastically witty lines and subtle references which offer a tribute to the era of video games it draws in a large majority of it's core concepts from.Gameplay is quick, but not twitch like. This is not your twitch reaction platformer, this is not Super Meat Boy. The game allows breathing space for thinking and planning before moving across the stage. Your repetoire of moves consist of a shovel strike and a Mario-esque curb stomp from above. Extra abilites like shooting fireballs for example; can be aquired later into the game.The world map is a spitting image of Super Mario 3's. A top down scrolling area of different locations you may choose to conqueor. Your main hub is the town. The town is where the RPG element kicks in. As upgrades to your health and magical power can be purchased from merchants, along with other little things here and there. If you are looking for a vast expanse of customisation, this is not the game for you. The gameplay, first and foremost focuses on completeing area after area and slaying boss after boss.Speaking of levels, the difficulity of the game rivals that of older ninja Gaiden games, stage after stage of environments and enemies for you conqueor. A somehwat generous health pool and semi-frequent checkpoints offer some saving grace from death and gold that is lost on death is able to be re-collected from the place of your demise. Boss fights lay at the end of every level and is one of the things that Shovel Knight really gets right. Every fight challenges you and most importantly, the bosses react to your movements, if a corrupted knight boss see's you try to hit him from above, he will quickly dodge back into the air for example. Fights are long enough they provide a sustained challenge and the repotoire of their moves is varied enough for the fight to feel fresh and exciting on all fronts. The music that accompanies Shovel Knight are orginal chiptunes that suit the area your are venturing in and provide a wonderful background to your quest. Shovel Knight is a platformer, through and through. The vibrant bit graphics and charming narrative provide a wonderful base to some of the most smooth, fluid and inituitive platforming gameplay I have seen in years. The game started off as a wonderful Idea in the first place but Yacht Club Games really polished it to be one of my favourite games of 2014 so far. Hands down. No number score because this game can't be limited to a arbituary value out of 10 but I reccommend it. "

												This game completely took me by surprise. I expected it to be good, but it outshined itself in every element. It was miticulously crafted from start to finish and was assisted by the fantastic soundtrack. Each level has fantastic artwork and design and the boss battles all feel unique. The game itself is short (at a run time of around 5-7 hours) , but the new game plus mode after the game's ending improves the run time a great deal. If you get Shovel Knight, don't expect to stop the game at the end of your first quest. NG+ has a great challenge to it with double damage to you, no health pickups (save for your own chalice), and half as many checkpoints as before. It'll make boss battles very difficult, but never frustratingly enough that it feels impossible. The lack of a lives system (instead of losing lives, you lose a portion of the treasure you've obtained) also improves this feeling. You can recover the money you lost from each death if you get back to that point without dying. This element never makes the death feel painfully brutal like the games it is inspired by, but keeps death with enough meaning that you still desire to get back to the point you failed to pass.All in all, the game proved itself to be a real joy to play and well worth your time and the $15 cost. I cannot wait to see what Yacht Club has in store for the game's further developments and their future projects.			"

												If Mega Man and Super Mario Bros 3 had a love child with the hero from Wizards and Warriors, it would be called Shovel Knight.  Everything glorious about 8-Bit gaming with fun bosses, inventive stages, and fun abilities make this a retro gaming hit that brings every bit of nostalgia it should given the design.  The stage design feels incredibly Mega Man inspired, with backtracking and hidden passages if you want to scratch that completionist itch.  Game layout, overworld map have a very SMB3 feel.  And to top it off, your weapon is a shovel that you beat enemies in the face with when you're not using it as a pogo stick.Plus... synchronized swimming dance scene with a giant fish.  No, seriously.  Just buy the game.			"

												This game.Oh my goodness gracious, THIS GAME.Before I got Shovel Knight, I knew little to nothing about it, and I was actually deciding between buying either this or Rayman Origins. A friend suggested I get this instead. I did so.My already high expectations (as I had heard it was really good,) were blown away by just how masterfully crafted this game is.Imagine, several fondly-remembered NES platformers (Mega-Man, SMB, Castlevania, etc.) were merged together, slowly but surely.It is then carefully finished up as all of the awful tropes we hated in said games (sudden unexpected deaths, weird stiff controls, etc.) are picked out and thrown away.Now imagine it being coated in original ideas, an AMAZING soundtrack (I'm a sucker for amazing music,) and a whole lot of heart from the dev team.With this, you get Shovel Knight.The difficulty is surely not child-level, but suprisingly not hair-tearingly frustratingly difficult. I beat around half of the bosses of this game on the first try (Including some I'm sure infuriated others possibly, (coughcoughpolarknightcoughspecterknightcough) but not because they were too easy to me, oh no. They were damn hard, to be sure. But it was because the game is so fair with its difficulty. You remember those days in NES games when you were given like, no reaction time to an enemy's attack, or a trap that instanly kills you?Yeah, this game has NONE of that. If you die, it's on you: It still has many places where you can instantly die here, oh yeah, but it gives you just barely enough time to quickly react to them all.This game takes all the good things in old games, only the good things, and adds in a special, original flair of its own.TENOUTTATEN.

												+ shovel knight is challenging- the game is not really skillbased you just have to memorize the level layout and boss attacks+ boss mechanics are innovative- there's no urgency in any bossfight, you can just wait for a opportunity, attack a few times, back off, wait, repeat  the game doesn't reward you for optimizing your interaction with the boss and taking every opportunity. Bosses don't have a soft/hard enrage. So while bosses might appear hard at first, soon they'll get really boring once you figured out how to cheese them.+unique characters, fighting with a shovel is awesome- characters are really limited in the sense that they always do the same thing. Either you can just talk to them, which is useless, you can buy something from them, which can be useful, or you fight them, there's no real character development+there's multiple ways to beat every level- due to the nature of the game, levels are really linear+there are many relics- most relics are kind of useless, or only used once in gem levels- at the beginning gold is kind of scarce but useful for health upgrades and your first relics, but later on gold becomes useless because a) you get a lot of gold b) the item system is kind of bad in shovel knight. You can only buy a few shovel upgrades, and there are no clear armor upgrades because there's no armor value in the game. Expensive armor always has a disadvantage, and the advantage it provides is minimal. The best armor in my opinion is the red one since it's simply an upgrade with no disadvantages.+ shovel knight is a good homage to old school games- because of that, there are many outdated mechanics that just feel frustrating, even jumping feels really weird oftentimes Get this game if you enjoy old school games and don't mind being challenged a bit, otherwise skip it imho			"

												I usually post steam reviews in portuguese, but since I wrote this for another website, here it goes:You play as shovel knight, and your goal is to reach the enchantress and save your old partner, shield knight. In order to do so, shovel knight must defeat eight members of ""The order of no Quarter"".Shovel Knight is very much inspired by our beloved classics. Mario, Zelda, megaman, castlevania, it's very easy to see how shovel knight has been inspired by all of these games, but all in the best way possible. The best thing shovel knight inherited from those games is the marvelous level design. The tutorial level is wonderfully done, teaching you the basic mechanics without the need of a message or even a button display. Even in later stages, the game will never put you in a dangerous situation without teaching you first, something that megaman in particular was always known for.The overworld map looks a lot like the Mario Bros 3 map (there are even wandering enemies with special fights or stages), and you can usually choose the next stage from 2 or 3 avaiable, and visit the villages, where you can buy upgrades, relics and equipment with the gold you got on the levels. Relics basically works like spells, but there are also chalices that can hold liquids which will grant you one time effects (like the bottles in zelda). You can also upgrade your shovel, but there are only three upgrades. One of them makes sparks come out of your shovel while you're at full health (zelda again). There are some different armors too, but I felt like just one of them was really useful, so in terms of upgrades the game could do better.Shovel Knight is great, and as far as I'm concerned it deserves the praise it's been getting. Combining the best elements from classics, with great boss fight and some beautiful animations, it's pretty easy to recommend this game whether you enjoyed the classics that inspired it or not.			"

												Shovel Knight is absolutely NUTS.  I heard it was godlike, I bought it, and then I played it. Here’s the scoop:Shovel Knight is a retro 2-D platformer that is heavily inspired by other great platformers from back in the day like Mega Man, Mario Bros. 3, Ducktales, and Zelda ll. Your goal is straightforward: save your companion Shield Knight by defeating the 8 knights from the Order of No Quarter and the Evil Enchantress (think Robot Masters from Mega Man). You get to adventure through awesome levels, collect jewels to upgrade your health, magic and weapons, and face off against awesome bosses. The gameplay is simple, but it is masterfully crafted and it’s absurd how much fun I had playing it.Shovel Knight’s soundtrack was done by Jake Kaufman (who composed the music for games like Shantae, Mighty Switch Force, Ducktales Remastered) and Manami Matsumae (Who composed the music for the original Mega Man).  With that said, this soundtrack is TOO SICK.  Each level has an awesome retro style that sounds like it came right out of the NES days and any gamer should be able to appreciate it.One thing about Shovel knight that surprised me is how easy it is to get into. The controls are great, and the game mechanics are intuitive and easy to grasp. There is also a godlike checkpoint system. Most old school platformers give you a number of lives and if you die too many times, its “GAME OVER, YOU SUCK, BACK TO THE START”.  Shovel Knight instead places checkpoints throughout the level, and if you die, not only do you not have to play the whole level again, but you only lose some money which you can collect if you make it back to it. Getting rid of the lives system eliminates a lot of frustration, which is sure to please many.It also surprised me with how replayable it is.  I probably played through the game 8+ times because there were so many different ways to play through it. I played a No Death run, No Relics run, No Spending Money run, New Game+, and a bunch more.  It also helps that the game was so fun that I COULDN’T STOP PLAYING IT.  Shovel Knight even has cheat codes that add more ways to play the game. Ridiculous.To be honest, Shovel Knight is actually too much fun.  They might as well just ban this game from the market because it is illegal how good it is.  Shovel Knight has charm, it has style, it has sick tunes, it has sick gameplay, and there’s even more free content on the way. I recommend it to anyone who likes video games, and if you’re a platformer fan, then this game is an essential to life. To put it simply, if Shovel Knight was a type of fertilizer, it would be grade A+, all-organic horse manure.  Thank you for reading this review.			"

												Murder things with the mightiest of all weapons...a shovel, which earns a 10/10 in my books for weapons. Game is entertaining, if not frustrating to play (especially a certain flying area) but worth to play. bought back in 2015 but I'm lazy but the price isn't worth it unless the plague knight is a good experience but I have yet to play it.*Update*Plague knight is fun to play and has a lot more play styles and abilities (still the flying area is annoying especially the boss) but does it deserve the price? Yes and no as while it is fun to playit is worth t if you want the game BUT it should hopefully be worth the price when the next character is available so looking foward ot that.			"

												It didn't click with me.I know this is on me, and I'm offering my opinion here as a recommendation for those with similar tastes. It's not that the game was too hard, nor was it particularly badly designed.It was just too slow and overly methodical for me. It was overly obsessed with precision to the point where I personally felt it was at the detriment of fun. I think what really leads to a lack of a recommendation is that it's disingenuous and untrue to itself. It's visually reminiscent of Duck Tales (and other, similar 8- and 16-bit games) but it plays more like Super Meat Boy or I Wanna be the Guy.Now I'm not saying that I feel that it was misleading, nor am I saying that they falsely advertised. What I am saying is that it feels like it has a split personality and it creates a dissonant vibe for me as I play it.On the one hand, it wants so badly to look like an updated version of games I used to play. It strikes the closest parallel aesthetically with Duck Tales for the NES (due to Scrooge's pogo walking cane attack), but the heart and soul of the gameplay is indubitably contemporary and similar to other equally modern indie platformers.This identity crisis made it even less appealing to me as it felt oddly patronising. As though I would be too small-minded to accept it had it gone with a less familiar aesthetic. I don't like feeling patronised by my games. Maybe this, too, is a failing on my part. Perhaps it's just a paranoid insecurity, but whatever you think it just didn't sit well with me. I can imagine that there might be others who could feel the same way about it.I also understand that a lot of the fans just simply won't be able to grasp these complaints, and they'll create their own to argue against based upon misunderstandings of my perspectives. This is the Internet, you have to expect that.The thing is is that I'm not saying it's a bad game. I'm just saying that if you're like me it just may not sit well with you. Where something like Freedom Planet is completely honest about itself and confident in that to the end, for which I love it, Shovel Knight is more like a hustler that's trying its best to manipulate me into liking the game it is rather than being honest about the game it is.That doesn't mean it's a bad game. That just means it's a dishonest game. I don't like games that are so untrue to themselves. I feel that lack of confidence and I don't know how I'm supposed to have confidence in it if it has none in itself.I recommend this game to anyone who wouldn't have these issues.			"

												The only things this game has to recommend it are charm and nostalgia for the ""NES-hard"" era. If you want a NES era platformer that ignores all progress games have made since 1990, but with slightly nicer graphics and more audio channels, then Shovel Knight might be for you.Let me start by saying I have a high tolerance for difficult games. Dark Souls and Super Meatboy are both in my top ten. I enjoy a challenge if it feels tough but fair. Shovel Night is tough, but it is not fair. You will die a lot in this game and at least half of the time you will feel like the death was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is due to a combo of game mechanics that have died off in the past 25 years: Instant death pits and knock-back when you take damage. These mechanics should have stayed dead, and should never make an appearance together. They were not what made Castlevania or other NES games fun. They were ways that companies padded out short games when the industry was still young and we didn’t have better ideas. The combination of these with the randomness of some enemies will result in a lot of cheap deaths that pad out the games length. The main “skills” required here are patience and time. Given enough tries you will finish even the most unfair sections or bosses. And then at the end you might feel slightly accomplished. Maybe? I feel like I learned most everything I needed to in the 1st hour of play, I don’t think the four hours after that really increased my skill at the game all that much. It didn’t give me a feeling of mastery when I beat something, it game me a sense of relief. “Glad that’s over”Overall, in spite of some charm, I don’t like this game and can’t recommend it. Nostalgia is no excuse for discarding the many new game design ideas since the NES that this game throws in the toilet. Pros:Great first hour. Play that, then stop and just imagine that the rest of the game is like that.Nice Art & SoundCharming worldCons:Frustrating/unfairNot much mechanical depth to masterMostly useless gadgets/upgrades. (I only ever used 3)			"

												IT'S SO GOOD. The controls are tight, the graphics and animations are gorgeous, the dialogue's glorious, there's the right amount of challenge with generous health and mana pickups, and the items are completely optional extras (the phasing mechanic's super broken, but whatever, you can just ignore it. Would be nice for it to last a little longer and be a lot more expensive so as to avoid it being an absolute crutch). Save for the additional areas designed specifically for them, you'll never be forced to use the items in normal play. On that point, though, they greatly compliment them usual stages, so don't think for a moment they're just non-viable throw-away pieces of junk.The tutorials? What tutorials? The levels are expertly crafted to introduce each concept and obstacle-- heck, they even give you the tell-tale signs of secrets you should keep an eye out for in the beginning --so you're never completely overwhelmed, yet suitably pushed to a comfortable requirement of developed skill. You'll feel like you're given the driver's seat right away, but you'll likely never feel as though you're out of your depth.And it's not all platforming in this game. Bosses, bosses, so many bosses. Additional bosses, secret bosses, roaming bosses, bosses at the end of every level; you won't be able to move for bosses! Each with their own uniqie gimmicks and tricks, you'd be pushed to have a bad time when one appears. Each is a delight to behold, and great fun to learn and fight.This is honestly my favourite game of recent memory. It's far better than any classic SNES game could have even hoped to be, and the creators' time, love and devotion oozes from every pore of the game. Buy it now.UPDATE: The Checkpointless achievement is indeed on the fritz. Smashed and looted all of the checkpoints (including the ones nestled away in corners), even finished the last boss again in case of badly placed triggers-- nothing. Very disappointing, considering all the hours I've sunk into getting past those couple of poorly designed traps flawlessly (blemishes on an otherwise 10/10 experience of a game). It's a testament to the overall quality of the game when I can only think of three throat-rippingly bad insta-kill areas, but still. It's very disheartening to see this kind of thing, and extremely discouraging in terms of trying the rest of the achievements.In addition to the reported achievement issues I've been hearing about (and experiencing on a smaller scale), New Game+ is actually an incredible let down. Enemy damage is ramped up, there are less checkpoints, almost all food is replaced with bombs, and you receive less refreshments in that one encounter. All of these are limitations you could more than easily place upon yourself by simply refusing the help the game already gives you. Save for the bomb thing. Good luck trying to punch yourself in the face.The fact that this lazy NG+ was actually a stretch goal of the original campaign smacks of something I can't quite define without using extravagant absolutes.Hopefully this'll all be patched in a future update. All I know is, I've run out of Shovel Knight to play. Sad times. (Sell me DLC plz).			"

												I can honestly say, without a doubt this is one of the most solid, well made, and fun platformers I've ever played. The controls are perfect, the graphics are incredible with each stage getting their own theme graphically and musically. The music is so amazing that it was one of the driving forces to get to the end because I wanted to hear what awesome music would accompany the amazing stages. Also, while this game can get difficult it is extremely fair, and no death ever felt cheap or that the game decided it wanted me dead for no reason.If you want adrenaline pumping shovel action mixing together some of the finest gaming mechanics with some of the best music and graphics then buy this game. You will not be disappointed.  "

												if you are interested in a game that is a tribute to old sidescroller games, but has awesome music, amazing level design, intelligent enemies, and RPG aspects; then you should buy this game now. The controlls are extremely responsive, and like dark souls, the game does not hold your hand, the game is only difficult until you find a strategy to suceed ON YOUR OWN, without the games help. This aspect i love and makes victory so much more exilerating. I would recommend this game to anyone who liked dark souls, or mario, or any old sega genisis game. This game is truly nostalgic. And even if you have not played these games and have money burning a hole in your pocket, i would check this game out. 8.5/10 (a really good review from me)			"

												This is a beautiful example of how video games can be fun, hard, and exciting all at once.  If I screwed up a jump, I know exactly what screw-up happened.  If I died to a boss, I knew I had to learn its patterns (which are godawfully obvious after trying it for so long!) It teaches through gameplay, not through tutorial prompts or quicktime events.  There's some annoyances here and there like sine wave missiles or autoscrolling sections, but if the music doesn't pump you up enough to push through it then you're playing the wrong game.Case in point: Shovel Knight did its job.  It went over and above doing its job.Extra case in point: THE MUSIC. HNNNGH.  SO GOOD.			"

Throw that in with a hilarious cast of characters, great story, items/upgrades, world map similar to Super Mario Bros 3, absolutely beautiful visuals and an amazing sountrack. This game has everything a 2D platformer could ask for and more. It is well worth the $15 and there is going to be a bunch of added FREE DLC thanks to the goals it reached on the kickstarter page from about a year ago.

												Having just finished my first playthrough of the game, I can confidently say that Shovel Knight is one of the best games I've played in recent memory. It's reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by as it was consistently hyped up to be, but surpasses other modern games that attempt to follow that old school formula: Mega Man 9 and 10 immediately come to mind. Each stage feels unique, each boss is well-designed, and the game slowly ramps up in difficulty enough to stay interesting but without such a high difficulty curve that it gets too frustrating. The soundtrack is fantastic, again reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by. The game's sense of humour (and writing/dialogue in general) is charming and got a chuckle out of me a few times; talking to NPCs is always a treat, even the nameless ones. I don't want to comment on the controls too much, since I used a PS3 controller that's seen better days, but they may take some getting used to depending on what 2D platformers you've played most recently.Basically, I couldn't recommend Shovel Knight enough. If you're a fan of 2D platformers both old and new, you owe it to yourself to pick up Shovel Knight. Whether you have nostalgia for these kinds of games or not, I guarantee that this is one of the games that people will be taking about when they talk game of the year, and it's worth every penny of its current price point.

												I heard about this game and its Kickstarter over a year ago and 'backed' it. I was not disappointed. At all.Shovel Knight tips its hat to retro platformers by its amazing visuals, astounding soundtrack, and extraordinary gameplay 'feel'. The controls are tight and natural. I would compare them to Ducktales for the NES. Attacking and movement reminds me of Castlevania; you should be calm and collected and plan your attacks and jumps.So, grab your shovel and dig right in. Bury your enemies. This game is a gem and you should not take it for...granite... Too many shovel puns? I don't care. If you grew up on platformers like I have, BUY THIS GAME. Don't let this one get...buried...in your wish list. Ok, I'll stop.			"

												To call it a simple 8-bit platformer would be doing it a disservice. Shovel Knight is so much more, a beautifully written love letter to the NES era and a nostalgic trip through old school, paying homage to its predecessors while (if you'll excuse the lame pun) ""digging"" its own fun niche in the genre. It's challenging without being too frustrating, and it controls smoothly. If you love a good platformer, pick this up and give it a play.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. It's about as Mega Man as you can get without actually being Mega Man. The music, art, and just about everything else is supremely well done. The base game is challenging without being terribly hard, but through what relics you use and what you do with checkpoints you can crank up the difficulty quite a lot. Probably my best purchase of the year so far.			"

												Not only my favorite game to be released in 2014 but one of my favorite 2D platformers of all time. Gameplay is a combination of NES games like Mega Man, Ducktales and Castlevania. The World Map is similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 and the town are similar to Zelda II.If you're a sucker for old school platformers like I am then Shovel Knight will definitely not dissappoint. Well worth the 15 dollar price point. BTW the soundtrack is amazing!			"

												As a startup game designer myself, this is the kind of quality game that I hope to create some day. Something that obviously has months and months of care and hard work put into it, regardless of how simple the game is. Shovel Knight is in short, a joyful walk down NEStolgia days with inspiring tight gameplay, beautiful and admiring pixel art, and an abundance of incredibly polished chiptune music. I was a kickstarter backer since it was announced, and I was very worried with the few delays they made, but the final product has proven to be 100% worth the price of admission.You play as an adventurer Shovel Knight, our pogosticking protagonist who's searching for his long lost companion Shield Knight. Both of them were exploring the mysterious Tower of Fate, when the dark magic of a cursed amulet cast them out and sealed the tower. When Shovel Knight awoke, Shield Knight was no where to be found, but instead The Enchantress has risen to power and spreads evil across the land. Now Shovel Knight must quest out on a search for his long lost companion. Also in his way are several other cleverly themed knights in an ensemble known as ""The Order of No Quarter"", each with their own unique character and fighting specialties. The gameplay itself is a side-scrolling mixture between NES classics like Mega Man, Super Mario 3, Castlevania, and DuckTales. It also happens to take some modernization from newer games. For example: there are no lives per se, but instead when you die, three money bags spring where you bit the dust, and you must recover them to save from losing any gold a la the notoriously difficult Souls series. Along your journey you can spend gold you collect to upgrade your shovel to perform new attacks, or purchase different armors that all have different effects. You can also buy relics from a traveling salesman which allow you to shoot fireballs, dash in mid air, and go invincible for a short period of time among several other abilities.The art is very impressive for that 8-bit pixel look that so many developers are caught on lately (myself included). The animations are very characteristic and help bring the game to life with ease. The game can almost guarantee a giggle the first time you see Shovel Knight dig through a treasure chest. Speaking of the giggles, the dialog is extremely humorous and doesn't allow the game to take itself too seriously. It tries for the casual joke or two at the expense of actual game knowledge, which helps make the game feel more alive and interesting. These two components help seal the game and bring it to life. However, there are a couple reused assets for enemies. For example different mage enemies, and rat like enemies are made different only by their color palettes. A small nitpick to an otherwise gorgeous and endearing world.Finally, the music is possibly my favorite thing about the whole game. Jake Kaufman(Shovel Knight's composer and OCRemix veteran code-named ""virt"") is bound to have put himself on the map with this soundtrack, and with the help of Manami Matsumae(Mega Man composer) it's really no surprise. Each tune is specifically designed to run on actual NES hardware and helps secure that classic retro feel to the game. Thus, the music in this game not only shines, it radiates light in every way. Every level has it's own distinct composition, while each boss has a remixed version of that same song. It's instantly catchy chiptunes will have you hook, line, and sinker throughout all of the almost 50 compositions. Jake has also been kind enough to offer the entire soundtrack, as well as a second full arrangement album from various artists, each for a ""you name it"" price tag on his BandCamp page.Shovel Knight is an astounding achievement that just plain works. Every person attached to this project put their heart and soul into the game, and it shows in every way. Rarely do I say that an independent video game has a shot at making it to Game of the Year status, but Shovel Knight easily digs its way to the top of the list. A must-have gem in any Steam, 3DS, or Wii U library. (9/10)			"

												I don't just recommend this; I heartily recommend this!Boy did they nail the design on pretty much every aspect of this game.  Tight enemy and level design of the calibre of the early Mega Man and Castlevania games; mix that with modern slick controls and graphical smoothness, a rockin' soundtrack from the legendary Jake Kaufman (and original Mega Man composer Manami Matsumae, and steep but smooth difficulty curve, this game delivers one incredible experience.Each new checkpoint feels like an accomplishment; each stage, you know you've learned how to play the game better; and each boss, you've learned how they think inside-and-out.I could keep rambling, but that's probably just going to distract you from the 'Add to Cart' button.  Yes, that green up there.  Press it.  You won't regret it.			"

												This game is awesome, an example of how to due a good throwback to simpler times while at the same time updating the mechanics to fit with modern times, Shovel Knight can be enjoyed by just about every platforming enthusiast. The sprite quality is terrific, being both detailed and beautifully animated, the soundtrack is an absolute joy to the ears, the difficulty is challenging, but at the same time forgiving, and there's plenty of fun hidden treasures to be found alongside a harder new game plus. The main drawback is the games overall length, if you don't bother clearing some of the game extras, it can be as short as 3 hours, but for the nature of the game, I think it complements it perfectly, as it makes it easier to go back to for replays (similar to NES platformers). I have nothing to complain about it really, truly a wonderful time.			"

												A wonderful homage to the old fashioned games we grognards grew up with, Shovel Knight combines excellent platforming action with tight controls and a wide variety of equipment to keep what is otherwise a short game interesting and varied. Perhaps most impressive is the fact that the old style graphics and music were not done as a shortcut or to make things easy; they were clearly done out of love and affection, and the work is of high quality throughout. The quirky, off-beat humor is tastefully done and never wears out it's welcome or grows stale, and the game turns a few of the age-old tropes on it's ear in surprising (and excellent) ways. Overall, a solid investment that's worth the investment, every penny of it. Shovel on, friends.			"

												A really good 8-bit platformer much in the same vein as Mega-Man. It can be incredibly challenging but the save system makes sure you don't get sent to far back for each attempt.That said, the later levels require a level of precision controls that the game is lacking. You notice it the farther you get that there are delays after certain jumps or attacks or both that can cost you a life. In turn, this can make the later levels far more frustrating than they ought to be.			"

												Inspired by classic NES games without being hindered by the limitations and lack of design wisdom of the age, Shovel Knight is an absolute gem that doesn't hinge on nostalgia to be enjoyable. It's about the length of a Mega Man or Mega Man X game, but, in my opinion, a bit easier. There's a decent amount of side content beyond just the boss levels, and user-options to make the game more difficult (such as beating the game without the use of relics). The levels are well-designed and there are very few ""cheap"" moments. Boss designs, both aesthetically and functionally, are fantastic.Like old-but-good NES games, it's short, sweet, and has plenty of replayability.			"

												This game brings to the table a lot of things I do not see from indie games that are aiming to be 8-bit. Yacht Club knows exactly what made NES games like NES games, and rather than just copy their concepts, they skillfully synthesized them into levels. Mechanics are inspired by previous NES titles such as Zelda 2, Duck Tales, Megaman, but it never feels copied so much as it feels inspired and fresh. I especially love the checkpoint system that rewards skilled players for taking risks.The soundtrack is absolutely ASTOUNDING in this game. No fake chiptunes, this is genuine 8-bit sound emulated using Famitracker, and it shows! For a personal favorite track I also list La Danse Macabre. Level design and difficulty are spot on, with Specter Knight's stage being the only real spike in difficulty I actually noticed. The rest of the game is smooth like silk, and death, while not a serious issue, can sap your wallet fast should you not adapt.If you're still reading this, go buy the damn thing. Whether or not you fall 15 dollars in debt, you'll feel like this game is worth all of it, and maybe a little more.			"

												Shovel Knight is one of those games that after I finish, I wish up to the heavens for there to be a sequel in a few years or sooner.Shovel Knight is a great Mega Man-like clone, with little bits of story here and there, but the main focus here is the gameplay aspect.Your main weapon is a shovel, which doesn't really sound right, but it makes sense why. Throughout stages, you can dig up piles of dirt that reveal treasure, which you can then use to buy upgrades, armor, and helpful items to give yourself a boost for that one area that really makes you want to break your keyboard or controller.I disagree when people assume that graphics make a better game, because those people are wrong and are judging a book by its cover.Take a look at the old NES games, and tell me that graphics make a good game.Shovel Knight is a take on the old 8-bit classics we all grew up with and loved to play after school and on summer vacation.Everything is there, the 8-bit graphics, chiptune music, and the difficulty: YES, I said difficulty.This is a game at times makes you want to rip your hair out, but with trail and error, you succeed, and you feel satisfied. This game gives you satisfaction when you finish your goals.Modern games today don't really serve any kind of punishment for failing, they just keep holding your hand, giving you handicaps all the time; there is no challenge anymore.Shovel Knight is a great gem of a game that deserves its praises; everything about what makes a game a game is here.This soon-to-be modern classic, hopefully get the sequel it deserves.

												Shovel Knight deserves some major praise. Something about it didn't let me stop playing. I sat down and beat it start to finish, non-stop. (Okay I had to pee once) I'd like to blame it on nostalgia, but the only thing truly unoriginal oldschool thing about Shovel knight is the 8-16 bit style. I suppose you could say the boss fights remind you of Megaman. The overworld reminds you of Mario. But there's relics, secrets and technical combat you don't really get from those games. Shovel your way to riches and hoard it until you can afford the ever increasingly expensive upgrades. Search for the relics, which will not only give you combat advantages or movement boosts, but provide useful for future secrets and challenges. The gameplay is just different - and in a good way. You wield a freakin' shovel!GUESS WHAT, THOUGH. There's a STORY to Shovel Knight and it's awesome. You lose you beloved Shield Knight (f) and have nightmares about saving her. You battle your way to the Evil Enchantress who has either captured or killed Shield Knight. Black Knight, your rival, runs into you often along the way. You must defeat the Order of No Quarter in order to proceed to the Evil Enchantress, which consists of different modded Knights with interesting and often humorous characteristics. I started Shovel Knight expecting to screw around. Decided to do some playful voices and be dorky with it. Maybe rush through it, being all tryhard. But I ended up falling in love. At some point I forgot I was doing voices and really got engrossed in the entire situation. I'm glad I was streaming because this is a game I want to remember. It's on YouTube as a playlist now, for those interested. It took me about 4:45 to beat the game fully.My favorite part is how well Shovel Knight teaches you how to play without directly telling you. Every level introduces a new mechanic, and there's always a part on each level (especially the tutorial) that teaches you new things. And you'll have to reapply the things you learned at a moment's notice.As far as challenging yourself... When you die, you release what seemed like 1/3 or 1/4 of your gold. Think of it as a more forgiving Dark Souls. You can go back to where you died and pick up that gold. Alternatively, there are checkpoints on each level. If you feel like the level is easy, you can actually destroy the checkpoint crystal for gold. If you do well on the level (I'm uncertain on the specifics, could be not dying or taking damage) the crystal changes color and holds more gold the more you pass without defeat. So you can also get accumulative growth in gold for taking the risk of removing the checkpoints.Shovel Knight has great functionality IN SPADES....... Just play it.			"

												Right off the bat, Shovel Knight is an amazing 2D platformer game, and easily one of my favorite recent games. The game has a strong reminiscence of early Nintendo games, a lot like Megaman, Castlevania, and The Legend of Zelda, while producing it's very own unique storyline and gameplay. Playing as the titular protagonist 'Shovel Knight' as he goes on a quest to rescue his beloved Shield Knight, you progress through many different stages of the game, all ranging from plains, to a volcano, underwater, in the air, and more; the levels are very detailed with hard boss battles and plenty of secrets. The game overall gets progressively hard and I cannot express how many times I would get frustrated over my deaths. You're able to purchase useful relics, armor and weapon upgrades, have the ability to use magic, and find collectible music sheets; there's also random boss encounters and side stages where you can do different tasks. I totaled myself up with 12 hours lonesome on this indie game, and enjoyed everything about it. Even though the game came out in 2014 and has retro-styled graphics, I thoroughly loved playing it and is a great example of how these retro games can still be dominant over others. From the cliché, yet original, storyline and characters, to a wide range of useful trinkets, the game is a must-play whether or not you've ever played old-school Nintendo games, or retro games in general.

												When it comes to Kickstarter I've always been rather skeptical, unfortunately it's become a bastion for hacks to make broken promises and release unfinished titles, which makes me apprehensive to ever donate to any Kickstarter title. Shovel Knight however is the exception to the rule, as the most polished title I've ever seen come from a Kickstarter campaign I can definitely say that this game comes highly recommended and with yet more free content on the horizon, Shovel Knight is the gift that just keeps on giving.Clearly inspired by the NES era of gaming and with obvious nods to the classics of old (specifically the Megaman series, a fond favourite of mine) this game delivers on all fronts. With a quality sound track, imaginative art direction and larger than life characters, this challenging platformer delivers on everything it promises. I had been looking forward to this game for a long time and picked it up at launch, but waited to write a review because I was so impressed with it that I really wanted to do it justice. After experiencing some recent disappointment with hyped up Kickstarter titles (namely Hyperlight Drifter) I felt now was the best time to share my love for Shovel Knight in the hopes that more passionate developers will find inspiration in the example set by Yacht Club Games and that indie gaming can return to being less about unwanted hipster drama and more about quality gameplay from developers who genuinely care about the medium.If being impressed by the base game wasn't enough Yacht Club released the first of a number of free DLCs in the form of Plague Knight's adventure, one of the bosses from the base game whose story you can now play through to see how he ended up in the position he's in when you encounter him as Shovel Knight. Not only did this DLC manage to be surprisingly different from the base game both in terms of how Plague Knight plays and offering his own seperate story, but it also managed to keep things fresh by having a very different feel and adding a dash of extra humour to the character to make the initially creepy Plague Knight actually seem surprisingly sympathetic, funny and dare I say somewhat lovable. This leaves me very confident that the upcoming DLC adventures will by just as polished and I have to say I am really looking forward to them.Shovel Knight is easily up there with the best of Indie titles, alongside such great games as Cave Story and Freedom Planet, I really can't recommend this game enough! For those of you who have fond memories of the NES era and younger gamers who want a retro experience, you really can't go wrong with Shovel Knight, so do yourself a favour and get shovelling for shovelry!

												You take the best bits from Megaman (8 boss themed stages, ridiculously catchy 8bit tunes) and you mix it with some Mario style overhead level selecting (including extra areas and extra boss encounters) and top it off with some lite RPG leveling mechanics, and you got an amazing homage to the 8bit era. The platforming is engaging, with treacherous enemy placement and a down attack mechanic that boosts your height. The combat is simplistic, but with a regular stream of new relic abilities, ensures an ever expanding arsenal and mobility enhancements. There's a few too many insta-death areas which will increase your frustration level, but this is classic gaming where pattern recognition and memorization are the name of the game. Plus it has a very forgiving checkpoint system, about 5 per stage, which is about 4 more than you got back in the day. Not only does it look the part, but this is old school gaming at its best.			"

												A nice little title that about saving worlds and shoveling loot--recreated as an NES game but with a few more colors on screen at one time. The pacing is a bit off early on. You get infinite lives, but every time you die there is a steep phat loot penalty--causing you to try to reclaim dat loot from where you died. All in all though, if you like Duck Tales mixed with Zelda and a dash of Super Mario for good measure, then this game is for you.:Tips to avoid pulling hair out over losing dat phat, phat loot:-The fishing pole can grab dat phat loot that looms over chasms after you've died.-Keep a yellow potion to snag other phat loot you don't have time to grab.-Sometimes, if it's a tough area--and the save station is a ways back--it might be best to let dat sweet phat loot go until later. I know you gotta get all dat sweet phat glorious loot but the phatest loot can be grabbed more easily with other sweet phat gloriously triumphant looted relics later in the game.... after they've been looted most phatedly.

												Simply one of the most overwhelmingly well-executed games I have ever played. Charming, funny, brilliantly designed, satisfyingly concluded, Shovel Knight's quest (which has, by the way, distinct Arthurian undertones) is one that will stay with you for a long time. The art direction and music deserve special praise: the soundtrack is megaman-esque, but with more fantasy oriented sounds. I never tired of hearing the music for each level. Propeller Knight's level's music is an example of perfeclty matched sounds to the style of the level, in my opinion. The look of each level is very distinct, which to me more than makes up for the fact that there are a relatively small number of them---I was excited to play each level as I got to it, and to be honest, this game made me feel that excited gaming feeling that I haven't really felt since I was younger. So obviously I'm going to recommend it! Please let there be a sequel...			"

												Looking for a platformer that crosses Duck Tales and Mega Man in pseudo 16-bit style?  Look no further.  In this excellent retro style side scrolling platformer you control Shovel Knight.  Weilding a shovel as his main weapon of choice as he combats his way through his 10 hour quest in order to find Shield Knight.There are bosses throughout this adventure and each stage hides upgrades to further your expendition in search of his shield weilding counter part.  Much like a Metroidvania some areas you can not progress unless you do find these upgrades or purchase them from the trader in the town.The game is extremely well done and the musical score is fantastic as well.  The devs have already released DLC that extends the life double fold and for FREE!  The bosses are fun and fairly easy to defeat.  The games stages though start off easy enough and progressively get more difficult as you make your way to the end.Recommended to anyone that loves a good platformer with story.  10/10			"

												A game that feels like one out of the old generation of games, but brings a lot of life to the genre. On top of fantastic gameplay with nice feeling controls, I am perhaps most impressed by the vivid world of Shovel Knight. There are some truly novel concepts (Troupple King?!) and a lot of characters who bring life to the world. The skills all have a place but never feel overpowered, and much to my delight, the developers did not make each one tailored to wreck a specific boss in the fashion of Mega Man. One aspect that I loved is that the game was tough, but seldom unfair. At one point, I died 20 times without making any progress, simply because I was making mistakes. However, in this span, I was frustrated but never felt like quitting the game. Whether you are a veteran of the genre or are looking to dive into the genre with a newer title, Shovel Knight will provide a ton of fun and a good challenge. It isn't just a great throwback to the old days, it's a game that would shine in any era.			"

												Easily one of the best platformers I've played in a long time. It combines MegaMan's level design philosophy with mechanics from other games such as castlevania and DuckTales, but still manages to be be completely unique from those other titles. Unlike other retro-inspired games it uses the past as a guide rather than a crutch and pretty much nails the spirit of old 8-bit games. This is everything a modern-day ""old-school"" video game should be.			"

												This game is like Megaman meets Ducktales, with a death mechanic similar to Dark Souls.  You go through stages in a SMB3-type map and fight bosses using a shovel, thrown weapons (relics), and pogo moves.  You have an infinite amount of lives, but when you die you drop a portion of your gold and have to go get it.  You can only have one set of gold out at a time, so if you die before recovering it, it's gone.  It does mean you basically have as many tries as you want for bosses, but they are still fun.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. It's about as Mega Man as you can get without actually being Mega Man. The music, art, and just about everything else is supremely well done. The base game is challenging without being terribly hard, but through what relics you use and what you do with checkpoints you can crank up the difficulty quite a lot. Probably my best purchase of the year so far.			"

												As a startup game designer myself, this is the kind of quality game that I hope to create some day. Something that obviously has months and months of care and hard work put into it, regardless of how simple the game is. Shovel Knight is in short, a joyful walk down NEStolgia days with inspiring tight gameplay, beautiful and admiring pixel art, and an abundance of incredibly polished chiptune music. I was a kickstarter backer since it was announced, and I was very worried with the few delays they made, but the final product has proven to be 100% worth the price of admission.You play as an adventurer Shovel Knight, our pogosticking protagonist who's searching for his long lost companion Shield Knight. Both of them were exploring the mysterious Tower of Fate, when the dark magic of a cursed amulet cast them out and sealed the tower. When Shovel Knight awoke, Shield Knight was no where to be found, but instead The Enchantress has risen to power and spreads evil across the land. Now Shovel Knight must quest out on a search for his long lost companion. Also in his way are several other cleverly themed knights in an ensemble known as ""The Order of No Quarter"", each with their own unique character and fighting specialties. The gameplay itself is a side-scrolling mixture between NES classics like Mega Man, Super Mario 3, Castlevania, and DuckTales. It also happens to take some modernization from newer games. For example: there are no lives per se, but instead when you die, three money bags spring where you bit the dust, and you must recover them to save from losing any gold a la the notoriously difficult Souls series. Along your journey you can spend gold you collect to upgrade your shovel to perform new attacks, or purchase different armors that all have different effects. You can also buy relics from a traveling salesman which allow you to shoot fireballs, dash in mid air, and go invincible for a short period of time among several other abilities.The art is very impressive for that 8-bit pixel look that so many developers are caught on lately (myself included). The animations are very characteristic and help bring the game to life with ease. The game can almost guarantee a giggle the first time you see Shovel Knight dig through a treasure chest. Speaking of the giggles, the dialog is extremely humorous and doesn't allow the game to take itself too seriously. It tries for the casual joke or two at the expense of actual game knowledge, which helps make the game feel more alive and interesting. These two components help seal the game and bring it to life. However, there are a couple reused assets for enemies. For example different mage enemies, and rat like enemies are made different only by their color palettes. A small nitpick to an otherwise gorgeous and endearing world.Finally, the music is possibly my favorite thing about the whole game. Jake Kaufman(Shovel Knight's composer and OCRemix veteran code-named ""virt"") is bound to have put himself on the map with this soundtrack, and with the help of Manami Matsumae(Mega Man composer) it's really no surprise. Each tune is specifically designed to run on actual NES hardware and helps secure that classic retro feel to the game. Thus, the music in this game not only shines, it radiates light in every way. Every level has it's own distinct composition, while each boss has a remixed version of that same song. It's instantly catchy chiptunes will have you hook, line, and sinker throughout all of the almost 50 compositions. Jake has also been kind enough to offer the entire soundtrack, as well as a second full arrangement album from various artists, each for a ""you name it"" price tag on his BandCamp page.Shovel Knight is an astounding achievement that just plain works. Every person attached to this project put their heart and soul into the game, and it shows in every way. Rarely do I say that an independent video game has a shot at making it to Game of the Year status, but Shovel Knight easily digs its way to the top of the list. A must-have gem in any Steam, 3DS, or Wii U library. (9/10)			"

It has very clever level design that reminds me heavily of the megaman series. It does feel as if i was playing a NES game sometimes if the NES had a bit more colors and the NES was stronger, but the retro style does not at all take away from any of the gameplay elements. i highly recommend this game for anyone who really loves platformers and/or has played any of the platformers i mentioned before. This is one the examples where kickstarter actually produces a GOOD game and i must say it is very very worth it for its price. 9/10 a must buy.			"

												A really good 8-bit platformer much in the same vein as Mega-Man. It can be incredibly challenging but the save system makes sure you don't get sent to far back for each attempt.That said, the later levels require a level of precision controls that the game is lacking. You notice it the farther you get that there are delays after certain jumps or attacks or both that can cost you a life. In turn, this can make the later levels far more frustrating than they ought to be.			"

												Shovel Knight. What does one say about this game? It's a very solid game with tight controls and great music. Bringing back a nostalgic feeling of early NES games, with none messed up. Every idea taken from another game is implemented perfectly. The music is so memorable and fitting in each instance used. The challenge is there and if you want more, New Game + offers a bigger challenge. The platforming is fair, and you will never feel like the game cheated you out of a life. The bosses are fun and cool. This game is close to perfect, but has it's flaws. One stage in the latter half is very bottomless pit heavy, and if you struggle with that, you will have trouble on that level, as an example. This game is very worth your money, and I highly suggest you get it.			"

												It's like time travelling. Shovel Knight is easily the best representation of the modern retro game. The ui design, sound effects and music, and the pixel count are reminiscent of 8 bit, while the vibrancy of the colors and smoothness of the gameplay are more 16 bit. Regardless, Shovel Knight is a lot of a fun, with humorous dialogue, and simple, but intuitive and sometimes challenging combat and platforming. It takes some ideas from games like SMB3, LoZ II, and Mega Man, among others, such as a very SMB3-esque overworld, villages, items, and upgrades somewhat similar to LoZ II, and a good assortment of Knight bosses, similar to how Mega Mans bosses were. Throw in things like the Anchor sub-weapon that is basically the axe the Castlevania, and you have a game that takes some great feature from old-school games that you love and know, but still forges it's own unique identity without becoming a parody or mashup of what's come before it. And with a New Game+, and loads of cheat codes, Shovel Knight offers a lot of replayability. If you like retro action-platformers, and/or fun, you should probably pick up Shovel Knight. 10/10 would shovel again.			"

At first sight the game takes you back to the generation of pixelated games and really works to the best it can! It's refreshing for gamers who like nostalgic trips, but inviting to those who are new to 2D side scrolling platformers. 10/10 Would recommend again.			"

												Shovel Knight deserves some major praise. Something about it didn't let me stop playing. I sat down and beat it start to finish, non-stop. (Okay I had to pee once) I'd like to blame it on nostalgia, but the only thing truly unoriginal oldschool thing about Shovel knight is the 8-16 bit style. I suppose you could say the boss fights remind you of Megaman. The overworld reminds you of Mario. But there's relics, secrets and technical combat you don't really get from those games. Shovel your way to riches and hoard it until you can afford the ever increasingly expensive upgrades. Search for the relics, which will not only give you combat advantages or movement boosts, but provide useful for future secrets and challenges. The gameplay is just different - and in a good way. You wield a freakin' shovel!GUESS WHAT, THOUGH. There's a STORY to Shovel Knight and it's awesome. You lose you beloved Shield Knight (f) and have nightmares about saving her. You battle your way to the Evil Enchantress who has either captured or killed Shield Knight. Black Knight, your rival, runs into you often along the way. You must defeat the Order of No Quarter in order to proceed to the Evil Enchantress, which consists of different modded Knights with interesting and often humorous characteristics. I started Shovel Knight expecting to screw around. Decided to do some playful voices and be dorky with it. Maybe rush through it, being all tryhard. But I ended up falling in love. At some point I forgot I was doing voices and really got engrossed in the entire situation. I'm glad I was streaming because this is a game I want to remember. It's on YouTube as a playlist now, for those interested. It took me about 4:45 to beat the game fully.My favorite part is how well Shovel Knight teaches you how to play without directly telling you. Every level introduces a new mechanic, and there's always a part on each level (especially the tutorial) that teaches you new things. And you'll have to reapply the things you learned at a moment's notice.As far as challenging yourself... When you die, you release what seemed like 1/3 or 1/4 of your gold. Think of it as a more forgiving Dark Souls. You can go back to where you died and pick up that gold. Alternatively, there are checkpoints on each level. If you feel like the level is easy, you can actually destroy the checkpoint crystal for gold. If you do well on the level (I'm uncertain on the specifics, could be not dying or taking damage) the crystal changes color and holds more gold the more you pass without defeat. So you can also get accumulative growth in gold for taking the risk of removing the checkpoints.Shovel Knight has great functionality IN SPADES....... Just play it.			"

												Right off the bat, Shovel Knight is an amazing 2D platformer game, and easily one of my favorite recent games. The game has a strong reminiscence of early Nintendo games, a lot like Megaman, Castlevania, and The Legend of Zelda, while producing it's very own unique storyline and gameplay. Playing as the titular protagonist 'Shovel Knight' as he goes on a quest to rescue his beloved Shield Knight, you progress through many different stages of the game, all ranging from plains, to a volcano, underwater, in the air, and more; the levels are very detailed with hard boss battles and plenty of secrets. The game overall gets progressively hard and I cannot express how many times I would get frustrated over my deaths. You're able to purchase useful relics, armor and weapon upgrades, have the ability to use magic, and find collectible music sheets; there's also random boss encounters and side stages where you can do different tasks. I totaled myself up with 12 hours lonesome on this indie game, and enjoyed everything about it. Even though the game came out in 2014 and has retro-styled graphics, I thoroughly loved playing it and is a great example of how these retro games can still be dominant over others. From the cliché, yet original, storyline and characters, to a wide range of useful trinkets, the game is a must-play whether or not you've ever played old-school Nintendo games, or retro games in general.

												This game made me smile upon opening into the main title screen, I had flashbacks of my youth and the multitude of retro class gaming which i experienced. Shovel Knight brings all the old things that you loved from retro style gaming and threw it into a more smooth controlling system. I've loved every moment of this game from it's original storyline to its interesting and comical bosses. The random events are just a bonus and it just reminds me of what throwing the old Super mario into a bowl and smashing the old classic Zelda games into it and out came Shovel Knight. Also you get a shovel......10/10			"

Including games that I feel heavily influenced this title, Super Mario Bros 3, Ducktales, and Mega Man.  I was hooked on those games back then, and it's the main reason I wanted to check this game out.  I'm glad I did!I think the only thing missing from the experience is an uncomfortable rectangular controller and you'd swear you were playing an NES game from that era(well, aside from better graphics and sound, and widescreen resolution).

												I bought Shovel Knight back before I knew of any DLC and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a tight platformer with a nice amount of hidden collectables. There's some customization to the game and it's just all around fun. If you enjoy games like Mega Man, Duck Tales, or Mario, you will definitely like this game.Then the DLC came out, and oh my lord is it fun. You play as one of the Knights of the Order of no Quarter, Plague Knight, and have a ton of customization. The gameplay changes slightly, but you go through the same levels as Shovel Knight, but with extra collectables. This DLC is easily worth the full base price of the game as well, but you get it for FREE!Keep at it Yacht Club Games!			"

It felt just like an early 1990's NES game (with some fancy on-cartridge chips, obviously).The graphics were very well done, the music was incredible (and felt like a Mega Man game), and the level design was top-notch.My only complaints are the darkness trick in the Spectre Knight level (which, while adding challenge, took some of the fun away) and the length of time you stare at the death screen. Maybe pressing a button to skip it would fix that.Overall, if you like platforming, this is a really great game with some tight controls, a decent story, and really good boss fights.			"

												This game is classic platforming action. The game has gorgeous pixel art, amazing music, tight controls and fantastic designs for enimies bosses and allies. This game is one of the best of 2014, however, that doesn't mean it is flawless. The story is quite bad, and although they try to throw a plot twist at the end it's not that exciting. I found there were times where shovel knight moved further than I inputed, some levels have have checkpoints that are way to far away from one another, sometime doing small jumps can be incredibly difficult. The game also has some items that are just plain useless. Shovel Knight is an outstanding game with very few problems, if you love the old NES games then you will feel right at home. Going for 100% is extremely difficult due to a select few achievements, however if you go start to end without any of the upgrades the game is going to become quite difficult, however if you are good at games like this you can complete the story in under 1 hour and a half. That being said for the $15 dollar pricetag it is well worth it, I'm very pleased with my purchase and I'm interested in seeing more games from the indie developers Yacht Club Games. I highly recomend this game.			"

												After beating this game i can confidently say this is probley my new all time favorite 2d platformer its worth the money. The Game is just fun its going to be a speed run game. its fun to play casually the controls are perfect the music is amazing upgrades, hidden walls lots of bosses, long enough levels, has a down attack akin to duck tales another one of my favorite platform games and the game expects you to use this mechanic in the game to help you reach areas and traverse levels. the boss fights are fun nothing in this game i found boring i was entertained the whole way and that is a very rare thing for me. There is a new game plus i have not done and i missed a few items and music scrolls etc so there is replayablity there is lots of feats (achievements) to get as well. To me this game is up there with duck tales megaman cavestory mario any of the great platformers you can think of. there are upgrades to buy and your penalty of death is mostly losing money there is difficulty but the best part of this game is you dont feel cheated often most of my deaths envolved my own error or knock back into pits which is the only thing i could say annoyed me but the ease of just getting right back into the game when you die doesnt make death♥♥♥♥♥♥you off like most platformers you lose some gold and gold is important in this game to a extent but is not a huge deal if you lose it. The game has many check points but you can destroy them to make it harder on your self for extra cash so you wont respawn there (acheivement cough) anyway my personal opinion of this game is it is a 10/10 for me and i recommend it fully to anyone who likes platform games it is a amazing experience.Game length depends on you. took me around 3 hours going slow and casual and still missing a few items like maybe 3-4. speed run could be very short and i suspect it will be a very short run given the invisiblity locket strats.

												Shovel Knight is a magnum opus of game design that comes the closest to perfection in it's catagory than any others. Each detail enhances the love that Yacht Club Games and us as players have for the genre in many, many ways that add up throughout its welcome runtime (8-10 hours not including Plague Knight content) and never overstay their welcome. The plot is simple, easy to follow, and gives you better motivation than most triple A games nowadays, but the tight controls, practical arsenal, and excellent use of the classic 8-16bit style, gives it an emotion of its own that's hard to put into words. I was simply floored by the game as a whole, as well as the intelligence it assumes you have as a human being. Games were hard in the past to increase their longevity and keep it from getting boring too quick. Shovel Knight is hard because Shovel Knight's task is hard! But the struggle is infinitely worth itStory: What it needs to be/10Gameplay: 9/10 (10/10 if you have the pleasure of being the plague knight)Music: 10/10 no questions asked. I really loved how at the hub worlds like villages, the music changes it's 8 bit synths a little bit with each area.Verdict is 9/10 because there is no perfect game yet but if nothing steps up soon I will be happy to throw my vote in the suggestion hat.

												I generally don't like 2d platformers like this. When I say like this, I mean megaman. I don't enjoy the megaman games. This game is like a megaman game if they were as fun as people say they are. This game was a pleasant suprise that I recieved as a gift. If you like platformers, you'll probably love it. If you don't, you'll probably really like it but maybe wait untill it's 10euro/dollars.			"

												I bought Shovel Knight back before I knew of any DLC and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a tight platformer with a nice amount of hidden collectables. There's some customization to the game and it's just all around fun. If you enjoy games like Mega Man, Duck Tales, or Mario, you will definitely like this game.Then the DLC came out, and oh my lord is it fun. You play as one of the Knights of the Order of no Quarter, Plague Knight, and have a ton of customization. The gameplay changes slightly, but you go through the same levels as Shovel Knight, but with extra collectables. This DLC is easily worth the full base price of the game as well, but you get it for FREE!Keep at it Yacht Club Games!			"

												A fantastic creation of the studio Yacht Club Games. Shovel Knight is set in the style of NES style platformers of old. The game can be categorized as an ""Action Platformer"" You attack, jump and even do moves to traverse much like Link does in Zelda II and Duck Tails. This simple addition adds so much availability for unique platforming segments. The game is the perfect difficulty. If you die, it's your fault and your fault only. The characters are unique, the levels are the just the right difficulty, and it doesn't hold your hand. My favorite part of this game is the first level. Teaching you how to play the game without a bunch of menus and tutorial segments. I've completed this game on WiiU and Steam. It's available on many different types of platforms if that's your thing. And with the promise of free DLC coming out, You get so much bang for your buck. My only complaint is when you get hit you get slightly knocked back. This isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. It's minimal at most but it's still a minor complaint I have. It could of been a lot worse, but still something to mention. Overall this game is amazing, unique and worth every single one of your hard earned dollars. Go out and buy this game!			"

												For someone like me who grew-up playing Atari/Sega/PC Dos-games/SNES, this was like a love letter from the past.Simply put, the games has the ""old game style"" vibe to it (I'd say SNES vibe the most) and it has that ""classic"" gameplay/music feel to it as well. Also, the gameplay is solid, challenging at some points and the story is decent for a ""kickstarter/indie"" game. I've enjoyed my time playing this game and would definitely recommend it to any ""old school gamer"" such as myself.Rating: 10/10! :DP.S: Can't wait for the FREE DLC as well! :D			"

												This is a truly astounding success of a game. Buy it. Buy it right now.Shovel Knight is a love letter to the NES era that goes above and beyond the lazy references and sloppy pixel art that have become so common in ""retro"" games. It wears its influences on its sleeve - you'll quickly recognize bits of Mario, Mega Man, Castlevania, and more - but there's an obvious attention to detail in merging and updating them into a cohesive, modern game. The story is simple but charmingly told, the gameplay is slick, the music is spot-on, the levels are beautiful and varied with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and there are plenty of challenge options if you feel like showing off or replaying the game.

												10/10 FINELY CRAFTED FROM THE HEARTAfter four playthroughs and unlocking every achievement i have to say this is one of the finest games i've played in a good while. You can tell that it's crafted from the love of retro platformers like Mega Man and Castlevania, and it genuinely feels like one of the great games you would have played back in the day and would have stacked up alongside the big names released at the time easily. It plays very much like a Megaman game but its not as difficult. The knights moveset is simple yet intuitive and the majority of the powers feel essential to use and are not just there for show. One downfall i would say is that the first magic power you get (Chaos Orb) is an absolute boss destroyer. The bosses themselves are challenging without it though. The soundtrack is awesome and the visuals are very colourful, i don't know what else to say. This is a game you absolutely must play!			"

												I don't often post reviews on Steam but Shovel Knight is blowing me away so much that I am making an exception. This game was billed as a throwback to the NES era and it definitely succeeds in giving you that nostalgic feeling but it also ends up being way better than all the games that inspired it.The graphics, levels and characters have so much charm and I was constantly surprised at how many memorable moments there are throughout the campaigns.There is a lot of replay value here since there are many ways to play in terms of how difficult you want the game to be. There is a new game+ of course but also other ways to adjust your experience by choosing to power up your health or use checkpoints in levels or skip those both completely. On top of that there are three additional campaigns after you finish the main Shovel Knight quest (two available now and one more to be released in the future).If you have even a passing interest in NES or SNES 2D sidescrollers, then I recommend this game without hesitation. I haven't played a game that I've personally enjoyed as much this since Super Mario Galaxy.Shovel Knight is now one of my top 10 favourite games of all time and I hope others can find the same joy that I have when I'm playing it.

												Though I'm old enough, I didn't grow up playing the sort of games that inspired Shovel Knight.  As a result, I have no particular nostalia for its aesthetics, but I found it damn charming anyway.  Great art and animation, and fantastic music.  The developers' choice to limit themselves to an 8-bit palette, while ignoring other technical limitations of the era, works well and I find the design more cohesive than pretty much any other throwback pixel art game I've played.The game is difficult by modern standards, but certainly nowhere near a ""masocore"" platformer.  Ultimately, I really enjoyed how it played despite a few frustrating bits.  The fact that the character control feels just about perfect in terms of respoviness goes a long way to mitigating the challenge.  I'm guessing the game is actually quite forgiving in comparsion to many of the games it pays homage to, but I think it's just right in terms of proving a challenge that feels like it can be overcome without requiring so much practice it stops being entertainment.Before buying, I was unsure about the game because of that difficulty and because I have no particular reverance for it's ancestors, but I'm very glad I gave it a shot.  While it's not a game that I think is going to be especially memorable for me, I ended up enjoying it a lot.			"

												MEGAMAN and MARIO 3 HAD A BABY!     I have been playing games for about 27 Years and across all consoles and devices.  So it is with zero uncertainty that I can say that -- SHOVEL KNIGHT is one of the best games EVER made.  PERIOD!     Not only is it hugely charming, there is an emotional crux that is quite central to the story and it is explored in ways both subtle and intricate.  If the ending to this does't succeed in eliciting a feeling from the player then the fault certainly isn't with the game, but with humanity itself!     The desing is also remarkable.  I orignally wondered why it was taking so long to be released, but now I know.  SHOVEL KNIGHT is absolutely PACKED to DEATH with content.SHOVEL KNIGHT is beyond a shadow of a doubt an undisputed MASTERPIECE!  What a surprise.NEW GAME +     HERE I COME!!!:)			"

												An amazing game. I beat the shovel knight part of the story within a couple of hours and absolutely loved the story. It practically has it's own ""Set a difficulty you feel comfy with"" in that you can break the lanterns which in turn will give you less check points. After the shovel knight story, playing as the plague knight was truly different. I felt so confused transitioning from Shovel Knight to Plague Knight, but I loved it. I felt as though it gave the game a new experience to a familiar world. King Knight and Spectar Knight are supposed to be next, along with the addition of a few new modes to my understanding so I absolutely can't wait.			"

												Surprise, surprise! Its an indie game! The best way I could describe Shovel Knight, from the perspective of someone who didn't experience the NES first hand is a case of ""old dog, new tricks"". This platformer harkens back to the old 8-bit style of the NES in terms of both visuals (sortof, technically, its not actually 8-bit, but whatever) and gameplay, and audio, whilst having a very modern sense of game feel at it's core.That's the essential part, and one of the best things , in my opinion, about Shovel Knight. It could've just been a nostalgia trip, but honestly, at the core of it is an extremely well designed game that uses the basic control scheme of the NES to create an impressive level of depth (Just like some NES platformers! HOW ABOUT THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥). The spells you're given are given are all extremely fun to play and experiment with (Although, Fireballs are a bit OP).This game feels like a kind of evolution of the 8 bit style. Story elements are told through gameplay segments that give a great sense of attention to the mainly character driven plot (Though, like 8 bit platformers, the story is quite simple, in general. It does gain some unfounded depth throughout the game, however.)The boss battles are all amazing, with the right level of challenge leeway such that you can beat the bosses in a number of ways (No use weapon X to beat this boss a la Mega Man). the score is FANTASTIC (virt has the OST available to download, GO GET IT!). The whole package is just wonderful			"

												Aspects of this game were 30 years in the making. If you've played through multiple generations this will come as a nostalgic respite. Rewards second and third playthroughs. Can see how this would be a fun low-to-medium-difficulty speed run title, as stages three and up are very challenging the first time around, and a breeze thereafter (even the gem stages which are infuriating at first). The achievements are challenges that add replayability, if for example you want to get through a level with 20 or less sword swipes, or without dying, or without checkpoints.If you like what the preview shows this should be an instant purchase at sale or full price. You are unlikely to regret it.			"

												This is a truly astounding success of a game. Buy it. Buy it right now.Shovel Knight is a love letter to the NES era that goes above and beyond the lazy references and sloppy pixel art that have become so common in ""retro"" games. It wears its influences on its sleeve - you'll quickly recognize bits of Mario, Mega Man, Castlevania, and more - but there's an obvious attention to detail in merging and updating them into a cohesive, modern game. The story is simple but charmingly told, the gameplay is slick, the music is spot-on, the levels are beautiful and varied with plenty of nooks and crannies to explore, and there are plenty of challenge options if you feel like showing off or replaying the game.

												As soon as i started seeing perfect scores for this game online i just thought it seemed too good to be true. I dont normally play these types of games. I couldn't get into Battleblock Theater or Volgarr because i thought they where extremely boring. This game on the other hand is the complete opposite! it has fun addicting levels with exciting music. There are lots of characters too talk to in the villages and many things to collect and upgrade. I highly recommend this game!			"

												As a digging simulator, Shovel Knight paints a Steinbeckian portrait of the exploited proletariat - who, as it was with Grapes of Wrath's self-deluded poor, see themselves as ""temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" Ah, but as does Shovel Knight share philosophy with Steinbeck, so does it share the eminent author's weakness, too: an overabundance of dancing fish, which to this humble reviewer felt akin to supplanting a ballet with drunken, groping jitterbug.1 out 1000 gems.

												When it comes to Kickstarter I've always been rather skeptical, unfortunately it's become a bastion for hacks to make broken promises and release unfinished titles, which makes me apprehensive to ever donate to any Kickstarter title. Shovel Knight however is the exception to the rule, as the most polished title I've ever seen come from a Kickstarter campaign I can definitely say that this game comes highly recommended and with yet more free content on the horizon, Shovel Knight is the gift that just keeps on giving.Clearly inspired by the NES era of gaming and with obvious nods to the classics of old (specifically the Megaman series, a fond favourite of mine) this game delivers on all fronts. With a quality sound track, imaginative art direction and larger than life characters, this challenging platformer delivers on everything it promises. I had been looking forward to this game for a long time and picked it up at launch, but waited to write a review because I was so impressed with it that I really wanted to do it justice. After experiencing some recent disappointment with hyped up Kickstarter titles (namely Hyperlight Drifter) I felt now was the best time to share my love for Shovel Knight in the hopes that more passionate developers will find inspiration in the example set by Yacht Club Games and that indie gaming can return to being less about unwanted hipster drama and more about quality gameplay from developers who genuinely care about the medium.If being impressed by the base game wasn't enough Yacht Club released the first of a number of free DLCs in the form of Plague Knight's adventure, one of the bosses from the base game whose story you can now play through to see how he ended up in the position he's in when you encounter him as Shovel Knight. Not only did this DLC manage to be surprisingly different from the base game both in terms of how Plague Knight plays and offering his own seperate story, but it also managed to keep things fresh by having a very different feel and adding a dash of extra humour to the character to make the initially creepy Plague Knight actually seem surprisingly sympathetic, funny and dare I say somewhat lovable. This leaves me very confident that the upcoming DLC adventures will by just as polished and I have to say I am really looking forward to them.Shovel Knight is easily up there with the best of Indie titles, alongside such great games as Cave Story and Freedom Planet, I really can't recommend this game enough! For those of you who have fond memories of the NES era and younger gamers who want a retro experience, you really can't go wrong with Shovel Knight, so do yourself a favour and get shovelling for shovelry!

												Shovel Knight is an excellent retro style platformer that really gives respect to the pixel era of gaming. This game is worth the ten dollars (I think thats the price) with the multiple campaigns and the rage inducing mechanics that every good platformer needs. I have only completed the first campaign (207 deaths and it took 15 hours excactly {ok 14:59:37}) and cannot wait to play the next campaign. Although the story is short it is a good story and has a great ending. 5/5 gonna play again, no complaints. (and this♥♥♥♥♥♥is comming from a pessimist).			"

												I don't even know how to start, but here we go: This is one of the best games I ever played so far in the genre.Sadly I wasn't aware of the Kickstarter campaing back then, otherwise I'd have help this great game's development.With that said...Shovel Knight is the closest thing you (25+ yos) can play and feel the nostalgia all over the game: Pixelated and colorful graphics, AWESOME soundtrack, simple yet fun and intuitive controls, sub-weapons, fair difficulty...But the game doesn't rely solely on nostalgia. The characters have their own personalities, dialogues are funny/puns galore, game can be challenging if you go after achievements and collectives/personal challenges/speed runs.More than a generic platformer, Shovel Knight mainly has a soul. An essence that it makes unique among others of the genre. And with upcoming (free by the way, thanks to the Kickstarter success) campaings starring the other knights from The Order of No Quarter, Shovel Knight has a amazing replayability.What you waiting for? Sharpen thy shovel and start striking the earth, thou dig me?  "

												As a startup game designer myself, this is the kind of quality game that I hope to create some day. Something that obviously has months and months of care and hard work put into it, regardless of how simple the game is. Shovel Knight is in short, a joyful walk down NEStolgia days with inspiring tight gameplay, beautiful and admiring pixel art, and an abundance of incredibly polished chiptune music. I was a kickstarter backer since it was announced, and I was very worried with the few delays they made, but the final product has proven to be 100% worth the price of admission.You play as an adventurer Shovel Knight, our pogosticking protagonist who's searching for his long lost companion Shield Knight. Both of them were exploring the mysterious Tower of Fate, when the dark magic of a cursed amulet cast them out and sealed the tower. When Shovel Knight awoke, Shield Knight was no where to be found, but instead The Enchantress has risen to power and spreads evil across the land. Now Shovel Knight must quest out on a search for his long lost companion. Also in his way are several other cleverly themed knights in an ensemble known as ""The Order of No Quarter"", each with their own unique character and fighting specialties. The gameplay itself is a side-scrolling mixture between NES classics like Mega Man, Super Mario 3, Castlevania, and DuckTales. It also happens to take some modernization from newer games. For example: there are no lives per se, but instead when you die, three money bags spring where you bit the dust, and you must recover them to save from losing any gold a la the notoriously difficult Souls series. Along your journey you can spend gold you collect to upgrade your shovel to perform new attacks, or purchase different armors that all have different effects. You can also buy relics from a traveling salesman which allow you to shoot fireballs, dash in mid air, and go invincible for a short period of time among several other abilities.The art is very impressive for that 8-bit pixel look that so many developers are caught on lately (myself included). The animations are very characteristic and help bring the game to life with ease. The game can almost guarantee a giggle the first time you see Shovel Knight dig through a treasure chest. Speaking of the giggles, the dialog is extremely humorous and doesn't allow the game to take itself too seriously. It tries for the casual joke or two at the expense of actual game knowledge, which helps make the game feel more alive and interesting. These two components help seal the game and bring it to life. However, there are a couple reused assets for enemies. For example different mage enemies, and rat like enemies are made different only by their color palettes. A small nitpick to an otherwise gorgeous and endearing world.Finally, the music is possibly my favorite thing about the whole game. Jake Kaufman(Shovel Knight's composer and OCRemix veteran code-named ""virt"") is bound to have put himself on the map with this soundtrack, and with the help of Manami Matsumae(Mega Man composer) it's really no surprise. Each tune is specifically designed to run on actual NES hardware and helps secure that classic retro feel to the game. Thus, the music in this game not only shines, it radiates light in every way. Every level has it's own distinct composition, while each boss has a remixed version of that same song. It's instantly catchy chiptunes will have you hook, line, and sinker throughout all of the almost 50 compositions. Jake has also been kind enough to offer the entire soundtrack, as well as a second full arrangement album from various artists, each for a ""you name it"" price tag on his BandCamp page.Shovel Knight is an astounding achievement that just plain works. Every person attached to this project put their heart and soul into the game, and it shows in every way. Rarely do I say that an independent video game has a shot at making it to Game of the Year status, but Shovel Knight easily digs its way to the top of the list. A must-have gem in any Steam, 3DS, or Wii U library. (9/10)			"

												Inspired by classic NES games without being hindered by the limitations and lack of design wisdom of the age, Shovel Knight is an absolute gem that doesn't hinge on nostalgia to be enjoyable. It's about the length of a Mega Man or Mega Man X game, but, in my opinion, a bit easier. There's a decent amount of side content beyond just the boss levels, and user-options to make the game more difficult (such as beating the game without the use of relics). The levels are well-designed and there are very few ""cheap"" moments. Boss designs, both aesthetically and functionally, are fantastic.Like old-but-good NES games, it's short, sweet, and has plenty of replayability.			"

												Shovel Knight may just be the best platformer of the past few console generations.  Yatch Club Games has outdone themselves with this title bringing players a well tuned, creative game that will keep you wanting to play rather then feeling compelled to keep going just to see the ending.  Whats more is the three free DLC packs that the game has (Plague Knight currently out, King Knight and Specter Knight coming soon) you really are getting four games in one as each campaign plays and has different story than the others.  Whether on sale or standard price Shovel Knight is well worth the cost.  With the recent ressurection of pixel art platformers it is easy to understand why Shovel Knight has come to be the reigning king.			"

Shovel knight has a downward stab and a regular shovel swing. Once he progresses far enough he can upgrade his equipment and forge new armors that give him special abilities or make his shovel able to perform new tricks.Every level has a special item that if you find it in the dungeon, you can get it right then and there- the only issue is you need to purchase it. If you do not find the item in the level, don't fret! You can buy it in town from the underground salesman. The bosses are unique and provide an interesting spin on each fight that requires for you to play a different way each time.Perhaps the best part of the game is the replay value. In most games released today there isn't much replay value. The game is typically too long to enjoy a second playthrough in most games and there aren't many reasons to do so. In Shovel Knight if you beat the game you have the classic new game + but considering how short the game is, it's easy to pick up again and play a different way. The steam achievements also help push for this game to have multiple play throughs (A no death run, no money run, no item run, etc etc) which goes back to the roots of achievements: Awarding the player for achomplishing something that would be worth a reward.If I was to give one specific reason to buy this game: It is because the game is easy to pick back up when you take a break from it, each level is short enough to finish within 10-15 minutes and if you want to take a break the game auto-saves. It's easy to pick up and put back down and helps a ton when you're trying to take a break from other things.			"

												Shovel Knight is one of those games that after I finish, I wish up to the heavens for there to be a sequel in a few years or sooner.Shovel Knight is a great Mega Man-like clone, with little bits of story here and there, but the main focus here is the gameplay aspect.Your main weapon is a shovel, which doesn't really sound right, but it makes sense why. Throughout stages, you can dig up piles of dirt that reveal treasure, which you can then use to buy upgrades, armor, and helpful items to give yourself a boost for that one area that really makes you want to break your keyboard or controller.I disagree when people assume that graphics make a better game, because those people are wrong and are judging a book by its cover.Take a look at the old NES games, and tell me that graphics make a good game.Shovel Knight is a take on the old 8-bit classics we all grew up with and loved to play after school and on summer vacation.Everything is there, the 8-bit graphics, chiptune music, and the difficulty: YES, I said difficulty.This is a game at times makes you want to rip your hair out, but with trail and error, you succeed, and you feel satisfied. This game gives you satisfaction when you finish your goals.Modern games today don't really serve any kind of punishment for failing, they just keep holding your hand, giving you handicaps all the time; there is no challenge anymore.Shovel Knight is a great gem of a game that deserves its praises; everything about what makes a game a game is here.This soon-to-be modern classic, hopefully get the sequel it deserves.

												As a startup game designer myself, this is the kind of quality game that I hope to create some day. Something that obviously has months and months of care and hard work put into it, regardless of how simple the game is. Shovel Knight is in short, a joyful walk down NEStolgia days with inspiring tight gameplay, beautiful and admiring pixel art, and an abundance of incredibly polished chiptune music. I was a kickstarter backer since it was announced, and I was very worried with the few delays they made, but the final product has proven to be 100% worth the price of admission.You play as an adventurer Shovel Knight, our pogosticking protagonist who's searching for his long lost companion Shield Knight. Both of them were exploring the mysterious Tower of Fate, when the dark magic of a cursed amulet cast them out and sealed the tower. When Shovel Knight awoke, Shield Knight was no where to be found, but instead The Enchantress has risen to power and spreads evil across the land. Now Shovel Knight must quest out on a search for his long lost companion. Also in his way are several other cleverly themed knights in an ensemble known as ""The Order of No Quarter"", each with their own unique character and fighting specialties. The gameplay itself is a side-scrolling mixture between NES classics like Mega Man, Super Mario 3, Castlevania, and DuckTales. It also happens to take some modernization from newer games. For example: there are no lives per se, but instead when you die, three money bags spring where you bit the dust, and you must recover them to save from losing any gold a la the notoriously difficult Souls series. Along your journey you can spend gold you collect to upgrade your shovel to perform new attacks, or purchase different armors that all have different effects. You can also buy relics from a traveling salesman which allow you to shoot fireballs, dash in mid air, and go invincible for a short period of time among several other abilities.The art is very impressive for that 8-bit pixel look that so many developers are caught on lately (myself included). The animations are very characteristic and help bring the game to life with ease. The game can almost guarantee a giggle the first time you see Shovel Knight dig through a treasure chest. Speaking of the giggles, the dialog is extremely humorous and doesn't allow the game to take itself too seriously. It tries for the casual joke or two at the expense of actual game knowledge, which helps make the game feel more alive and interesting. These two components help seal the game and bring it to life. However, there are a couple reused assets for enemies. For example different mage enemies, and rat like enemies are made different only by their color palettes. A small nitpick to an otherwise gorgeous and endearing world.Finally, the music is possibly my favorite thing about the whole game. Jake Kaufman(Shovel Knight's composer and OCRemix veteran code-named ""virt"") is bound to have put himself on the map with this soundtrack, and with the help of Manami Matsumae(Mega Man composer) it's really no surprise. Each tune is specifically designed to run on actual NES hardware and helps secure that classic retro feel to the game. Thus, the music in this game not only shines, it radiates light in every way. Every level has it's own distinct composition, while each boss has a remixed version of that same song. It's instantly catchy chiptunes will have you hook, line, and sinker throughout all of the almost 50 compositions. Jake has also been kind enough to offer the entire soundtrack, as well as a second full arrangement album from various artists, each for a ""you name it"" price tag on his BandCamp page.Shovel Knight is an astounding achievement that just plain works. Every person attached to this project put their heart and soul into the game, and it shows in every way. Rarely do I say that an independent video game has a shot at making it to Game of the Year status, but Shovel Knight easily digs its way to the top of the list. A must-have gem in any Steam, 3DS, or Wii U library. (9/10)			"

												Inspired by classic NES games without being hindered by the limitations and lack of design wisdom of the age, Shovel Knight is an absolute gem that doesn't hinge on nostalgia to be enjoyable. It's about the length of a Mega Man or Mega Man X game, but, in my opinion, a bit easier. There's a decent amount of side content beyond just the boss levels, and user-options to make the game more difficult (such as beating the game without the use of relics). The levels are well-designed and there are very few ""cheap"" moments. Boss designs, both aesthetically and functionally, are fantastic.Like old-but-good NES games, it's short, sweet, and has plenty of replayability.			"

												Alongside Rayman Legends, Shovel Knight is the best modern platformer i have yet to play. it takes every fun and rewarding aspect of platformers and adds fun new elements, as well as throwbacks from classics. it also incorperates a high difficulty for completionists and the ""you lose a bunch of stuff when you die"" element from the Souls series. i haven't enjoyed a modern platformer this much since Rayman Legends (which is equally as fantastic btw), if you want an ""original"", challenging platformer that's super rewarding, and has a fantastic variety in stage design and new mechanics as you progress, as well as one of my personal favorite game soundtracks, i strongly recommend this game. it stands among the best modern-retro themed games to date. 10/10 easily. cannot put down my controller. at 15 dollars, this game is WELL worth the price, plenty of replay value as well, if you were at any point considering getting it, don't hesitate, because you won't be disappointed, i sure wasn't.

It has very clever level design that reminds me heavily of the megaman series. It does feel as if i was playing a NES game sometimes if the NES had a bit more colors and the NES was stronger, but the retro style does not at all take away from any of the gameplay elements. i highly recommend this game for anyone who really loves platformers and/or has played any of the platformers i mentioned before. This is one the examples where kickstarter actually produces a GOOD game and i must say it is very very worth it for its price. 9/10 a must buy.			"

												This game is thoroughly amazing. It felt just like an early 1990's NES game (with some fancy on-cartridge chips, obviously).The graphics were very well done, the music was incredible (and felt like a Mega Man game), and the level design was top-notch.My only complaints are the darkness trick in the Spectre Knight level (which, while adding challenge, took some of the fun away) and the length of time you stare at the death screen. Maybe pressing a button to skip it would fix that.Overall, if you like platforming, this is a really great game with some tight controls, a decent story, and really good boss fights.			"

												Shovel Knight is the love child of the classic NES - era games, combining the gameplay mechanics of such games as Ducktales, Megaman and Castlevania. As it takes a lot of stuff from old games, it tweaks and refines them into much better experience and gameplay.The Story is quite simple but still quite charming and mysterious. Shovel Knight & Shield Knight were adventuring in this forsaken, evil tower until they triggered some kind of horrendous magic and Shield Knight dissapeared. Shovel Knight managed to escape with a broken heart, as the tower sealed itself once again. Years later, the squad of evil guys appear and the tower opens once again. Shovel Knight decides to return there and find out what happened to his dear friend Shield Knight. And also to kick the bad knights asses, of course!The gameplay itself is kind of a same as in Castlevania, but instead of a whip you have a shorter ranged shovel what you can use to dig, whack and pogojump only into enemies. There's also upgrades and usable items which you can buy to make your Shovel Knight much better.The stage desing is like in Megamans but with checkpoints which you can also destroy for harder challenge. Each of the main stages has their own special theme and in the end of each one their unique boss. There's also special stages and random special encounters in the world map for more shovely action.The music in this game is as awesome as the game itself. What I've seen, there's over 40 unique tracks of music for each stage, boss and town. If you love Megamans music, you'll love this one too.In the end I don't have anything negative to say about this game. It's so charming and awesome that I can't but to recommend this to everyone who love old NES games and to those who are new to this genre. ♥/♥ "

												After beating this game i can confidently say this is probley my new all time favorite 2d platformer its worth the money. The Game is just fun its going to be a speed run game. its fun to play casually the controls are perfect the music is amazing upgrades, hidden walls lots of bosses, long enough levels, has a down attack akin to duck tales another one of my favorite platform games and the game expects you to use this mechanic in the game to help you reach areas and traverse levels. the boss fights are fun nothing in this game i found boring i was entertained the whole way and that is a very rare thing for me. There is a new game plus i have not done and i missed a few items and music scrolls etc so there is replayablity there is lots of feats (achievements) to get as well. To me this game is up there with duck tales megaman cavestory mario any of the great platformers you can think of. there are upgrades to buy and your penalty of death is mostly losing money there is difficulty but the best part of this game is you dont feel cheated often most of my deaths envolved my own error or knock back into pits which is the only thing i could say annoyed me but the ease of just getting right back into the game when you die doesnt make death♥♥♥♥♥♥you off like most platformers you lose some gold and gold is important in this game to a extent but is not a huge deal if you lose it. The game has many check points but you can destroy them to make it harder on your self for extra cash so you wont respawn there (acheivement cough) anyway my personal opinion of this game is it is a 10/10 for me and i recommend it fully to anyone who likes platform games it is a amazing experience.Game length depends on you. took me around 3 hours going slow and casual and still missing a few items like maybe 3-4. speed run could be very short and i suspect it will be a very short run given the invisiblity locket strats.

												Shovel Knight is one of those games that you remember for a long time. It is a homage to the old NES classics, but the game really does stand on its own, even without the added nostalgia. Controls are immaculate (when using a controller, at least), the soundtrack is memorable for every stage, and the story and characters goes well beyond what one could reasonably expect from a retro title like this. One of the best parts of Shovel Knight is the excelent difficulty curve. The game manages to challange you throughout the entire game, without ever leaving you frustrated or bored. The game never holds your hand, and expects you to make your own tactics from the available special powers, of which there are plenty. With infinite lives and a generous checkpoint system though, you really shouldn't find this game more difficult than other games unless you are particularly bad at platformers.As can be expected of this kind of platformer, completing the game for the first time can be done in about 6 hours. This might seem on the short side, but as the gameplay never go stale, this really is a game that one can play over and over. Even with the game itself complete, there are plenty of achievements that are quite challanging, and helps add replay value to the game. In addition, the developers have more material that will eventually be added to the game for free, so the fact that the game can be completed in one hour and 30 minutes shouldn't deter you from purchasing the title, as it holds plenty of value.

												If you like platformers you will love this, it has all the elements of what makes these type of games great and more! It's not as hard as traditional platformers albeit some parts of levels will frustrate you but that's the fun of it! My only gripe is that the main story is too short! I collected every item and completed every stage in around 4 hours. There is some extra content as well as NG+ that I haven't delved into as it's just some quirky extras to get more of the game.Nevertheless you can see the quality in the game by just how much effort was put into crafting this, so it's a defnite buy.

												There really is no need for yet another review wandering on about how good this lil' game is but I'll say so anyway. I've played a lot of games in my day but and I don't know if its age but I haven't felt anywhere near as engaged with them as I did when I was a kid. This game broke that pattern. The design is thoughtful and innovative without resorting to gimmicky extras or the cheap deaths that most 'hard platformers' have. By the end I was progressing along at a daring clip and I realized that, for once in a very long time, I was doing so because I had legitimately mastered the mechanics of the game. It's that sort of feeling you get when you play the same map on a multiplayer shooter way too much. When I beat it for the first time it felt very differen than winning most games I've played. Seriously one of the few indie games totally worth paying the non-sale price for. You'll get your money out of it.			"

												This is the absolute best game I've ever played. One playthrough and I'm going to shell out the $15 to buy it on 3DS & another $15 for the Wii U (and any future console it may come out on). ProJared gave this a 10/10, BalrogtheMaster gave it a Check + (Best score on his review show, BNGR), and The Completionist wouldn't shut up about it. So after seeing his 101st episode (guess the gane), I decided to buy it for myself. I got it on PC because obvious reasons. (*cough* #PCMASTERRACE *cough cough* )  That next day, I played the entire game (The basic adventure, not New Game +) and loved it. The Bosses, The Relics, and who could forget, the Troupple King (A trout mixed with an apple and it's a king and it dances. Do you need more of an explanation.). If you've played game like, Ducktales, Castlevania, Mega Man, just combine them and you have the wonder that is Shovel Knight. Also Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman (Apologies if I mispelled), the guy who did the soundtrack for Ducktales Remastered, Double Dragon Neon, and pretty much most games by WayForward (Which most of the members of Yacht Club Games are from), did the soundtrack. Do you need more reasons? If so, buy this game. 10/10.			"

IT'S MEGAMAN, ZELDA 2, DUCKTALES, AND MARIO IN A PLATFORMER ORGY WITH  A SHOVEL.on a more serious note:this game is extremely good game that takes from a lot of very famous platformers ( megaman, zelda 2, and what-not). It has very clever level design that reminds me heavily of the megaman series. It does feel as if i was playing a NES game sometimes if the NES had a bit more colors and the NES was stronger, but the retro style does not at all take away from any of the gameplay elements. i highly recommend this game for anyone who really loves platformers and/or has played any of the platformers i mentioned before. This is one the examples where kickstarter actually produces a GOOD game and i must say it is very very worth it for its price. 9/10 a must buy.			"

												Shovel Knight is the love child of the classic NES - era games, combining the gameplay mechanics of such games as Ducktales, Megaman and Castlevania. As it takes a lot of stuff from old games, it tweaks and refines them into much better experience and gameplay.The Story is quite simple but still quite charming and mysterious. Shovel Knight & Shield Knight were adventuring in this forsaken, evil tower until they triggered some kind of horrendous magic and Shield Knight dissapeared. Shovel Knight managed to escape with a broken heart, as the tower sealed itself once again. Years later, the squad of evil guys appear and the tower opens once again. Shovel Knight decides to return there and find out what happened to his dear friend Shield Knight. And also to kick the bad knights asses, of course!The gameplay itself is kind of a same as in Castlevania, but instead of a whip you have a shorter ranged shovel what you can use to dig, whack and pogojump only into enemies. There's also upgrades and usable items which you can buy to make your Shovel Knight much better.The stage desing is like in Megamans but with checkpoints which you can also destroy for harder challenge. Each of the main stages has their own special theme and in the end of each one their unique boss. There's also special stages and random special encounters in the world map for more shovely action.The music in this game is as awesome as the game itself. What I've seen, there's over 40 unique tracks of music for each stage, boss and town. If you love Megamans music, you'll love this one too.In the end I don't have anything negative to say about this game. It's so charming and awesome that I can't but to recommend this to everyone who love old NES games and to those who are new to this genre. ♥/♥ "

												As a digging simulator, Shovel Knight paints a Steinbeckian portrait of the exploited proletariat - who, as it was with Grapes of Wrath's self-deluded poor, see themselves as ""temporarily embarrassed millionaires."" Ah, but as does Shovel Knight share philosophy with Steinbeck, so does it share the eminent author's weakness, too: an overabundance of dancing fish, which to this humble reviewer felt akin to supplanting a ballet with drunken, groping jitterbug.1 out 1000 gems.

												  The music, the gameplay, the graphics, the characters, all just simply amazing. Everything about this game is appealing, and the mechanics are really thought out and well executed. Checkpoint systems are ingenious, losing gold on death is much better than having lives and gives a greater motivation for players to stay alive (also it's less frustrating than a flaccid ""GAME OVER"" screen). And there are so many new things introduced in every stage I never found myself getting bored, you should absolutely buy this game, its well worth your money! I mean what were you going to do with that $15 anyway? Buy a sandwich or two?  Fine, go buy your sandwich, sure it will taste good for the 15 minutes you're eating it, but then what? It's gone, just like that, and you know what? I bet you're still hungry.  Well *this* game is like a sandwich that lasts *forever* and if you get tired of it, you can put it in the fridge and get a different sandwich. But when you feel like getting some of that moutwatering Shovel Knight sandwich you haven't had in such a long time, it'll be there, right there in your fridge waiting for you, because Shovel Knight will always be there for you, so you should be there for it!

												Dude. I. Love This Game. I got this game thinking, ""oh this'll be sorta cool, lets try it,"" and came out thinking ""welcome to all you need to renew your faith in retro gaming!"" I love the style of this game combining elements from all my favourite retro games, like Zelda, and Megaman! I thought it to be challenging, nut not in a frustrating way, and I found the bosses to be difficult, but not in a throw-your-keyboard-at-the-wall kind of way. All I can really say about this game without spoiling it, is it is an amazing game, difficult but not too difficult, retro style, super mario world type map, with Zelda 2 dungeon & Megaman type levels. I all in all give this game a 9/10, due to how it is, on occasion, a little frustrating at those spots where you keep dying whenever you go to get your gold from previous death.			"

												A nice little title that about saving worlds and shoveling loot--recreated as an NES game but with a few more colors on screen at one time. The pacing is a bit off early on. You get infinite lives, but every time you die there is a steep phat loot penalty--causing you to try to reclaim dat loot from where you died. All in all though, if you like Duck Tales mixed with Zelda and a dash of Super Mario for good measure, then this game is for you.:Tips to avoid pulling hair out over losing dat phat, phat loot:-The fishing pole can grab dat phat loot that looms over chasms after you've died.-Keep a yellow potion to snag other phat loot you don't have time to grab.-Sometimes, if it's a tough area--and the save station is a ways back--it might be best to let dat sweet phat loot go until later. I know you gotta get all dat sweet phat glorious loot but the phatest loot can be grabbed more easily with other sweet phat gloriously triumphant looted relics later in the game.... after they've been looted most phatedly.

												You take the best bits from Megaman (8 boss themed stages, ridiculously catchy 8bit tunes) and you mix it with some Mario style overhead level selecting (including extra areas and extra boss encounters) and top it off with some lite RPG leveling mechanics, and you got an amazing homage to the 8bit era. The platforming is engaging, with treacherous enemy placement and a down attack mechanic that boosts your height. The combat is simplistic, but with a regular stream of new relic abilities, ensures an ever expanding arsenal and mobility enhancements. There's a few too many insta-death areas which will increase your frustration level, but this is classic gaming where pattern recognition and memorization are the name of the game. Plus it has a very forgiving checkpoint system, about 5 per stage, which is about 4 more than you got back in the day. Not only does it look the part, but this is old school gaming at its best.			"

The controls, the stages, the characters, the music. THE MUSIC! My ears have never felt so good as when I listen to this classic music. This is the kind of game that just feels right to play. If you ever played a nintendo platformer with a controller back in the day, you can feel it. You feel like you went back in time, to the days of laying around and building your childhood, making memories on your old SNES, or console of choice. This is worth your money. This is a masterpiece. It reminds us that games were meant for one simple purpose: to have FUN. Not for leaderboards, not for clans, not for trolling, FUN. If your game isn't about having fun, it's not a game. THIS game is about having fun. LOTS.			"

												I won’t deny that I absolutely love games that bring me back to when I was a child. 8-Bit, 16-bit and just remakes of classics get me jazzed up to play. What am I seguing to, you might be asking. Well I’ll tell you gentleman! It’s Shovel Knight. The first game made by Yacht Club Games. I first laid eyes on this game whilst strolling through Youtube one day and my goodness it looked glorious. Shovel Knight was funded by Kickstarter in April of last year and now has FINALLY been released. So, was it worth the wait? Did Yacht Club Games earn our money? Listen up and follow me after the jump!STORYShovel Knight being that it’s developed in 8-bit most people would completely skip it, and they, I find, would be missing out on such a great story of love, loss and redemption. The story, itself is one of the 8-bit era. Shovel Knight must save his lost love Shield Knight by defeating The Order of No Quarter and The Enchantress. So you know the drill tragic event happens, love has been lost, must fight multiple enemies and evil order in order to get back what was lost. You’ve heard it before, but it hasn’t been executed as well as this in a very long time...if ever for these types of games honestly. The characters and environments are so damned fresh and lively that it brings me into the world. GAMEPLAYSo being a Shovel Knight what else would you use but a trusty shovel to bring down The Order of No Quarter? The combat is simple and very responsive for any player to pick up and play. You get an easy swing of the shovel as well as a downswing, akin to Scrooge McDuck in Ducktales or Cranky Kong in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. If you need a little more digging power you can purchase different suits of armor and upgrades for your spade throughout your journey, as well as upgrading your health and mana. In order you purchase these upgrades you have to collect gold. Whether it be piles of gravel, opening chests, discovering secrets, or whacking your enemies collect the gold and pick your poison. Along with all of this you get a series of items that will help you on your journey, like an Anchor, Fireballs, Dirt Gauntlets and many more. With these items and more you can bury your enemies into the dirt. It’s very clear that old school games were VISUALS AND SOUNDWith a game like this the sound and visuals are always key points for me. These days it seems some people care for crazy visuals and orchestrated sound, but I grew up on the bits and chips so by all means, dig them up and let me enjoy them. Shovel Knight’s style of progression is a breath of fresh air to 8-bit style games. This is a game that deserves the term “Nintendo” game. The music is just as good if not the best part of the game. Jake Kaufman is a master at what he does when it comes to music and Manami Matsumae (Mega Man Composter) helping with a few tracks just gives the soundtrack more weight. Wrap UpShovel Knight is very much a love letter to 8-bit but it is absolutely not stuck in time. It’s characters and story engaging, it’s combat masterfully crafted and the visuals and sound exactly what you need to experience this game. It oozes confidence and knows exactly what it is and goes far beyond what it tries to do. It’s one of the best games I have played this year and is a game that everyone should play. No matter what is keeping you from playing this game, dig right through the vault of heaven with your...Shovel...I think I reached my pun quota for this review!			"

												Simply one of the most overwhelmingly well-executed games I have ever played. Charming, funny, brilliantly designed, satisfyingly concluded, Shovel Knight's quest (which has, by the way, distinct Arthurian undertones) is one that will stay with you for a long time. The art direction and music deserve special praise: the soundtrack is megaman-esque, but with more fantasy oriented sounds. I never tired of hearing the music for each level. Propeller Knight's level's music is an example of perfeclty matched sounds to the style of the level, in my opinion. The look of each level is very distinct, which to me more than makes up for the fact that there are a relatively small number of them---I was excited to play each level as I got to it, and to be honest, this game made me feel that excited gaming feeling that I haven't really felt since I was younger. So obviously I'm going to recommend it! Please let there be a sequel...			"

												Looking for a platformer that crosses Duck Tales and Mega Man in pseudo 16-bit style?  Look no further.  In this excellent retro style side scrolling platformer you control Shovel Knight.  Weilding a shovel as his main weapon of choice as he combats his way through his 10 hour quest in order to find Shield Knight.There are bosses throughout this adventure and each stage hides upgrades to further your expendition in search of his shield weilding counter part.  Much like a Metroidvania some areas you can not progress unless you do find these upgrades or purchase them from the trader in the town.The game is extremely well done and the musical score is fantastic as well.  The devs have already released DLC that extends the life double fold and for FREE!  The bosses are fun and fairly easy to defeat.  The games stages though start off easy enough and progressively get more difficult as you make your way to the end.Recommended to anyone that loves a good platformer with story.  10/10			"

												As a gamer, I've never been too keen on the big-name modern games.  I want to enjoy them, but they often come off as bland, uninspired, and lacking a distinct charm that I crave.  Hell, it took me until Team Fortress 2 to even own an FPS title.So yeah, I'm a fan of the classics, and it saddens me that younger gamers seldom get a taste of what gaming was like back in the day.  Leave it to Shovel Knight to set the record straight.Right from the first notes of the intro stage theme, I knew that this was gonna be FUN.  And I was exactly right.  It was FUN.  The distinct charm that I crave.  FUN.Poetic language aside, I love just about everything in this game.  The gameplay is simple to understand yet hard to master.  The presentation is quirky and colorful (the main character wields a shovel, for Mew's sake). and everything from the 8-bit graphics to the kickass chiptune soundtrack reeks of retro charm.  Speaking of retro, the gameplay reflects this quite well.  As stated before, it's simple and draws inspiration from several sources, yet it still feels like its own entity.  After all, it's still a game made in 2014, and the achievement system and upgrade shops serve as a reminder to this.  Of course, a game isn't retro without challenge, and it's sadly the one point that I find slightly lacking.  That's not because there is no challenge; it just feels like the wrong kind of challenge at times.  I can tolerate challenge via level design and game progression, and Shovel Knight does that well.  However, I still can't get over certain factors that feel rather cheap at times.  Enemy placement is ungodly annoying, especially in the later levels, and design choices like the blackout segments from the Lich Yard never cease to infuriate me.  Even then, all you're doing is losing money upon death, but if you die repeatedly, get ready to grind gold and backtrack to get what you want.But I can overlook this.  Because really, if that's all I have to complain about, then Shovel Knight is truly worthy of the acclaim it's received.  Mainstream developers, take notes.  Because indie companies are on the rise, and if this game is any indication, they're doing your job better than you are at the moment.9.5/10; currently my favorite game that I first played in 2015			"

												Long story short, I LOVE this game.  There is only one real gripe I have about it (and a secondary minor one), but the music, level design, and even the story are amazing.  The bosses (some of them anyways) are not as hard as one would think and can be dispatched pretty easily, and you inherently have infinite lives on a given level.  While you do lose loot on death and you can destroy checkpoints (those concepts I like), it's not quite enough to balance out the fact that it's more about your patience on a level than using a more traditional lives pool.As I said earlier though, music, gameplay, level design, and the story are very well detailed and worth indulging in the game.  If you ever wanted to introduce someone to what classic gaming was like, this is a good place to start.			"

												When it comes to Kickstarter I've always been rather skeptical, unfortunately it's become a bastion for hacks to make broken promises and release unfinished titles, which makes me apprehensive to ever donate to any Kickstarter title. Shovel Knight however is the exception to the rule, as the most polished title I've ever seen come from a Kickstarter campaign I can definitely say that this game comes highly recommended and with yet more free content on the horizon, Shovel Knight is the gift that just keeps on giving.Clearly inspired by the NES era of gaming and with obvious nods to the classics of old (specifically the Megaman series, a fond favourite of mine) this game delivers on all fronts. With a quality sound track, imaginative art direction and larger than life characters, this challenging platformer delivers on everything it promises. I had been looking forward to this game for a long time and picked it up at launch, but waited to write a review because I was so impressed with it that I really wanted to do it justice. After experiencing some recent disappointment with hyped up Kickstarter titles (namely Hyperlight Drifter) I felt now was the best time to share my love for Shovel Knight in the hopes that more passionate developers will find inspiration in the example set by Yacht Club Games and that indie gaming can return to being less about unwanted hipster drama and more about quality gameplay from developers who genuinely care about the medium.If being impressed by the base game wasn't enough Yacht Club released the first of a number of free DLCs in the form of Plague Knight's adventure, one of the bosses from the base game whose story you can now play through to see how he ended up in the position he's in when you encounter him as Shovel Knight. Not only did this DLC manage to be surprisingly different from the base game both in terms of how Plague Knight plays and offering his own seperate story, but it also managed to keep things fresh by having a very different feel and adding a dash of extra humour to the character to make the initially creepy Plague Knight actually seem surprisingly sympathetic, funny and dare I say somewhat lovable. This leaves me very confident that the upcoming DLC adventures will by just as polished and I have to say I am really looking forward to them.Shovel Knight is easily up there with the best of Indie titles, alongside such great games as Cave Story and Freedom Planet, I really can't recommend this game enough! For those of you who have fond memories of the NES era and younger gamers who want a retro experience, you really can't go wrong with Shovel Knight, so do yourself a favour and get shovelling for shovelry!

												Shovel night in my opinion is an (almost) original game on its own,Yacht Club said in the crefits they were inspired by nintendo titles such as Mega Man, Mario, Kirby and Metroid, if you played the game you can tell. And they made a great game, but it was short and though I was satisfied with the game I wished it was longer. Buy Shovel Knight now! gg, good game 8/10.   c :( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Are you tired of all the self-styled ""retro"" games that only ran the graphics through a pixel filter? Do you miss the awesome, catchy-as-hell chiptune music of old? Are you even remotely miffed that Capcom apparently hates Megaman now?If so, buy this. You'll be treating yourself to one of the best platformers seen in a decade.			"

												Let's combine Megaman, Ducktales and Castlevania... oh and maybe little bit mario, what do we get Shovel Knight.This game is an fine gem with kickass soundtrack, gameplay, idea of the weapon, bosses and challenge.As Megaman, it got 8 bossess, 8 sub-weapons that you get to get trough the stage (not from after defeating boss, just find blue chest with Jester selling item) and let's not forget the kicking music that makes you go for it.As Ducktales, it use some technique and attacks and... well, treasures. (not much familiar with ducktales game)As Castlevania, it use lot of medieval look, breakable wall, food as health and running to the castle.As mario, well just the map.This may not be very clear review about it, but if you like good 8-bit game with interesting weapon of choice, good sountracks and if you are fan of any of these game, I recommend to buy it, it's worth on your money as it worth on my money.

												Shovel Knight came to me in a time where I was between computers. I only had my little laptop and it was not capable of playing the more graphically intense games that I love to play. I was stuck with a library of Steam Games but no Computer to play them. Then along came Shovel Knight. Everything I remembered about games like Mega Man X that made my childhood came flowing back. From the tight controls to the amazing soundtrack to the lovable characters and intriguing dialog, Shovel Knight took me in, Hook, Line, and Sinker. Buy this game for your own good. It's worth every penny I spent on it. Finish the story mode, play the DLC they gave to you for free entitled Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows where you play as an enemy boss you defeated in the Main Story. After that there are plenty of challenges to test your skills. It's a lot of content and a great fun game I was not able to put down. AND it can run on pretty much any system. Enjoy!			"

												Shovel Knight is a great game, but it still has flaws.In the style department, Shovel Knight predictably feels like some kind of NES game on steroids (in a good way); everything feels retro and original, yet there are extra animations and frames that wouldn't be there in an actual older game. This makes Shovel Knight a much cleaner, more modern experience without detracting from the style, sort of like a rotary dial telephone that's connected with modern phone lines, if that analogy works for you. The soundtrack is similar, retro and modern at the same time.Controls-wise, the game is also spot on. It's a simple, yet fun system that allows for big plays to be made with very little there in the level. A simple ledge, some spikes, and the weakest enemy in the game can suddenly turn into a crazy combo in which you kill the enemy, avoid the spikes, and jump on the ledge. Easy? No. Satisfying? Immensely.Is it a perfect game? No. Shovel Knight does get a bit mixed up in respects to the bosses. Yes, it is in the style of an older game, so yes, you will be dying and restarting the room many times if you run into a hard bit. Yet the bosses seem to not be the kind of enemy that do things predictably. As such, you'll really just have to go in, figure out what the boss does every time it so much as moves a finger, figure out how to avoid that, and then die and try again. This may just be a sign of my mediocracy at games like these, but it really feels like the world champion at NES games and my eleven-year-old brother would have the same amount of difficulty on their first few tries at the bosses. They don't fit into the ""play more and you get better"", but rather go ""play until you know EVERYTHING I'M GOING TO DO AND HOW TO DODGE IT then never apply it again after you beat me"".When you die, you can go back and collect your gold, so the only thing you technically lose on these tens of tries on the bosses is time, and maybe patience. Yet it gets boring and annoying when the boss keeps throwing something your way that you can't seem to avoid. The bosses hit harder, faster, and have more health than you.It's frustratng, and I can see a lot of people just giving up after a few gos, but hard-core rougelike-playing masochists will have quite a bit of fun with it.TL;DR 8/10 Great game, tedious at times, and not for everyone. Worth, but maybe wait for a sale if you don't know for sure you like this kind of game.			"

												The perfect homage to retro. Plays like the memory of what childhood platformers were like, but not how they might actually be when the cloud of nostalgia is lifted. Very self-aware design throughout, mashing together classic tropes and a few contemporary ideas (I'm a big fan of the Souls-style currency/corpse run), with gorgeous art, one of the catchiest soundtracks in a while, and a load of humor. Shovel Knight is a great game all around that evokes classic style without pandering, and stands up on its own right. I think it's easily worth full price.			"

												I highly recommend this game if you 1. like the Mega man genre, cause it plays alot like it with some of it's own features (in this case a good thing it plays a decent amount like it). 2. you like action platformers and lastly 3. U like games with a good amount of challenge. If you like all those things I can't think of a better game in this genre and yes it might even be better than mega man 9 and 10. music is also ♥♥♥♥ing great and theres like 50 tracks. Something I don't really like about the game is theres much of the same enemy in different colours, with slightly different moves, this is mostly visable with the knights where for example stabs 1 time the other 2 times and another jumps aswell.but this didnt bother me all that much. second thing that might need to get nerfed is HP potions, u can get cups for not a high price at a fellow in town, after that u can fill em up with liquids, 1 of them is a full restore, these cup fills are free btw, and when u have 10 hearts and restore em all with 1 potion is bvery hard to die especially since u can restore them after every level.Great game, will grant you alot of fun for I'd say 6-8 hours for the main story, and after that u can collect all collectables and beat new game+, aswell as getting every achievement the game has.My final score of the game is.... 8.5/10, AWESOME game, with some very minor issues "

												Hello everyone of Steam and probably the internet, this will be a review on the indie game called ""Shovel Knight"" developed and published by Yacht Club Games. Just imagine ideas from some of your favorite NES games such as Duck Tales, Castlevania, Mega Man, and Legend of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link (and probably more) just put into one fantastic 8-bit game. That is what this game is in short words.Ok, now for the good things about this. This game plays like a melee version of Mega Man, with a bounce and attack system of DT and LoZ. It has the classic 8-bit style of the NES, which some might be ""Ewwww this game sucks because look at the graphics."" Just ignore those people because this is near the beginning of the real start of the video gaming era and was a great one. The music is epic too, it has the sounds like it was an NES game and it is just awesome. I would love to see more to this game soon, it is such a great experience for me since I love classic old games.Now for the bad. On some low end PCs, you can't play as well, but that should not be a problem for others due to the advancements in technology since when my PC was made. The one problem with some of the ideas borrowed is mainly one that I found, which is that, like in Castlevania, you get knocked back, and hopefully, not into a hole and die. Otherwise, that is all I have to complain about this game.After hours of watching and playing this game and examining it I came to a conclusive result. For the final result of this game, I will give it a 9.5/10. It is not a perfect game, but damn is it good. I would love to see great games like these more often, instead of stuff like the new Call of Duty, which is just a slightly altered game engine, and a multiplayer focused point and click game. I know people ask for a different formula, but when people do it, it sucks, but because they failed in some aspect of it and because the majority now is so stupid to have a change for once. So overall, this game is great, everyone should go get it if they enjoy games like Mega Man, cause it will be worth the money to you and the developers.			"

												A game that meshes everything great from the NES classics Castlevania III, DuckTales, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Mega Man, with some modern influences from Dark Souls, this game creates one of the greatest sidescrolling platformers of this generation.  Everything is great about this game, from its difficulty, its art style, its music (by the awesome Jake Kaufman and legendary Manami Matsumae), and the characters.  This game is great, I would wholly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre, and especially to those who aren't.			"

												You miss those days when you saw the heart and soul put into a game?When the game was challenging, but not punishing?When the game had charm, but wasn't childish?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should definitely look into Shovel Knight. Even if you said no because you weren't old enough to have classic memories of ye games of olde but would be interested then this is still a solid game to play. It's definitely inspired by a lot of older games such as Megaman and Ducktales, but it plays extremely well and is a standout and well made game.For starters, the gameplay itself is really solid. For the levels, the platforming is solid, controls extremely well, and is overall well designed. Most stages have a gimmick, such as being pitch black and only lightning to show the path, or lava you have to traverse by spreading a gel on it. This makes each level it's own and stand out. For the bosses, the combat is extremely smooth. They do their pattern and you dodge and fight them, and each boss has a bit of a gimmick (One gets a herald of trumpets to cause raining killer confetti, while another sets up a treasure chest that steals your money). Each knight (or boss) has it's own personality to. You got the self-riteous King Knight, the bratty Tinker Knight, and so on. The items are also interesting, and each bring their own gameplay change (Though you are by no means required to get them, which makes them better). Some have utility (Such as an amulet that gives invulnerability), some give aid to platforming (Such as a knife that pulls you forward), and others just help with combat (Such as a giant anchor that you can throw). Which items are useful or not depends on how the player uses them, though almost all items can be used in most situations.The death system is also interesting. If you die you lose a large sum of your collected loot, but you can retrieve it by grabbing the floating bags that you leave behind (on the first life after you die). This means while death isn't that punishing, it can cause you to not be able to get some items, so you are still encouraged to keep as much treasure as you can.There is also one neat little gimmick that levels have: Their checkpoints. While this isn't true for the first level, you can break your checkpoints as you go along for treasure, but remove the check point itself. Checkpoints that have a longer stretch to the next one generally give more treasure. It becomes a measure of risk vs reward!The music is also quite amazing overall. Though some may not like the chiptune instruments, it is overall well composed.As every rose must have it's thorns, though, this to has some flaws.While I said the level design is amazing earlier, the majority of the time the enemies aren't obstacles as much as platforms, and this makes some levels feel like the biggest threat is the instakill pits/spikes/lava, which given a health system seems redundant.Also most bosses can simply be cheesed by ""Scrooge McDucking"", ie. Simply bouncing on them over. And over. And over, and that often times is a blind spot on them, so the difficulty of the boss is diminished if you are good at bouncing over and over.Another issue is a couple bosses have instant kill moves that can catch a player off guard (Snow Knight...), leading to some cheap deaths (Though this is rare).Finally, the final boss has one flaw I find quite major: You are supposed to bounce off a partner, however there is no implication of this. You can't stand on them like it looks like, you can't hit them or anything... this can lead to frustration of just trying to figure out how to beat the final boss.Overall a terrific game in almost any aspect, save for a few minor gripes! If you are looking for an entertaining game, look no further!			"

The controls, the stages, the characters, the music. THE MUSIC! My ears have never felt so good as when I listen to this classic music. This is the kind of game that just feels right to play. If you ever played a nintendo platformer with a controller back in the day, you can feel it. You feel like you went back in time, to the days of laying around and building your childhood, making memories on your old SNES, or console of choice. This is worth your money. This is a masterpiece. It reminds us that games were meant for one simple purpose: to have FUN. Not for leaderboards, not for clans, not for trolling, FUN. If your game isn't about having fun, it's not a game. THIS game is about having fun. LOTS.			"

												Maaan, if this game had been around when I was a kid, this would have been the number 1 game of my childhood. It's just so good for an old school NES-style platformer. The challenges are satisfying and the level design is pretty fun and great to explore. The added free DLC to the game is an amazing gesture, and the DLC is pretty worthwhile in it's own right! Highly recommended.			"

												Fast paced, fun, great retro 8-bit soundtrack.  Easy controls and a game mechanic I haven't seen before - getting knocked back after attacking an enemy.  It's usually the other way around.  I can honestly say this is one of the BEST games I've played so far in 2016.			"

												Shovel Knight may just be the best platformer of the past few console generations.  Yatch Club Games has outdone themselves with this title bringing players a well tuned, creative game that will keep you wanting to play rather then feeling compelled to keep going just to see the ending.  Whats more is the three free DLC packs that the game has (Plague Knight currently out, King Knight and Specter Knight coming soon) you really are getting four games in one as each campaign plays and has different story than the others.  Whether on sale or standard price Shovel Knight is well worth the cost.  With the recent ressurection of pixel art platformers it is easy to understand why Shovel Knight has come to be the reigning king.			"

												If you like old-school 8-bit games, you absolutely must get this one.  A love-letter to all of the NES greats, incorporating elements of Mega Man, Super Mario Bros. 3, Zelda 2: Adventure of Link, Castlevania, and more, it is truly amazing.Gameplay is solid, with none of the floaty response that plagued actual games from the NES era.  Earlier stages start off easier and get progressively more difficult as they go along, but at no point does the game hold your hand.  There are relics to find that give extra abilities, or you can choose not to collect them to give an added challenge.  Your life and magic meters can be likewise extended or not based on your preference.  And the same even goes for weapon and armor upgrades.All of the usual suspects can be found in the stage design: Fire stage?  Check!  Ice stage?  Check!  Water stage, clockwork stage, and multiple-form bosses?  Check, check and check!  And the music!  Oh boy the music.  You'll be humming a lot of the tunes long after you've quit for the night.  I highly recommend picking up the soundtrack, available at a choose-your-own-cost.Get the game.  Get it now.  And love it.			"

												This game is a fantastic platformer that feels along the lines of NES games like Duck Tales, Mega Man, and Castlevania.  It's hard enough to provide a challenge, yet is not overwhelmingly difficult.The design of the game is so intuitive that you can just pick up the game and start playing without ever reading a manual, and the tutorial level gracefully teaches you all you need to know about the game without printing a single word on the screen.The one thing I would criticize would be the relatively large amount of time it takes from dying to jumping back into the action; if you died without using a checkpoint, it is literally faster to exit and restart the game than it is to wait for the game to explain how much gold you dropped when you died and from which check point (if any) you will be resuming play.BTW, I'm only about half-way through the game.

												A smile will be on your face the whole time you play it. Shovel Knight isn't too full of new ideas, though that isn't a bad thing. Shovel Knight dug up some of the best mechanics of the NES era, and mixed them all together into a very solid, and very fun action platformer. It reminds me what the most important thing about video games is, and that no other media can replicate, gameplay.			"

												This might just be my game of the year for 2014, unless Super Smash Bros. can manage to blow my mind yet again. Let me list a few reasons why this game is so awesome.1. The 8-bit graphicsThe graphics in this game have amazed me and given me a somewhat nostalgic feel of playing games on the nes. Another great thing about this is that it never makes fun of itself for being a retro looking/feeling game. (*cough cough retro city rampage * cough cough) With the constant overflow of old looking games, this one really stands out, especially for its beautiful animations.2. The level designThe level design is also very creative, one minute throwing me into a village reminiscent of Zelda II and the next, leading me underground to fight a giant mole-monster-humanoid-thing. This game is loaded with variety, and the platforming is pixel-perfect.3. The difficulyNo game I've ever played before has ever made me slam down on my computer's keyboard as hard as I did when I kept falling into the same pit over and over again. But it wasn't the game's fault for the ""clunky platforming"", but mine because I knew I had messed up. The game is unbelievably hard, but it also has such a forgiving death system that makes it very beatable, and with enough practice you can get amazing at every single level, and then go back to find all the secrets that you missed.4. The musicThe Shovel Knight soundtrack is probably one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard in a game, if not the best. The chiptune flows beautifully into your ears. It sounds like 8-bit heaven, and I would without a doubt reccomend for everyone to download the soundtrack off of the official Bandcamp page.And i've just scratched the surface. But if you want the full deal, I would totally ""dig deeper"" and give this game a try, wether you like classic games or not.TENOUTTATEN.			"

												This game was fantastic.  Takes the old retro platformer formula and perfects it.  It is challenging at times but isn't super punishing. Auto-saves, checkpoints, and the ""Super Mario-esque"" overworld map makes this a great one for those who just want to do a level and take a break, but it is addicting so you probably won't put it down.  The story is very 1989 NES but that is what makes it great, the controls are super tight and the level design is super.  I recommend this to anyone. It would make a great handheld game so maybe the 3ds version is worth looking at.  With all the items and levels completed it took me 5-6 hours, I missed some collectables though if you're the completionist type.  Overall this game is fantastic and worth a playthrough, I will definitely be doing a ""New Game Plus"" run.5 ""Ridiculous Shovel Puns"" out of 5			"

												I know what you're thinking... oh, another indie retro platformer. Shovel Knight is definitely that, but it's also the finest example of that in the last few years.Developed by Yacht Club Games, This is yet another success of how Kickstarter can bring you a game that would of not otherwise been made via  traditional funding methods.Shovel Knight takes the retro-ness to a new level though. It's incredibly faithful, whilst removing some of the limitations of the NES console (like sprite flickering, and some other limitations). The developers stuck to the original NES color palette, though they added an 1 or 2 extra colours as Yacht Club insisted that they couldn't make certain things look the way they wanted without the extra colours. It's outstounding what they did with the limitations. The pixel art is absolutely full of character, talent and is wonderful to look at.You play as a knight that wields a shovel -  aka Shovel Knight (how awesome, right?). The story is quite simple, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight fought alongside each other, traversing across the world seeking treasure together. But for reasons that I won't spoil, you are seperated. After secluding himself and griefing for Shield Knight, he digs up his shovel again, hoping to find and rescue Shield Knight. The sound uses a sound engine that was used in some of the Japanese Famicom console or something along those lines. You can even put the sound track onto a NES cartridge, and it would play on a NES! (Sadly, the whole game wouldn't though - as I mentioned, they removed some of the limitations that wouldn't make it possible to play it on a NES console). It definitely nails the authenticity of 8bit sound.The music is probably why I instantly fell in love with Shovel Knight within the first 30 seconds of the first level. What a cracker of a track. Every single level has a track that you will be bopping and humming melodies to for days. This isn't music that is 'good for chiptunes', it is GREAT music that just happens to be chiptunes.As every track has a theme, so do the levels. Every level has a themed boss (Propeller Knight, Polar Knight and Mole Knight - for instance), where the whole level will be themed around the boss mechanically and visually. Every level adds some new mechanic and challenge that keeps it fresh as you progress through the game.The razor tight controls are why it's so fun to play (I would recommend playing with a pad). It takes elements from certain games like Duck Tales, Megaman and Mario... and combines them with some light RPG elements. What you have is a game that feels, looks and plays oldschool. But has the polish and design tendancies of a more modern game. It gets quite challenging towards the towards the end of the game too, but newgame+ is where you will find the real challenge as checkpoints are halved, enemies do more damage, and most food platters that heal you will instead, turn into bombs that will try to bury you.I can't really praise Shovel Knight enough. It does so much right, and if it was released 20 years ago, it probably would of been hailed as a classic.			"

												""No, No, Dig up stupid""... ~ Chief WiggumShovel Knight, where to even begin? Such an amazing nostalgia trip for those of us who remember what it was like being a child growing up in the late 80's / early 90's. Some new age gamers might not ""get it"". The game is as casual or difficult as you want it to be depending on the items you collect throughout the journey, so it's definitely a game that can be played by everyone.There is checkpoint system implemented in the stages so it's casual but after the tutorial stage you are given the option to destroy the checkpoints you come in contact with, for hardcore gamers this is a Godsend. If anyone remembers games where dying at a boss meant repeating the entire level over again, this is for you. Honestly I don't remember any NES game that did this, most games had checkpoint systems implemented and I feel it's a bit of a misnomer and hyperbole...The music is created by the incredibly talented Jake Kaufman of Contra 4, Double Dragon Neon and Mighty Switch Force fame just to mention a few. It's definitly no slouch in terms of catchy tunes so it'll keep you thinking about the game long after you've shelved it.It borrows game play elements from games like Mega Man, Zelda II, Ducktales and Super Mario Bros. 3 just to give an example of what to expect. There is a small upgrade system implemented but it doesn't take control over the game entirely. You still have to earn most of your upgrades through good old fashioned game play and I thought it was a fine balance. It'll give you an edge in the early game to buy out shops but aftewards you will have to rely on some skill which could proove frustrating to some gamers not used to those sorts of elements.I found the game fair in difficulty, none of the stages are ""easy"" but none of them are overly frustrating either. I noticed the game never ramped in difficulty too much, it kind of goes up a notch with each new wave of bosses and seems to level off from there. With some replayable factors such as New Game+, it will keep you coming back to try again. The only way to get good at games like this is to keep playing and memorize them, it will become more enjoyable if you plug in the hours.The one big peeve I have about the game is the sloppy level design, I found it a bit erratic at times and too random. The one big flaw with this game is the way it flows and that could proove to be an issue for speed running. The relics are all hidden off the beaten path but once aquired could be used to create shortcuts through most main stage obstacles.I wouldn't say it's a flawless masterpeice but it's definitely a sleeper hit / hidden gem type game like Little Sampson, Whomp 'Em or Panic Restaurant... it definitely has charm and you can tell passion was put in to it. If this was released 20 years ago it would more than likely have a large cult following today and be worthy of being sold at auctions for hundreds of dollars.If you enjoy old school games, you will definitely put the effort in to playing this and will be rewarded for your effort of growing to love this game even more. If you're not good at retro style games, you should probably steer clear of this title as you're bound to be disappointed and think it's terrible... when it really isn't.Overall if I had to rank this game, which is stupid and subjective, it's an 8 out of 10... the pros far outweigh the cons. It's a great game if you give it a chance.			"

												Shovel Knight brilliantly recreates the style of early '90s platformers, from the old-school aesthetic to the satisfying level design. Tying it all together is a lighthearted and surprisingly effective story that gives the game a real heart. Unfortunately, much like the older games that inspired it, Shovel Knight can be unfair at times; numerous deaths and forced repetition really hurt the experience. Fans of older games are guaranteed to be pleased with Shovel Knight, but newcomers may grow impatient with its unforgiving difficulty. Regardless, this is a very unique title that's worth a look from everyone who loves creative games.(Rating: 8/10 “Very Good”)			"

												Shovel Knight is an absolute masterpiece. It is a beautiful platformer featuring a wonderful cast of characters, a very polished world and level design, variety and challenge. And if the base game was not enough the developers of Yacht Club Games are bringing free dlc, or rather full expansions, that just change the way the game is played: from challenges to whole new campaigns featuring new playable characters. Having played the Plague of Shadows expansion I can confirm that these dlcs are worth looking for, they are so good to the point of seeming like another full game in your library. I see myself coming back to this game many times, and i think it will still be amazing decades from now, without a single doubt. For all platformer fans out there, this is a must have, trust me.If this and all the other reviews have not yet convinced you to buy this game probably nothing ever will. But you will be the one missing out on an amazing adventure! =D			"

It has that cozy 8-bit feel but also has things like awesome lighting effects (for a game with a 8-bit design, there is), a very neat difficulty curve (sometimes rather challengeing, but never smash-my-keyboard-to-death-hard, except in challenge mode, but that's like Dark Souls 8-bit edition. Don't go there.) the story is entertaining (not to mention the numerous puns....), and the experience in all is very well held toghether. Also. The soundtrack. This is a GREAT game soundtrack. I recommend everyone that ever enjoyed a platformer to at least give it a chance. You probably won't regret it! "

												I'm not usually a fan of games that are difficult. I hate it when I die multiple times in a game, especially by the same enemy, and ESPECIALLY when it's in the same area each time that I just can't get past. I'm that wuss that plays games on easy because I don't want to get frustrated because a game is too difficult. Shovel Knight is surprisingly the exception. Shovel Knight is a tough game, I've died many times and very often during a level. Despite yelling profanities and getting more and more frustrated with each death, I've yet rage quit. Maybe it's because there's no saves within the level, so if you quit you have to start over, but there's something about it that makes me come back each time I die. I don't get just annoyed, I get determined and improve my technique. I last longer in each battle after I die, and there are areas of the level that despite being too difficult to surpass at one point, I've now figured out. It's really refreshing, and I wish other games were able to achieve this level of fun and frustrating. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by Shovel Knight. Really enthralling, old-school, and loads of fun.			"

												So I got this game for 10 bucks, but was waiting for it to go on sale for lower, since it seemed like it couldn't possibly provide as much entertainment as everyone said it would for the price of 15 bucks.I was wrong.First, I learned how to run, jump, and dig, then applied those skills to surprisingly perilous but conveniently fair platforming, all to go up against knights of varying themes and regalia, all to defeat an evil Enchantress, and, in doing so, saved the kingdom and my girlfriend.So then I decided to try Plague of Shadows, having heard it's pretty different, but still expected the same core game.I was once again wrong as I had to relearn everything, having to learn how to throw bombs, bomb jump, and apply those skills to much more almost laughably easy platforming, and betrayed all of my allies for the specific purpose of impressing my girlfriend, all while the story made no attempt to hide how evil I was.4/6/17: Now, for Specter of Torment:It was worth the wait as I had to once again relearn everything again, from using my faster scythe, homing attacks, all with mostly unrecycled environments so that , as I beat up a bunch of people to force them to join an organization against their wishes, have PTSD and inadvertently kill my best friend, while the story tries its best to make Specter Knight more sympathetic. Which it did.Pros:Beautiful 8-Bit SpritesFair difficultyFun story and charactersPros (Plague of Shadows):Almost feels like an entirely different game specifically due to the playstyle and fixes to make the mode workGives you just enough to go on, but leaves you a lot of room to learn how it worksDoesn't even try to sugarcoat that Plague Knight is an amoral ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to anyone except Mona, which is refreshing.Pros (Specter of Torment):Once again, feels like an almost entirely different game, especially since it actually has brand new stages; hell, it's actually being sold as a separate game, for 10 bucks!Manages to be serious and darker, but without compromising the franchise's signature lighthearted humor.A lot of pre-established characters get more backstory to make them interesting.Cons:Some stages are plagued with annoying enemies (The Flying Meanies particularly suck)Some stages have parts that that autoscroll upwardPretty short if you know what you're doing (need to try the New Game+)Cons (Plague of Shadows):The romantic angle is a bit by the numbers (not that it doesn't distract from how good the game mode is)A bit same-y to the main story, but the gameplay changes make up for itShovel Knight is annoying to fightCons (Specter of Torment):Remember the stage parts that autoscroll upward? This has three of thoseSome of the levels and bosses border on unfair for the sake of being unfair (Polar Knight in particular; Specter Knight is not built to fight him)It's shorter than both the main game and Plague of ShadowsOverall, it's a great game with very few hiccups, and I am very much looking forward to King Knight's game mode.I Need To Re-evaluate My Taste In Games/10			"

												4/8/2017: I have to ammend this review some since this went from ""Shovel knight"" to ""Treasure Trove. I really don't have too much to add here except that the the other knights solve the lack of runtime and replayability the base game had.[original review]Shovel Knight is while brief, excellent platforming experience that gives many nods to the greatest of platformers. a small dash of many classic platforming series make it into this game while it also having its own merits to stand on as well. from the 8 bosses with refight aspects of mega man, the pogoing with your shovel as a clear nod to ducktales and secret area galore style and world map of Mario games. It also has its own personal charms in making a quasi medieval fantasy setting. I was almost slightly disappointed in the towns that they didn't work like neutral zones like in bionic commando with how the first town dialogue goes haha...But enough with the charms and homages. Is the gameplay good? You bet it is. The controls are very tight and responsive for a platformer which is very important. The relics can make the game very easy if you bother to seek them out, which makes a very balanced  game, you can make it as hard or as easy as you like by deciding to go for certain things and it also rewards those quite amply for seeking out the secrets. the bosses are interesting to fight and each come with their own themes which a nice attention to detail in a genre where attention to detail is important. The game has all ends of the platforming spectrum covered in its stages with each largely employing its own interesting gimmicks to keep you entertained but none being super frustrating. The game is one very solid ""just right"" on many of its aspects and easily can be tweaked to fit your tastes by how you play or don't play some areas.The only thing one might complain on is the game's length, unless you aim to 100% the game an average playthrough is 3-4 hours, 5-7 if you really want to see everything the game has to offer in your first playthrough. But that being said the game is a very solid platforming experience and if you are still hesitant on it wait for a sale, but do at some point play this game.			"

												Ever heard the phrase ""Like a fine wine, it gets better with age""? Well, after 2 free DLC's that really should count as proper expansions and with another one in the works, this game takes that phrase a little too seriously. I loved it back in 2014 and I love it even more in 2017. Absolutely recommended.			"

												Shovel Knight is a retro-style game done right.Great level design, challenging and rewarding gameplay, beautiful pixel art visuals, a catchy soundtrack, and free content updates that add things such as: new campaigns, features, etc.If you're into games with a style similar to the classic Megaman and Castlevania titles or just the action platform genre overall, then look no further!Shovel Knight is definitely worth your time and money.

												This game is a fantastic platformer that feels along the lines of NES games like Duck Tales, Mega Man, and Castlevania.  It's hard enough to provide a challenge, yet is not overwhelmingly difficult.The design of the game is so intuitive that you can just pick up the game and start playing without ever reading a manual, and the tutorial level gracefully teaches you all you need to know about the game without printing a single word on the screen.The one thing I would criticize would be the relatively large amount of time it takes from dying to jumping back into the action; if you died without using a checkpoint, it is literally faster to exit and restart the game than it is to wait for the game to explain how much gold you dropped when you died and from which check point (if any) you will be resuming play.BTW, I'm only about half-way through the game.

It is a amazing 2D Platformer/Action/Aventure/RPG/etc. game that has all the elements of lovable retro games such as Megaman, Metroid, Mario, and Kirby games. The soundtrack is amazing as well as the mechanics for such a simple game. Overall, its a very polished game and I would sincerely recommend it to anyone who loves these type of games.

												If this game was released in the NES era it would be remembered today as golden classic alongside such titles as Mega Man 2 and Super Mario Bros. 3. It was released in 2014 however and it is one of better representatives of action-platformer genre I've seen in years. Everything is top notch here, from excellent 8bit graphics and music (incredibly catchy music!) to very balanced difficulty and super-tight controls. Thanks Yacht Club Games, please make a sequel.

												Quite simply, this is the best retro platformer out right now.  The mechanics are solid, stages are wonderfully crafted, and the art and music are beautiful.If you enjoyed pogo-stomping goons in Zelda 2 or Duck Tales on the NES, say hello to your soul mate.  Shovel Knight's downward thrust is crazy fun when fighting enemies, but it really shines in discovering secrets and solving puzzles.Speaking of, there are tons of secrets to discover in Shovel Knight.  Secret treasure, secret areas, secret secrets.  Also lots of great little challenge areas where you can really rack up loot if you're skilled enough.The whole game runs about the length of any old NES platformer, which I think is exactly where it needs to be.  There's still reason to come back with a New Game+ feature and achievements to unlock.  Of course, if that's not your thing, you can still have a lot of fun just playing it again.  I've beaten the game twice now and still playing.A+, 5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up, 10/10... If you have any inkling toward classic 8-bit platformers, this is a must have.			"

Real work and skill went into making this game, and it shows.  There is little that can compare to the rush the game gives me when I finally beat a level without dying, getting past  surprisingly intelligent enemies and deviously-placed traps and beating the boss.That doesn't even mention the tight controls, the fantastic chiptune music, the graphics that so effortlessly mimic classic NES games while using modern tricks and pallets.  This is just a fantastic game.			"

												Better item system then Zelda 2, More interesting weapon then Castlevania, and a theme in line with Megaman. Shovel Knight is an awesome 2 button retrogame. While retro gets thrown around a lot or the best game never made on the nes, yes while the animation and the some of the colors isn't 100% accurate it is very very close as well as the game can be played with an usb Nes controller if you want, while any controller can work just fine (havn't played with a keyboard and mouse) the controls are fun,precise, and amazing.Pros: Great HandlingAmazing art and sound designFunny story played straightInteresting game mechanics and reuse of standbys in a positive way.Forgiving loot system as well as quit system.Cons:A little difficult for newer players.For a score it would have to be 9.5/10 While it's not perfect because of some of the difficulty curve and the fact the WiiU and 3DS version has a better item management system which seems like a bad reasons to lower the score, but the game is still amazing and only minor gripes hold this game back from being considered a perfect game, but it sure is by far the best platformer in the last 5 years.

												This game is brilliant. The gameplay is excellent and constantly experiments and forces you to adapt - but in a way that seems fair and is informed by the level, the story is minimalist and yet touching and perfectly reinforces and augments the gameplay, and the amount of content is just mind-blowing. I've gotten more out of this $10 game than the majority of big-budget titles - not only does it give you an entire shovel knight campaign, completing the game unlocks the plague of shadow's DLC, which is practically a sequel in the amount of gameplay, story and playtime that it affords. (By the way, if you buy this game, it's well worth your time playing the second campaign - it's just as good, if not better, than the first one). These devs have done an amazing job, and it's definitely one of the best games i've ever played. Buy it!			"

												Shovel Knight is a game designed to be a throwback to the NES era of videogames. It takes inspiration from many classic games such as Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, DuckTales, Metroid, Mega Man, and the list goes on. You take on the role as Shovel Knight whose beloved friend, Shield Knight, has been taken away and it is your job to pass through the multiple levels and save her.There are multiple stages in this game and each of them have a different element to them which differentiates one from the rest. The levels have some difficulty to them but a set amount of checkpoints allow the game to feel less ""rage-inducing."" The checkpoints may also be ignored or ""broken"" in order to achieve more jewels or treasure, the curreny in the game, which may be used to purchase new armor, items, health upgrades, magic upgrades, or shovel upgrades. Each of the bosses at the end of the level are unique so the game does not get tedious or feel boring at any point. There are also collectibles in the form of ""Music Sheets"" which are in hidden locations throughout the game and can be collected for money, providing an incentive. The best part of the game is the fact that it is extremely replayable because of its brilliant concept and level design. The score is also amazing and very true in achieving that ""NES"" feel to the game. Any fans of classic games will appreciate this game and anyone who enjoys having fun will enjoy it as well. It definitely provides some challenge on the first playthrough and there is also a New Game + Mode for the daring. Overall, Shovel Knight is just a blast to play through and just shows the power of KickStarter. 9.5/10			"

												Shovel Knight is without a doubt 1 of the best 2D platformers I have ever played. You could even say that I really dig it *cue laugh track*.You can really see all the dedication and effort that was put into making this game. The Controls are great, The soundtrack is great. The Level desing is great. Even the characters have a lot of charm and personality to them, even though they don't exactly have a lot of depth to them. Shovel knight is also full of humor and all kinds of references, and both of tose have been done extremely well. I laughed out loud a couple of times while playing this game.The levels are also quite varied and they are full of all kinds of little secrets to find. And then the boss fights, oh those boss fights. Each of them has their own theme(just like the levels they are in), and all of them are simply fun and quite challenging to fight against. Speaking of challenge, the game starts out quite easy, but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly, yet the game never felt unfair. If you die, you only have yourself to blame. You can always try to blame the game but you are only lying to yourself if you do that you silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The game did have a few flaws though. Some of the items you can get are EXTREMELY overpowered compared to others. Also, it is a bit silly that you can tank a huge hit from a boss no problem, yet a spike scratching your ankle is an instant kill. The game is also a lil short, but I didn't really mind it that much because the level of quality remained high from beginning to end. If they make another Shovel knight game, I really hope they would make a co-op mode of some kind, where the other player could play as the Shield Knight. If that  ends up happening, they better send me a million dollars for creating this idea.Edit: Well it seem that I got what I asked for. Plague of shadows update was released, and it dramatically increased the amount of content in the game by adding a challenge mode and a completely new character who has his own campaign. With the Plague of shadows, Shovel knight reinforces it's status as 1 of my favorite indie games of all time. Keep up the good work Yacht club!			"

The best part of the game is the fact that it is extremely replayable because of its brilliant concept and level design. The score is also amazing and very true in achieving that ""NES"" feel to the game. Any fans of classic games will appreciate this game and anyone who enjoys having fun will enjoy it as well. It definitely provides some challenge on the first playthrough and there is also a New Game + Mode for the daring. Overall, Shovel Knight is just a blast to play through and just shows the power of KickStarter. 9.5/10			"

												Being born in 1987, I just caught the very tail end of the 8 bit NES era. Some of my earliest gaming memories are of playing 8 bit platformers on the NES like Mario 1/2/3, Contra and Milon's Secret Castle - Anyone remember that game? But I actually never grew up on the old Castlevanias and Megamans that Shovel Knight draws heavy influence from. The legendary difficulty of those games had discouraged me from playing them until very recently. While I feel I now appreciate those games, I don't think I would say that I enjoyed them. I just don't have the patience to bare through the brutal old school difficulty those games have. I was pleased to find out that unlike the games it's influenced by, Shovel Knight does an excellent job of easing the player into the game by slowly introducing the player to the mechanics and then incrementally ramping up the difficulty level. Don't worry, there's still some controller-snappingly difficult levels later in the game. But they come at a point where you're already too invested in the game to throw down the controller and give up in frustration... I'm looking at you, Mega Man 2.In Shovel Knight, you play as Shovel Knight who uses - you guessed it - a shovel as his primary weapon. Shovel Knight is off to save his comrade and love interest, Shield Knight, from the clutches of the evil Enchantress. Along the way you'll have to defeat eight ""boss knights"", which is a clear reference to Mega Man's usual eight robot masters. Your shovel can be used to hit enemies directly in front of you similar to Simon's whip in Castlevania or it can be thrust downward to bounce off enemies like the ""pogo bounce"" in Ducktales. The shovel can additionally be used to dig up the many mounds of treasure found throughout the levels in the game. Treasure can be used to purchase weapon, armor or health upgrades or it can also be used to purchase various ""relics"" which give you powerful secondary abilities which cost magic power. Instead of using a ""lives"" system, each time you die in Shovel Knight, you'll lose a chunk of your treasure. However, in borrowing a page from Dark Souls, if you can get back to where you died previously without dying again, you can recover your lost treasure. Very cool design. Another interesting mechanic is that each checkpoint in a level can be optionally destroyed for a good sum of treasure. It's a neat risk/reward mechanic, but I was usually too scared to destroy any checkpoints in the game, especially in the later levels.Nearly every aspect of Shovel Knight is designed to invoke 8 bit nostalgia. Everything from the menus to sound effects is very reminiscent of the NES era. It's actually possible to play the game with just four buttons and a D-pad, like a NES controller. The world map is very Mario 3-esque with optional mini-boss enemies that shuffle around the screen after completing every level. There's Zelda II like towns throughout the game where upgrades and new equipment can be purchased. Even the health boosts are potroasts in homage to Castlevania. There's some great 8 bit music as well: Strike the Earth, An Underlying Problem and La Danse Macabre are highlights from the soundtrack. Even the composition of the tracks somehow simultaneously reminded me of Castlevania and Mega Man.There really isn't too much negative I can say about Shovel Knight. It's a difficult game, but it's also a fair game. It introduces difficulty over time instead of beating you over the head with it like Shovel Knight's old school brethren. It is kind of short though, but at the same time I felt its length was appropriate. If you're a fan of old Castlevania or Mega Man games or even 2D platformers in general, you must check out Shovel Knight. You won't be disappointed.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

 If you're reading this, you're already considering buying the game. I’ll save your time: buy it.  Pros +  Addicting gameplay that takes notes from other successful games.  Hitting enemies with your shovel feels just right. Your shovel’s use as a pogo stick a la Ducktales is great and levels are designed perfectly around the ability. Relics obtained from each level are used as fun power-ups used for platforming or enemy-fighting a la Mega Man.+ Outstanding level design.  Every level has a distinct theme, and no theme gets boring at any point during a level. Level themes are constantly being taken advantage of in new and innovative ways, keeping you interested in what you’re about to face throughout every level of your journey.+ Amazing soundtrack.  The 8-bit tracks are catchy and you’ll know them by memory by the time you’ve beaten their respective levels.+ Beautiful visuals.  Vibrant 8-bit graphics and stellar background and environment designs. Every pixel looks sharp and crisp on widescreen HD displays.+ Tons of replayability.  Lots of fun achievements to unlock and bonus challenges to attempt.+ Decent story.  A bit cliché, but there isn’t much focus on the story. Games of this nature are better off putting little focus into their stories anyway.+ Free DLC!  We don’t want to pay for new content to products that were already released. Take notes AAA gaming industry. Cons - Poor death system.  After dying a percentage of your gold falls out of you around your death spot and you have to retrieve it without dying again a la Dark Souls. The system worked brilliantly in Dark Souls, but in a platformer, the system is problematic as gold is often placed over bottomless pits and is impossible to retrieve. For me this is the game’s biggest flaw, and if this game gets a sequel I hope its death system is vastly improved.- Weak boss battles.  Boss battles in this game go from average to awful. Most consist of them spamming things at you, and the final two boss fights are terrible.-Controls aren’t perfect and take some getting used to.  Jump physics feel a little off, but you’ll get used to them eventually so it’s not a deal breaker.- Enemies knock you back a  little  too far.  There’s an armor you can buy that eliminates knockback but makes platforming slippery, essentially solving one problem but creating a new one. If this game gets a sequel the knockback should be toned down a little. Do I recommend Shovel Knight? Of course I do, silly. It’s an amazing game and anyone who hasn’t played it is missing out. Buy it as soon as you can, on whatever platform you can.  "

Jumping (on the shovel) is fun like never before in any other game from that genre.

												This game was fantastic.  Takes the old retro platformer formula and perfects it.  It is challenging at times but isn't super punishing. Auto-saves, checkpoints, and the ""Super Mario-esque"" overworld map makes this a great one for those who just want to do a level and take a break, but it is addicting so you probably won't put it down.  The story is very 1989 NES but that is what makes it great, the controls are super tight and the level design is super.  I recommend this to anyone. It would make a great handheld game so maybe the 3ds version is worth looking at.  With all the items and levels completed it took me 5-6 hours, I missed some collectables though if you're the completionist type.  Overall this game is fantastic and worth a playthrough, I will definitely be doing a ""New Game Plus"" run.5 ""Ridiculous Shovel Puns"" out of 5			"

												Shovel Knight may just be the best platformer of the past few console generations.  Yatch Club Games has outdone themselves with this title bringing players a well tuned, creative game that will keep you wanting to play rather then feeling compelled to keep going just to see the ending.  Whats more is the three free DLC packs that the game has (Plague Knight currently out, King Knight and Specter Knight coming soon) you really are getting four games in one as each campaign plays and has different story than the others.  Whether on sale or standard price Shovel Knight is well worth the cost.  With the recent ressurection of pixel art platformers it is easy to understand why Shovel Knight has come to be the reigning king.			"

												This is one of those games that is hard enough to the point where when you've beaten it, you feel like you've accomplished something. You'll say: ""Oh, man. That was hard, but really fun!"" It's not the hardest game ever (far from it), but it will test your platforming skills to an appropriate level. If you enjoy a game that pushes you far, but not too far, Shovel Knight is the game for you!Though, if you plan to 100% this game like I did (including the Plague of Shadows DLC), you'll get to a point where you'll want to murder someone.

												This game is one of those that want to make you flip a table when you lose all your gold to a level.When I first started, I was like ""wow, this game should be a breeze.""...but after the second level, I died.And died.And died....and died.It's those types of games that make you want to come back for more.Geez, Yacht Club games...10/10			"

												Side-scrolling 8 bit video games came back in the greates way by old fashioned representative kickstarter child Shovel Knight. Jumping (on the shovel) is fun like never before in any other game from that genre. Must have for all platform games fans and those who are searching for funny and enjoyable games that tests our dexterity and sense of humor. Dig in for secrets and lots of 8 bit but not flat fun!!!

												An awesome game, worth every hour. A very difficult platformer with very good gameplay. I liked this game so much I also went through New Game Plus too... But only got halfway because i suck at it. I also reccomend using the cheat code in the game that changes various words within the text in the game with ""Butt"".			"

												I honestly couldn't stop playing this game. While at it's surface it's simply a platformer game which you just jump and attack, but Shovel Knight turns out to be one of my all time favorite games! I love the story. Best of all there were No tutorials, No loading screens, and no useless mindless dialoge. It's gameplay was solid and didn't contain any  bugs that I saw or experienced. IF you judge it by it's graphics you are seriously missing out. To me some of the characters that were walking by or people you bought items from seemed like they had a story to them. The story is fantastic and this was one of the games where I actually went back to find hidden secrets. The best of all was the music. I highly recomend this game to not only the players who are new to gaming because it's not overwelming on the gamer, but experienced gamers who are looking for a new game that gives them a good experience. It's a fantastic game for all kinds of players (unless your looking for a game where you have to buy a whole bunch of content to be good, shoot other players to death, yell at other players, and or a clicker game.) Shovel Knight is definitley worth your money. Get ready to steel thy shovels players!			"

												All my life I've identified as a demi shovel.When I was a young lad all the other boys played with trucks or soldiers, but I just wanted to play with a shovel. Every year on my birthday and christmas I would ask for a shovel. It didn't even have to be that nice, a 99 cent plastic one would do, but no. My parents would not allow me to carry out my forbidden love. Later on as a teenager I made a deal with a friend. I went to his house and gave him all of my tooth fairy money in exchange for his shovel. In that moment... I was euphoric. No more longing. No more begging. I had everything I ever wanted right there in my hands. I felt an overwhelming series of emotions: pride, guilt, happiness, worry. I thought I could hide my precious.I tried everywhere: the yard, my closet, the neighbors yard, but my parents found it. They found it and they broke it and burned it in front of me. IN FRONT OF ME.Those were the bitterest tears I've ever wept.I was grounded for 3 months but I didn't care anymore. My spirit was broken. It was that night I realized I could go on no longer. I ran away, and started dancing for tips on street corners. Sleeping with thugs, jumping from town to town. It was a horrible life, but eventually I gained enough money to buy my own shovel, and I started my own hole digging service. I didn't care if I was dirt poor (no pun intended).... I was happy.Well the years flew by, and eventually I found a woman, started a family, and got a nice job. But there was a severe price to being a father. I just couldn't keep up my shovel obsession at that point. My wife threatened to kick me out of the house, because the kids were so so scared of my shovel collection and how much time I spent with it. They accused me of not even knowing their names.I sold them. 600 dollars worth of shovels.That was 5 years ago, and I'm over it now, after months of therapy. But the other day, my 10 year old asked me to buy him a game on steam.""Another call of battlefield piece of crap"", I muttered to myself.I saw shovel in the title and passed out.I woke up 3 days later, staring at the hospital ceiling. It was night, and I was alone. I didn't know who I was, or where I was. I looked over and saw a picture of a small child. I wondered why it was there for a while until I realized he was my son. As I started remembering everything and everyone, one thought became dominant in my mind: shovel knight.I jumped out of bed and started looking for a way out. I realized I was only a few stories up, so I made a rope out of the sheets and climbed out. I hitched a ride back to my house, not caring who was driving or what would happen, desperate to lay my hands on that shovel game once and for all. As soon as I got home I bought the game and began playing it, and I just want to thank the developers for this masterpiece. I can't express my gratitude to them. Sure, the gameplay is fun, the music is great, the characters and enemies interesting... but what sells the game is that iconic blue shovel. I can know slay dragons with a shovel. I can defeat evil bosses and conquer obstacles. I know live in a world that revolves around shovels. This game has empowered me as a demi shovel in a way that nothing ever has before.10/10			"

												I kept hearing about this game and seeing it mentioned everywhere so I thought it would give it a go. It turns out this is probably the best indie game, ever. Any fan of old school/retro gaming (fans of the NES era, especially) are highly, highly recommended to try this one out. Wbat it basically is, is if you smushed together Duck Tales, Megaman, Castlevania and Zelda 2, with a bunch of references to classic NES games. I'm not even kidding. It would take forever for me to list all the references I've picked up from playing through it and I'm not even done yet!This game is clearly a labor of love. It doesn't pretend to be a clone or to be an innovative thing but it certainly pulls off the intention of paying hommage to the classics very well, down to the difficulty. Don't think to get into this and breeze through; it will test your wits and platforming skills. This is one for the nostalgics and for those who weren't around back then but think they've got good platforming skills. As much as some indie games are disposable, we've seen some pretty amazing ones and Shovel Knight is definitely one of them. By far the best indie game of 2014.			"

The game is beautifully designed with that old school feeling..and hardcore challenges.I loved the whole game from start to finish, and cant wait for the next update which will add more characters to challenge against the game.The music is extraordinary, and again feels old school. Extreme amounts of thought process has gone into developing this game.A while back my son was watching me playing this, and after a short poriod of time was itching to play.. so I bought him a copy.. he also loves it... which then lead to him wanting to beat the game not long after me.. :DI do hope that they bring out a Sequel..I would 100% recommend this game to everyone you wont be disappointed...What a master piece!

												- Updated for the release of Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment An amazing game further enhanced by the expansions Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows and Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment (both are free updates for existing Shovel Knight owners and are now also part of the Treasure Trove package). Patience and persistence is the key if you want to complete the three included adventures. Every time you succeed, you will feel as if you have just achieved the impossible. It is this formula that will keep your eyes glued to the screen for hours on end. I would personally recommend that you play each adventure in a single sitting. Once you develop a rhythm, you will not want to put your controller down. Set an evening aside and get to it!5/5			"

												I'm not usually a fan of games that are difficult. I hate it when I die multiple times in a game, especially by the same enemy, and ESPECIALLY when it's in the same area each time that I just can't get past. I'm that wuss that plays games on easy because I don't want to get frustrated because a game is too difficult. Shovel Knight is surprisingly the exception. Shovel Knight is a tough game, I've died many times and very often during a level. Despite yelling profanities and getting more and more frustrated with each death, I've yet rage quit. Maybe it's because there's no saves within the level, so if you quit you have to start over, but there's something about it that makes me come back each time I die. I don't get just annoyed, I get determined and improve my technique. I last longer in each battle after I die, and there are areas of the level that despite being too difficult to surpass at one point, I've now figured out. It's really refreshing, and I wish other games were able to achieve this level of fun and frustrating. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by Shovel Knight. Really enthralling, old-school, and loads of fun.			"

												Not sure if I can say anything that hasn't been said before. This game is really fun, and reminds me of a mix-bag of old NES games that I loved as a kid. Most notably: Mega Man, Duck Tales, Mario, Castlevania, etc.Would definitely recommend.			"

												This game is almost like it came from that retro era of greatness. Seriously this game is AMAZING! The platforming, the story, the combat system. Everything is good! ( Almost ) Here is a list of pros and cons.PROS:The platforming and the controls are excellent.You can play as ""Plague Knight""Almost all the boss fights are good!Smooth animation.Spectre Knight is awesome.CONS:Polar Knight is kinda lame.The Final Boss is too easy.Plague Knight has some stupid ways to die.---------------------------------------------------------------FINAL THOUGHTS:They sould really just have you unlock each boss to play through the game as. Maybe not the final boss though.Overall rating. 8.7/10			"

												Side-scrolling 8 bit video games came back in the greates way by old fashioned representative kickstarter child Shovel Knight. Jumping (on the shovel) is fun like never before in any other game from that genre. Must have for all platform games fans and those who are searching for funny and enjoyable games that tests our dexterity and sense of humor. Dig in for secrets and lots of 8 bit but not flat fun!!!

												I don't often post reviews on Steam but Shovel Knight is blowing me away so much that I am making an exception. This game was billed as a throwback to the NES era and it definitely succeeds in giving you that nostalgic feeling but it also ends up being way better than all the games that inspired it.The graphics, levels and characters have so much charm and I was constantly surprised at how many memorable moments there are throughout the campaigns.There is a lot of replay value here since there are many ways to play in terms of how difficult you want the game to be. There is a new game+ of course but also other ways to adjust your experience by choosing to power up your health or use checkpoints in levels or skip those both completely. On top of that there are three additional campaigns after you finish the main Shovel Knight quest (two available now and one more to be released in the future).If you have even a passing interest in NES or SNES 2D sidescrollers, then I recommend this game without hesitation. I haven't played a game that I've personally enjoyed as much this since Super Mario Galaxy.Shovel Knight is now one of my top 10 favourite games of all time and I hope others can find the same joy that I have when I'm playing it.

												I'm gonna keep this short. I promise. I've only started playing this game game properly for around a week now, since the Game Grumps started playing the expansion. I have completed the Shovel Knight campaign and the Spetre Knight one, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best games I have ever played! The gameplay is difficult and can frustrate you at times, but you keep going as you can feel improvement, unlike some games I've played (Dark Souls) which make me feel like I'm not getting any better. The gameplay mixes the aesthetic of a retro game with the playabilty and user-friendly feel of a modern day platformer, which is a hard mix which I feel they have nailed!THE STORY, I didn't go into this game expecting much in the way of a storyline, but I was wrong! I will not spoil any of it. The story is rich and full, the writers behind this game are excellent at creating a well-rounded immersive storyline, which is told through the game perfectly. Furthermore, the Spectre Knight campaign adds an amazing level of depth to the story. IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FIRST CAMPAIGN, YOU NEED TO PLAY SPECTRE KNIGHT! It adds a level of knowledge of many characters that thickens the storyline and revealing more than before.All in all, I 100% reccomend this game to anyone. I owned it for around a year before I played it properly, so my advise would be to just DO IT!			"

												Some people would say this is a game in the mindset of the infamous and widely hated ""Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link"". And they would not be wrong. But ♥♥♥♥ that, nobody played this nowadays. So i might as well give you a whiff you can relate to, aye?This games is what happens when take a megaman game, take away the gun and replace it with a melee weapon. Add the pogostick jump from Duck Tales and the subweapons from castlevania and voilá, you have Shovel Knight.Theres been around a ♥♥♥♥load of ancient hipster retro games lately. Except this one here is gud. It has authentic 8 bit pixel art, smooth sountrack from the original sound composer of megaman I and II and a pleasantly scaled difficulty curve.Its not as hard as other games though, but i guess thats one of its strengh. Its as hard as you need it to as you need it to be. And this doesnt hold you back from wanting to play it again. And again.The feats add a nice taste at alternative playstyles, nothing short to say about the ramped up Newgame + Mode. And the developers made high promises of adding additional free content later.The one thing im missing out on thought is a scoreboard for clearing time and treasure, this needs to be added.Nice game overall. Worth your time and money. And its cheaper than some packs of beer. 15 Euros is an easy investment. So Wutsha waitin for, get shovelin' boyo. The dirt is strong within you.

												I'm not usually a fan of games that are difficult. I hate it when I die multiple times in a game, especially by the same enemy, and ESPECIALLY when it's in the same area each time that I just can't get past. I'm that wuss that plays games on easy because I don't want to get frustrated because a game is too difficult. Shovel Knight is surprisingly the exception. Shovel Knight is a tough game, I've died many times and very often during a level. Despite yelling profanities and getting more and more frustrated with each death, I've yet rage quit. Maybe it's because there's no saves within the level, so if you quit you have to start over, but there's something about it that makes me come back each time I die. I don't get just annoyed, I get determined and improve my technique. I last longer in each battle after I die, and there are areas of the level that despite being too difficult to surpass at one point, I've now figured out. It's really refreshing, and I wish other games were able to achieve this level of fun and frustrating. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by Shovel Knight. Really enthralling, old-school, and loads of fun.			"

												I played this game for numerous hours on a friends WiiU and was absolutely delighted when I realized it was available on PC.By far the best platformer I played, and I've played a bunch of them. It has that cozy 8-bit feel but also has things like awesome lighting effects (for a game with a 8-bit design, there is), a very neat difficulty curve (sometimes rather challengeing, but never smash-my-keyboard-to-death-hard, except in challenge mode, but that's like Dark Souls 8-bit edition. Don't go there.) the story is entertaining (not to mention the numerous puns....), and the experience in all is very well held toghether. Also. The soundtrack. This is a GREAT game soundtrack. I recommend everyone that ever enjoyed a platformer to at least give it a chance. You probably won't regret it! "

												This game is a perfect example of why I do not like the recent glut of procedurally-generated games.The level crafting is so tight, and each level is designed with care.  Real work and skill went into making this game, and it shows.  There is little that can compare to the rush the game gives me when I finally beat a level without dying, getting past  surprisingly intelligent enemies and deviously-placed traps and beating the boss.That doesn't even mention the tight controls, the fantastic chiptune music, the graphics that so effortlessly mimic classic NES games while using modern tricks and pallets.  This is just a fantastic game.			"

												All my life I've identified as a demi shovel.When I was a young lad all the other boys played with trucks or soldiers, but I just wanted to play with a shovel. Every year on my birthday and christmas I would ask for a shovel. It didn't even have to be that nice, a 99 cent plastic one would do, but no. My parents would not allow me to carry out my forbidden love. Later on as a teenager I made a deal with a friend. I went to his house and gave him all of my tooth fairy money in exchange for his shovel. In that moment... I was euphoric. No more longing. No more begging. I had everything I ever wanted right there in my hands. I felt an overwhelming series of emotions: pride, guilt, happiness, worry. I thought I could hide my precious.I tried everywhere: the yard, my closet, the neighbors yard, but my parents found it. They found it and they broke it and burned it in front of me. IN FRONT OF ME.Those were the bitterest tears I've ever wept.I was grounded for 3 months but I didn't care anymore. My spirit was broken. It was that night I realized I could go on no longer. I ran away, and started dancing for tips on street corners. Sleeping with thugs, jumping from town to town. It was a horrible life, but eventually I gained enough money to buy my own shovel, and I started my own hole digging service. I didn't care if I was dirt poor (no pun intended).... I was happy.Well the years flew by, and eventually I found a woman, started a family, and got a nice job. But there was a severe price to being a father. I just couldn't keep up my shovel obsession at that point. My wife threatened to kick me out of the house, because the kids were so so scared of my shovel collection and how much time I spent with it. They accused me of not even knowing their names.I sold them. 600 dollars worth of shovels.That was 5 years ago, and I'm over it now, after months of therapy. But the other day, my 10 year old asked me to buy him a game on steam.""Another call of battlefield piece of crap"", I muttered to myself.I saw shovel in the title and passed out.I woke up 3 days later, staring at the hospital ceiling. It was night, and I was alone. I didn't know who I was, or where I was. I looked over and saw a picture of a small child. I wondered why it was there for a while until I realized he was my son. As I started remembering everything and everyone, one thought became dominant in my mind: shovel knight.I jumped out of bed and started looking for a way out. I realized I was only a few stories up, so I made a rope out of the sheets and climbed out. I hitched a ride back to my house, not caring who was driving or what would happen, desperate to lay my hands on that shovel game once and for all. As soon as I got home I bought the game and began playing it, and I just want to thank the developers for this masterpiece. I can't express my gratitude to them. Sure, the gameplay is fun, the music is great, the characters and enemies interesting... but what sells the game is that iconic blue shovel. I can know slay dragons with a shovel. I can defeat evil bosses and conquer obstacles. I know live in a world that revolves around shovels. This game has empowered me as a demi shovel in a way that nothing ever has before.10/10			"

												Anyone who's grown up with a NES and/or played any of the Capcom/Konami/Nintendo (etc.. I won't go through a whole list) games at the height of their greatness should get this game. This game is worth it at full price and if the creators make another I'll be there to support it at release.Tight simple controls like you would have on the NES, fantastic music, fun levels with secrets, random humour...It plays something like a Megaman/Mario/Zelda2 -ish conglomerate.It's just the perfect homage to the classic greats, while still creating its own identity. The creators put a lot of love and detail into this one. I can't recommend it higher for a game of its genre.Rated 8/8 bits.**Goatician :)PLAGUE OF SHADHOWS UPDATE:If you thought Shovel Knight was hard before (I didn't -- full achievements), then Plague Knight's campaign will soon change that.Plague Knight controls a LOT more awkwardly, with less HP, more knockback (almost strictly worse), has somewhat awkward attack patterns, etc... Initially.It's one of those risk/reward things, since after I got the hang of him, I was able to pretty much fly around the map taking out enemies with precision. Mind you, this won't be easy at first, since the number of times I shot myself into spikes, or just missed/slightly overshot a platform, bumped into an enemy to my doom, pressed the wrong sequence of buttons to stop myself from falling were many. But the pay-off is very worth it -- for example, going back to fighting Spectre Knight (?.. the ghost one), he initially mopped the floor with me, but the second time around I was flying all around him, dodging his attacks/hitting him from safe angles..All plague-knight levels are tweaked, and some include secret passages for a slightly more difficult path for (a something). The bosses play identically, however, since your movement style and attack patterns are completely different this changes things up in a nice way. This should not come as a spoiler (you had to have predicted it) but when you fight shovel knight himself, it is just great to see how they gave his boss music the epic boss fight theme that matched the happy tune of the intro level/shovel knight theme.It is also interesting how they changed to world so you see it from the eyes of this villain (misunderstood?). The story is again mostly bare-bones just like how shovel knight tried to emulate the NES games of glory.New Challenge Maps: There are also some legitimately difficult challenge maps which are fun little side missions. I hope they eventually release the exclusives for PC.Overall, I hope there are more expansions (free or not), or sequels. Plague knight has been a great addition to the game (again, if you find it way too hard, stick with it, because once you figure him out it is a *lot* more fun).			"

												“Shovel Knight” is an old-school platformer that’s very heavily inspired by classic titles from the NES days. Taking bits and pieces from various classics including “Ducktales” of all things, it combines many older game design philosophies to deliver a truly retro experience. It was developed by Yacht Club Games after a highly successful kickstarter campaign which managed to raise over $300,000.In the past few years of gaming, there have been countless attempts to emulate the feel of older games — everything from NES-era graphics to limited soundtracks based on the hardware inside older machines. Unfortunately, many of the developers have failed at delivering a quality retro experience. Whether it’s due to dodgy controls, boring gameplay, or bad design in terms of how the game functions, many retro titles don’t succeed in bringing the experience across to the player.“Shovel Knight” is not one of these games. From the fantastic soundtrack to the solid and enjoyable gameplay, it actually nails the retro feel right on the head. Genuinely challenging level design and secrets abound make the game feel right at home on an older console. Not to mention, the game refuses to hold your hand throughout, so for anyone planning on picking up the game, we suggest picking up the mantra many players of the “Souls” series did: Get good or die trying.As for the actual gameplay, it borrows bits and pieces from various games. The shovel can be used as a standard sword, as well as to pogo-bounce off of enemies. This makes boss fights a very enjoyable and unique experience, as you can juggle between trying to pogo for lots of damage and avoid attacks when on the ground. In addition to the basic shovel, there’s also plenty of sub-weapons that use magic to activate. They can also have a wide variety of effects, such as being temporarily invincible, to throwing around fire, and even just straight up punching whatever unfortunate soul is nearby.The combat is tight, but the level design shines too. They’re dense with things to do and see, and of course there are lots of enemies to fight. Secrets abound in practically every level so players with a keen eye can find themselves rather rich early on. This adds to repeat playthroughs as learning where things are hidden can radically change the gameplay experience from one run to the next.Ultimately though, “Shovel Knight” is at its core a game of risk and reward. While it’s easy to get a hold of thousands in gold, it’s not as easy to keep it — every death drops three bags of gold based on how much is currently possessed. Similar to the “Souls” games, dying before recovering the bags of gold drops another set of bags and deletes the old one. Unfortunately there’s no way around it. Dying is much more painful than any life system could bring across in a game with save files, especially considering some of the items and upgrades require multiple thousands in gold.With great and responsive combat, combined with tight level design filled with reasons to explore, it’s hard to not see “Shovel Knight” as a proper classic title. The phenomenal soundtrack punctuates the exploration and the boss fights, and the tension of having to get money back without losing more of it from the ever-so-lovely bottomless pit deaths is closer to traditional gaming than most attempts. Fortunately, it’s not held back by its desire to be a classic title, and retains the quality to be expected from a modern 2D platformer release.4/5			"

												A throwback to 2D platformers from the 80s/early 90s. Shovel Knight is highly reminiscent to Megaman, but it's actually a bit more forgiving than some of the games found in that series. I'm not saying Shovel Knight is simple, there are difficult parts in certain levels, but everything is doable. Besides the typical gameplay from a 2D platformer, the game's music is awesome. It's actually one of the main reasons why this game is so beloved. The main campaign isn't too long, but it's also not too short. Though I enjoy the idea of free DLC, this game's DLC didn't really interest me. I played as Plague Knight for 30-40 minutes and he felt way too clunky compared to Shovel Knight. Maybe I'm just not used to it yet, but I have no interest in playing as Plague Knight. I don't speak for everyone, but based on what I experienced, the DLC is a pass when it comes to gameplay. Overall, I enjoyed the main game very much and I definitely recommend it.			"

												What can be said about Shovel Knight that hasn't already been said by countless fans and reviewers? Shovel Knight is a retro action-platformer with RPG elements and an excellent soundtrack - as well as a great sense of humor. The game features classic elements, borrowing from games like Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link. Mega Man, Super Mario Brothers, and Castlevania. The game is difficult. But in all the proper ways that make retro games good. Never did I feel the game was unfair or trying to hard to be difficult for the sake of being difficult. Where most ""Retro Style"" games these days aim for a ridiculous level of frustration and difficulty, Shovel Knight focuses on making a good, challenging, and entertaining game that's fun to play. Plenty of replay value thanks to achievements being present that actually have some challenge to them (Don't get hit for a whole level, don't die for the entire game. Beat the game without buying any special weapons or items...etc.) So there's many ways to play, as well as the ability to choose what direction you want to go in on the world map. (Bosses and levels come in sets but the order you take them in is entirely up to you.) The game is designed well and the visuals and sound are fantastic. I recommend turning up the excellent soundtrack and enjoying what is destined to be considered a modern classic. 10 out of 10. No regrets.			"

												Shovel knight is an amazing platform game, it has a little NES vibe with Link like fighting mechanics, a touch of Mario 3 in the map travel, and a hint of mega man ill let you figure out. The game is nostalgiarific and the music is both suiting for the game and great for old video game music lovers like myself :)			"

												Duck Tales meets Megaman meets Castlevania with a Mario 3 overworld. What isn't to love?I mean honestly, if the above doesn't sound good to you, then this game probably isn't for you.For those a bit more on the fence, I suppose I'll elaborate a bit:In Shovel Knight, you play the titular knight in a battle against the Order of No Quarter. To do so, you travel to various stages and, in classic Megaman style, travel right while fighting enemies, platforming, and finding secrets. Throughout the level, you gather up Gems and Coins either outright, via slain enemies, or via secrets and chests, in order to gain Gold, which you can spend at the Village on various Health and Armor upgrades or items.Your shovel is your main weapon, with the ability to outright smack your enemies or pogo on them ala Duck Tales, and similarly can be used against blocks of various types of dirt and/or rock to traverse the screens. Items work similarly to Castlevania, with a limited resource that drains every time you use it (in Shovel Knight, it's pots, as opposed to Castlevania's hearts), though in Shovel Knight you gain the item permanently and can swap between them at your leisure. Even within the first 3 main stages, the selection of items you get is large enough to accomodate a variety of playstyles and strategies.The bosses and stages themselves are very remniscient of Megaman, with each stage having a particular theme carried out that matches the Boss. The Bosses themselves have a nice variety of attacks and pattern that, although at first are hard, can be read and manipulated, just like Megaman. Enemy types vary from neat and strange, like the helicopter-rat thing, to fairly standard fare, like the 2spooky skeleton. The music is always wonderfully fitting, and creating a sense of mood and enhancing all of the stages without being distracting.Movement feels good. Controls are responsive. Hitboxes don't feel wonky. In essence, this game is great.If you agreed with the first sentence, you probably already have the game.If you hate retro and/or have terrible taste, you probably weren't gonna get this game anyway.If you're interested, but worried $15 is a little steep, let me assure you that based off of the 3 main stages I've played so far and the size of the overworld map, that you are in for a decent amount of gameplay. Moreso if you want to replay anything, which you most likely will. It's absolutely worth it.Get digging.			"

												Out of all the retro style games to come out over the last several years, Shovel Knight is perhaps the best one to emerge on the scene. The first successful game backed by Kickstarter and developed by Yacht Club Games, Shovel Knight is an instant classic that will only become greater as time goes on. One of the best things about Shovel Knight is despite being an ode to a long gone era of gaming it still easily manages to establish its own identity. There’s a good few retro style games that fail to do this and often suffer for it.The gameplay is simply top notch. The controls are simplistic and the input response is absolutely great as well. Furthermore, since the additional campaign of Plague of Shadows has been released while two more campaigns are on the way and in development as of writing this updated review the playable characters all play differently compared to each other. This is a good thing so you’re not just getting a reskinned playable character who behaves exactly the same. While I can’t say much for the upcoming campaigns due to lack of information, Plague of Shadows stands out noticeably in comparison to the regular story mode where you go through the game as Shovel Knight.The music is fantastic, hands down and no argument to be made. Jake Kaufman is a fantastic composer, but he wasn’t alone on the soundtrack. Manami Matsumae, a Japanese video gamer composer who started off at Capcom before becoming a freelance composer later on. She contributes several tracks to the whole score while Kaufman delivers the majority of the score. Each stage and each boss is given an incredibly fitting and catchy theme to them. Furthermore, Plague of Shadows was given a small score of its own for its own specific events and fights.For those seeking some challenge to their games then don’t be dissuaded by Shovel Knight, the game has something for everyone. For the main game itself, you can challenge yourself to see how fast you can go through it, see how you can handle completing the game without acquiring or using the relics, and doing both at the same time. There also exists a password system in the form of the name entering for each file where some names will change how the game functions, one code in particular making Shovel Knight twice his size. It’s something like that that showed the developers really thought of everything.In conclusion, you’re going to get an absolutely great game for a minimal cost. What also helps is that as mentioned before, Yacht Club Games are working on more free content for the game so you’ll be getting more for nothing as time goes on. Do not pass up on this game, it’s a missed golden opportunity that everyone should experience.			"

												Shovel Knight is a 2d platformer that pays homage to and uses gameplay elements from classic NES games such as: Castlevania, Super Mario Bros. 3, Duck Tales and Mega Man series. Shovel Knight's partner, Shield Knight, disappears in the cursed tower and he goes on a journey to return to the tower to find her. Meanwhile the Evil Enchantress sends out her evil band of knights, The Order of No Quarter, to terrorize the land.I love this game. From the classic 8-bit graphics to the 8-bit music, it reminds me of the NES games I played when I was a youngin'. It takes some of the best elements from those games I mentioned above and brilliantly makes them its own thing. Shovel knight can pogo bounce on enemies with his shovel and smack them with it too. Later on there are armor and shovel powerups you can purchase but they're not necessary to complete the game. Along the way you can also find relics hidden in each stage that will help you considerably but remember to have enough magic points to use them. Health and magic upgrades can be purchased in town as well as relics you've missed as long as you completed the relic's corresponding stage. There's a warmup stage right in the beginning so you can get comfortable with how everything works before you set out to beat the Order of No Quarter. And you'll need all the practice you can get because the later stages can be quite difficult. Easy to pickup, hard to master, this is a great game if you have a nostalgic itch that needs scratching. Hell even if you don't have any nostalgia for the style, it's still a solid game. The developer, Yacht Club Games, still has plans to add more playable characters in the future but at the time of this review we have Shovel Knight and then Plague Knight to play as once you beat the game. I highly recommend this game. A must buy if you're a fan of classic NES platformer games or just platformers in general.			"

												What can be said about Shovel Knight that hasn't already been said by countless fans and reviewers? Shovel Knight is a retro action-platformer with RPG elements and an excellent soundtrack - as well as a great sense of humor. The game features classic elements, borrowing from games like Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link. Mega Man, Super Mario Brothers, and Castlevania. The game is difficult. But in all the proper ways that make retro games good. Never did I feel the game was unfair or trying to hard to be difficult for the sake of being difficult. Where most ""Retro Style"" games these days aim for a ridiculous level of frustration and difficulty, Shovel Knight focuses on making a good, challenging, and entertaining game that's fun to play. Plenty of replay value thanks to achievements being present that actually have some challenge to them (Don't get hit for a whole level, don't die for the entire game. Beat the game without buying any special weapons or items...etc.) So there's many ways to play, as well as the ability to choose what direction you want to go in on the world map. (Bosses and levels come in sets but the order you take them in is entirely up to you.) The game is designed well and the visuals and sound are fantastic. I recommend turning up the excellent soundtrack and enjoying what is destined to be considered a modern classic. 10 out of 10. No regrets.			"

												For Shovelry! I am completely impressed and blown away not (only) by the meticulously crafted NES era graphics given an ever-so-slight modern day facelift AND a brilliant original soundtrack by legendary Megaman, and soon Mighty No.9, composer Manami Matsumae but by the amazing programming in this game.Enemies know the moves you want to do, bosses are intuitive and challenging, and many mechanics are in themselves homage to familiar programming found in classic NES titles. But don't be fooled, Shovel Knight is a trove of originality.This game is completely worth every cent of the so so SO low price of $15. Go buy the boxed version and support this team because they have worked so incredibly hard to bring you this already classic title.			"

												THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A 8-BIT PLATFORMER OF AWSOMENESS!!This game combines elements from other games from NES such as Zelda 2 adventure of link for the levels and bosses.The map screen is from Super mario bros 3. The characters are very likable with their personalites. There are mutiltple different types of amour you can get each with their advantages and disadvantages, also their are Shovel upgrades that give you new moves.The music is 8-bit and stylish bringing in a very enjoyable soundtrack.Shovel Knight is a breath of fresh air to the gaming world because you know FPS games are everywhere now.One word of Advice watch out for King Knight's Confetti it Kills 9/10			"

												Shovel Knight is an amazing game. Reminiscent of old NES/SNES games, it keeps the retro feel while still keeping to standards of some modern day games. When it comes to the actual meat of the game, I can't really say much negative about it: The gameplay is smooth and quite responsive, the story is beautiful and still simple to keep grasp of, and the visuals are top-notch for a game emulating older-style graphics. A negative that I can admit, however, is that it feels extremely short. In just a few hours, you can crank through all of the bosses and the side content of the main story and it leaves you wanting a little more. However, with the most recent update to it, it now has an added campaign where you play as one of the bosses through his own story, as well as adding a challenge mode for players feeling cocky or wanting a good test of their skill.All in all, even with the game feeling a fair bit short, Shovel Knight is a great game and is definitely worth the money for it. More updates are planned for it, including more of the side campaigns and other possible goodies, so pick it up!For Shovelry!			"

												Shovel Knight is one of the best games I've ever played. It's on my top 5 favorite games of all time. The platforming is smooth and the graphics feel great. It's what other inde games should strive to be. The Shovel Knight campagin is great. The first level teaches you everything you'd probablly need to know without any tutorial. The levels fit the style of the game very well and the bosses are nice and simple but still give you enough of a challenge.The Plague Knight campagin is a great addon. The addon is free and it's mechanics are completly different but still extremely engaging. The boss battles are a new challenge even though they do about the same thing as they would in the Shovel Knight campagin. This is a very well designed game and I can't wait for the Specter Knight and King Knight campagins.Specter Knight's campagin was amazing. The new wall jump and dash slash mechanics took some getting used to but they really fit well. The boss battles have some new things so you may have to approach them differently than Shovel and Plague Knight. The story also expanded quite a bit. This campagin is a prequel to shovel knight and more lore is told. It was a very nice campaign and I can't wait to see what they'll do for King Knight.			"

												Double, trouble, soil and shovel,True knights wield not rake nor scuffle!    ....(a scuffle is a kind of hoe ;))Short Version:  AMAZING!Verbose Version:Shovel Knight is, hands-down, the most amazing new platformer game I've played in years.  Try it - I'm absolutely certain you'll feel the same!  If you're like me and grew up in the NES era, then your entire 3+ decade experience with video games is informed by those early titles.  Personally, I love the new and the old, playing the latest AAA productions in one moment, and retro system classics the next.  If you can identify with that, then you simply must put aside your Steam gaming backlog for a moment, and give yourself an evening to play Shovel Knight.  It has been awhile since a new title has compelled me to play straight through from beginning to end, but I was instantly gripped and can't wait to play *again* in NG+.Shovel Knight is clearly made by a team who knows this genre inside and out, and have produced a masterpiece that combines a unique cast of characters/abilities/equipment, perfect responsive controls (d-pad FTW, and if you play on a TV, best to mitigate any input lag!), beautiful visuals, top-notch music, superb writing, retro references galore, and every other possible indication that the creation of this title was a labour of love.  Honestly - I can't fault anything about it.  Shovel Knight is completely endearing to me, and my heart-felt congratulations go out to the team at Yacht Club Games - anybody who was a part of creating this has true reason to feel proud.  I will be watching this studio closely in the future.If you were ever a fan of any of the Mega Man, Castlevania, Super Mario Brothers, Ninja Gaiden, Contra, or Duck Tales games, then Shovel Knight is for you.  Or if you missed that generation and haven't caught up through virtual console, but enjoyed Dark Souls or any of the new Rayman games, again, it's a must play.			"

												Let's talk about Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight is a nostalgia game. Shovel Knight is a NOSTALGIA game. They make a few things not very obvious at first and force you to fumble through the game to learn them. Breaking checkpoints for money is one. Being able to change the relic button to something actually useful is another.  The music, while catchy, gets very annoying after a while as well. It has a very short loop life and makes me long for something with more meat. MegaMan 2, Mario, Ducktales, they were all able to do better things with the music.  It also expects you to know Mario standards of being able to jump over the wall of the world, but it only lets you do this when it wants you to do this. So thinking this was a regular thing, I attempted to jump over the wall of the world and died because I didn't realize the developers didn't want me to be able to do that trick there when it worked elsewhere.  Getting away from those complaints, Shovel Knight is a fairly simple game with a platforming appeal that is tough, but forgiving, and in general, a fun game. The mechanics are fairly simple, there's a fun bit of exploration involved, trying to figure out every nook and cranny you need to break.7/10			"

												Truly a trip through time. Shovel Knight captures the very heart of what we know and love of the 8 bit era. Nearly everything in this game was designed to replicate 8 bit perfectly. Too bad the story is actually good and not full of Engrish and typos or else it would have that 8 bit feel there too. The bosses and gameplay are just magnificent. Each stage and boss requires a different strategy and they all have their own little quirks that make them unique.If you want to relive your youth of 8 bit, then I'd highly suggest picking up this game. Even if you never played games like this before, I'd still recommend it. The game is put together really well and it is certainly worth its weight in gold			"

												Shovel Knight is an instant classic, earning a place in my heart right next to Mario, Zelda, Sonic, whatever!  Gorgeous 8-bit inspired graphics, awesome chiptune music, super tight controls, fantastic level design, cool subweapons and more!  Easy enough to draw in new players but challenging enough for pros (especially if you want to go for some of the feats like BEATING THE WHOLE GAME WITHOUT DYING ONCE!)I can't praise this game enough and hope this marks the first entry in a long line of Shovel Knight awesome-ness.  With new DLC content like three playable bosses, battle mode, genderswap mode, and more coming before the end of the year, this game is easily worth $15.  It may only take you several hours to beat, but you'll keep coming back to it again and again!Dig status: Dug			"

For Shovelry!+ Fun Gameplay+ Replayability (NG+, 3 playable characters, Speedrunning Community)+ Bits of Comedy+ Awesome Soundtrack+ Active Developers +/- Initially, Shovel Knight is a pretty short game. Add the updates/expansions into the mix, & this isn't that big of an issue.- Price Increase (From $15 to $25) - Somewhat justifiable considering the updates (Plague of Shadows/Specter of Torment), but I digress.Full Review HERE:

												A friend suggested I gave this a try. After giving it a playthrough I must say: Shovel Knight is a really great game.The gameplay, art, characters, soundtrack, pacing... everything is superb and spot on. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Sure some moments (the latter levels in particular) had quite a lot more challenge to them, but it's certainly far from impossible. In my opinion those were the moments this game really shined, they were just on that sweet spot that keep you coming back persistently to try and get through to finish the level, and I loved it. Overcoming that steady stream of small taunts was extremely satisfying in the end. All of this on top of 8-bit graphics and 8-bit music, neither letting down for the smallest moment throughout the game. Bravo!Definitely recommending this one.			"

												The best NES game never made. Extremely tight controls. Game plays like a cross between Mega Man/Ducktales/Darkwing Duck with a SMB3/Kirby-esque overworld map, and towns reminiscent of Faxanadu (first and foremost) and to a lesser extent Castlevania 2, Zelda 2, etc.The game does pay a lot of attention to modern conventions though as well. It is somewhat easier, vastly less frustrating, and much longer than your typical old-school NES games. Saving is done after each level. Each level has 5 or so checkpoints. When you die, you don't lose set lives, but gold, which you can get back.One of my favorite games of 2014, by a wide margin. If you played NES games or just like 2d platformers or retro-games an absolute must-buy. This game is amazing.			"

												The platforming is solid and the combat goes from just ""okay"" to ""feels great"" through quality upgrades across the game. (I recommend getting the double jump slash shovel upgrade first when you gain access to it.) That and an assortment of other upgrades really give you good reason to keep investing into your character.The levels are well done with ample secrets throughout and only a small handful of spots that were lacking in the design department. You can tell the inconsistencies when looking at deaths per level as they spike across the levels instead of increasing steadily or remaining similar throughout (depending on what their intent for difficulty was).The art is an homage to classic NES design with a nice palette and excellent animations for almost all characters in the game. The music is spot on and gets you into the feel of the game, though nothing stuck out to me as being ""zomg amazeballs""; that is, I don't find myself humming any of the songs, but that doesn't mean they're not good.Definitely check it out, there's a lot to discover and the game has some quality platforming that harkens back to yesteryear.

												Shovel Knight gets a lot of praise, which is not for no reason. Many would call it 'nostalgic', but I personally think it's great in it's own way; aside from the classic graphics and recognisable soundtracks many will recognise from the bit-era.In short:GOOD+ Nice ol' iconic platforming, defeating your enemies, aquiring ways to defeat said enemies... a great formula done almost perfectly and with a bunch of new engaging ideas!+ Level design and atmosphere. It's a small game, but filled to the brim with personality. You'll see a lot of old themes like the 'halloween/undead' stage and the always hated ice-stage, but also a lot of fresh mechanics and themes for such a simple platformer.+ Bosses deserve their own mention. I always love games with good bosses. I know many feel the same, so here ya go. Definite plus.+ Though simple, the story is actually pretty intruiging. You might see all the twists coming, but they still do their own original thing with it. Which is why I like the Shovel Knight and Shield Knight characters quite a lot. It's extremely solid, and open for many new stories to build onto it. + Soundtrack also deserves it's own mention. Though all the iconic sound effects are the way we know them, the music really is the gigantic lovely cherry on top. + There are multiple ways to play the game to give yourself more challenge, and the game also comes with a few achievements to hint at some of these other plastyles!NOT SO GOOD- I played it on a keyboard but I admit it would probably be FAR nicer with a controller. So if you don't have one the controls might be a bit annoying.- Relatively short. It has pretty good replayability, but somehow you still feel like they could've done so much more. Especially when you look at the Mario3-esque overworld map going on.- Instant-death spikes? Yes. But it's about the worst kind; the sideways ones. Slip one pixel to much to the left at a snail pace? Dead. It's reaaally something platformers should abolish for some more creative ideas. Dying to a boss at a difficult fight is challenging and fun. Doing an entire section of platforming without a scratch and dying right before a checkpoint? Frustrating.- Though I earlier praised the music. It tends to change to another version EVERYtime you enter another section of a town or something. Normally, this is great, gives every section it's own feel. But here it's actually taking away the atmosphere it's supposed to give because it keeps switching every 4 seconds when you're running through the towns. And that's basically it aside from some personal thoughts. I could be getting a little bit ahead of myself by saying Shovel Knight, the character, would be perfect lined up to the likes of Mario and Sonic. If only in extremely iconic design and the world his character lives in. Extremely simple, but very recognisable and engaging.  For example, I wouldn't be surprised to see him or Shield Knight in Smash Bros, things like that. I'd personally love to see far more of this, so I hope the team is planning on expanding this fun world of knighthood and I recommend this to any one who's up for a good old school challenge!			"

												This game was my favorite out of 2014. I did miss a lot of games in 2014 but that still can't deny how great this is. I am a huge NES classic fan especially Mega Man and this game is a must for any fan of the NES classics. It is an amazing throwback with great visuals and an AMAZING soundtrack. Think Castlevania meets Ducktales meets Mega Man.  It has a world map straight out of Mario 3 and 8 bosses with an intro stage along with a village where you can buy and sell things, and an airship with armor and shovel upgrades. The bosses are creative, colorful in personality, and fun to fight. All the boss patterns are fun and interesting and with no order of each move it can be challenging. There are many secret areas in where you can get more loot, relics, or music sheets to certain songs that you can sell and then play in the village. The gameplay and design are fairly thought out. You stop in your place to slash with your shovel. You can use your shovel to use a pogostick-like attack. Later in the game you can get a charge slash that makes the movement really awkward when you charge it. The movement feels a little too slow in my opinion and the jumps feel too high in comparison. I rarely felt like I was cheated out of a life but it did happen and I can't excuse that. The challenge is lacking for the style of game. You are never faced with too much at one time with no chance to get the pattern. It always feels a bit too safe. I never died to losing all my life or to a boss. I only died to bottomless pits and spikes that sometimes felt cheap. This game is built around a speedrun and to get full completion you will need to master that speedrun and that is only a sign of good design. I could go on and on about everything this game has to offer but i'd rather have anyone reading this be playing this great platformer. So what are you doing still reading this?! Go play Shovel Knight! You won't regret it. 9/10 Would shovel again			"

												Hey, remember the 80's? I sure do. Games were awesome then.Oh... right. -ahem-This game is basically a lovechild of Ducktales, LOZ2, SM2 and yes even Megaman. God knows how they pulled that last one off, but they did. Forget the fact that he's using a shovel and that his attacks look like he shovels them, because this game makes you think ""♥♥♥♥, i should go get a shovel to defend myself with.""Seriously, think about it. People are using swords and guns and you go off and weild a damn shovel like a boss.Sounds good now, doesn't it?			"

												This game is super fun! I hope this franchise continues. My only gripe is that it also follows a very irritating achievement that too many steam games have, which is beat the game without dying. I find that to be stressful and next to impossible, which makes achievement completion impossible. Enjoy the game for what it is though!			"

												Do you like to play games released in 1983 - 1991? Are you a sucker for anything 8-bit? Do you lust for the NES and its many timeless classics? Do you like platformers that are challenging but not too challenging that you'll end up throwing your controller across the room? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then I recommend this game to you!A great, charming, challenging platformer that throws you back to the days of the NES with music and levels inspired by the likes of games including, but not limited to Mega Man, Zelda 2, Castlevania, Super Mario Bros. 3, Ducktales and more. Plus, it's getting free updates, such as campaigns where you can play as some of the bosses with their own unique abilities, and a gender swap mode.While other indie games have tried their hand at making a retro looking and feeling game, most of the time, they fell flat and the retro aesthetics felt shoehorned/forced in. This isn't the case at all in Shovel Knight, it looks, feels, sounds and plays exactly like a game released for the NES would (although the devs did have to push beyond a few of the NES's limits in some cases.) Only real complaint is no exclusive content for the PC version (PS3/4/Vita get the Kratos boss fight, Xbox One gets the BattleToads level, 3DS gets the StreetPass arena + Shovel Knight amiibo functionality, and the Wii U will be getting co-op and other functionality linked to the Shovel Knight amiibo.) That may change in the future, and if it does, I will update this review to reflect that.All in all, this review does not do the game justice. It's one of the best platformers I've played in years. No, scratch that, it's one of the best platformers I've ever played! Buy it now. NOW!			"

												Shovel Knight is freakin' amazing. If you grew up on NES Megaman, Castlevania, and crap like that, this is a must buy.It's extremely well made, has great music, and the characters are unique. They've even added a free add-on campaign that lets you play as a different knight. His play style is completely different from Shovel Knight, and he has his own story, so it's not just a copy/paste of the original campaign.			"

												Shovel Knight merecia uma nota muito alta pelo conteúdo original. A promessa de DLCs dos 3 boss parecia interessante, mas não acho que alguém pensava que o Plague of Shadows acrescentaria tanto ao jogo, mudando totalmente a jogabilidade, história e design. Vendo o trailer do Specter of Torment e o quanto estão caprichando além do que já capricharam no Plague, esse é um dos jogos que serve de exemplo pra todas softhouses nessa época nebulosa de DLCs ruins e caros, microtransações e falsas promessas.

												Shovel Knight is a very well made platformer game made in the spirit of NES.  I was able to complete this game in a few hours over roughly 3 days time.  I usually only write reviews if a game is either very exceptional, or very terrible.  Fortunately, this game is very exceptional.  Just to briefly summarize, the game is about Shovel Knight, a hero who is trying to rescue his best friend, Shield Knight from an evil sorceress.  The game has a ton of 2d platforming action, and some of the best game control mechanics I've played since Super Mario Bros 3.  You go from area to area, defeating all of these other knights, each one specializing in a particular area.  While all that is going on, you visit a small town in between quests, so you can drop off ""shanties"" for the local musician to archive for you.  Speaking of music, this game features some of the best chip music in ages, and there is a lot to hear.  So as you are getting through all of the quests, you are also upgrading your armor, your shovel, and gathering new magic spells to use to get you through the areas.  They designed the levels where you have to use certain powers to proceed, introducing new challenges as the game progresses.  I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who loved the NES/SNES, and enjoys a good challenging classic style 2D platformer game.  I can see myself playing this game for years to come!  Nice work, Yacht Club Games!			"

												So, it's been a while since my last review. I've been busy. And when I got time I just didn't feel like it. But now I have (finally) finished Shovel Knight and said to myself: ""Hey, why not?""Shovel Knight. A game that came at least a year or two ago and I have just managed to finish. In 14 hours. Don't get fooled, though, those are 14 hours through out nearly a year, for reasons I'll go over later on.This is a game that aims to bring out nostalgia from the old great times of NESS games (I actually wasn't around by then, but, hey, it works too). You play as Shovel Knight, a knight... with a spade instead of a sword. You are on a quest to find the Evil Enchantress and rescue your old friend Shield Knight from her and her Order of No Quarter, a selection of the most bombastic knights I've seen in a videogame. The game will keep throwing in new mechanics, enemies and challanges until the very end of the game, so you don't get bored; and without the hardware limitations of the NESS era, the guys over at the Yatch development studio have managed to create a game with enough content to be considered a game worthy of today's standards without dropping the old times feeling.Which gets me to... Shovel Knight tries to mimic a lot of things that games before the second millenia had, and the difficulty is something that is replicated masterfully. And I almost wish they hadn't. Oh dear god, at the end of my fourteen-hour-long run I had a death count of 168. That's more than 10 deaths per hour, at about an average of a shameful fall into a bottomless pit or getting my skull obliterated by a boss every six minutes. I remember that, sometimes, I said to myself ""I still have an hour or so of free time and I'm bored. Let's see what I can play..."" while I scrolled through my Steam Library, only to find Shovel Knight, and thinking ""Yeah... maybe another day. I don't feel like flinging my laptop across the room right now"". This game takes guts to play. And it turns out that what I finished was just the base game, and that I still have New Game Plus and the Plague Knight free expansion left. Oh, boy...What can I say? This is a game that is going head first into my ""games that I love and hate"" list.+ Entertaining gameplay with very simple mechanics.+ Very easy to learn. Almost impossible to master.+ Has the right length for a game like this. And, quite honestly, I don't know if I would have been able to stand much more of it.+ An absolute ton of secrets, side quests and achievements. Completionists better know what are they getting into...- This is no walk in the park whatsoever. The game WILL frustrate you, and the risk-vs-reward sistem is totally stacked against you. Just so you know.- Some parts are just downright ridiculous. Either perform a pixel-perfect sequence of jumps and mid-air item usages or fall to your death and lose a quarter of your current money and about a sixth of your leftover sanity. You missed the plataform and killed yourself before you could get to the point you died so you could recover your loot? Welp, sucks to be you: there goes another quarter of your earnings and the other one is lost forever! Christ, I think I rage quited about three times in my first playthrough.This game gets a 7.5 out of 10. Definetely deserves to be called a ""classic"".			"

												This game is a retro revival done right. It perfectly emulates what a classic game should feel like updated for modern standards. It's been attempted many, many times, rarely done correctly. The game can get a bit difficult sometimes, so only play if you have enough patience for it. If you're able to beat some of the old Mega Man games, and enjoyed them, then this game should be right up your alley.			"

												I'm sure you already know if this is your kind of game or not, as an NES MegaMan clone. Stages are varied enough to be fun with interesting patterned boss fights at the end of each stage.However, this is one of those games that wants you to ""pick your own"" difficulty level, because there is no traditional difficulty selection. The mid-stage checkpoints are all optional, and most of the health/mp upgrades as well. Personally, playing through it with using all of those, the game was far too easy, tallying up the deaths at the end most were from one specific boss fight and the bonus areas. If you get all the health upgrades as they become available, it becomes extremely hard to die due to running out of HP, most of my deaths came from bottomless pits. On top of that, some of the sub-weapons seem to give you invincibility when you use them, making them go-to weapons for every single boss fight afterward, but thats also part of your own difficulty level if you want to use it.Having said that, the game feels great to play, the art is true to its NES style in pallet and always maintaining a 1:1 pixel ratio, with good slightly-better-than-NES music as well. I'd recommend to anyone that enjoys either MegaMan or platformers in general.			"

												If you are looking for an NES classic but you have already played all the greats in the NES library, this is the game for you.  The soundtrack sounds inspired by Capcom, and the gameplay is a little like Duck Tales splashed with Shatterhand and Zelda 2.  The upgrades you can purchase are fantastic and make you feel like you are progressing and growing in power.  The only bad side I would say is that it feels a little short, but that's not a real issue when what's here is so well done.			"

												Shovel Knight is the first game developed by Yacht Club Games. Initially getting kicked off as a Kickstarter campaign, the game rapidly gained followers and backing, eventually getting released on Windows, 3DS, and Wii U, with ports to other consoles and operating systems appearing later. The game achieved much success, but is it well-deserved? Let's find out.Story:In a land where heroic knights roamed, there were two heroes whose names were known throughout the land: Shovel Knight, and Shield Knight. With their signature shovel and red shield in hand, the two were inseparable, until one quest led them to the ominous Tower of Fate. What they found there, would change their destines forever...Without mentioning spoilers, the plot of Shovel Knight maintains a persistent charm to it.  The characters, while not completely fleshed out, are (mostly) still interesting enough to carry it. The people are likable, the presentation is good, and the quest is good enough to make you want to see how it ends. That being said, Shovel Knight's story is not ground-breaking in any way: it is cliche'd but endearing, and integrates itself well with its gameplay.Gameplay:Shovel Knight shares its gameplay characteristics with many 2D side-scrolling platform games in the industry, but what sets it apart is how it is presented. The controls aren't handed to you on a silver platter:  instead, the stage design is worked around introducing you to them intuitively, as needed, without feeling forced. This is absolutely essential to maintaining a balance between challenging gameplay and enjoyment, and Shovel Knight does this almost flawlessly. The main goal of each stage is to get to the end of it, defeating enemies, collecting treasures, and fighting bosses. The stage designs and enemies remain unique throughout the game, with many hidden secrets in each stage, reminiscent of Megaman stages. Rather than a set number of lives, dying forces you to drop some money bags where you died and pushes you back to the last activated check point, giving you a chance to regain that money later, similar to souls in the Dark Souls series. Outside stages, there are towns where you can upgrade your health and magic, or buy relics, shovel abilities, and armor to help you fight.Unfortunately, the game is quite short, easily clearable under 10 hours. In addition, there is not much incentive to replay it on New Game+, except to get the 100% on a higher difficulty. Visuals:The graphics pay homage to old 8-bit graphics games of yore, and what a lovely homage it is. Shovel Knight's pixelated art is, simply put, dazzling. The animation is fantastic, the stages and enemies look great, and the attention to detail in the background is amazing. Even if you're not usually a fan of that peculiar style, it is easy to appreciate it, and is one of the game's strongest aspects.Sound:And here comes the other strong aspect of the game. There is no other way to say this: Shovel Knight's OST is brilliantly well done. Jake Kaufman (Contra 4, Red Faction: Guerrilla, DuckTales: Remastered, Shantae) worked together with ex-Capcom composer Manami Matsumae (Mega Man, Mega Man 10, and others) to create some sweet, sweet music. Catchy beats blend together to give each location a unique experience and truly bring the game to life. I highly recommend getting the OST if you can, as it is well worth it.Conclusion:With fun, challenging gameplay, dazzling art, and great music, Shovel Knight offers a short, yet  great experience. It is a must-have for any fans of the genre. If you see it on sale, immediately get it.			"

												Shovel Knight is one of the best games I've ever played. It's on my top 5 favorite games of all time. The platforming is smooth and the graphics feel great. It's what other inde games should strive to be. The Shovel Knight campagin is great. The first level teaches you everything you'd probablly need to know without any tutorial. The levels fit the style of the game very well and the bosses are nice and simple but still give you enough of a challenge.The Plague Knight campagin is a great addon. The addon is free and it's mechanics are completly different but still extremely engaging. The boss battles are a new challenge even though they do about the same thing as they would in the Shovel Knight campagin. This is a very well designed game and I can't wait for the Specter Knight and King Knight campagins.Specter Knight's campagin was amazing. The new wall jump and dash slash mechanics took some getting used to but they really fit well. The boss battles have some new things so you may have to approach them differently than Shovel and Plague Knight. The story also expanded quite a bit. This campagin is a prequel to shovel knight and more lore is told. It was a very nice campaign and I can't wait to see what they'll do for King Knight.			"

For Shovelry!+ Fun Gameplay+ Replayability (NG+, 3 playable characters, Speedrunning Community)+ Bits of Comedy+ Awesome Soundtrack+ Active Developers +/- Initially, Shovel Knight is a pretty short game. Add the updates/expansions into the mix, & this isn't that big of an issue.- Price Increase (From $15 to $25) - Somewhat justifiable considering the updates (Plague of Shadows/Specter of Torment), but I digress.Full Review HERE:

												A great tribute to retro gaming. Includes dozens of cheat codes that aren't behind a paywall and a free big dlc just arrived this month. The devs certainly bring what they promised. Music is very, very memorable and I personally love it. Go check out ""Strike the Earth"". I can't say much more. It's a game with very good mechanics and a fun scheme. If you have the slightest interest in retro style games, the game is worth its full price easily.			"

												If Volgar the Viking was a throwback to SNES, with all the right things kept, Shovel Knight is a throwback to late-era NES. The game feels good to play, levels are smartly designed with lots of secrets, combat is fluid, and the overworld is very very nostalgic. The game is a bit easier than other platformers (or was for me) but is still completely worth the purchase.			"

												This game falls in the extremely rare category of one I did not enjoy but would still definitely recommend, presuming you're someone that enjoys precision platforming.  Despite this, I still finished the game, and went back for a few achievements in New Game Plus.  Shovel Knight is extremely well made, and lovingly crafted -- that much is clear.  In fact, I'd argue it's almost too well made -- it's like when a record label sets out to manufacture a song that uses the absolute most pleasing melody, with the perfect rhythm that only years of cold market research and focus testing could produce -- as opposed to some pure, deep, soulful and meaningful expression of life experience by some aspiring and talented singer-songwriter (e.g. Spice Girls vs. Johnny Cash).  That's not to say either method is ""wrong""; they're just different.  This game is suspiciously good.The aesthetic... --I mean, if the modernizing features alone weren't a dead giveaway (e.g. widescreen resolution, extended color range, high quality audio), one might mistake it for an old NES game from the '80s; an absolutely masterful presentation in the retro style from the 8-bit Nintendo era.  I've heard some say that the game would've been right at home on the NES.  Of course, ignoring all of the technical impossibilities of such an assertion, some form of it could've.  However, the way I see it, it both absolutely could not, but already kinda did...You see, Shovel Knight is a great game in its own right; aside from the fan service and nostalgia for an era of gaming long past, it stands up.  A person of any age, regardless of gaming background, could find a lot to like in it, but it especially caters to those of us that grew up playing games of this style, and boy does it hit all the right notes -- like I said, a bit too well.  ...and for me, this is the part where the argument that Shovel Knight stands on its own breaks down, because the only originality I see in it is the token shovel-wielding player character.  Sure, it crafts a personality for itself with its whimsical aesthetic and interesting bosses, but it feels like it all came together as a product of imitation.Some of the best systems and mechanics from some of the best, most iconic games of the NES era were carefully selected and combined into Shovel Knight.  The overworld map system from Super Mario Bros. 3, the boss and item progression from Mega Man, and heavy elements of Castlevania playstyle are a few examples.  That's not to say this is a problem, nor would I accuse the developers of plagiarism; game development is a highly iterative process.  You could critically examine most games today and find roots well-established by games the preceded it; that's just progress.My point though is a counter-argument to the idea that Shovel Knight could've been at home on the NES.  It simply couldn't, because it is a perfection of all of those games that came before it; it just wouldn't exist without them.  It is a modernized adaptation of our best memories from a long-past era of gaming, formed to fit with the conveniences and features we've come to expect today.As for me?  I mentioned I didn't enjoy it.  I actually found the experience a lot more stressful than I expected it to be.  Not that I necessarily felt cheated, or that I took issue with the difficulty ramp (by the end, I found it extremely challenging, though fair).  My skill and reflexes felt informed by the level design, commensurate to my ability (I did beat the game after all).  There were moments of triumph, where I managed to successfully execute difficult maneuvers on the first try, but there were contrasting moments of trial and error, akin to the Dark Souls experience where you learn enough from each mistake to do better on subsequent attempts.  I got the impression that it was never going to exceed my skill level -- despite how crazy it became at times --that I could find some way to force my way through it, and even when I was sure the game might beat me, sure enough, I found a way through.The problem for me is that Shovel Knight managed to trigger my anxiety in a way that few games have ever been able.  For me, the execution and platforming would often feel harrowing, is if I was risking and wagering far more than was actually on the line.  I don't know where this feeling came from, because ultimately the death penalty isn't all that impactful, and there are enough checkpoints throughout each level to keep the repetition tolerable.  ...but I felt stressed out and tense the whole time, and it just wasn't a good feeling.  I expect, for most people -- especially for any fans of this genre -- this will not be a problem, but I just couldn't relax, and that made it that much more difficult to just have fun.My personal edge-case aside, it's a wonderfully made game, and stands as one of the best examples of percision platforming I've seen.  It's well loved and respected for a reason, and I would still easily recommend giving it a shot.			"

												There's little bad I can say about this game. The gameplay seems like a natural expansion of Capcom's NES/SNES titles, the developers are dedicated to the fanbase and even releasing huge expansions for free, catchy music, solid controls, great humor without resorting to base/self-reference/fourth-wall breaking and overall fantastic atmosphere.Oh, and to top it all off, you can play with a SNES controller. (NES controller has too few buttons, however) There's nothing like those rigid 1990's dpads for a game where 360 degree sticks serve no purpose to begin with.			"

												9.5/10Shovel Knight is a modern classic, literally. It looks and feels like a classic 2d jump`n`run and also plays like one to a degree, but at the same time feels modern, fresh.The controls are great (controller as well as KB+M). The character design is very creative, funny and unique. They are like characters from Megaman or animes/cartoons from the 80s and 90s.Every level has its own theme with unique enemy types and gimmicks, so there is always some change.There is also character progression. You find new Relics (skills), buy new Equipment and upgrade your stats, everything of this works really good. What I really liked were the last 2 stages and especially the last bossfight which had a nice ideas and was also a great moment story-wise.I dont want to repeat all those standard sentences though. Its simple, if you like any kind of platformer and you like challenging games, this is a no-brainer.			"

												Shovel Knight. Why aren't you playing this yet? BUY IT THE ZOMGBBQHYPEHYPEHYPE!Fangirling aside, let's talk about the technical side of things.Graphics:It's pixel art. Not strictly 8-bit pixel art actually. In an actual 8-bit machine they can only render 8 colours at a time in any particular sprite or layer. Which explains why in true NES games, the colour of the enemies change together with your character. (Biggest culprit again Megaman series)Shovel Knight has a lot of places where it looks 8-bit at first glance. But, if you colour pick and line the shades out they do break the limit.How did they keep that 8-bit feel? Colour choice. It all boils down to the painting.Gameplay:Perfectly right controls. It will jump the moment you press jump. Some games have a slight delay in jumping but this doesn't have it. If you inch, he will inch. If you pogo stick he will pogo stick. Oh, yes he can bounce on enemies and some objects like Scrooge McDuck.Best played on a controller for very good reasons. There will be really tricky platform sections where a bad keyboard cause a lot of needless suffering. Which leads to the next section.Difficulty:If you're the kind of person who have very bad jump timing/slipping off platforms, this will be a very very hard game for you.If you're a fresh newbie in the platforming scene, expect a steep difficulty curve.If you're more experienced in casual platforming, still expect a somewhat steep curve.If you're an old veteran of the NES Nintendo Hard era, this is definitely the game for you!There will be times where you will die. Repeatedly. And you will feel like flipping the table because That One Section gets in the way. Boss fights are very fast paced and expect a few tries before getting the hang of it. Unless you're in the NES veteran level.Things do get easier as you get more relics (Magic) and upgrade the Shovel Knight's gear (Armour/Shovel). But they're not going to prevent accidental falls from derpiness :PThe map is mapped out ala Mario Style, which means mini-areas and mini-bosses will move around the map after completing each stage. I won't spoil who they actually are.Stages can be replayed to get more money (or you missed a secret) but bewarned! In Mega Man the bosses dissapear for good after you beat them.Nope. Not in Shovel Knight. Bosses WILL wait for you at the end of the stage. New relics will make some stages a ton easier to farm.... just come prepared.All in all, expect a challenge!Music:All the music here are Chiptunes. It might take a while to get used to the kind of beepy gritty sharpy feel. The most earworm tune is the village music. Despite the high quality of the visual production, the music takes a while to catch on.When you do get used to it, it's really nice! Adds a lot to the feel of the stage and the game in general.Conclusion:What are you doing? BUY IT NOW! The only folks I'd think twice for are those with terrible coordination. But don't fret! You can try! I used to suck really hard in platforming. Then eventually with practice I get better. Platforming is like riding a bike, you'll remember it for life. "

												This is a prime example of Kickstarter done right.Shovel Knight is a retro platformer that  brings you back to the older style of games, in a colorful 8-bit medieval world with a plethora of different enemies, bosses, items, upgrades, and more. Oh, and it's plenty f***in' hard, too.To be 100% honest, I had torrented this game at first because at the time, $15 appeared a bit heavy for a 200mb game, but after playing for just an hour I decided to buy and support the people who made this awesome title. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more of Yacht Club's work in the future.			"

												Well, it's no Mega Man. and it's no Duck Tales. neither is it Castlevania nor Zelda II nor Bionic Commando nor Ninja Gaiden, etc. etc. you get the idea. I guess it's the ultimate retro-nostalgia-pandering game, built entirely out of old references like a Tarantino film. except instead of excessive swearing it has excessive bad puns.Most retro style indie games will at least try to innovate a little, or throw in a gimmick, but I couldn't find a single new idea in this entire game. If this were made in the 80s, it wouldn't be remembered as a classic, it would be that decent-yet-forgettable title that ripped off everything creative around it. Kinda like most big studio games we get today, heh.But in the end, it's still good! It is an adequate platformer, very polished production. A little too easy, not very clever level design, but there's not a single BAD thing anywhere in it. It took no risks, but it has no ugly stains.+ The soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is awesome stuff. The main sidequest has you collecting the bgm sheet music, as well you should.			"

												I loved it, and i love it. I really do. It's essentially 95 percent Megaman and maybe 5 percent some other games but it's really good no matter what. Controls feel great, there's tons of little secrets, I adore the music and the bosses are probably the best part. The game is fairly easy (nowhere near as hard as Meatboy and others) with maybe a smidgen of difficulty at the last level. It depends probably what items you use. If you want to cheese it or are too frusterated you can pretty much just phase locket most of the game. The bosses are the best part. Almost none of them are wait-around-and-hit-weakpoints. You can attack and stay on their butts the whole time. I really like that you can play super aggressively on them and take quite a few hits before going down. Level design is pretty much exactly Megaman style but obviously melee. My only problem is the game is absurdly short. I beat it in 5 hours and thats after doing all the levels too. There's a new game plus mode but it doesn't change much at all. Less checkpoints, no food, and enemies do more damage. No level change or anything so that kind of bummed me out. There's also a code to replace most of the text with ""butt"" so yeah. This is probably my favorite platformer.			"

												Fantastic game. Here's some feedback about weaker points in the game.There is ""faux low framerate"" in this game which threw me off a bit. For example when opening the menu it's very framey, same for the cursors in the menu. Didn't really like that aspect of it. I had to double check that my game was actually running at 60 fpsThe armor and weapon upgrades were very tame. Being able to electrocute the ground on the condition when being on full health sounds great, in reality you fart out a tiny spark that hovers over the ground. Of all the armors, I just used the silver one which gave me an extra attack. All the other ones were boring. When you progress further in the game the checkpoints get further and further apart. It did get annoying towards the end and I didn't really feel like exploring anymore, too much risk.I would've like more optional bosses towards the end game. I liked the wandering travellers but felt like there were one or two missing just before the end boss.I felt like the game was already pretty challenging from the start. Maybe some more gradual increase in difficulty would've been nice.I didn't really like the ""dark sections that are lit up by lightning"" sections because the dark to light ratio was way too high. For every split second of light you have multiple seconds of darkness where you can't really move.Positive points: the powerups are fantastic, they really change up the game, the npcs are interesting and fun, music is great, combat is fun and tight, ending is great.

												In 2012 I walked into a public restroom at Wal-Mart and startled a person who was already in there, causing him to slip on a puddle of urine and hit his head on one of the sinks. He immediately began convulsing, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ his pants, and foaming at the mouth. As the blood began to pool around his head I noticed he was wearing a ""Meat is Murder"" shirt, prompting me to leave him to his own thoughts.Later that week I was watching the news and it turns out he was some congressman's son and now he's in a wheelchair, lol.

												At first glance, this game just appears to be another indie platformer that is retro themed.At second glance, you look at it as ""Maybe this one will be different.""At third glance, you're having the time of your life just pummeling away at enemies with a shovel.This game controls very tightly with simplistic (yet complex to carry out in some circumstances) controls. One thing that I always bore in mind, was how awesome the difficulty curve was. From the very first level, you are getting tossed at monsters that are difficult to beat (but not impossible) and techniques that you'll be using for the rest of the game. The healthy difficulty curve really contribute to this game's replayability, too. I can see myself in the future doing another run of this game for some good old fashioned fun.On a personal note, this is one of the few games that can make you feel emotions. Any time during the Shield Knight dream sequences, the music and overall theme did an excellent job at making you specifically go for Shield Knight. I missed her once on the third dream sequence and almost cried. Not to mention at the end of the game I felt tears welling up in my eyes when she was going to sacrifice herself to save you, then audibly cheered when it turned out she was alive.I haven't gotten that excited about a video game since I was eight years old when I first beat Ocarina of Time. No game has been able to capture that old fashioned sense of achievement since then for me. To me, that rates this game as one of my all-time favorites.I know my review will become blotted out by ""Bounced a shovel off of a bubble 10/10"" But, this game is a solid 10/10 in my book. Excellent music, tight controls, good (but not obtrusive) storyline, and awesome gameplay. It's a must-play.			"

												Shovel Knight is an homage to the golden age of gaming.  The style of overworld map is taken straight from Super Mario 3.  The gameplay feels like the best of both Castlevania and Mega Man.  It even has an element of Dark Souls, where dying causes Shovel Knight to drop gold that can recovered by returning to the spot where you died.  There are plenty of power-ups, upgrades, and secrets to acquire.  If retro platforming is your thing, you'll get everything you want from Shovel Knight.			"

												There are way too many ""retro-style"" games that aren't anything like old games, which only seem to be ""retro"" style because their creators are pretentious and/or lazy.Shovel Knight is not one of those games.It looks perfect. It sounds perfect. It, shockingly enough in this world of ""hey retro means really hard right?"" games, PLAYS perfect. It gets tough at points, tough enough for you to die at the same point five times, tough enough for you to scream out loud, and yet manages to get it right to the point where you DON'T say the game is unfair, because it's not. If you die, you certainly know why, and know what to do next to not die (and then you invariably screw up and die again).Playing this game makes you feel like a child again. It's a familiar and nostalgic, yet completely new and refreshing experience.If you grew up playing video games, you HAVE to play this game.			"

												I haven't played such a great game in ages!Shovel Knight brings back the fun and challenge of the old side-scrolling platforms from the 80s and 90s, but it remixes everything to create something new and fresh.This game is flawless.The story is simple, but does it's job, the challenge is perfect, the controls are absolutely tight and responsive, the graphics awesome and the soundtrack incredible!The best thing is that every single level is different from the previous one.Both graphics and type of challenges/enemies/puzzle change every time, so it's impossible to get bored!The game is hard, (not insanely, though), but never unfair.If you die it's only your fault, and every level can be completed with a bit of practice.The graphics are awesome! True 8 bit style (which is quite hard to replicate in such an elegant way), but with a much richer colour palette than every NES game put togheter, and the animations are amazing.The soundtrack is a tremendous achievement!I haven't been listening to such a great soundtrack in ages! Lovely tunes to pump up the action and i sometimes listen to it while doing other stuff..I'll conclude with a special mention to the boss battles; many and quite elaborated.If you like 2D (old school) Platform/SidesScrolling games, you'll love this one!Pros:- Nice Channalge (Hard, but not impossible)- Tight and precise controls- Amazing 8-bit graphics- Unbelievable Soundtrack- Amazing variety (in a matter of levels and type of challenges)- An Achievment Hunter's heaven (There are many fun challenges)Cons:- NOTHING (and i haven't been writing something like this in a long while)This game was really a surprise!

There's also upcoming FREE DLC that will allow you to play as the evil knights, with new stages and story. I give this game a: 9/10. Hopefully, when the DLC comes out, I can give this game a 10/10.

												Shovel Knight scratches an itch I didn't even know that I had. Its retro graphics combined with chiptune music remind me of the old Mega Man games, which is a franchise I loved as a child. The gameplay is quick, and crisp. You don't find yourself blundering because of the controls. The bosses themselves aren't too difficult; it's the levels that are your biggest challenge. The platforming in this game requires some practice. Luckily, the game doesn't run on an extra life system. When you die, you lose gold which you can recover as you restart.The soundtrack for the game accents it so perfectly that the game seems less bright if you turn the music down. I don't say that a lot about soundtracks, but this one is definitely worth putting on headphones for. The story is actually pretty surprising. I thought it would be a cookie cutter hero vs. villains story, but it turns out to be so much more.Definitely worth your time and money.			"

It feels like Castlevania and Megaman together, and Yacht Club games have done it right.If you haven't, I highly recommend purchasing this game, you'll never regret it.			"

												This game is an amazing throwback to the 8-bit sidescrollers of old.  The controls are just tight enough to be responsive but don't hold your hand, which makes the whole experience enjoyable and challenging (a RARE treat in today's market!).  The graphics are bold and eye-catching, and the music is absolute ear candy.My only major critiques are the somewhat high price for an indy game and the difficulty spikes, which can be off-putting to folks that haven't kept up on their platforming skills.  If you loved Mega Man or Bionic Commando, this game will not dissapoint!			"

												A very solid retro platformer, the look and feel reminds me of Mega Man, Mario and a dash of Duck Tales.The controls are damn near flawless, the game could've been a tad longer -but hey, there's a new game+.10/10 would buy again (and will, once EU 3DS is released).			"

												Shovel Knight scratches an itch I didn't even know that I had. Its retro graphics combined with chiptune music remind me of the old Mega Man games, which is a franchise I loved as a child. The gameplay is quick, and crisp. You don't find yourself blundering because of the controls. The bosses themselves aren't too difficult; it's the levels that are your biggest challenge. The platforming in this game requires some practice. Luckily, the game doesn't run on an extra life system. When you die, you lose gold which you can recover as you restart.The soundtrack for the game accents it so perfectly that the game seems less bright if you turn the music down. I don't say that a lot about soundtracks, but this one is definitely worth putting on headphones for. The story is actually pretty surprising. I thought it would be a cookie cutter hero vs. villains story, but it turns out to be so much more.Definitely worth your time and money.			"

												Ok, so having grown up on nearly all retro consoles (atari, NES, SNES,N64, Sega genesis, ect.) this game... after all the games i played this year like the Tomb Raider remake, Civ5, Skyrim... all amazing games... Except Shovel Knight made me feel sooooo nostalgic with the gameplay that it immediatly became the second best game I bought for PC (#1 would be Bastion... look it up). This game feels like a classic mario....like Ghouls 'n Ghosts, like castlevania and even more so, like the original Mega Man games... With the retro design all those who missed out on THE best gaming period will feel just as fortunate as those who played in the 90's; playing this game.10/10 Would smack s**** with a shovel again.

												A lot of people seem to think of this game as the Messiah of all games - The peak of what we're capable of achieving. This has led to this game acquiring a somewhat over-the-top amount of praise.Is the game good? Yes! Is it great? Yeah.. Is it the best thing ever? Not quite.Let's be reasonable here: It's a fun retro-platformer offering a lot of challenge and bringing back a lot of mechanics from older titles that we haven't seen used in a larger and more popular mainstream title for a long time. Please, do keep in mind that some of these mechanics were left behind for a reason though.It's a good, fun game - Possibly even close to a masterpiece, but it is *not* 'the one game to rule them all'.What does it do really well?- Tight controls and Dualshock 4 compatibility without any outside tools needed.- Even thought it's an old style, the visuals are nice if you enjoy pixel-art.- A good sense of humor and a decent, if slightly confusing, story.- It's got a great deal of content and, like most games in this genre, it's more or less infinitely replayable. What does it do not-so-well?- An absolutely minute amount of bugs that can ruin your day. These are extremely rare in my experience, but while the game is solid it's not bulletproof.- Some of the mechanics are.. Well, not so fun. Rooms going completely dark, forcing you to go around not really sure of where you're going or what's up above or beneath you. Bosses that have a slightly tiresome amount of RNG and lack of control to them leading to some not always very fair deaths. Mechanics that take control away from the player and leaves you relying on luck more than skill, and some screens where a you run the possible risk of getting a setup of hazards that's unpassable. (It's rare, but it happens, and it basically means a reset/death.)I'd recommend this game to any platform enthusiast, but at the same time.. If you're like me and don't like mechanics where you can't rely on skill, this game *will* frustrate you every now and again. The difficulty curve towards the end also takes a rather sudden, massive leap, making the second half of the game far, far harder than the first half without really easing you into it.Great game, definitely a classic, and something I'm going to play more of - It's not the best game I've ever seen, nor evne the best of this particular genre. Top 5, but not number 1.			"

												This game is incredible. Shovel Knight is a game about a knight, clad in cerulean armor, with a shovel for a weapon. He used to roam the lands with his love, until they were seperated at the Tower of Fate. Now, Shovel Knight must rise up once more to protect the valley from the Order of No Quarter.This game is super freaking hard. Maybe it's just because I suck, but this game is difficult. You will ragequit. You will swear at it. But at the end of the game, you will love it. It's a combination of tons of different NES games. It has the pogo-jump from Ducktales, the knockback effect from Castlevania, and the boss battles and instakill spikes from MegaMan. If you loved those games, you will love this. I died a total of about 100 times. No joke, no sarcasm. 100 times. I think maybe a little more. That's how hard this game is. If you're not a fan of constantly dying, you will not like this game. If you don't like gorgeous 8-bit graphics and incredible chiptune songs, you will also not like this song. But if you put aside the ""terrible"" graphics and the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" music, you will discover an incredible experience.Plus, there's a new free expansion for the game, and another coming up, that lets you play as Plague Knight and Spectre Knight, so there's a pretty good replayablity to it.9.5/10I don't like dying.TL:DR: It's difficult, but good. Buy it.			"

												if you enjoyed any of the following, you will likely enjoy this game:-mega man series-ducktales (nes)-super mario bros. 3-zelda II: the adventure of link.a veritable love letter to all four and then some, the game features solid gameplay that teaches you through gameplay and not tutorials, a downright boss ost accented by the original mega man 1 composer (!!!), and a goofy, cheesy story that'll at least make you roll your eyes and grin, if nothing else. while i reference the four above as reference material, the game actually plays fairly uniquely and has its own strengths (and weaknesses) by comparison--it's a rare gem among others of its kind that shines in its ability to utilize its tools for its own sake rather than relying on parody and mockery to do its job for it--it's a game that's genuinely fun, rather than only being fun because it makes you think about the fun you had playing the games it takes its cues from.the game took me about 8-9 hours to complete--rather impressive for an nes-style indie game--and there's a new game+ mode that will probably take a little longer due to increased difficulty. there are also codes you can use to make the game easier/harder/sillier, if you're into that. my main complaints are mainly in difficulty spikes--some areas/bosses are far harder than others, and it can feel a lot like the difficulty takes a sudden dip or jump depending on where you are. i personally had lots of trouble in some of the later stages only to beat the bosses barely getting touched, if at all. the price point may also be an issue for some--$15 isn't terribly cheap, and though i feel the game is worth it for its polish, you might do well waiting for it to inevitably go on sale if you're not sure you'd enjoy it. all in all, this is a game that has the look of a classic and the feel of a well-constructed platformer--if you enjoy platformers at all, you're missing out if you skip over this game.also, there's a mode where every important word is replaced with the word butt. 11/10 would steel my shovel again.

												I'm leery of retro-styled games, but Shovel Knight does right what every game with ""8-Bit"" or ""Pixel"" in the title does wrong: it recognizes that what made the old NES classics...classics...is a strong focus on content and production, from story to character design to sound to gameplay. Shovel Knight is not AN NES game, but the NES game you would save your allowance for, the one that would cause your friends to show up to your house a little more often. And that's what games in this vein should aspire to be.			"

												At first glance, this game just appears to be another indie platformer that is retro themed.At second glance, you look at it as ""Maybe this one will be different.""At third glance, you're having the time of your life just pummeling away at enemies with a shovel.This game controls very tightly with simplistic (yet complex to carry out in some circumstances) controls. One thing that I always bore in mind, was how awesome the difficulty curve was. From the very first level, you are getting tossed at monsters that are difficult to beat (but not impossible) and techniques that you'll be using for the rest of the game. The healthy difficulty curve really contribute to this game's replayability, too. I can see myself in the future doing another run of this game for some good old fashioned fun.On a personal note, this is one of the few games that can make you feel emotions. Any time during the Shield Knight dream sequences, the music and overall theme did an excellent job at making you specifically go for Shield Knight. I missed her once on the third dream sequence and almost cried. Not to mention at the end of the game I felt tears welling up in my eyes when she was going to sacrifice herself to save you, then audibly cheered when it turned out she was alive.I haven't gotten that excited about a video game since I was eight years old when I first beat Ocarina of Time. No game has been able to capture that old fashioned sense of achievement since then for me. To me, that rates this game as one of my all-time favorites.I know my review will become blotted out by ""Bounced a shovel off of a bubble 10/10"" But, this game is a solid 10/10 in my book. Excellent music, tight controls, good (but not obtrusive) storyline, and awesome gameplay. It's a must-play.			"

												Shovel Knight is an homage to the golden age of gaming.  The style of overworld map is taken straight from Super Mario 3.  The gameplay feels like the best of both Castlevania and Mega Man.  It even has an element of Dark Souls, where dying causes Shovel Knight to drop gold that can recovered by returning to the spot where you died.  There are plenty of power-ups, upgrades, and secrets to acquire.  If retro platforming is your thing, you'll get everything you want from Shovel Knight.			"

												Inspired by an 8-bit aesthetic and staying true to the style while technically going beyond what an NES would feasibly be able to reproduce, Shovel Knight is a treat. Combining tried-and-true elements from any number of classics without overdoing it, this game is a must-have for any retro fan, but its charm, challenging-but-fair difficulty, and tight game design are sure to delight anyone with a taste for quality platformers.

												Honestly didn't know what to expect coming into this game, but I got instantly hooked the moment I started. Playing this game brought back a lot of fun memories I had of playing on the NES as a kid, from Ducktales to Mega Man. This game really captures the nostalgic feeling well while feeling fresh. My only regret is that I never got around to this game sooner.The controls in this game are really tight and responsive. I enjoy the fact that when I fail, it's my fault and not the fault of the game. The musical score is fantastic as well. A lot of really catchy pieces. And the sprite work is very well done. The designs and the animations are very well thought out and detailed. The level design as well is very well thought out. They do a great job at introducing mechanics and having you learn them before having you go out in challenges and master what you learned.I love how this game is set to where it's not too easy but not too hard, making it accessible to casual and hardcore gamers alike. Both campaigns were very enjoyable and I look forward to the Spectre Knight DLC which will be coming around soon as of this review. Definitely one of the most enjoyable, original platformers I had the joy of getting to play recently and if you haven't yet, I highly recommend giving this game a shot. Chances are, I'm sure you'll really DIG IT. :)			"

												I'm to lazy too truly think about and review this game, so I'll make this quick~It's a game where you play as a Knight and he kills things with a shovel. You collect gems and you can dig them out of the groud.If you feel really special, you can even use your shovel as a pogo stick, don't question it man.You can even kill other knights, because they're broke and don't have quarters. They can't even play an arcade machine, man.If you go to a town, you can get stuff. If the game is too hard, cheat. If it isn't then don't, 'cause that's stupid.I like this game, I'd dig it out in spades, but I suppose it depends what kind of hole you dig yourself into. I personally want to plow it right up. I like this game so much that I think about it every knight. I personally don't think they truly steel anything. You dig?Bad jokes aside, whether you like the NES style or not, you should still pick up this game. It takes every good game mechanic, refines them, and steels the NES art style and instruments. (Okay that's enough of the puns.)It's definately not something you should simply miss, I'll put it that way. Whether you like it or not is up to opinion, but you should at least try it.Also DLC is MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM goooooooooooooooooooooooood			"

												A short review for the short time I've put in so far:The still images look like it could have come from an 8-bit machine. But in motion it's as smooth as it is pretty. The classic game mechanics makes for a smooth gaming experience. I've never experienced any slowdown from this game on my rather average spec. laptop. as is prone to happen occasionally in like 30-60% of the games I play on the machine.Playable on a two button controller which is a plus, although it would have been nice if some of the direction+button commands were mapped to the extra buttons on your average controller.The main melee attack is prehaps a bit on the short side. I found it easier to kill most enemies with the downward strike. And I find the loss of gold on death rather annoying, especially when they are floating somewhere inaccessable.A great game, but I doubt it will have me coming back anytime soon once I've completed it. That's why I'm taking my time with it, a location/upgrade unlocked every week or two.8.4/10			"

												At first glance, this game just appears to be another indie platformer that is retro themed.At second glance, you look at it as ""Maybe this one will be different.""At third glance, you're having the time of your life just pummeling away at enemies with a shovel.This game controls very tightly with simplistic (yet complex to carry out in some circumstances) controls. One thing that I always bore in mind, was how awesome the difficulty curve was. From the very first level, you are getting tossed at monsters that are difficult to beat (but not impossible) and techniques that you'll be using for the rest of the game. The healthy difficulty curve really contribute to this game's replayability, too. I can see myself in the future doing another run of this game for some good old fashioned fun.On a personal note, this is one of the few games that can make you feel emotions. Any time during the Shield Knight dream sequences, the music and overall theme did an excellent job at making you specifically go for Shield Knight. I missed her once on the third dream sequence and almost cried. Not to mention at the end of the game I felt tears welling up in my eyes when she was going to sacrifice herself to save you, then audibly cheered when it turned out she was alive.I haven't gotten that excited about a video game since I was eight years old when I first beat Ocarina of Time. No game has been able to capture that old fashioned sense of achievement since then for me. To me, that rates this game as one of my all-time favorites.I know my review will become blotted out by ""Bounced a shovel off of a bubble 10/10"" But, this game is a solid 10/10 in my book. Excellent music, tight controls, good (but not obtrusive) storyline, and awesome gameplay. It's a must-play.			"

												Shovel Knight is an homage to the golden age of gaming.  The style of overworld map is taken straight from Super Mario 3.  The gameplay feels like the best of both Castlevania and Mega Man.  It even has an element of Dark Souls, where dying causes Shovel Knight to drop gold that can recovered by returning to the spot where you died.  There are plenty of power-ups, upgrades, and secrets to acquire.  If retro platforming is your thing, you'll get everything you want from Shovel Knight.			"

												I would like to say that I am not a platformer kind of gamer. I prefer things like RPG's, Action/adventure, and FPS. I do not like games that are from the 16 bit era that much. I lived and played games during that time and I am honestly glad that time period is over. With that being said, I think Shovel Knight is an amazing game. I think the gameplay is solid. There are a bunch of collectables in it. Not to mention there is a tone of upgrades to Shovel Knight. The storyline is pretty predictable  but that is ok because the gameplay itself is fun. I like how there is an acheivement for listenining to all the puns that one character says in the game. I like that they put that character in the game. It ads an extra form of humor without the need for a storyline mission or a side quest. I like how there is a Mario style of map to move around in. I have to say, I was impressed by this game. I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I do. If you like retro style gaming then you need to have this one in your library. If you don't like those type of games then I still recommend this game because I don't like retro platformers and I still found this game to be fun and worth my time playing it.			"

												Shovel Knight is quite different from many platformers in many senses. To begin the idea of using the shovel is interesting because it allows for more unique puzzles/treasures. Another interesting part of the game is the ability to press down to bounce on top of enemies with your shovel. The extent to which this can be used to grant you bonus treasures, defeat bosses, and even get more power ups makes it more than a gimmick, but turns it into a very important mechanic to learn and master. Furthermore, the game has some of the most creative bosses and stages of any game. Each stage has its own mechanics that you must be able to pick up on the fly. Normally I would not like this, but you are usually given one stage where you can practice using the mechanic before having to use it to complete a screen. Overall I highly recommend Shovel Knight.

												This game does something rare in that it not only captures the magnificent level designs, feel, gameplay and sound of Capcom games on the NES but it also manages to pick apart all of the fun elements and merge them into a finely tuned being, with its own identity and music worthy of a purchase. The game slowly hands you more difficult dishes until before long you're taking on swarms of enemies that used to give you a hard time when they were solo. The bosses, stages and items keep things interesting and the game never really gets stale. I'd recommend this game to anyone who has ever liked Megaman, Ducktales, or any other good platformer from the 8/16/32 bit eras.			"

												Shovel Knight take me back to the days of playing Megaman and Mario. The game center around the hero Shovel Knight in his quest to stop the Enchantress and her evil knights of the Order of No Quarter. Shovel Knight plays like Super Mario Bros 3 and Megaman. By that I mean the overworld is just like the overworld of Super Mario Bros 3 where you on a overworld map and you select a stage to enter. And the levels play like a standard Megaman level where you must platform your way through, destroy enemies, and use items and power-ups you got along the way to help get to the end of stage where you will generally fight one of the knights of the Order of No Quarter.Now none of this bad, quite the opposite, it taking some of my favorite parts from those games and making a good game out of it. It definately add to the nostalgia factor for anyone who played those games. But this game is easily it own game with it fun story, colorful characters and bosses, and finally it has a fun soundtrack.This is a must get for anyone who think themselves a side scrolling platformer fan. And if this wasn't enough for you to get this, also know that the developers are releasing DLC that will add new characters and features to the game (this is because they reached their kick-starter reach goals). This a lot of great content for less than $15.Edit:Plague of Shadows add on to the Shovel Knight story by telling it from the side of one of the villains known as Plague Knight. Use Plague Knights bombs to blast your way through the levels. You can customize the bombs and rearrange the casing, powder, and fuse on the bomb. Each one of these affect how the bomb work and how you will use them. The level are almost identical to the one in Shovel Knight but with some slight differences to allow for Plague Knight to get through the level. One way this game shine is how it take side characters that you would have not given a second thought to an actual back story. I personal enjoy the interaction between Mona and Plague Knight.This was a welcome expansion to the game and the fact that it was free make it all the better.Edit 2: Specter of Torment add on is the prequel story telling how the Specter Knight recruited knights of no quarter join the Enchantress. As Specter Knight you must cut the other knights into submission to make them join the Enchantress. Specter Knight plays far differently than Plague Knight and Shovel knight. He can climb up walls and do slicing attack to enemy to zip his way up to higher areas. This style take a some getting use to but once you do it feel right. Like with the previous campaigns you will get items and armor that can make you game easier. I salute Yacht Club for their ability to take not only a boss character but every minor character and flesh their character and story out. Specter Knight campaign is full of minor characters who couldn't get their shine in the previous campaigns. With 2 campaigns done and a genderswap mode added, all that is left is the King Knight campaign.			"

												While I prefer my fantasy with more dragons, this game has everything you could ask for in an action plateformer. lovely pixel art, a killer soundtrack and game elements and mechanics that were inspired by so many old classic games such as Super Mario 3's map system, megaman esque level designs and bosses, hidden items like in legend of zelda, and of course the pogo stick mechanic from Ducktales!Take up your shovel blade and get ready to fight all manner of warriors, worlocks and monsters. Like the classics all the mechanics are taught through experience instead of hand holding tutorials. The story is simple, yet it has one of the most epic plot twists ever. Sorry, no spoilers, you'll have to beat the game to find out.I also enjoy how the map enviroment is never stagnent, random encounters pop up all over the place, and the penalty system for dying is rather unique and fair. Instead of losing lives, you loose your gold, or jewels I guess.This game is worth every peny and more, ten out of ten I say. Now if you'll excuse me, I've treasure to dig up.			"

												Is there an option for higher than a 100? This game is such a joy to play. It blends together some of the best aspects of retro games, as well as some newer titles. This is an anyone game, I find it hard to believe that anyone won't like this. It's easy to pick up, it's challenging, and the music just compliments the already amazing gameplay.With the release of the new specter knight campaign, I played only ten minutes and I'm loving it already. Yacht club is doing fantastic work, they know what DLC shouldbe, and did I mention the DLC is free?Shovel knight is all around a joyous NES era throwback. Once you pick it up, it'll be hard to put down. It is really worth the $35 I payed for the deluxe edition			"

												I will admit I don't have many hours on steam for Shovel Knight, i find the controls a tad clunky with standard keyboard mapping, however with a gamepad this game is absolute gold. I've played this game without the free DLC for about 500 hours on the basic campaign alone on my Nintendo 3DS.Story: 6/10 It's a tad predictable but good nonethelessGameplay: 8/10 Controls very well, and when you die, it's generally something you did wrong, which can be frustrating, thus 8/10Music: 10/10 Originally composed 16-bit gold that made itself etched into the history of gamingIs the game worth the full price: DefinitelyThis game is a classic and if you haven't tried it, you should certainly consider picking it up, sale or not.

												This game is probably one of the best platformers I've ever played. Gameplay Shovel Knight plays in a similar way to a Megaman game, where you have to defeat all the knights of the order of no quarter (kind of like the robot masters in Megaman), and the levels are composed of ""rooms"". The level design is so well made, it teaches you brilliantly the mechanics of the game really quickly, and there are very few moments where you say to yourself ""this is the game's fault"", because usually every death is justified, the mechanics in one room were taught to you before hand so you know what to expect.  Plague of Shadows The Plague of Shadows update gives you (once you've cleared the game) the possibility to play as Plague Knight, one of the Knights of the Order of no quarter. The gameplay changes entirely, and you get to replay the entire game as a baddie. It's really fun and is a great addition to the game. The Story The story, while being simple, is pretty good in my opinion. You are Shovel Knight, an adventurer that used to roam the land with his partner, Shield Knight. They go exploring the Tower of Fate, where Shield Knight gets defeated and Shovel Knight is forced to escape. He then retires to a more peaceful life, but The Enchantress and her Order of no quarter start ruling the land. Shovel Knight, wanting to fight this evil, comes back and begins his quest to defeat The Enchantress. Plague of Shadows In the update, Plague Knight's quest is to brew a potion that will make him extremely powerful, but for that he will need the essence of every Knight of the Order of no Quarter, including The Enchantress' essence. With the help of Mona, your alchemist assistant, you begin your quest to defeat every knight and brew this strength potion. OST The OST. Oh man the OST. It is composed by the man, the legend, Jake Kaufman, and he just nails it once again. The soundtrack is really good and fits the overall feeling of the game extremely well. I don't think that Jake Kaufman could ever fail the soundtrack for a game. The soundtrack of Plague of Shadows is just as good. TL;DR I greatly recommend buying Shovel Knight. While it is not the longest game, it is still extremely fun to play and definitely worth it's price, the level design is incredibly well done, the controls feel really well, the OST is insanely good. Yacht Games' first title is a masterpiece.			"

												I've been playing this game on the Wii U, and have decided to get the PC version, so... here's my reviewPros:- Excellent Level Design, with well-made soundtrack- Very subtle throwbacks to retro games, like Ducktales, Zelda 2, and Super Mario Bros 3- Nice, tight controls, with a lack of bs game mechanics- Platforming is surprisingly well-madeCons:- Limited replayability- Relic system is a bit on the gimmicky side, especially as only one is universally useful.Shovel Knight is an excellent game with clever retro callbacks, with the more obvious references going to the likes of Ducktales. It's very easy to get accustomed to the game mechanics, and recognize patterns, and the levels kept me coming back. A Super Mario Bros 3-style map, filled with treasure levels, and roaming boss battles, helps to fill the retro vibe.The level design is very uniform, and the level is consisted of several checkpoints that you can break to get more treasure, at the expense of that checkpoint. I tended to break the middle checkpoints, and completely ignore the checkpoints that pop up right before a boss battle. Each level has a mix of variations of enemies, and level-unique enemies as well, so no complaints there. I also found that the soundtrack is very suiting for each level, giving each level a ice musical theme, further supplemented by the boss theme.Playing first with my keyboard, and then with a custom NES controller helped me understand that the controls are tight, a callback to Castlevania, which means fhat precision does in fact play a role in the game. There never really was a time where I felt the game cheated me out of a death, but rather, my error in understanding enemy patterns and mistakes in movement were the cause of my demise.One of my only gripes is that replayability is limited in this game. Sure, there's a New Game+ mode, and a DLC gamemode called Plague of Shadows, as well as a challenge mode, but overall, the replayability is limited in this game. The other gripe is the relic mechanic. In the game, you can access a room with a blue chest in each level, where you can spend a certain amount on a relic that can aid you in the game. I found that each level allowed for use with the accompanying relic, but one relic seemed to be too advantageous, and that was the phase locket, which grants brief invincibility to it's user.Overall, I really like this game. Sure, the replayability is limited, and some relics can be bs, but all in all, this is a game that bears little flaw, and those flaws are quickly outshone by the good parts of the game. 8/10			"

												tl;dr: Even if you barely like pixel art games and or/platformers of any form, then give this game a try, it is that good!There are some very rare games which are just so good that it is hard to find anything bad about them. Shovel Knight is one of those games and it's just the first game from Indie developer Yacht Club Games. The game is a brilliant ""modern oldschool"" Action-Platformer that draws inspiration from many classic NES games like Castlevania, Duck Tales and mostly MegaMan but still feels very unique in its own way: Here you have 8 Boss Knights from the Order of No Quarter instead of 8 Robot Masters like you would have in  MegaMan including themed stages that look awesome and are bursting with collectibles, personality ( the character design is simply flawless) and innovative gameplay elements. And there are even more optional stages, towns to explore and enemy encounters on the map that looks a lot like the one from Super Mario Bros. 3. And that's just the tip of the iceberg: Nice Soundtrack, a whole lot more bosses than just the knights, armor and weapon upgrades, magic relics, dialogues and although there is a heavy focus on gameplay here as you might expect, a story that is at first very shallow, but gets unexpectedly touching for an 8-bit-game in the final stages . And fear not: The difficulty in the main game is really not that high, everybody should be able to complete normal mode. To those who seek a challenge, there is a much harder New Game + and some difficult achievements (Speedruns, No-Death-Runs etc.). I completed my first playthrough in about 8 hours and even if you just play through the game once, it's worth the fifteen bucks. So I totally recommend this game to anyone that doesn't hate the platforming genre, in fact I think that this game is the best release in 2014 till now.			"

												I don't think I need to go into a great deal of detail and praise for Shovel Knight. It's in no need of any more of that.I will say that Shovel Knight is a pleasant surprise compared to most indie games. It actually tries to improve upon a formula to a degree as opposed to forcing many design flaws from old games just because ""that made the experience more difficult and more rewarding in those old games"" according every retro loving geek ever. It's important to me that the game is difficult enough to be a challenge without being so difficult that I just refuse to pick it up again for weeks, but then I'm terrible at games (I'm not a filthy casual, I'm just bad) and I always have trouble with platformers especially (finish Cave Story for god's sake) but Shovel Knight is a game that I think any person could easily jump into, so long as they don't have a problem with the retro graphics.The gameplay is solid, even though it's really just Jump & Shoot Man without the shooting. Plenty of jumping though. If I can knock the game for anything it would probably be that every boss is designed to be dispatched in the exact same manner, which isn't entirely a bad thing, but it makes the relics seem a tad useless outside of a few points where they are almost required. The Phase Locket is the most useful relic in the game, a little too useful though, as it is easy to abuse.The soundtrack is pretty good. I mean it's chiptune but I've never had a problem with that. I don't make a fuss about most music that does not have lyrics. It's memorable and that's all that matters. You can get the soundtrack up on Jake Kaufman's bandcamp for name your own price, as well as an arranged version of the soundtrack.Overall I'd say this game is worth a try if you're looking for a little nostalgia trip, or even just a game that's easy to just sit down and play.

												Shovel Knight is one of the finest and most polished platformers I've played in years. Even if you can't relate to the whole nostalgic NES/Famicom gaming scene, you SHOULD still give this game a try. Belonging to the platformer genre, Shovel Knight has lots of jumping; fortunately, the jumping mechanics are smooth and easy to plan, so leaping over the many pits of death shouldn't be too stressful. Ninety-nine percent of my deaths were entirely my fault, which is good! The visuals are colorful and very distinguishable, so things that LOOK like they're in the background will NEVER turn out to be weird platforms or obstacles. You'd be surprised by how important this small detail can be in old platformers.The plot is a simple ""Defeat the eight big bosses and save the girl!"" affair, the relatively short length of the game is remedied by the addicting allure of a more challenging ""New Game+ Mode"", and the soundtrack... Lordy, the SOUNDTRACK! I actually listen to quite a few of the standout tracks on their own, when I'm not playing the game. For $15 (that's like, what, a couple coffees at Starbucks?), Shovel Knight is practically a steal. Quite frankly, I dig this game.			"

												If you are a fan of the 8-bit era, this is a must purchase. Sales be damned! Shovel Knight is a pixel-art platformer which incorporates many of the unique mechanics from classic titles such as Duck Tales, Super Mario Bros 3 and Mega Man. The art design is gorgeous despite the market seemingly being littered lately with retro style platformers and the music by Kaufman and Matsumae brings all the chiptune goodness you could ask for. I doubt I've enjoyed a soundtrack this much since Scott Pilgrim. The difficulty sits on the moderate level. However, NG+ will probably be making you throw your shovel at times. The title also contains a bevy of unlockables and alternate characters to play as which ramps up the replayability factor. Basically, grab your shovel, dig up the remains of your wallet from the Steam Sale and BUY this game!			"

I've played this game without the free DLC for about 500 hours on the basic campaign alone on my Nintendo 3DS.Story: 6/10 It's a tad predictable but good nonethelessGameplay: 8/10 Controls very well, and when you die, it's generally something you did wrong, which can be frustrating, thus 8/10Music: 10/10 Originally composed 16-bit gold that made itself etched into the history of gamingIs the game worth the full price: DefinitelyThis game is a classic and if you haven't tried it, you should certainly consider picking it up, sale or not.

												If you grew up in the 1980s and you loved Mega Man and Castlevania on the NES, then you'll be happy to know that Shovel Knight is their spiritual successor. You can ask virtually everyone I know IRL and they will tell you that I love picking out the flaws in things. So it is with rather a stunned feeling that I have to say: this game is mostly perfect.An amazing chiptune soundtrack, great characters and a story that's practical, beautiful quasi-8-bit graphics, and fantastically responsive controls pretty much sum up what the game is made of... But it's the obvious love and respect with which the developers crafted the game that really takes it over the top.You really owe it to yourself to play Shovel Knight if you've ever loved a platform adventure game in your life. Even if it's not on sale, it's well worth what it costs; and that's coming from a hardened Steam Sale hunter.			"

												I love retro style games, and this is no different. This game is filled with great music, gameplay, and somewhat good storytelling. I love everything about it really, except the length could have been longer, but that's about it. Overall, this is a fantastic game, and you should definitely try it out if you like the old classic 2d games!			"

												Shovel Knight. It's a game about a Knight and a Shovel. The Shovel is OP and the Knight knows it. He uses the Shovel to *SPOILERS* and thats it. Also it has the Plague Knight. Whom is the greatest boss of all time.10/10 I loved it. Plague Knight Story please. Thanks. I love you for making this game.			"

If Dark Souls were a platformer involving Shovels, it would be Shovel Knight. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are straight out of an NES cartridge, and the level design is superb. Shovel Knight is a masterful work of gaming enginuity that I would recommend to all gamers.			"

												It's a perfect tribute to some of the older retro games. This game has some challenging platforming, unique bossfights, and a soundtrack that truly complements every moment you spend in the game, whether you are in an intense battle, or simply walking through the village. The controls handle well, and are straightforward and aren't to difficult to master. As I stated before, this game does have parts in which you may find difficult, but the checkpoints throughout the level will help keep you from having to repeat parts, and allow you to feel accomplished after completing each level. With each death, you lose a portion of the gold that you've collected throughout the game. You can collect this gold back when you return to where you had died previously. In short, It is an amazing retro-style 2D platformer. Shovel Knight is a ton of fun, and is a must have to your library!  "

Shovel Knight is a charming love letter to classic NES games that feels fresh and fluid. The gameplay is tight and you will smile to yourself when you suddenly recall Megaman, Castlevania, and even Contra and Ninja Gaiden while playing. That being said, this is an original game with a surprisingly touching story as well. The soundtrack is memorable and will be on my regular music playlist rotation in 2015! I will absolutely replay this game and shoot for 100% while eagerly awaiting Shovel Knight II!			"

												To start off this review I would like to say that I have played a lot of platformers before this one so I know what a good platformer looks like and this game, is a good platformer.And Shovel Knight is an excellent platformer as it combines retro plaforming elements with some modern elements seen in many games today, mainly the colours. It also has a good story which most platformers don't have. The main thing I would have to say about this game is that it is a perfect blend of Megaman and Super Mario as it allows you to traverse a map and choose different levels (Like Mario) but there are bosses at the end of each of level and they all have different ""elements"" (much like Megaman). Also you have a weapon which is useful in a platformer. Another thing to say about the game is that you have not just 1 weapon, but you can collect a small arsenal of weapons which are all very useful in different situations. I genuinely cannot find anything bad to say about this game.In short, Shovel Knight is an amazing game which combines platforming with good story-telling and RPG elements. I would recommend this to anyone who likes old school platforming games.             10/10			"

You might be tempted to whine how the graphics go beyond the NES/Famicoms capabilities but at the same time it's lovely to play a retro platformer that isn't pandering terribly to nostalgia and is making a great game in it's own right without unnecessary tributes to other classics.It plays a lot like Ducktails on the NES but it's mechanics go beyond that into a great game in it's own right.Highly recommended.

												This is the perfect game if you want to increase your blood presure and shorten your life span,If you're terrible at platformers like me.Frustrating but at the same time ALOT of FUN, the devs did a good job of capturing the style of old NES/SNES games allthought i often wished they didn't use some of those very old school NES/SNES ideas, such as :Instant death spikes, instant death pits and the infamous knockback effect which always knocks you back into a nearby death pit.Thankfully the game has a fair amount of checkpoints in every level, so it's at least somewhat forgiving.In general, the game feels like you took a bunch of old classic NES game and mixed them together, games such as : MegaMan,Super Marios 3,Castlevania and Metroid.The soundtrack is also just pure frekin' gold, really love it.The game is not very hard at the start but as you keep playing the difficulty keeps getting higher and higher, the last three levels being almost pure hell for me, i actully had to buy a new keyboard because of this game since i managed to brake my space key(jump key) in half because of how many times i started hiting it out of frustration due to the Tower of Fate: Entrance level.It'll kick your♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll keep coming back  for more.It is a game that will often request from you to be 100% perfect in certain levels and/or specific parts of a level but as much as it might frustrate you at those times, you'll also love it since the general gameplay just feels good and is so much frekin' fun.

You go around killing and hopping on enemies and obstacles with your shovel. You obtain gold that can be used to upgrade gear with unique abilities. The boss fights are neat and the music is really good. I would wait for it to go on deal until you purchase it as the game length isn't that long, but still worth the price since it's a good game, especially if you can see yourself running through it multiple times and the second time running will be more of a challenge for those looking for a harder time.

												I will tell you my personal experience of the game instead of some ""This was good and this was not""-kind of thing. First of all. I am twenty nine years old writing this. Some might wonder why a twenty nine year old play a platform game that might be more suited for an eleven year old? My brother wonders the same thing when he sees me playing these kind of games and I do too whenever I play a bad one in search of the good stuff.Thing is. I spent a lot of hours on plattformers growing up especially most of the Mega Man games. In more recent years I been trying to find games that gives me a certain feeling that some of the old games gave me. I re-found it in Mega Man X (SNES), Donkey Kong Country (SNES) and Shatterhand (NES) for example. But most games just bores me after some time because they miss that certain something and I rather return to games more suitable for my age.. Say Red Dead Redemption (PS3) or The Walking Dead (PS3 and PC).Shovel Knight is one of the very few games that has given me the feeling I got as a kid. Most new games which is built upon a old concept is either too easy or too hard. Often centers around being ""fast"" and have lots of enemies. I am not looking for a easy or hard game though. I'm looking for a good game and Shovel Knight is just that.When I started playing it first looked like an old DOS-game and then as a cheap Mega Man rip-off but very soon I realized it was more to this game than meets the eye. As the game developed I see a whole nods to games I love.. Golden Axe, Super Mario 3, Duck Tales and even Link 2.Between levels you choose for your own liking you can visit a town. Just as in Link 2. The difference? These towns are actually fun to walk into and is very well done.. Unlike those for Link 2. Man I hated those towns even as a kid haha. The characters you meet there actually has something useful to say and they can help you in ways that make the game easier and more enjoyable.The Mega Man references are all over the place but they are never just ""Hey, let's put this Mega Man-thing here"". No. They reconstructe the ideas and make them unique. The bosses for example. In Mega Man you mostly just learn a pattern and then most are stupidly easy. These bosses, while some are easy, are much smarter and have a bunch of attacks. I have finished the game and I not even sure I saw all their moves. They just don't stand taking hits either. Put them in a dangerous position and they will eventually get out of it.The level design is top notch. There are plenty enemies and it's the hasards that mostly kill you or offer a real challenge. You don't need to be a genius to ""get"" what you are supposed to do but it makes the whole experience more fun and the next scene is never too predictable. An overall great flow during the whole game.Unlike Mega Man some unexpected things happens to the map.. Think of the axe-men in Super Mario 3. But better and offers variation. There was a ""what the f**k""-moment for me in the game. Even that is explained in a good way later on. The game isn't just a one way street either. As I watched the end credits there are stuff I actually missed in the game.. Which makes a replay a welcomed experience.So... Nothing bad to say? Well. The game is very slow... Still better than too fast. But it could have been a notch faster. And I saw myself fighting against the controls.. Those who played Duck Tales and Darkwing Duck (NES) knows what I am talking about.In the end of the day the music drives the game forward, the level design is fantastic, the story is well done, the bosses are fun and while it reminds me of different games it still finds originality in a way most platform games don't.To me this is right up there with all the classics in the genre. Very well done guys. Comes recommended. I'd love to see more games with a similar concept that is as well done. I'd buy that. You should too!			"

												I don't think I need to go into a great deal of detail and praise for Shovel Knight. It's in no need of any more of that.I will say that Shovel Knight is a pleasant surprise compared to most indie games. It actually tries to improve upon a formula to a degree as opposed to forcing many design flaws from old games just because ""that made the experience more difficult and more rewarding in those old games"" according every retro loving geek ever. It's important to me that the game is difficult enough to be a challenge without being so difficult that I just refuse to pick it up again for weeks, but then I'm terrible at games (I'm not a filthy casual, I'm just bad) and I always have trouble with platformers especially (finish Cave Story for god's sake) but Shovel Knight is a game that I think any person could easily jump into, so long as they don't have a problem with the retro graphics.The gameplay is solid, even though it's really just Jump & Shoot Man without the shooting. Plenty of jumping though. If I can knock the game for anything it would probably be that every boss is designed to be dispatched in the exact same manner, which isn't entirely a bad thing, but it makes the relics seem a tad useless outside of a few points where they are almost required. The Phase Locket is the most useful relic in the game, a little too useful though, as it is easy to abuse.The soundtrack is pretty good. I mean it's chiptune but I've never had a problem with that. I don't make a fuss about most music that does not have lyrics. It's memorable and that's all that matters. You can get the soundtrack up on Jake Kaufman's bandcamp for name your own price, as well as an arranged version of the soundtrack.Overall I'd say this game is worth a try if you're looking for a little nostalgia trip, or even just a game that's easy to just sit down and play.

												Shovel Knight is a pretty good game. Smart, funny and well thought out. The art is beautiful, generally i'm no a pixel art fan, but in this game the art is well developed and is a plus in the game, Maybe the best part is the character design, every knight is amazing. But, my favorite knight, after the shovel knight, is the shield knight. Would be amazing if Yacht Club Games do a game about her!!The game design is pretty smart, each level have his own difficulty, and is not repetitive. That is appreciated today.The retro essence of the game is very good developed. Any ""old school gamer"" would be pleased to play this game, but have enough charisma to inspire love to the new gamers.A 10/10 game.I'm waiting for the expansions!			"

												I would like to say that I am not a platformer kind of gamer. I prefer things like RPG's, Action/adventure, and FPS. I do not like games that are from the 16 bit era that much. I lived and played games during that time and I am honestly glad that time period is over. With that being said, I think Shovel Knight is an amazing game. I think the gameplay is solid. There are a bunch of collectables in it. Not to mention there is a tone of upgrades to Shovel Knight. The storyline is pretty predictable  but that is ok because the gameplay itself is fun. I like how there is an acheivement for listenining to all the puns that one character says in the game. I like that they put that character in the game. It ads an extra form of humor without the need for a storyline mission or a side quest. I like how there is a Mario style of map to move around in. I have to say, I was impressed by this game. I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I do. If you like retro style gaming then you need to have this one in your library. If you don't like those type of games then I still recommend this game because I don't like retro platformers and I still found this game to be fun and worth my time playing it.			"

												Shovel Knight is quite different from many platformers in many senses. To begin the idea of using the shovel is interesting because it allows for more unique puzzles/treasures. Another interesting part of the game is the ability to press down to bounce on top of enemies with your shovel. The extent to which this can be used to grant you bonus treasures, defeat bosses, and even get more power ups makes it more than a gimmick, but turns it into a very important mechanic to learn and master. Furthermore, the game has some of the most creative bosses and stages of any game. Each stage has its own mechanics that you must be able to pick up on the fly. Normally I would not like this, but you are usually given one stage where you can practice using the mechanic before having to use it to complete a screen. Overall I highly recommend Shovel Knight.

												If you grew up in the 1980s and you loved Mega Man and Castlevania on the NES, then you'll be happy to know that Shovel Knight is their spiritual successor. You can ask virtually everyone I know IRL and they will tell you that I love picking out the flaws in things. So it is with rather a stunned feeling that I have to say: this game is mostly perfect.An amazing chiptune soundtrack, great characters and a story that's practical, beautiful quasi-8-bit graphics, and fantastically responsive controls pretty much sum up what the game is made of... But it's the obvious love and respect with which the developers crafted the game that really takes it over the top.You really owe it to yourself to play Shovel Knight if you've ever loved a platform adventure game in your life. Even if it's not on sale, it's well worth what it costs; and that's coming from a hardened Steam Sale hunter.			"

Shovel Knight is a masterful work of gaming enginuity that I would recommend to all gamers.			"

												It's a perfect tribute to some of the older retro games. This game has some challenging platforming, unique bossfights, and a soundtrack that truly complements every moment you spend in the game, whether you are in an intense battle, or simply walking through the village. The controls handle well, and are straightforward and aren't to difficult to master. As I stated before, this game does have parts in which you may find difficult, but the checkpoints throughout the level will help keep you from having to repeat parts, and allow you to feel accomplished after completing each level. With each death, you lose a portion of the gold that you've collected throughout the game. You can collect this gold back when you return to where you had died previously. In short, It is an amazing retro-style 2D platformer. Shovel Knight is a ton of fun, and is a must have to your library!  "

												This ended up being my favorite game of 2014. You would think that this is another 2D indie side scroller that will eventually end up on a humble bundle, but do not wait for it to go on sale. GET IT NOW. Shovel Knight is a charming love letter to classic NES games that feels fresh and fluid. The gameplay is tight and you will smile to yourself when you suddenly recall Megaman, Castlevania, and even Contra and Ninja Gaiden while playing. That being said, this is an original game with a surprisingly touching story as well. The soundtrack is memorable and will be on my regular music playlist rotation in 2015! I will absolutely replay this game and shoot for 100% while eagerly awaiting Shovel Knight II!			"

												To start off this review I would like to say that I have played a lot of platformers before this one so I know what a good platformer looks like and this game, is a good platformer.And Shovel Knight is an excellent platformer as it combines retro plaforming elements with some modern elements seen in many games today, mainly the colours. It also has a good story which most platformers don't have. The main thing I would have to say about this game is that it is a perfect blend of Megaman and Super Mario as it allows you to traverse a map and choose different levels (Like Mario) but there are bosses at the end of each of level and they all have different ""elements"" (much like Megaman). Also you have a weapon which is useful in a platformer. Another thing to say about the game is that you have not just 1 weapon, but you can collect a small arsenal of weapons which are all very useful in different situations. I genuinely cannot find anything bad to say about this game.In short, Shovel Knight is an amazing game which combines platforming with good story-telling and RPG elements. I would recommend this to anyone who likes old school platforming games.             10/10			"

												Fantastic and charming retro-themed platformer. You might be tempted to whine how the graphics go beyond the NES/Famicoms capabilities but at the same time it's lovely to play a retro platformer that isn't pandering terribly to nostalgia and is making a great game in it's own right without unnecessary tributes to other classics.It plays a lot like Ducktails on the NES but it's mechanics go beyond that into a great game in it's own right.Highly recommended.

												This is the perfect game if you want to increase your blood presure and shorten your life span,If you're terrible at platformers like me.Frustrating but at the same time ALOT of FUN, the devs did a good job of capturing the style of old NES/SNES games allthought i often wished they didn't use some of those very old school NES/SNES ideas, such as :Instant death spikes, instant death pits and the infamous knockback effect which always knocks you back into a nearby death pit.Thankfully the game has a fair amount of checkpoints in every level, so it's at least somewhat forgiving.In general, the game feels like you took a bunch of old classic NES game and mixed them together, games such as : MegaMan,Super Marios 3,Castlevania and Metroid.The soundtrack is also just pure frekin' gold, really love it.The game is not very hard at the start but as you keep playing the difficulty keeps getting higher and higher, the last three levels being almost pure hell for me, i actully had to buy a new keyboard because of this game since i managed to brake my space key(jump key) in half because of how many times i started hiting it out of frustration due to the Tower of Fate: Entrance level.It'll kick your♥♥♥♥♥ but you'll keep coming back  for more.It is a game that will often request from you to be 100% perfect in certain levels and/or specific parts of a level but as much as it might frustrate you at those times, you'll also love it since the general gameplay just feels good and is so much frekin' fun.

												Very nice game. It offers platformer gameplay similar to that of the NES/SNES era that you obviously already can tell. You go around killing and hopping on enemies and obstacles with your shovel. You obtain gold that can be used to upgrade gear with unique abilities. The boss fights are neat and the music is really good. I would wait for it to go on deal until you purchase it as the game length isn't that long, but still worth the price since it's a good game, especially if you can see yourself running through it multiple times and the second time running will be more of a challenge for those looking for a harder time.

												If you liked challenging NES platformers such as Castlevania, Megaman, and Zelda 2, you'll enjoy Shovel Knight. It's quite challenging, but there are plenty of checkpoints throughout the levels, and you get infinite lives, so as to keep frustration levels low.The levels are designed intelligently, in that new game mechanics are gradually introduced - you might learn how to deal with bouncy squid on one screen, and then on the next screen you'll have to bounce on the squid to get over some spikes.The music is excellent in chiptune style, reminiscent of the NES games I mentioned earlier. There also seem to be references to Megaman and other games - for instance there is a boss who resembles Enker from the Megaman series in terms of his attacks.Overall, this is a well made game which is quite challenging, but not too frustratingly impossible.

												Very good game. Controls great, platforming is fun and challenging, amazing music and pixel art. To top if off, the dialogue is clever and funny without trying too hard. The (free) additional campaign is almost the same as the first, but the character controls so differently that it almost feels like another game.			"

												Definitely one of the best love letters to retro games in recent memory. Doesn't use its pixel art as an excuse for laziness, has an excellent aesthetic and chiptune soundtrack, and in terms of gameplay feels most like a heavily refined DuckTales or Zelda 2. Biggest complaint I've heard is that it's not longer.			"

												Incredible.+Phenominal music. Immediately had me humming along.+Fantastic controls. Playing with a controller feels spot on.+Really well done 8-bit graphics. Sets the mood very well, and in certain weather effects look amazing being done in just 8-bit.+One of the few good things to come out of Kickstarter.+TONS of secrets. It really keeps you in levels longer to search all over.+Great difficulty curve. You can destroy checkpoints for more loot, but that puts more pressure on you. It does a good job of keeping things difficult, but not NES-frustrating hard (unless you want it to be.)-I suppose if I have to nit-pick, towards the end of the game gold becomes near worthless. A lot of armors seem to be in the game just to throw away money.Get it. It's amazing if you enjoy retro style platformers.			"

												This game is amazing. Anyone who grew up with games from the 80's and 90's owes it to themself to pick this up.The music is awesome, the amount of detail in the sprites is crazy, and the gameplay is totally solid. Not a single death in this game feels unfair and totally feels like it's the player's fault.10/10, it's their first release and it'll be hard for Yacht Club Games to top it.			"

												A lot of people seem to think of this game as the Messiah of all games - The peak of what we're capable of achieving. This has led to this game acquiring a somewhat over-the-top amount of praise.Is the game good? Yes! Is it great? Yeah.. Is it the best thing ever? Not quite.Let's be reasonable here: It's a fun retro-platformer offering a lot of challenge and bringing back a lot of mechanics from older titles that we haven't seen used in a larger and more popular mainstream title for a long time. Please, do keep in mind that some of these mechanics were left behind for a reason though.It's a good, fun game - Possibly even close to a masterpiece, but it is *not* 'the one game to rule them all'.What does it do really well?- Tight controls and Dualshock 4 compatibility without any outside tools needed.- Even thought it's an old style, the visuals are nice if you enjoy pixel-art.- A good sense of humor and a decent, if slightly confusing, story.- It's got a great deal of content and, like most games in this genre, it's more or less infinitely replayable. What does it do not-so-well?- An absolutely minute amount of bugs that can ruin your day. These are extremely rare in my experience, but while the game is solid it's not bulletproof.- Some of the mechanics are.. Well, not so fun. Rooms going completely dark, forcing you to go around not really sure of where you're going or what's up above or beneath you. Bosses that have a slightly tiresome amount of RNG and lack of control to them leading to some not always very fair deaths. Mechanics that take control away from the player and leaves you relying on luck more than skill, and some screens where a you run the possible risk of getting a setup of hazards that's unpassable. (It's rare, but it happens, and it basically means a reset/death.)I'd recommend this game to any platform enthusiast, but at the same time.. If you're like me and don't like mechanics where you can't rely on skill, this game *will* frustrate you every now and again. The difficulty curve towards the end also takes a rather sudden, massive leap, making the second half of the game far, far harder than the first half without really easing you into it.Great game, definitely a classic, and something I'm going to play more of - It's not the best game I've ever seen, nor evne the best of this particular genre. Top 5, but not number 1.			"

												This game is incredible. Shovel Knight is a game about a knight, clad in cerulean armor, with a shovel for a weapon. He used to roam the lands with his love, until they were seperated at the Tower of Fate. Now, Shovel Knight must rise up once more to protect the valley from the Order of No Quarter.This game is super freaking hard. Maybe it's just because I suck, but this game is difficult. You will ragequit. You will swear at it. But at the end of the game, you will love it. It's a combination of tons of different NES games. It has the pogo-jump from Ducktales, the knockback effect from Castlevania, and the boss battles and instakill spikes from MegaMan. If you loved those games, you will love this. I died a total of about 100 times. No joke, no sarcasm. 100 times. I think maybe a little more. That's how hard this game is. If you're not a fan of constantly dying, you will not like this game. If you don't like gorgeous 8-bit graphics and incredible chiptune songs, you will also not like this song. But if you put aside the ""terrible"" graphics and the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" music, you will discover an incredible experience.Plus, there's a new free expansion for the game, and another coming up, that lets you play as Plague Knight and Spectre Knight, so there's a pretty good replayablity to it.9.5/10I don't like dying.TL:DR: It's difficult, but good. Buy it.			"

												I just finished the game for the first time and I really enjoyed it. In total I died 137 times, and each time I take full responsibility for. I don't play this type of game very often but at no point did I feel like the game cheated me. I played the entirety of it with a DualShock 4 controller and it handled perfectly with the DS4Windows program. I purchased the soundtrack+game bundle because the soundtrack is really that good. Each zone has a great theme and the song for each is memorable, with ""Strike the Earth!"" being my favorite. Most of the bosses are interesting and challenging, I think I only one-shot one of them. The strategies to beat them aren't rocket science and defeating them is only a matter of execution. The final boss sequence is particularly rewarding and unique. The biggest surprise for me was the world of the game. There are genuinely funny moments and characters and by the end of the game you really feel for the main character. I highly recommend playing this if you like well-made platformers.			"

												(My Original Review) - October 2014This game... I just can't put into proper words to describe how great it is...For such a short game, it left a impact on me, and not just nostalgically.I've had so many great moments with this game that I can say right now it's a MUST play for sure! I'm happy to say, its now a new member to my family of top 10 favorite video games of all time. But enough about me and my experience with the game, after all its no fun listening to someone ramble on about it, but thats what Shovel Knight kinda does to you. I've become so attached to this gemstone of a game over the past year that I kinda find myself lost within' it on every new playthrough.With all the charm it put into it's characters, and all the effort, love and the sheer polish of its platforming. And the soundtrack, good lord, the soundtrack! It's pure bliss without the ignorance and it does it so effortlessly.Go play it and you'll see what I'm talking about. If you're a either a die-hard nostalgic platform lover, or a casual player of games, it deserves your attention.UPDATE: (Plague of Shadows DLC) - December 2016As this game continues to grow and show off more about the other knights and their stories, it still stands to prove it's mark on my words. Plague of Shadows is Yacht Club's love letter to the community that still continues to support them in anyway possible. THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE GOOD DLC PEOPLE! Having the choice to play as another knight aside from Shovel Knight, and playing a completely altered main-story campaign to the one you're used to, is in a level of its own of how much the developers care about their game and the people who play their game.Taking control of Plague Knight (the main protagonist of the Plague of Shadows DLC) is completely different from the way you play the cyan-ironclad digger himself. Taking place during the same time as Shovel Knight's quest (and even intertwining with each other), Plague Knight comes equipped with his own tools for alchemical anarchy and mayhem. Concoct and brew your own bombs with the many of different effects at your reach to dispose of your enemies in droves of pretty explosions. How he moves, attacks and even jumps is so unique as oppose to Shovel Knight hes literaly a different character all his own. While tricky to get used to at first, once you get the hang of him you may find yourself not going back to Shovel Knight once you've played around with Plague Knight and all his marvelous gadgets.While also having an altered version of the main campaign, the story of both knights is just as diverse as they are from each other. However I won't spoil anything of Plague Knight's story as that should be experienced on your own terms to get the full enjoyment of it. But while saying so, the story will come and suprise you and twist any previous relationships with this beaked villian of the Order of No Quarter.And do you want to know the best part about this DLC, aside from offering an alternate story and new character to play?... IT'S FREE! It all comes with the full game, so is it really considered DLC anymore? Well yes and no. Its more of an addition to the full game that came in a update to it rather than being side content that you would pay extra money for. But hey, thats a good thing! This means you get basically get a semi-prequel and you don't have to pay the extra money (even though I would of payed money for this sort of thing. C'mon Yacht Club just take our money already).And so, as was said before about the original, this is a instant classic among myself and others who have played it. If you haven't gotten the chance to buy it yet, I still recommend it to anybody! And I can't wait to write another review about the next upcoming DLC, Specter of Torment, featuring Specter Knight.

Warning it can be hard as nails and will induce some rage quitting.+Nice old school music+graphics+Varied environments+Good controls+Nice rpg upgrades+Solid platforming+Good boss battles+Some zelda like towns for upgrading/strategizing use of resources-gold-Having to restart an entire area if quit or leave.-Unsure if it has a difficulty level adjustment for younger players.-Too many instant deaths then repeating things inducing rage lol.Time for some gold digging. 8.5/10			"

												I just finished the game for the first time and I really enjoyed it. In total I died 137 times, and each time I take full responsibility for. I don't play this type of game very often but at no point did I feel like the game cheated me. I played the entirety of it with a DualShock 4 controller and it handled perfectly with the DS4Windows program. I purchased the soundtrack+game bundle because the soundtrack is really that good. Each zone has a great theme and the song for each is memorable, with ""Strike the Earth!"" being my favorite. Most of the bosses are interesting and challenging, I think I only one-shot one of them. The strategies to beat them aren't rocket science and defeating them is only a matter of execution. The final boss sequence is particularly rewarding and unique. The biggest surprise for me was the world of the game. There are genuinely funny moments and characters and by the end of the game you really feel for the main character. I highly recommend playing this if you like well-made platformers.			"

												Shovel Knight is basically what happens when you hear some guy explain what his perfect game is and he just says""It'll play like X but with elements from Y and Z and W and all the letters through the alphabet""it's just another dumb indie game that happens to good this time, only this time they got over the lazy graphic barrier most indie devs stop at and then went to the next level and copies everything from all the games that people enjoyed in the 80s without really coming up with anything original like those games went to do as they evolved.I don't want to play ducktalesvania-man, I've already played those to death, But still it's at least a step in the right direction for indie devs so for that I recommend it.

												Definitely one of the best love letters to retro games in recent memory. Doesn't use its pixel art as an excuse for laziness, has an excellent aesthetic and chiptune soundtrack, and in terms of gameplay feels most like a heavily refined DuckTales or Zelda 2. Biggest complaint I've heard is that it's not longer.			"

												(My Original Review) - October 2014This game... I just can't put into proper words to describe how great it is...For such a short game, it left a impact on me, and not just nostalgically.I've had so many great moments with this game that I can say right now it's a MUST play for sure! I'm happy to say, its now a new member to my family of top 10 favorite video games of all time. But enough about me and my experience with the game, after all its no fun listening to someone ramble on about it, but thats what Shovel Knight kinda does to you. I've become so attached to this gemstone of a game over the past year that I kinda find myself lost within' it on every new playthrough.With all the charm it put into it's characters, and all the effort, love and the sheer polish of its platforming. And the soundtrack, good lord, the soundtrack! It's pure bliss without the ignorance and it does it so effortlessly.Go play it and you'll see what I'm talking about. If you're a either a die-hard nostalgic platform lover, or a casual player of games, it deserves your attention.UPDATE: (Plague of Shadows DLC) - December 2016As this game continues to grow and show off more about the other knights and their stories, it still stands to prove it's mark on my words. Plague of Shadows is Yacht Club's love letter to the community that still continues to support them in anyway possible. THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE GOOD DLC PEOPLE! Having the choice to play as another knight aside from Shovel Knight, and playing a completely altered main-story campaign to the one you're used to, is in a level of its own of how much the developers care about their game and the people who play their game.Taking control of Plague Knight (the main protagonist of the Plague of Shadows DLC) is completely different from the way you play the cyan-ironclad digger himself. Taking place during the same time as Shovel Knight's quest (and even intertwining with each other), Plague Knight comes equipped with his own tools for alchemical anarchy and mayhem. Concoct and brew your own bombs with the many of different effects at your reach to dispose of your enemies in droves of pretty explosions. How he moves, attacks and even jumps is so unique as oppose to Shovel Knight hes literaly a different character all his own. While tricky to get used to at first, once you get the hang of him you may find yourself not going back to Shovel Knight once you've played around with Plague Knight and all his marvelous gadgets.While also having an altered version of the main campaign, the story of both knights is just as diverse as they are from each other. However I won't spoil anything of Plague Knight's story as that should be experienced on your own terms to get the full enjoyment of it. But while saying so, the story will come and suprise you and twist any previous relationships with this beaked villian of the Order of No Quarter.And do you want to know the best part about this DLC, aside from offering an alternate story and new character to play?... IT'S FREE! It all comes with the full game, so is it really considered DLC anymore? Well yes and no. Its more of an addition to the full game that came in a update to it rather than being side content that you would pay extra money for. But hey, thats a good thing! This means you get basically get a semi-prequel and you don't have to pay the extra money (even though I would of payed money for this sort of thing. C'mon Yacht Club just take our money already).And so, as was said before about the original, this is a instant classic among myself and others who have played it. If you haven't gotten the chance to buy it yet, I still recommend it to anybody! And I can't wait to write another review about the next upcoming DLC, Specter of Torment, featuring Specter Knight.

												Kickstarter gets a bad rap sometimes, and for good reason, but if the service creates more games like this, I will die defending it, because Shovel Knight is one of the finest platformers I have ever played. The market is flooded with mediocre retro-style indie platformers that do little more than pander to people's nostalgia for a quick buck, but Shovel Knight stands out as a game that truly feels like an 8-bit game, from the color palatte to the sound design to the two-button control scheme, and would stand tall as a classic even alongside 8-bit titans like Mega Man and Castlevania. Controls are tight and fluid, giving you perfect control and making the simple actions you perform fun in their own right, which is essential for a platformer. The level design in on par with the best of the NES era, teaching the player about it's mechanics without ever shoving it in their face, and offering some amazingly creative ideas and mechanics. The combat is very fun, with several oppurtunities to test your shoveling skills against enemies that take more than one hit to fell, allowing you to chain attacks together in a smooth and satisfying fashion. The boss battles in particular are fantastic, offering massive challenge and forcing you to think on your feet, since they have set attacks, but don't always do those attacks in the same order. They're the best bosses I've ever seen in a 2D platformer. Despite it's purposeful limitations, the game looks great, and the music is some of the best chiptune work I've ever heard. It even has a story, and a good one at that, with some great interactive storytelling and a genuinely touching ending. It's no masterpiece, but it's more than I'd expect from a game like this, especially when so many higher-budget games with more focus on story get it so wrong.What impresses me most about Shovel Knight, though, is how well it captures the true essenece of nostalgia. Most retro indie games' defintion of nostalgia is to say ""hey, remember game X? Wasn't game X great?"" which is misguided admiration at best and manipulative design at worst. Instead, Shovel Knight builds the elements that create nostalgia into the core of it's design, rather than merely reminding us of games that incited those same feelings. It does this through a combination of discovery and safety. Shovel Knight, while playing on familiar tropes, has many incredibly unique and surprising moments that play with our expectations to create something new, and even when they're not setting us up the level and mechanic design is so utterly inspired you just can't help but be in awe of it. However, there isn't too much new. The game is presented in a style familar to nearly everyone who plays games, and the simple traditions that underscore this discovery, like returning to the town to give music sheets to the bard and buy health upgrades, give the game a safe haven, a sense of security that prevents the influx of new mechanics from becoming overwhelming and threatening. Discovery and security are the things that made childhood great: being able to experience so many things for the first time, but always having a sense of security in the feeling that you would come inside and mom would cook you dinner at the end of the day. So in other words, Shovel Knight evokes emotions that reflect a positive view of childhood, and what word describes a positive view of the past? Nostalgia. People often use nostalgia as a negative, but they have to realize that for a game to invoke nostalgia, the memories of it have to be positive. The same techniques that make people remember games like Zelda so fondly are replicated perfectly in Shovel Knight, and that is no small feat.Admittedly, the game isn't perfect. The biggest problem is that it's a bit on the easy side. Checkpoints are frequent, magic items are too powerful, and magic refills are far too common. While this does suit the game's intent, which is more about having simple fun than massive challenges, it left me wanting more when I completed the quest. The New Game + mode does address these problems by increasing damage, removing health power-ups, and giving you less checkpoints, but it would have been nice if that was selectable from the start as hard difficulty. Additionally, there isn't nearly enough to spend your money on, and all the treasure you get from the pleathora of well-hidden secrets this game doesn't take long to become worthless. Finally, there's a bit too much knockback for my liking, as I fell into several pits simply by being knocked into them by an enemy. The overarching theme of this game seems to be to take the good bits of retro games and leave the bad stuff behind, so it's inclusion is perplexing and occasionally frustrating. There is an armor which reduces knockback, though, which I like. Also, the game is kind of short, though a short length suits this kind of game. Overall, though, these are just nitpicks. Shovel Knight is an amazingly fun. It's a spectacular experience that anyone who enjoys the classics of the NES era will love, and even if you don't, Shovel Knight may convince you that, despite their age, those old games still have a lot of merit, and the love people have for them shouldn't be dismissed as a rose-tinted view of the past and a resistance to change, but rather a celebration of everything those old games did so right that newer titles have forgotten.9/10P.S. If you want a true challenge out of Shovel Knight, the best way to do it is to try and speedrun the game. This game was made with speedrunning in mind, and it's increcdibly fun and accessible to try and see how fast you can blaze through the game. It's truly where the game comes into it's own, and the mastery of all the items and mechanics becomes neccesary and the brilliant design becomes apparent. It's something you have to experience, even if you're normally turned off by the idea of speedrunning.			"

												After playing the game for 2 hours or so, here are my thoughts:The developers behind this game ""get"" what makes a good 2D platform actually GOOD.+ Responsive controls+ Stages with diverse hazards in accordance to their theme+ Memorable boss fights+ Awesome musicOn top of this, they added:+ A checkpoint system that is both good for beginners and experts alike (for different reasons)+ Instead of having a finite amount of tries before you get kicked out of a long stage, you lose an amount of your wealth that is retrievable, if you can reach the screen where you died (think Dark Souls)+ Towns, vendors, minigames, sidequests, upgradable armor and special movesMy only ""problem"" so far is that with a system that offers you an infinite amount of retries and a very forgiving checkpoint system, they decided to add refillable potions that top up your health and mana to the max and some other stuff that are fairly OP (IMHO, always).But, given that the developers intended the game to be accessible to beginners and experts alike, the latter can freely choose not to use them (there are also achievements if you don't die at all, break all the checkpoints in the game, don't buy anything with money etc. so for people who crave to be challenged there are plentiful of ways to get their fix).There's also official word for free content released at a later date such as challenge mode, gender reverse mode, battle mode with the order of no quarter and 3 playable boss campaigns.tl;dr Just buy it already!

												Shovel Knight is a game brought to us by ex devs working at Wayforward games who want to bring back the nostalgic feels of the old NES/SNES days. But will they succeed or fail miserably ? We play as Shovel Knight. He and Shield Knight were the most heroic knights in the land but one day after Shield Knight dissapears Shovel Knight stops fighting evil. But one day an Evil witch named the enchantress takes over the land and its up to you to stop her Knights and herself before she destroys the land. So how is Shovel Knight ? This game is exceptional and without a doubt this is a game you need to have in youre steam library no matter what. The gameplay is mixed into diffrent things. You can use youre shovel to dig secret places so you can find gold which you can use to buy upgrades and magic relics. You can also use it like a pogo to jump on enemies in the vein of Ducktales the video game. The game also has very tight controls so whenever you die its youre fault entirely. The game also looks absolutly beutifull and its one of the best games on steam as of now. The game also has a very catchy soundtrack and its a delight to listen while you fight enemies and conquer bosses. Overall theres not too much bad to say about Shovel Knight. The game has a few minor bugs but thats pretty much it. The game is tough so expect a challenge. Overall Shovel Knight is an exceptional game which you simply need to own no matter what cause its that good. I give Shovel Knight a 10/10 ( Yeah Its that good)			"

												This is not your average shovel-ware retro indie game. (You heard me.) I bought it this evening and immediately put 3.5 hours into it simply because I couldn't put it down. I'm a huge fan of classic Mega Man, and this is on the same level except much less mash-heavy which is definitely a plus and with some RPG-elements added. Basically it's a classic melee/precision platformer with plenty of interesting and novel mechanics as well as loads of humor. Also checkpoints a-plenty throughout the levels which helps if you're impatient and/or maybe not too experienced with platformers. I wouldn't call it unforgiving --- not at all --- but it certainly expects you to actually put an effort into beating it. ('It' = the game. Yeah, I know what you were thinking.)The game rarely (if ever) kills you in cheap ways --- you're pretty much always the one to blame which is also why, if you're easily frustrated by challenging platforming, you'll probably want to skip this game. However, if you dig great platforming experiences, hilarious puns, and the sweet sweet taste of victory when killing bosses, then you'll love this.			"

												Many games claim to be a retro platformer but this one is probably the only one this year that got it right you will die alot but it has an equal amount of reward and fairnes and a good thing for me is i had a reason to collect gold because you actualy need it but in most games its just something for score whitch i dont care that much about but i give this game 9/10 just because of the lenght for 15 dollars its a little short i think it took me 6 hours straight to complete it it will depend on your skill level though but its awasome buy it now ya ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

												“Justice in spades!”	Such is the rallying cry of the brave warrior Shovel Knight, who adventures across the land to defeat the Enchantress, who has conquered this once-peaceful land.  I’ve been looking forward to Shovel Knight, and there has been a lot of hype about it, particularly surrounding its many delays.  However, the wait was well worth it, and Shovel Knight is the pixel-styled side-scrolling platformer of your dreams.	The gameplay is smooth and I haven’t once felt cheated when questing through the world, defeating rats on propellers and strange spiders that ooze purple projectiles.  The game is very easy to learn, although the further you get into a level the trickier things will become.   One important thing to note about this game is the choice of controller.  I’m sure many people are fearful that their controller, whatever it may be, won’t be appropriate for this game.  Don’t worry, I’ve been playing with an Xbox 360 controller with a USB connection, and everything is fine.  The controls don’t lag, or feel buggy.  Shovel Knight moves in the direction I hold, and he turns and stops just fine.  A retro controller such as a USB super Nintendo controller may give you a nicer feel, because you’ll only be using three buttons, but choice of controller shouldn’t be a major issue.	Shovel Knight is, as I mentioned before, a side-scrolling 2d platformer game.  It has all of your favorite elements- enemies flash and are knocked back with invincibility frames briefly when struck, as is Shovel Knight.  There is only one attack button, and one jump button.  Shovel Knight can also perform a downward shovel attack while jumping that is very important for reaching the game’s numerous hidden areas- you must use the limited supply of enemies or objects to bounce ever-higher, soaring distances that your jump button could never handle by itself.  There are also items, called Relics, that you can gather and use.  This is the first place where I felt that the game balance might be a wee bit off- the Phase Amulet.	Once the Phase Amulet is in your possession, you may never want to use another relic.  It activates with no delay, and makes you invulnerable but still able to attack for about 2 seconds.  My first thought when I saw this item was, ‘This is incredibly overpowered.’ You can push the button to dodge any attack, survive environmental hazards, and generally shrug off anything.  That said, as the game progressed a bit more, I found that I was still dying, being hit, and generally not being able to instantly win.  Mana is a restriction that doesn’t come into play very often with this item, but simply being able to use it in time or being able to foresee an enemy’s attack is.  After spending some more time with the Phase Amulet, I think that it fits in quite well, and I mostly use it to dodge some bosses’ more irritating attacks.	The music in this game is top-notch, and every level will afford you a chance to find the Bard’s missing musical notes, enabling you to listen to whatever area’s theme you wish should you collect it.  My particular favorite so far is the theme from Pridemoor Keep, where you face King Knight, a jumpy golden ponce who attacks you with confetti and solid-gold armor.	My overall impression of Shovel Knight is joyous glee.  I haven’t enjoyed playing a game this much in quite a long time, and it’s really made an impression on me.  I would absolutely recommend this to any fan of the genre- keep in mind that this is a new game designed to look and feel like an old game, and it succeeds at that in spades. "

												This game is terrifically fun. For someone growing up playing platformers, this is a retro gamer's dream come true. Great development, challenging, great soundtrack, memorable characters, and simple controls. Shovel Knight does all the right things all the right ways.Also, the developers are adding more ways to play the game at no extra cost to the purchaser. So when you finish all there is to do, the developer could drop an update that allows you to play the whole game as another character and you receive all that no strings attached.Solid purchase. Would make a great gift to anyone new or old to gaming.10/10			"

It takes everything that was learned from those eras and makes the best game it can out of it. Its a mostly lighthearted game light on story as well but the minimal characterization and plot is still very effective. Its like coming home again and finding that home is how you remember it in your fondest recollections. Its like you're having a sleepover with your buddies eating pizza and washing it down with wine playing games all night and somehow its not weird that you're 40.

												You need this game. Shovel Knight is the perfect game with no flaws. It takes all the greatest features from classic games such as Castlevania, Mega Man, Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link, Super Mario Bros. 3, and DuckTales all combined into one. The game is tough but never too hard. It's challenging but forgiving. The game always rewards you after every challenge that crosses you path. Also we must not forget about the soundtrack. Jake Kaufman accels in all audio departments and makes this soundtrack timeless. Yacht Club Games is still adding more to this game makeing it more enjoyable than it already is and with the amount of content that is already in the game, you'll never want to put the controller down. I don't know a single person that hates this game and you owe it to yourself to play it. Buy it, For Shovelry. You won't regret it.			"

												Shovel Knight is a tough but fair retro style action platformer that mixes the 8-bit style of Mega Man and Ducktales but utilizes modern game design and processing power. It'll kick your butt a few times and test your skill. It cleverly uses a D-pad and 4 button control scheme, so you can use a USB adapter for an NES controller, and the game is a very rewarding experience that way. I don't know of anything on Steam that does this. Also, the music is another great job by Virt, Lich Yard and The Lost City themes being favorites, and the humor is top notch. Recommended if you're old enough to remember the Clinton administration.			"

												My first time playing through took my 6.5 hours, and apparently I had an 86% ""item completion"" despite my having all relics, armor, and shovel upgrades.  Despite that bit of weirdness, I had a very enjoyable time with Shovel Knight.  The story is cutesy, and gets a bit weird at the end.  Controls are great.  Hitboxes are a little too wide, but once you get the hang of it you learn to be okay with it.  Shovel Knight does EVERYTHING it sets out to do, and does it really well. Music is fantastic, graphics are engaging, mechanics (jump/slash/bounce) feel really good and responsive.I would recommend to anyone playing on a controller to set the relic use to the Right Bumper, though.  I realize why the default is set to X+Up, to accommodate the NES theme of 2-buttons-&-a-D-Pad, but it just doesn't work.Anyhow, I am done rambling.  This game is very easily worth the $15 just for the regular campaign.  New Game + and speed-running give it a ton more value.Enjoy!			"

												You don't have to dig too deep to know that Shovel Knight is one gem worth buying.  The difficulty climbs at a steady pace; you don't have to shovel down too much at once.  Some games bury you in tutorials wereas Shovel Knight's gameplay teaches you as you go.  Music is the next item I'll unearth- 'Strike the Earth' was absolutely ground breaking for me.  If you're looking for a great soundtrack, Shovel Knight's got it in spades.  ♠♠♠Don't wait til it's dirt cheap- support the devs!  There's no doubt you'll dig it for knights to come.  10/10			"

												Now that I've finished the game, I can give it a full review.Shovel Knight is that perfect kind of homage to the games you played on the NES. There's a little DuckTales, a little Megaman, a little Zelda II, and even a little Mario 3. Heck, there's even a little bit of Dark Souls thrown in for good measure. The one thing I do want to immediately draw attention to is the level design. I can sum it up in just one word, ""perfection"". For the first time in a long time, I found myself learning the game's mechanics without the aid of a tutorial level, and considering the number of games out there that hold your hand through 75% of the game? I find it very refreshing.I love the music, and considering the composer worked on Contra 4 and Double Dragon Neon, I'm not surprised that it is some of the best. Add in some compositions from a classic Megaman composer, and you have yourself a soundtrack made of pure gold.In lieu of lives, death takes away some of your gold. You have one life to get that gold back or it is gone forever. This mechanic is very much like dying in Dark Souls, where your souls are taken away and you have one life to get them back.I felt tthat the game's length was just enough. I'm really looking forward to the additional modes coming in free updates later this year, but for now, I have enough to keep me busy. I feel like the 14.99 price tag is worth it overall.I have enjoyed my time with Shovel Knight, and I can honestly say, that it never was unfair. Any deaths were because of my own mistakes.For a first game, Yacht Club Games really knocked it out of the park. I hope to see a sequel someday, but I couldn't be happier to just have this game in my steam library. Proud to be a backer!I dig it!			"

												I’d recommend getting shovel knight, I think it’s well worth the 15 dollars as of now. Not to mention the possible sales in the future.The normal campaign (If you are not going to collect everything) is gonna take you about 4—6.5 hours. If you want to go for a high-score, or a collect-a-thon 100% that’d probably take you about 8+. There’s also new game+, and tons of secrets to find.Game play’s solid, and is a mix of Duck Tales and Mega Man, but slightly faster-paced.The pixel art is great, with a nice amount of detail put into it.And the music is eargasming amazing!

The graphics are spot on to bring back great memories of playing as a kid, the music is so good I wish I could get the soundtrack. This whole game is just full of nostalgia, from Megaman, Castlevania, Duck Tales, and many other great old games. But it is its own game, it only takes elements from those games to enhance the experience. Again if you are a gamer that has been playing for a while and want to get back to your roots, BUY THIS GAME!!			"

The gameplay is a lot like Super Mario meets Mega Man, with an original and enjoyable soundtrack, a healthy dose of comedy and a whole lot of action, this game will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a bit of a challenge, and you'll probably die quite a bit but it's a great reminder that games don't need to be easy to be fun.

												This title is fully dedicated to being a nostalgia-fest, while bringing new flair and finesse to the platformer genre.  A love-child to gaming of generations' past, taking a mishmash of elements from the tried and true classics to some more obscure titles. Elements range from Mario 3 to Duck Tales to Mega Man and Castlevania. A stellar soundtrack, striking visuals, an overall good feel. The controls are fluid, and the level design is challenging without being unfair, leading to most deaths being a result of poor player judgement. tl;dr I dig it.			"

The graphics are great, the gameplay is tight/fun, and the music....the chiptune soundtrack is out of this world! As soon as I started playing I had to pause it and find the official soundtrack to ""buy"" (pay what you want) from Jake Kaufman's BandCamp page.If you are a fan of the old NES games I referenced above, this is a MUST BUY!I do hope to see more games coming from Yacht Club Games in the future.

I'm really looking forward to the additional modes coming in free updates later this year, but for now, I have enough to keep me busy. I feel like the 14.99 price tag is worth it overall.I have enjoyed my time with Shovel Knight, and I can honestly say, that it never was unfair. Any deaths were because of my own mistakes.For a first game, Yacht Club Games really knocked it out of the park. I hope to see a sequel someday, but I couldn't be happier to just have this game in my steam library. Proud to be a backer!I dig it!			"

												Stunning game with high nostalgia presence. I love my next gen content but a game like this really makes you appreciate the past. What a winner! If you don't invest in this game you are doing yourself a great injustice. On top of everything, this game a great replay value. Sadly that is something gamers rarely get to have nowadays.			"

												I never write reviews on games, but I have to for this. If you ever owned a NES or played any of the classics, YOU MUST GET THIS GAME!!! The graphics are spot on to bring back great memories of playing as a kid, the music is so good I wish I could get the soundtrack. This whole game is just full of nostalgia, from Megaman, Castlevania, Duck Tales, and many other great old games. But it is its own game, it only takes elements from those games to enhance the experience. Again if you are a gamer that has been playing for a while and want to get back to your roots, BUY THIS GAME!!			"

												100% for this game. For all of you out there that loved gaming in the days of ninja gaiden, Zelda 2, Mario 3, and DuckTales you honestly cannot go wrong with this game. KickStarting money to this project has turned into the single greatest donation I have made on the Website. Hours of gameplay, Secrets out the wazoo, Music that never grows old, innovative stage design, and bosses that are the pinicle of what action platformers represent...I honestly cannot say enough good things about this game. Do yourself a service and pick it up. Currently it costs $15, but I am not exhagerating by saying i would have gladly paid double that, which tecnically I am because I will also be picking up the 3ds and Wii U versions. This game has earned a place of honor in my Library, one i see myself visiting many times for years to come.			"

												Shovel Knight is one of the best games ever made, period.What makes Shovel Knight so good?1. Music: The music in this game is absolutly stunning. Jake Kaufman did a amazing job on this sound track like his other works in games such as Shantea and Mighty Switch Force. Also Manami Matsumae, who made a lot of classic Mega Man music, made a few tracks in this game. Even if you dont like the game, it is near impossible not to love the soundtrack. 2. Level Design: Even in my favorite games, there is always a part or two that always make me wonder ""Why was this made?"" Luckily Shovel Knight does not suffer from this at all. Every part in this game is very well made and does not feel cheap at all. Whether you make a jump or not is all up to your skill. A few parts such as Propeller Knights stage provide the most challenge in this aspect. Those damn fans XD 3. Boss: Rarely do you see a game where every boss is heart pounding and unique. Shovel Knight again somehow preforms this very well. The Order of No Quarter, the 8 villians in the game, all have a different aspect and provide the player a challenge. Whether its the robot mech of Tinker Knight, or the phycotic fight against Plague Knight, no game has ever made boss battles so fun4. Basic Elements: Shovel Knight as often noted, takes insperation from many NES classics such as Ducktales, Castlevania and Mega Man. Some of these things are Shovel Knights down spike ability, which alows him to bounce of enemy without taking damage, and the side weapons. All in all every aspect of this game is near perfect. I dont care whether it is on sale on not, but this game is a MUST PLAYShovel Knight recieves a 10/10			"

												I would like to get some things clear before i give the game my recommendation:- So many pitfalls near the end of the game. (2 of the knights use spikes or pitfalls to kill you with, personally very cheap way of killing you).- Not very challenging considering you have infinite lives (you just lose money, and there are not enough upgrades or enough costly ones to make it painful enough). However the checkpoint system they use is rather interesting and can add a layer of challenge that the game kinda lacks.- Some of the relics in the game are overpowered compared to the others (Phase locket can be spammed for invunability and the propeller dagger can rip most bosses apart in seconds)Despite what i said before, shovel knight is a very solid game with so much charm that you will need a shovel to dig though.

												This beautifully crafted game features:-Tight controls: my character moves exactly where I wish him to go. He does not slip and slide around.-Unique and challenging bosses: This is the element of this game that really REALLY makes me think of old-school gaming. Each boss has a patterned move-set that you must learn to advance. Each boss has a few moments of vulnerability, allowing you to strike out if you're quick enough. Once you defeat them, you will feel that sense of accomplishment (a la Dark Souls, and other old school games).-Challenging enemies: they're all different. Challenging, but not impossible to blast through once you learn their techniques.-Challenging platforming: from large gaps, to bouncing off of enemies to reach high ledges, to very narrow landing spots... this game has all of the platforming you could ask for (and more, which I will not spoil). -Fun music, old-school style midi/""8 bit"" music. It was a pleasure to my ears as a child and certainly fits this game's atmosphere.-RPG-lite elements. Upgrade your health and magic, acquire new spells, acquire money and buy everything!-Rewarding and challenging exploration: Need I say more? If you want to explore off of the main path to the boss, you will be  put to the test. However, you will also be rewarded!-Difficult but forgiving gameplay: There are checkpoints.

												Shovel Knight is what an SNES-style platform game would look like if it came out in 2014. It's unbelievably more retro than most retro-style games, including Cave Story.

												Shovel knight came out today, and I could honestly say that I was really excited. I wanted to be challenged by something that was brutal, but more importantly fair. Shovel knight is based off of the early NES games like Zelda 2, Super Mario Brothers 3, Megaman, and lots of other games. Unfortunately, the game does not live up to the “Brutal but Fair”. There are moments in the game where I died due to something that was not in my hands. There were moments where the game throws some serious bull♥♥♥♥♥♥at you. Another thing that also pisses me off is the spikes. Sure it makes sense that I would die instantaneously if so much as a pixel on my body touched some lava, but dying instantly by lightly grazing a spike is a whole new story. Plus, combine this with the relatively poor variety in enemies; you have a recipe for a relatively average experience. And deep down that’s what Shovel Knight really boils down to.  Shovel Knight seems to snap out of the matrix though when we reach the boss battles. The greatest thing about the boss battles is that you literally have to “TRY”. There’s no lollygagging’ when you’re here. The boss fights are a true challenge, and every failure is caused because you made a mistake, not because of a cheap spike cop-out for lazy programming. Because I died very so often in the later stages it was really lovely to see a checkpoint system in this game. It works incredibly well, and it’s good to see that they chose this rather than a lives system where you have to start the stage over. Instead, your punishment is similar to dark souls, where you lose your in-game currency when you die. Like dark souls, you can go back and pick the loot back up after you die. Speaking of dark souls, this is probably the one game that gets the closest to being as fair as dark souls. You see, this game did what Dark Souls 2 did not. It brought clever level design, great boss battles, and some relatively fair gameplay along with an incredible soundtrack as well as a great over world and an amazingly simple but charming story. I would probably give this game a 7/10 if the boss battles weren’t so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but because of the boss battles, the diversity in stages, and awesome music and story, I give Shovel Knight an 8/10. You see there are games that try all too hard to be like other games, we saw this with Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and that game did not do it right at all. However, Shovel Knight may be something we’ve seen many times all those years ago, but deep down Shovel Knight knew what it wanted to be. Shovel Knight is a homage to old school retro gaming. The game is definitely worth your attention. Watch some gameplay videos on it; I’m sure most of you will find yourself buying the game.			"

												Anyone who can appreciate 2D platforming games should play this; it nails every single aspect of its design.- Every gameplay mechanic is taught actively and without exposition, in a subtle but smart way. You don't have to read anything, you'll learn everything you need to know just by playing. Every single room in the game is engaging without being cheap.- The soundtrack manages to be BOTH atmospheric and memorable, with songs that both fit the theme of the level and feature catchy melodies - every single one. No game has done this so consistently before in my experience.- Every boss and NPC has a unique design. The color palette is bright and vibrant but not sore on the eyes. Each villager feels like a real person. The bosses are fun to fight against; they overwhelm you at first but you pick up on their patterns and beat them in a satisfying way.- It uses the Souls series death system: you lose money if you die unless you can make it back to the spot where you died on your next try. In my opinion more games should implement this as it's a great balance between punishing failure and rewarding consistency.- It doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a short and satisfying game you can complete in a weekend.If you read my entire post then do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												Excellent experience. It is a bit short but you can adjust the difficulty yourself based on what items you use. The achievement challenges vary from very easy to things like beating the game with no relics, not dieing once, or beating the game without using any checkpoints.Positive: Gameplay is solid and nestalgic, Music is top notch chiptune style, Decent humor spread throughout the story, New Game+ offers more challenging gameplay, Boss fights are well thought out and each feels unique.Negative: Some relics are too powerful for their cost particularly the invulnerability relic, Campaign length is a bit on the short side clocking in at ~5 hours if you are very familiar with 2D platformers, Weapon and Armor upgrades seem to be negligable.Overall: 8.5/10Bug: I also should note that I found a small bug in the game. If your monitor is set above a 60hz refresh rate and you turn on the game's VSync setting the game's speed adjusts accordingly. This may be a G-Sync specific problem but it seems fairly unlikely. My GPU is an Nvidia GTX 680 on the latest beta drivers using the Asus G248QE with the G-Sync module installed.			"

												Playing this game at PAX was one of the best experiances I've ever had. Talking with the devs about the game while I play it. The second I layed my hands on that controller was the moment I realized I need to get this game.Yacht Club Games nailed it with Shovel Knight, taking elements of tons of different NES classics.The controls are smooth, the story is awesome and nostalgiac, and the combat (though sparking rage at times) is rewarding and a joy!Each map is thought out perfectly and holds some of the best game design mechanics I've seen since 1001 Spikes and Braid. They're also jam-packed with secrets, so keep an eye out when playing to get some loot!The power ups not only look awesome but are very powerful when used right!The soundtack by VIRT and the amazing 8-16 bit style graphics not only bring some nostalgia to mind, but also makes everything come togetherShovel Knight digs it's way into my heart! 10/10Note that next gen controllers feel MUCH better than 360 or PS3 controllers.

												TL;DR - Love the game. If you like platformers and shovels, go buy.I've only played for 36 minutes at the time of this review, but from the 5 minute mark I was already in love with the game.Can I just say how beautiful the world is? The pixel style is so retro, and it reminds me of Super Mario World on the SNES. I've never played Super Mario World, but I have seen it's graphics and in my opinion Shovel Knight's are similar. It even has this cute little opening story about Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, which is honestly just adorable. The gameplay reminds me of Mario games, as I've played Mario ever since I was about 7. ( That's almost 6 years. ) It's a platformer game. I especially enjoy the ability to use the shovel to jump on enemies heads and bounce, or on bubbles to let you get to different areas in the game. Besides that, I love the shovel in general. I don't think I've seen any other game that uses a shovel as the main protagonist weapon... Ever.. Swords, bows, guns, magic... And now shovels! I can definitively say I've always been a platformer game perfectionist, which this game encourages. It has secret passageways  that you can get to with your shovel, to play games and get songs and earn achievements. Trust me, I'm aiming to get all the gold in the world by the end of this. I WILL LEAVE NO PILE UN-DUG!This game is already adorable, and I bet it just gets better later.			"

This game is incredibly well made in everything from art assets to sheer gameplay. Add in a massive amount of upgrades and fun little items that you can use and you have yourself a recipe for something that new games sometimes lack, Sheer unadultered fun!Nostalgia aside and taking the rose-tinted glasses off and just looking at this for what it is I can tell you, not promise, but tell you that should you decide to buy this game you'll be in for a good solid couple hours of well thought through level design, Good characters, Amazing gameplay and a game that'll leave you wanting more.I would definitely recommend this to anyone and loved every minute of it.

This game is the most satisfying experience I've had with a game all year.  The gameplay is flawless, the soundtrack is amazing, the secrets are infinite, and the homage to old-school games is omnipresent.  I cannot recommend this game highly enough.  If you don't pick it up on sale in the next 12 hours, you are missing out on saving $5 which you will inevitably fork over later.  Game of the year.  Hands down.  Buy it now.  Un-F'n-Real!			"

												The game takes some of the best elements from various old NES classics such as Mega Man and Ducktales and introduce them to the advances of the 21st century. The developers managed to create a gorgeous pixel aesthetic with lovable characters, while also offering challenging gameplay with tight controls. Everything just fits together perfectly. An instant classic.			"

												In my opinion Shovel Knight is a very good game, It looks, feels, and plays like old school Megaman, Kid Icarus, Mario, and Metroid games but has just enough difficulty to it to make it a fun challenge. I recommend this to any fan of platformer games. I rate 11/10			"

												I have found that Shovel Knight can aspire to be a 2D Dark Souls. It contains such mechanics as losing a form of currency as you die, and also a nice amount of gamplay. As well as he fact that there is a NG+ once you beat it for the first time. The game is a fun, happy, and charming feel to it. All in all I give it a 10/10 rating. Thank you Yacht Club Games for this great game and I hope for your future games have the same genuine feel to them like Shovel Knight did.			"

You could say it's a little bit like Mario (nes/snes) and Mega Man (nes/snes)but it's original and feels well made. The protaganist Shovel Knight feels awesome and heroic to play as and I would really enjoy more Shovle Knight games!			"

												Shovel Knight is one of the best games ever made, period.What makes Shovel Knight so good?1. Music: The music in this game is absolutly stunning. Jake Kaufman did a amazing job on this sound track like his other works in games such as Shantea and Mighty Switch Force. Also Manami Matsumae, who made a lot of classic Mega Man music, made a few tracks in this game. Even if you dont like the game, it is near impossible not to love the soundtrack. 2. Level Design: Even in my favorite games, there is always a part or two that always make me wonder ""Why was this made?"" Luckily Shovel Knight does not suffer from this at all. Every part in this game is very well made and does not feel cheap at all. Whether you make a jump or not is all up to your skill. A few parts such as Propeller Knights stage provide the most challenge in this aspect. Those damn fans XD 3. Boss: Rarely do you see a game where every boss is heart pounding and unique. Shovel Knight again somehow preforms this very well. The Order of No Quarter, the 8 villians in the game, all have a different aspect and provide the player a challenge. Whether its the robot mech of Tinker Knight, or the phycotic fight against Plague Knight, no game has ever made boss battles so fun4. Basic Elements: Shovel Knight as often noted, takes insperation from many NES classics such as Ducktales, Castlevania and Mega Man. Some of these things are Shovel Knights down spike ability, which alows him to bounce of enemy without taking damage, and the side weapons. All in all every aspect of this game is near perfect. I dont care whether it is on sale on not, but this game is a MUST PLAYShovel Knight recieves a 10/10			"

												This title is fully dedicated to being a nostalgia-fest, while bringing new flair and finesse to the platformer genre.  A love-child to gaming of generations' past, taking a mishmash of elements from the tried and true classics to some more obscure titles. Elements range from Mario 3 to Duck Tales to Mega Man and Castlevania. A stellar soundtrack, striking visuals, an overall good feel. The controls are fluid, and the level design is challenging without being unfair, leading to most deaths being a result of poor player judgement. tl;dr I dig it.			"

A good fix would have been to allow mouse buttons for attacks.			"

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												Finally a retro-style platformer that doesn't make difficulty a selling point! It's almost like someone stopped and said, ""Wait, what if instead of making this outlandishly frustrating, we made it fun instead?"" This is super addicting, and has a very high replay value.			"

												Whenever you're feeling inundated by the ocean of mediocre indie games, you can look to Shovel Knight as a shining example of a fun, superbly-made game by fantastic developers.Shovel Knight takes the absolute best parts of the 8-bit gaming age (and amazingly, none of the bad) and combines them seamlessly together.

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												Shovel Knight is one of the best games ever made, period.What makes Shovel Knight so good?1. Music: The music in this game is absolutly stunning. Jake Kaufman did a amazing job on this sound track like his other works in games such as Shantea and Mighty Switch Force. Also Manami Matsumae, who made a lot of classic Mega Man music, made a few tracks in this game. Even if you dont like the game, it is near impossible not to love the soundtrack. 2. Level Design: Even in my favorite games, there is always a part or two that always make me wonder ""Why was this made?"" Luckily Shovel Knight does not suffer from this at all. Every part in this game is very well made and does not feel cheap at all. Whether you make a jump or not is all up to your skill. A few parts such as Propeller Knights stage provide the most challenge in this aspect. Those damn fans XD 3. Boss: Rarely do you see a game where every boss is heart pounding and unique. Shovel Knight again somehow preforms this very well. The Order of No Quarter, the 8 villians in the game, all have a different aspect and provide the player a challenge. Whether its the robot mech of Tinker Knight, or the phycotic fight against Plague Knight, no game has ever made boss battles so fun4. Basic Elements: Shovel Knight as often noted, takes insperation from many NES classics such as Ducktales, Castlevania and Mega Man. Some of these things are Shovel Knights down spike ability, which alows him to bounce of enemy without taking damage, and the side weapons. All in all every aspect of this game is near perfect. I dont care whether it is on sale on not, but this game is a MUST PLAYShovel Knight recieves a 10/10			"

												In my opinion, I think this game is perfect in terms of gameplay, I see nothing wrong in it. It reminds me of NES games that I love, it contains elements from retro games like soundtrack and gameplay wise it can be kinda difficult at times like the Plague Knight fight or Game+ also knockback. The cool items/upgrades also add up to the game I dont find them all useful  but they are still nice to have. Plotwise its not something I would pay attention to since other games have used it I wont spoil it.			"

												Shovel Knight's the kind of game that would invite you to it's birthday party, then give everyone else a present.Shovel Knight's the kind of game that borrows five buck from you, then pays you back with interest before you have to ask for it back. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that has the hots for your sister, but asks if you're cool with it before he makes a move. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that creates a totally fun an interesting protagonist, but also has fun and interesting antagonists. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that were you both dying in a desert, would give you the last sip of canteen water.Shovel Knight's the kind of game that knows how to be challenging enough that you never lose interest, without ever getting so hard as to make you want to quit. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that when it drinks the last cup of coffee in the office, always remembers to brew another pot. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that hands out a few achievements for general progress, but reserves most of them behind actually difficult to achieve challenges. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that helps you with your math homework. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that apes classic late- 1980's NES game mechanics and structures to a T, while excising all the stuff that was annoying from them. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that will listen to your differing political views, but will still repect you and maintain your friendship because that's more important. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that calls back after the date. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that wakes you up with fresh coffee and scrambled eggs the morning after. Shovel Knight's the kind of game you should buy.			"

It is strange when you pay $60 for a game and get 4-6 hours out of it, when you can get a fantastic indie title that'll give you 20 hours for $15. I seriously reccomend this game. Get it. Now.

												The best way to describe Shovel Knight is it’s a cross been a good Mega Man style platformer with a Dark Souls death system twist.   It feels just like if you gave the Blue Bomber a shovel instead of a blaster, but kept nearly all the other mechanics and level design intact.  You gain currency by progressing through the levels, defeating enemies and finding secrets.  This is used to provide   upgrades, more health, and usable items similar of that you get from Robot Masters in Mega Man.  When you die, you lose a portion of your money in which you can get back if you can return to the same spot and recollect what was lost.  What is already in this game is well worth the asking price, and they plan to add more free characters and modes to an already great value.   If you like Mega Man games or even this style of 2d platformer, you need to give this game a shot!  I almost guarantee you won’t regret it!			"

												I am sure people have made all of the shovel/dig puns so I won't even dig up that corpse. Shovel Knight is a fun yet challenging game that will suck you into a nostalgia filled daydream of the SNES days. Shovel Knight will not only test your timing, jumping or shovel skills but also your patience and your ability to think critically while still enjoying a fun story with some dark undertones. Buy this game if you love playing difficult platformers or if you just love fun in general. What's great about the game, and Yacht Club Games is that the devs are still planning on releasing more updates to expand and improve the game so you can play as different knights. I will add that the badges for Shovel Knight look ugly to me, so I will be keeping my level one badge. I really dig this game. Yeah, I made that pun, and I don't care if you hate me for it.			"

												If you're a fan of games that are ""nostaligic"" and all that wishy-washy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then Shovel Knight is for you, I suppose?It's got a nice soundtrack, while most other games are meh at best in terms of sound.The boss fights are un-creative, but good nonetheless.The whole concept of ""Hurr, we're a quirky retro style indie platformer, durr"", slightly grates on my nerves.I'm slightly sick of quirky and unfunny indie titles.But sure, it was a good timewaster, and I recommend it for whenever you're having a slow facebook chat.

												Shovel Knight's the kind of game that would invite you to it's birthday party, then give everyone else a present.Shovel Knight's the kind of game that borrows five buck from you, then pays you back with interest before you have to ask for it back. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that has the hots for your sister, but asks if you're cool with it before he makes a move. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that creates a totally fun an interesting protagonist, but also has fun and interesting antagonists. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that were you both dying in a desert, would give you the last sip of canteen water.Shovel Knight's the kind of game that knows how to be challenging enough that you never lose interest, without ever getting so hard as to make you want to quit. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that when it drinks the last cup of coffee in the office, always remembers to brew another pot. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that hands out a few achievements for general progress, but reserves most of them behind actually difficult to achieve challenges. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that helps you with your math homework. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that apes classic late- 1980's NES game mechanics and structures to a T, while excising all the stuff that was annoying from them. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that will listen to your differing political views, but will still repect you and maintain your friendship because that's more important. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that calls back after the date. Shovel Knight's the kind of game that wakes you up with fresh coffee and scrambled eggs the morning after. Shovel Knight's the kind of game you should buy.			"

												I wouldn't mind saying the pro's and con's of Shovel Knight but the only thing I rather say is if anyone who played the old school platformers will have a great time enjoying Shovel Knight. It has some parts from the original Mega Man and Ducktales. Taking a few things from it to bring out a pretty good game such a Shovel Knight is definitely worth checking out. Such as the music. From the title screen to the end game screen had some memorable music pieces. Even some tracks needs a little time to get a few plays before judging and considering to be a memorable track. As of what I know overall the music is great. The mechanics and controls are great as well including the story. From me it was something of what old school gaming once had and that is a good or bad story. If it doesn't catch your attention for its story, music, or its sense of nostalgia then maybe it should be worth checking out when the weekend rolls on by for a short gaming session.			"

												Before you all downvote this reveiw I wanna say that I had fun witjh the game. I loved the Shovel Knight's campaign, but the controls for Specter Knight are horrible. The wall climb is weird because you start walking up the wall by just pushing against it. This makes it supper easy to be jumping onto a platform, get caught on a wall, and wall jump into a pit.  Also the jumping attack targets enemies which works when one enemy is on the screen, but when you have multiple enemies you fly all over the place and you feel like you have no control of what happens. I got used to the attacked but the wall climb killed me all the time. Please fix the wall climb.			"

												The best way to describe Shovel Knight is it’s a cross been a good Mega Man style platformer with a Dark Souls death system twist.   It feels just like if you gave the Blue Bomber a shovel instead of a blaster, but kept nearly all the other mechanics and level design intact.  You gain currency by progressing through the levels, defeating enemies and finding secrets.  This is used to provide   upgrades, more health, and usable items similar of that you get from Robot Masters in Mega Man.  When you die, you lose a portion of your money in which you can get back if you can return to the same spot and recollect what was lost.  What is already in this game is well worth the asking price, and they plan to add more free characters and modes to an already great value.   If you like Mega Man games or even this style of 2d platformer, you need to give this game a shot!  I almost guarantee you won’t regret it!			"

												Before you all downvote this reveiw I wanna say that I had fun witjh the game. I loved the Shovel Knight's campaign, but the controls for Specter Knight are horrible. The wall climb is weird because you start walking up the wall by just pushing against it. This makes it supper easy to be jumping onto a platform, get caught on a wall, and wall jump into a pit.  Also the jumping attack targets enemies which works when one enemy is on the screen, but when you have multiple enemies you fly all over the place and you feel like you have no control of what happens. I got used to the attacked but the wall climb killed me all the time. Please fix the wall climb.			"

												This game was amazing, just utterly amazing. I spent so much time playing and replaying this game. (Note: I started the game on PC but finished it on 3DS) There are so many great things about this game which I will name later. Most of this game was very memorable and enjoyable and I reccomend that everybody should play this game... but... WARNING: IF YOU DON'T LIKE DIFFICULT GAMES THAN JUST LEAVE!Pros-Amazing music-Fun levels-Creative bosses-Fun items to collect-Amazing Humor-Great controls -Most of the difficulty wasn't from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tCons-Controls are much easier on systems like the 3DS, Xbox, and Playstation-Some of the difficulty is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (For example: There are these enemies called Hover Meanies which are extremely annoying. They fly around and blow air that pushes you into insta-kill zones like spikes, lava, or pits. They're really annoying because most of the time, you have to memorize where they are or else they'll just come out of nowhere and suddenly you're dead)-Boss battles are pretty simple-In the Challenge Mode, you need the Phase Locket to beat it. (Phase Locket is a magical item that renders you temporarily invincible) I mean, you don't need it but it's like Borderlands 2 Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode and slag. The game is to difficult without it.-The Challenge Mode is the wrong type of challenging. (When I went into Challenge Mode, I expected something like slightly different level design, smarter AI, etc. but the challenge mode only makes it where you get no health restore stuff except for the rare carrot which only restores 2 health, and all damage done to you is doubled) -Most of the bosses were pretty easy (Except for the Specter Knight, The Enchantress, The Remnant of Fate) like literally all you have to do is bounce on them with the downward shovel attack.-The final boss (The Enchantress+Remnant of Fate) were more frustrating than memorable or fun. The Enchantress battle would be decent if it weren't for this insta-kill move where it would push you into the pit. The whole boss battle you fight on breakable blocks and she will fire a series of orbs that will break the blocks, sometimes she would fire them from above you and you couldn't jump out of it and you would just fall into the pit, and the Remnant of Fate just made it added this mechanic where (SPOILER DON'T READ PAST THIS) the Shield Knight would jump up and you had to bounce off of her Shield to hit the Remnant of Fate, which if you did it 1 millisecond early, wouldn't work, and it was often hard to get to Shield Knight because of the Remnant of Fates remaining orbs. Also she did a crap-ton of damage if you got hit once. "

Also, if you beat Shovel Knight, you get Plague Knight's campaign (Plague of Shadows) for free! And soon, they will be making a Specter Knight campaign and a King Knight campaingn.

Product received for free
												THIS GAME IS GREAT, if a little stressful at times. The music is amazing and the art style gives the feel of playing an old game.Money is a huge problem with my playthrough. Every time you die, a portion of your money is left where you died, so you have to go back to that spot, which may be very hard, get it, at which point youll have to not make the same mistake and move on. Sometimes the money is left at spots right above something that kills you, so you cant get it, or the money might just dissapear completely.The platforming is fun, and its satisfying when you find a hidden spot full of money.The bosses werent ridiculously hard, but it wont take you the first try to take them down.After completing the story with shovel knight, the challenge mode is unlocked (which i didnt find that fun) and the plague knight story was unlocked. Its almost exactly like the playthrough with shovel knight, just with a different story and different styles of fighting. The levels are the same, just with some more coins that plague knight needs to collect so, i wont be bothered with finishing this part.To conclude, i absolutely recommend this game. You will have a blast (for most the time, atleast).			"

												A perfect throwback to the days of the classicsI just want to get out there that this game takes elements from mega man, duck tales, and super mario bros 3.  adds in some original stuff, bundles it together, and the product is shovel knight, the best indie game i've played in a long time.  The game was created by yacht club games, a group of former wayforward employees. Never heard of them? neither have I. I mean, they're an indie developer. let's get into the review.Story: Prior to the game, adventurers Shovel Knight and Shield Knight journeyed across the world alongside one another, but while exploring the Tower of Fate, a cursed amulet takes over Shield Knight and leaves Shovel Knight outside of the sealed tower. Grieving for his beloved, Shovel Knight gives up adventuring and goes into self-imposed exile. During his absence, the Enchantress rises to power, spreading evil across the land. Upon hearing that the Enchantress has unsealed the Tower of Fate, Shovel Knight begins his journey back to it, hoping to find and rescue Shield Knight. In order to do so, Shovel Knight must fight the members of ""The Order of No Quarter,"" who have been dispatched by the Enchantress to impede him. Now, it's not directly stated in the game, but just about anyone can infer that shovel knight and shield knight really shared something special. i give the story a 5/5. A little simple, but it's entertaining enough. (& no spoilers for the ending.)gameplay- shovel knight allows you to control the blue bombe- i mean shoveler through a variety of hubs and stages scattered throught the order of no quarter. Each stage you complte hhas you face off against a knight of the order of no quarter. the eight knights are- king knight, specter knight, treasure knight, plague knight(who could forget his bendy straw) mole knight, polar knight, propeller knight, and tinker knight. There is also black knight, but he serves as shovel knights rival. Now, your main weapon is a shovel, but you can by relics and shovel upgrades to make yourself even more badassand to smooth out the ride. relics require magic, and you can increase your magic limit as well as your health. The gameplay definently reminds me of mega man's and the world map is practically ripped from super mario bros 3, with a hint of ducktales' fighting mechanics. though stiff controls can make platforming a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes. 4/5graphics- perfect classic interface. Character sprites and the environments in which they inhabit really stand out. 5/5.music- pure sex to my ears. 5/5.controls. shovel knight controls like a dream, though he can feel stiff at times, as metioned earlier. Best played with a controller, the keyboard controlls feel weird. 4/4All in all, i give the game a 4.5/5, it's pretty damn good.It's not just on steam, also. it's on wii u, 3ds, ps3, ps4, and xbox one for the same price!sequel????

												One of the best indie games I've played so far!The gameplay is prefect. The graphics are nostalgic and polished. The soundtrack is memorable and beautiful. The story is fun and it'll make you smile sometimes. After the story mode you can collect all upgrades, all song sheets, all cipher coins and make fun loadouts for Plague Knight (for example).If you want a retro yet amazing experience, buy this game RIGHT NOW!10/10 would dance with Mona again			"

												I absolutely recommend this game for anyone wanting to get a blast from the past in the sense of the 8-bit era. This game is incredibly well made in everything from art assets to sheer gameplay. Add in a massive amount of upgrades and fun little items that you can use and you have yourself a recipe for something that new games sometimes lack, Sheer unadultered fun!Nostalgia aside and taking the rose-tinted glasses off and just looking at this for what it is I can tell you, not promise, but tell you that should you decide to buy this game you'll be in for a good solid couple hours of well thought through level design, Good characters, Amazing gameplay and a game that'll leave you wanting more.I would definitely recommend this to anyone and loved every minute of it.

												I'm blown away and in awe of this game.  After just playing through Specter Knight, I feel stupid spending over $30 for a game.  Why, might you ask?  This game is the most satisfying experience I've had with a game all year.  The gameplay is flawless, the soundtrack is amazing, the secrets are infinite, and the homage to old-school games is omnipresent.  I cannot recommend this game highly enough.  If you don't pick it up on sale in the next 12 hours, you are missing out on saving $5 which you will inevitably fork over later.  Game of the year.  Hands down.  Buy it now.  Un-F'n-Real!			"

I can't explain the feeling I get when I play this game. It is my favourite game to come out in 2014. While it only says I have 1 hour played I have been deeply invested in the 3DS version and just recently bought it on PC... Because this game is amazing.TL;DR  This game touches nostalgia hard. If you're a fan of games and want to know how game design works... This game will teach you how to do it right. I am just gushing over how good this game is. Go buy the game, even if you don't like it... Support these amazing game developers. Will recommend this game to my children, grandchildren and so on.Right so now that I've got the TL;DR down I will begin a little bit more indepth and hopefully a bit more constructive.The game is a throwback to the age of platformers on the NES. This means Megaman, Legend of Zelda 2, DuckTales and Castlevania. This is one huge loveletter to the series of platformers and it even goes beyond that.The game itself gives you short story that seems to have no bones to it, but reveals more when you progress further in the game which would assume they have more than just a single Shovel Knight in mind. The game puts you in the role of Shovel Knight. A knight that uses a shovel for a weapon. You fight beside Shield Knight, your love and trustful friend until she dissapears. Que Shovel Knight amazing music and you're on your way to save your love and partner. The game gives you as little instructions as possible in the forms of text, you'll play the game and learn about it automatically ISN'T THAT JUST DANDY?! A thing of the past and yet it is the best thing to ever resurface, not having to see tireless textboxes shoved in there.After the first level you are thrust into an overworld like Super Mario Bros 3, where there are different icons. There will be icons for all kinds of nifty things but also the icons for the areas and bosses you will need to defeat to progress through Shovel Knight. In these levels you will collect treasure and be ready to grab everything you can because these will allow you to buy upgrades. We're talking about more health, manapoints... How about a new armor that does something different? Or how about an armour that makes you sparkle so you can go on your quest looking like the dandiest of knights there are!?Your shovel will also attain upgrades as you proceed to buy and collect treasure and soon you will find yourself at a boss.The bosses are like megaman, 9 bosses, 8 knights and the dreaded enchantress! + your rival Black Knight. These bosses are a delight, everyone with a deep personality that makes them feel way cooler than just having a skin and a theme. These bosses all have a purpose they want to fulfill and a reason to be in the ORDER OF NO QUARTER!*Echoing begins*Every boss has their own stage, themed appropriately aswell, their own music for the level and boss tune which are all delightful and will without a doubt make your feet tap and your skin crawl with how good it is... They even have the composer for Megaman in on this!Now that we've got all the positive stuff on here I would love to talk about something that really didn't bother me, but may bother some.There is knockback and insta-kill pits.NOT TO WORRY! There is a checkpoint system, but I know it can be a bit troubling for some. Just try your best guys! Some of the armors are a bit meh and found myself only using one particular one through the whole game.Other then that there really isn't anything else to say... It's just a gem that needs to stay for more games.Oh... Did I forget they're giving us Free DLC!? Where we play as one of the other knights? And they'll do it for more. Completely new combat, new enemy placements and so on so forth. FOR FREE FOR FREEEEEE. Please guys. I beg of you, buy this game and support these game developers since they're doing all this RIGHT! NOW! STEEL THY SHOVEL AND FIGHT! "

												Shovel Knight is a game that will make you angry. Angry that modern game design has summarily forgotten a whole slew of concepts it previously knew, which Shovel Knight displays in spades. Also it has an NPC who does nothing but spew puns, which might make you really angry as well.			"
