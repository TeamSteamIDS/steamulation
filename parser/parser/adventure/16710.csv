												I have no idea why this game gets such bad reviews.  I had a lot of fun with it, never expereinced any bugs, played it to the end, and was really impressed overall.  Is it a AAA-quality title?  Of course not.  Is it a very inexpensive, fun little hybrid action/adventure game with clever dialog, fun story, and good-enough gameplay.  IMO, yes!Really the only problem is that the game is only Part 1 and there will apparently not be a Part 2.			"

												Background: Picked up during the summer sale for pennies. Apparently it's an upgrade of a 2008 DS game with improved visuals and audio, part 2 was never released but you can complete the story on youtube via officially released cinematics.The Good:* Great story and plotting that mix things up* Characters and voice acting are fantastic* Self-aware quips make the characters stand-out* Fun mix of gameplay styles show depth right from the startThe Bad:* Looks dated, the pixelated cut-scenes especially* Awkward controls for interacting with characters but you get used to it* Mismatched lipsync is distracting* Combat is simplistic and weapons lack impact* Half a game that stops just as things are movingImpressions: Looks dated with low-rez cutscenes, awkward controls and mismatches mouth to voice work.. but in the first 10 minutes I was impressed by the story-telling, characters and gameplay. Reminds me of the first time i played Sam & Max.Recommended for: Noire detective fans who don't mind some run n gun n puns.Conclusion.7/10. Shines through its limitations to be memorable and a lot of fun.			"

												Being a platform-shooter/point-n-click detective game it is interesting to say the least. I picked it up for cheap during the holiday sale soley based on the fact that it kinda looked like Psychonauts and I have a soft-spot as well as a hard-on for platformers. Unfortunatly this game completely comes off as unfinished and under budget. It has the means to be an ok if not a good game but the bugged controls, fairly crappy graphics (ESPECIALLY during cutscenes), and flat out lack of quality sadly pretty much ruins it. Coulda, shoulda, and probably woulda did things differently if they could have, maybe if someone tested and polished it, maybe, who knows. Definatly worth trying if you can get it cheap (I got it for $0.74) or if you like point-n-click puzzle/detective games...			"

												A film noir homage in the vein of Pixar and Dreamworks 3D animated movies that combines platforms, action and point & click mechanics with uneven results. It plays as a Nintendo Gamecube title featuring: a colorful and charming art style, a jazzy soundtrack and better voice acting than some AAA titles. Unfortunately, Insecticide-Part 2 was never released; so you're left with an incomplete story and an unfinished game.			"

												This game has definitely gotten a bad rap by it's reviewers, but I actually liked it a lot. The plot and acting is decent. The platforming parts are kind of bad, but the adventure game ones aren't, and it feels kind of Beyond Good & Evil-esque.The worst part is that the publisher decided not to release the second half of the game for PC, which means you either have to buy it for the DS (with inferior graphics and cutscenes), or watch the second halves cutscenes on youtube, where the developer uploadet them: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL963FBBF618092865 "

												Yes, this is only half a game. The 2nd act got cancelled when the original publisher has gone under. Insecticide's full release happened only for the DS.Nevertheless, the soundtrack alone is worth Insecticide's price on Steam. Not an exaggeration! You liked Grim Fandango's stylishness? - all the people responsible for that game's art direction are back for this one. The combination of crime-fighting action levels and investigation-based adventure levels simply works. On top of that add the kind of humor that could have been given birth only by the collaboration of Space Quest and Curse of Monkey Island designers.			"

												Insecticide Part 1. More like Insecticide Part 1 and never get to see Part 2. It's not the developer's fault in that regard, as Part 2 was cancelled.The first problem is that this is a flippin' Nintendo DS port. It clearly shows, as it's a combination of poorly done shooting, platforming, and point and click. There is not much for any type of help in the game (the 2nd mission took me the longest, with the final taking me the second longest due to lack of telling me what to do other than a vague sentence).The controls were awkward, the difficulty was random if it was Easy or Hard. The FMV sequences were also horribly compressed compared to in-game mission audio. The game is also only 5 missions long (4 technically since ONE IS A CUTSCENE).I'm glad I bought this when it was about 40 cents. It's not worth anything else.			"

												Regrettably, Insecticide is a Part 1 of 2 series that will likely never be able to be finished as part 2 is not available. You can do some research on your own if you want to know the whole story of why.Part one provides a hybrid gameplay style consisting of action blasting platforming with point-and-click detective work. The mix of the two elements is done well and there are several cinematics that provide a game feel very similar to Psychonauts.As a stand-alone game, it is decent. But without a part 2 to compete the story, it feels half-baked.If you do play through this one and want to find out more of the Part 2 story, the developers posted the cinematics from the sequel on YouTube:

												Insecticide is an old favorite of mine, because I like those hard-boiled flat-foots with a dose of humour.  ""Don't worry, kid, it's just an exosceleton wound."" All in a day's work in the Insecticide Division.Gameplay-wise, Insecticide isn't much to write home about: it has sequences that are third-person-shooter with platforming elements, part action adventure game where you need to investigate a crime scene (and how to get the precinct coffee machine to produce the kind of coffee that Roachie likes), and lots of cutscenes. None of that is particularly difficult. The game does show its age, what with the low-poly models and the low-res, video, but who cares?The writing and the voice acting put Insecticide far above and beyond your average shooter. The character designs and the jazzy soundtrack support the game well. So even though it's never been a triple-A title (nor any kind of A, come to think of it), I'll gladly replay it once in a while (e.g. when it comes up in a Steam sale), just to hear Chris Lizt say, ""Stop, or I'll shoot - some more!""(The only disappointment with this game is that part 2 never came out. Insecticide has no Steam achievements.)			"

												Have you ever wished your graphic adventure games had a little more action? Or that your platformers required a bit more puzzle solving? Well, Insecticide is here, kind of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of point-and-click and action games. Unfortunately, only one of these elements turned out well. While the investigative segments of the game are a blast from the past, the platforming and combat are clunky and frustrating.Developer Crackpot has created an engaging world for Insecticide. The game is set in an alternate future where insects have evolved past humans and become humanoids. People are still around, but they have devolved into hominids and are barely surviving in the sewers. Many crime story clichés have been written into the script, but videogames can usually get away with reusing material movies ran into the ground years ago. You've got your grumpy police chief, your stakeout mission, your conspiracy that goes all the way to the upper echelons of power… All of the dialogue is peppered with insect puns that may have you rolling your eyes at first, but they end up being endearing. The game is often funny, and there are lots of geeky references to 60s sci-fi movies and other areas of pop culture.The player controls Detective Chrys Liszt as she investigates a possible homicide at a powerful corporation. To catch the bad guys, she alternates investigating crime scenes and chasing suspects. The crime scenes feature tried-and-true point-and-click gameplay and it's done very well. These portions of the game are fun, funny, and will provide a decent challenge to adventure gamers -- in fact, the game was created by LucasArts veterans who clearly know the genre.When the action kicks in, though, the fun checks out. Chrys can only fire one shot every few seconds, so forget about intense shootouts. And while she has a decent inventory of weapons, there's no way to switch them quickly. Either the Y button can cycle through them one at a time, or you can remove your hand from the fire button and select the gun you want with the stylus. She also turns at snail speed, so trying to dodge enemy fire is fruitless.The investigation sequences are really fun. The platforming...not so much.The graphics during the action sequences are pretty drab, and it can be hard to tell where you need to go next. Even if you do know, the camera might not let you get a good look. The game is also very dark, so playing on an old-school original DS phat might give you problems.There are unforgiving tightrope-walking segments that you'll be playing many times over. Most of the time the game respawns you near the place of your demise, but there are a few sections that send you too far back and force you to repeat frustrating areas over and over again.For the most part the audio is a quality affair. The voice acting is great, and the music is fully orchestrated. The soundtrack is a mix of seedy jazz and more intense, action-packed stuff. But the music doesn't loop smoothly, so it stutters briefly as it restarts, like a DVD menu. Sound effects are often missing at key moments. At one point Chrys defeats a giant, mechanical spider boss, but the beast disappears from the screen without any noise, any explosion, nothing.THE VERDICTThis one is a real heartbreaker. I really wanted to score it higher, but the action sequences get in the way of what could have been an extremely enjoyable adventure game. Crackpot has created an engrossing world with Insecticide, so maybe a sequel will focus more on pointing and clicking than frustrating and agitating. There are a lot of places this franchise could go, with plenty of interesting characters to develop. Sometimes a game should just do one thing, and do it well.RatingDescriptionout of 10Click here for ratings guide7.5PresentationCrackpot has created an engaging world, but skimped on some of the bells and whistles like key sound effects and animations.7GraphicsNice in the investigation sequences, bland in the action sequences.7.5SoundGreat voice acting and soundtrack, but the music doesn't loop smoothly.7GameplayAwkward platforming gets in the way of fun puzzle sections.6Lasting AppealAround ten hours of gameplay, but nothing beyond that.7OVERALLGood(out of 10, not an average) "

												Insecticide is a film noir styled action and adventure game with a great atmosphere. Set in a world populated by human-sized insects, you control a young female detective trying to solve a murder, and uncover what's behind a strange series of events. I feel the game is meant for children, rather than grown-ups, but I still found it quite enjoyable.I recommend it, if you don't mind dated graphics and somewhat quirky controls, and the fact that part 2 was never done for the PC (Nintendo DS only).

												This could be a decent game, but they didn't put enough effort into it.The atmosphere reminds me of Psychonauts but Insecticide is far worse.The voice acting is good, and the controls aren't bad (although I'd like more melee attacks). There are action and point-and-click adventure levels, so there's some variety. The enemies have very high accuracy, so it's challenging.I guess these are all the good things the game has to offer.Everything else is bad. The game is not complete (Part 2 confirmed for never being released on PC. You can play the full game on Nintendo DS, but with slideshows instead of cutscenes. And without voices, of course). The hitbox of enemies isn't clear (sometimes you're in front of an enemy and you'll miss some hits), there aren't subtitles on cutscenes (even if you turned them on in the options menu).""Bad conveyance"" are another two words that help me to describe this game. You can complete it in less than 4 hours, but you'll probably spend/waste more, because in some levels the game do nothing to point you into the right direction, and a bad palette choice don't help (you'll know what I'm talking about when you reach the level ""Pier Pressure"")			"

												Insecticide Part 1 Review - Raymond KT The game itself is fun to play. The art is fun to watch, but graphically it's a mess. Game stutters from time to time like some flash game. There's no support for widescreen displays either. In general, this game feels like a worked up flash-based game. Mediocre, short, and not very detailed. Good atmosphere. Not impressive. The game was meant for the DS. It was obviously ported to PC, and has graphics comparable to a mobile game system, which is not very good for PC. The action gameplay is basic, the voice acting is acceptable, and the ""detective"" sequences are basic ""click everything"" with minimal actual puzzles. I ran through in a very short period of time, then uninstalled, as it has zero replayability, and rather want the time and money back. The film-noir that it clings to is all that makes it tolerable, the game fits the word ""mediocre"" quite well. I've gotten more enjoyment for less money from MANY other things. The rhyme (commercial) at the beginning was interesting. I won’t get part 2 btw.			"

												You can tell these people love the adventure genre enough to want to update it with action elements for the new generation. Unfortunately, the action segments of the game, while not terrible, aren't seamlessly integrated into the game which makes Insecticide feel like a mixed bag.Insecticide can't decide whether it wants to be an adventure or a platformer, so it does neither particularly well.There are certainly some positive elements in Insecticide that make it worth a look, mainly in the classic ""adventure"" half of its action-adventure gameplay. The trouble is, that’s only half of what is only half a game to begin with. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.			"

The setting, graphics and voice acting are all good. Fluid controls and I didn't experience any issues. For $3 it's a good deal. Sometimes on sale for less. Look forward to grabbing ep. 2. Worth $3.

												If you're a masochistic basement dweller then this game is perfect for you.The gun mechanics is better than in Call of Duty + still ♥♥♥♥ though.This game is not even worth it when it costs $0.29.It's a piece of crap.1/10Also, i don't know the backstory of the protagonist, but everyone treats her like ♥♥♥♥.I'm currently debating on whether i should kill my self or not, the bloody tape recorder is nowhere to be found.

												I don't see why there are so many negative reviews about this game! It has a cool art style(reminiscent of Psychonauts) and interesting story and the voice acting is good quality. The game play, although challenging at times is fun. I like how there are two different modes that alternate throughout the game.			"

												Playing Insecticide Part 1 was and is a cult classic games to enjoy. It has a plot cheesy plot points. Main character with a mysterious past, nostalgic plot twist, and a 90s point and click interface feel. the only downfall of this game is that, it only has part one. when playing this game, is like playing Monkey Island in 3D.

												It's very inresting, the story has you going, it's got a very noiar feel to it, mind you the lip sync dring game play could have been better. But beyond that it is a pretty good game, Just wish they put out part 2. But if enough copyies are sold, they might do so. Besides, you want to see the whole story you have to find a copy of the DS version, and the differince between them and the PC is like night and day, if not for the fact that both are the same story and almost the same levels.

												This game has a number of things going for it but some pretty major flaws. It is an interesting mix of point and click and shooter. The characters are well designed and likeable. The voice acting is good and I love the word play. The story as far as it goes is decent but there is no getting away from the fact that this is only half the game; just as it gets into its swing the game ends. There are a couple of frustrating bits too where I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to be doing. So as long as you manage your expectations then this game provides a few hours of enjoyable entertainment.			"

												While the game is not all that bad, it's not worth much more than the price I paid for it, which was  $.29.  My major beefs are two fold: (1) You will need a walkthrough or guide, and (2) if you leave before ending the episode, even though it says  ""saving"" it still only takes you back the very beginning of the episode when you start  up again. That truly sucks. The graphics are cute and some of it is witty, but frankly it's not worth the time even for free. My recommendation is to skip it.			"

												This game perplexes me. Graphics are stylized quit nicely, but lip syncing is nonexistent. Bug puns exist literally everywhere, but most of them are forced. Enemies rarely hit you, but dodge your slow-moving bullets easily. Enemy AI is near perfect at dodging, but their pathing is awful and often leads to them running back and forth. Despite enemies practically never shooting directly at you, extra health is everywhere. Bullets deal miniscule damage but kicks instantly kill. To top it all off, the second leve, which I'm assuming is a ""Puzzle"" level, asks you do to a large number of completely unprompted and largely unaided tasks. The platforming sucks too because of how badly your character controls while in the air.I ended up paying about 30 cents and I still wasn't happy with it. At least it isn't buggy.			"

												I don't know if anyone likes this game since it's bundled with Real Horror Stories and Bad Rats (in which both were pretty bad games), but I don't care about anyone's opinions, this game is pretty awesome.It's basically a mixture of very popular games such as Fallout, L.A Noire, etc., it contains a fair amount of humor, and very difficult puzzles and maps, but fun to play and figure out. This game makes you feel like your playing Spongebob: Battle of Bikini Bottom (for the Xbox), in which by the way, was a very memorable game, so you can have a nostalgic feel while playing this game. Trust me, this game is worth every single penny, in fact, it's worth 5 bucks instead of  3, it contains everything that keeps you entertained, so do not have any regrets, buy this game now.			"

												I went into pun overload in the first five minutes. Everything else is just forgettable.This game looks and feel really bad, it wouldn't be too bad for the year 2000, but this was released in 2008. I understand it's basically a DS port, but this only makes it look even worse. Was it really necessary?Graphics are clearly lacking for the Portal era, obviously they thought porting to pc means only changing the control settings. Again, it could've looked nice on a DS, but on a pc it's unforgivable. The cutscenes are pre-rendered and the quality drop is absurd, the audio level goes down and up in a second and the cutscenes are in low definition and short too.Characters are flat and the plot is typical, but I really didn't expect much from it. This clearly isn't a narrative masterpiece, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be funny and entertaining, which it is, for the first half hour. After the first two levels everything else is boring and repeated, and the investigation parts will only bore you and frustrate you, spending 44 minutes on one level because you couldn't understand you need to examine an inventory item, then examine it again, then use it in a place, then use it again on the HINGES you didn't even see. These investigation parts are supposed to be a reference to the old sierra games but they're really just boring and tedious and break the flow of the game.TL,DR;Only buy this game on discount if you miss old titles like Sly Cooper and King's Quest.Otherwise, avoid this game.

												This game is nauseating to play. Not because the characters are all bugs, mind you, but for reasons that are hard to put your finger on. Well, I think I have it figured out:1. No AA. That's one thing. The game is full of jaggies. It is AWFUL.2. Framerate locked to 50 FPS. What is this? Seriously? What the actual f*@k.3. 1080p? Kind of... but the FOV doesn't change, so really it's just as bad as sloppily stretching 1280x1024 over your whole monitor. Looks like complete balls.4. Strange mouse movement. This is linked to the resolution thing, I think, but here's the basics: in menus, it's too fast. In gameplay, it's just kind of awkward.5. Altogether poor controls. Seriously, what is this? The controls for the third person shooter parts are clunky to say the least, and then there are the ""Detective Mode"" controls. Unlike your traditional point n' click adventure game, this crams those third person shooter controls in with very few changes. In short, it makes no sense. 6. Unrelated to performance, but it takes itself WAY too seriously.All of these issues combined make it unplayable for me. As I said, I feel slightly ill after playing for five minutes. It kind of sucks, because there are some good qualities:1. Character designs. They remind me of psychonauts, which is always a good thing.2. Voice acting. Meh, it isn't awful. Better than early Telltale stuff.I can't comment on the plot, though, because I can't play this game. And really, I don't think anyone should play it. Watch the cutscenes on Youtube or something. Because this game can be summed up in one word: sloppy. Seriously, don't even buy this for 79 cents on sale like I did.			"

												Really nice game, in the vein of PC/PSX/PS2 platformers of the late 90's and early 00's.Gave me a bit of nostalgia for the genre. Decent voice acting, the graphics are plain in today's day and age but they have their charm.Recomended especially if you grew up on spyro, jak and daxter, ratchet and clank.Also, got it on a sale for 29 cents. Great value for the money.			"

												What a disgusting game.  Indie games, ha.Pro- good voice acting- music?Con- cockroaches, i hate them- what nonsense story- laggy gameplay controls- begins easily enough then the end spamming with enemies and huge boss- half a game- every platform is slippery and you die from falling instantly- bad checkpoint system- bad language ""fingering"" bugs, awful conversation options- cutscenes could have used the game engine instead of that low quality video3/10 rating.

Review done................okay I'll say a little more.I killed the first enemy and realized this game isn't fun at all.If a game can't get the first kill right it's not worth bothering with.In Super Mario Bros. the first goomba you squash is interesting, it helps set up the pace, it's FUN!Your first kill in a Quake multiplayer match.

												""Part 1 of 2"" says the title screen, but sadly there is not part 2. Part 1, however, is a hybrid between shooter, platformer, and adventure game. The AI is a bit wonky and instantly dodges your shots and the adventure sections are very unclear about what the heck to do, but otherwise, this game is very enjoyable and has a Tim Schafer-esque art style. Just don't get your hopes too high for a satisfying story, because it leaves you at an unsatisfying cliffhanger with no plans on a follow-up.			"

Overall, the game is old. Like buggy (no pun intended) old.In order get past the game from crashing you need to set the compadibility mode to XP SP3, then run as admin for the game, this helped from getting to many crashes and was able to play the whole game, to top off the crash bug, you need to open the game in window mode then switch to fullscreen, as the game would crash for me on windows 7 before loading the game.But with that aside, The game was very nice, the detective mode made things enjoyable, and the gameplay was very smooth when I set it up with my controller using a third party program. Weird thing was the instant death to check point areas and falling even .0001 meter past the maximum high would just declare you dead instead of taking a small chunk of health. but I stomached it. the artistic directions was really good, and the animation was VERY good, except for those low buget moments. If this game got atleast 3 more months to tweak and continued animation and programing. this game would be one of those old school classics that everyone would scream ""give us a sequal"" Sadly, a really good game that didnt get enough time, however, unlike every game that doesnt get a sequal, the developers graced us with part 2 cinematics, so give it a watch when your done playing.

												Ho-ly crud is this a great game. Now, I'll get the one negative out of the way right now: part 2 is not on PC, only on DS. And that sucks.But the GAME. Oh, it's amazing. Most fun I've had in a long time, and I finished it in one five hour sitting. Couldn't put it down. It takes a classic detective setting, and throws it into a completely unique world of bugs. I loved the protagonist straight off the bat, all the characters had their own quirky charm, the voice acting is fantastic, the lines were witty and made me chuckle often, and there was something kinda charming about the older graphics too.Do I recommend this game? Oh fudge yes.			"

												To be clear, I bought the game to see the female protagonist in action. She's a bug but I like her style being a female lead in a Noir-type setting. It's quite unique. Despite all the negatives I am listing below, I still don't regret getting the game while it was on sale.The game does have some issues for me though so here we go:1) Screen resolutions. It has oddball resolutions and none fit my screen. Best to play it on windowed mode if you're out of luck in their limited selection.2) Setting mouse sensitivity all the way down will actually disable your mouse.3) You need to save the changes before changing tabs in the optons menu. O.o;4) No tutorial I think. 5) You have a double jump. I wish I knew that before the first platform leap (which you can't do without double jumping).6) I feel that the ammo recharge is pretty slow.7) You can just double jump from behind cover to pop the AI enemies hiding behind cover while in mid-air.

												I'd say this game is kind of mediocre. Its gameplay is split up in 2 parts: jump'n'run'n'shoot á la Ratchet and Clank and ""investigation mode"", which rather plays like a point and click adventure game. It feels more like a console game than a PC game as you not often require the mouse, just while interacting with a scene during investigation mode and in the menus,  furthermore the cutscenes (which seem kind of compressed along with its audio) and the overall graphics seem pretty outdated, considering the game came out in 2008.But now let's get more into detail:The combat/jump'n'run sequences is/are okayish. Every weapon is kind of viable, even the weakest one is still usable against the toughest ones, and also every weapon is usable against every weapon, and there isn't much tactics involved. You can dodge bullets, but some parts make it impossible to do so, as some corridors are too narrow to strafe. Fall damage is kind of an odd deal, as you either are fine or die, making you restart from a checkpoint (which feels kind of weird, as it just quickly fades to black and then fades into the last saved position, however sometimes the checkpoints are placed rather inconvenient, since some are around enemies, and while you figure out where you are now after respawning you propably will take a hit or two.The investigation parts play alot like point'n'click adventure games. You walk around, press spacebar when you are near an interactive scene and take items or use items from your inventory on other items. The first and second one are kind of tough, as the rooms are pretty big, and you don't get much hints on what to do, also items that have no more use doesn't always dissapear from your inventory, making the parts even more tedious to solve with. The third one (and last one) is incredibly easy on the other hand.Overall the game is, as said, mediocre. It isn't that bad, but also not a masterpiece. The price is kind of justified, considering the quality and the length of the game. However this game is only part 1 of 2 parts, however part 2 will propably never come out as a game (although all remaining cutscenes are on youtube I heard), so it should be kept in mind that this isn't a 'full game' as in a game that has a clear ending. So I reccommend it rather to those who like odd jewels (if you want to call it that) than to those who actually want to buy it and hope to get a good game in the traditional sense.			"

I'll bee giving this a thumbs down, but people who like solving puzzles like where the ♥♥♥♥ to go might like this better.			"

												In short, have to say, this game was actually pretty cool. Although I wouldnt recommend it to most people, I think some could appreciate the good qualities of this game enough to pay a couple bucks for it. Here's a full review if you wish to know  more...Graphics: 3/5Although the graphics in this game are pretty low res, and there was no option for widescreen, I thought the art and style were really awesome. Thats actually the reason why I purchased the game in the first place.. the screenshots looked great and it didnt disapoint me there at all.Sound: 4/5The soundtrack to this game is absolutely top. It was very enjoyable and never got old. Big ups to the guys who put in the heart on that music. I would have given the sound on this game a 5 had there not been some SFX that I found fairly annoying.Storyline: 4/5The storyline of the game was charming, and fun with interesting characters. Not the greatest writing but good enough to support the game in this aspect. Gameplay: 2/5This is where this game mainly falls short. The game is split into 2 modes, 3rd person shooter/3d point and click. The platformer shooter parts of the game have absolutely terrible gameplay. Clunky controls, frustrating level design, and the AI is just not anywhere near par. The point and click mode is generally ok, although it does have its fair share of flaws, i was able to look past most of them.In the end, this game has ALOT of bugs (no pun intended(oh and there is a ton of bug puns in the game.. they tried a little too hard with that)) and the gameplay is terrible but if youre the type of person who can appreciate other aspects of games other than the gameplay.. id say its worth a couple dollars and a few hours time. Oh, and I almost forgot.. apparently there is no Part 2.. big mistake, never call something part 1 unless part 2 is a sure thing :/			"
