												The Novelist is a 'narrative adventure' that is similar in many ways to games like Gone Home and Dear Esther, which is to say that it's not everybody's cup of tea. That being said, if you enjoyed those games or are open to experiencing a mature and realistic story, you might find that you enjoy The Novelist as much as I did. You play as a 'ghost' (for lack of a better word) that observes and influences a family of three (Dan, Linda, and their son Tommy) during a summer spent in the Oregon countryside. The game is sub-divided into 12 chapters, each of which has a central problem such as a family member drinking too much, a death in the family, or a child's difficulties learning. Your task is to explore the thoughts and memories of each family member and determine how they would deal with the outcome in the way most desirable for them. Inevitably this leads to a prioritization of people that results in a lot of uncomfortable trade-offs: Do encourage Dan to spend more time on his novel at the expense of his relationship with his wife and son? Or, do you make the family spend as much time together as possible at the risk of their professional obligations? And, perhaps more importantly, which of these outcomes do you choose consistently?  This is a game that you may only get 2-3 hours of playtime out of, but I valued those 2-3 hours a great deal.			"

												The Novelist is a very unique and difficult game. It's not difficult mechanically, but rather the decisions you're given are quite often tough to make, a meditation on the sacrifices we make for family, for work, for ourselves. Instead of simply being presented a wall of text or buttons to click you physically (incorporeally?) explore the home of the family you're influencing. You move among them in a first person view and have to avoid detection if you want to help them in the most effective ways. The movement in itself can be entertaining as you stalk the family and zip from light fixture to light fixture.The game also has quite a bit of content to explore, especially if you want to (probably out of intense guilt) revisit the family and see how things might have gone differently.

												I really wanted to like this game. But I just couldn't. The envrironment is as bland as it gets. The house feels lifeless and boring. The choice in this game is simplistc, and the outcomes are predictable. The stealth mechanic is in the way of what the game is supposed to be; but without it, it becomes even more repetitive and dull. The writing is not bad, which seems like a victory for a videogame, but it feels lacking in characterization. There are hints everywhere of interesting directions the game could have taken, but it manages to avoid all of them. The ending result is a bland, dull and completely unremarkable experience.  "

												When I first saw this game I was intrigued with idea of being able to interact with and influence the lives of a family. I was expecting something akin to Heavy Rain (minus the murder mystery), with choices presented very naturally through events and conversations within the game. That's not what I got. The Novelist started off as a quirky game that I believed could offer a few hours of enjoyment. For that first day, I was intrigued with my ability to  sneak around the house, observing this family while trying to learn from each family member what they wanted. However, by the end of the first day I found that my interactions with the family were limited to taking one persons side (or maybe finding a compromise). What this game boiled down to was picking up notes, listening to a few snippets of dialogue and then being offered the dreaded choice of A, B, or C (or red, blue, green if you prefer to see it that way). I didn't feel like I was involved with their lives. If they happened to see me, the only penalty was losing the option to choose a compromise. You don't feel as though you have any real role in their lives, except for making that one choice at the end of each day. This is something that gets repetitive very quickly.Even worse, you don't actually watch the family live their lives, you learn about it through notes. The sole role of the physical characters is to simply be there and provide (optionally) a watered down stealth mechanic. You don't interact with them, you don't learn about them from watching their routine, at most you get not even a sentence from choosing to listen to their thoughts. They may as well not even be there in the game.I have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed with this game (it hardly has the interaction to be called a game) and could not recommend it.			"

												I was briefly torn about whether or not to recommend the game, but after about five minutes of reflection, I can safely say that this game isn't worth buying. Despite having a great concept and being superficially well-made for an indie game, for the brief and predictable story, the asking price is extremely steep. The enticing story-and-gameplay concept is, sadly, completely and utterly wasted. This game could have been made between fifteen and twenty years ago as a college project and would be expected to be distributed for free. Most of the critique of the game will be about the story, so a bit about the gameplay first. As far as point-and-click adventure games go, this is one of the most simplistic. I've seen -more- simplistic games that I did play, but I can't think of any right now. There are no puzzles, nothing to figure out. You just find all the stuff that glows when you mouse over it, then sneak up behind everyone to see what they're thinking. Playing in stealth mode is a joke, no challenge (even for the minimally competent) whatsoever. The graphics are acceptable for the style (and one might assume, budget). The sound and music are pretty good, but they don't really seem to fit the mood of the game very well. It's sort of like matching up Silent Hill's music and sound with Casper the Friendly Ghost.The main part of the game is its story, and while I'm not opposed to a cliche setting or starting scenario, sadly the story does not really progress beyond the starting situation. Which is a shame, because the voice acting was pretty good. I played in stealth mode, looked at every interactable object, viewed every memory, unlocked every story option, and was never seen by any of the family members. Finished the game in 2.8 hours, got an ending I would consider 'good', and I have no desire to play it ever again.Instead of really giving you choices that matter that actually branch out the storyline, the three maladjusted characters are put on a sacrificial altar and the player gets to decide who will get to act all pissy/mopey/whiney this chapter. Some of the 'choices' offered are split between propriety and a non-sequitur option. Not chosing the non-sequitur option has the same level of consequences for the affected character as failing to fulfill social/societal expectations. Additionally, the choices are made for an entire week at a time, but most of the life-altering 'choices' are things that might take anywhere between fifteen minutes and a couple of hours in most of the chapters, or wouldn't be mutually exclusive no matter how you looked at it.Minor Spoilers: Hilariously, despite being myself in a somewhat similar life position as Dan, I could not find him interesting or identifiable. He's mopey and non-commital, and if I think of Tommy's reading troubles as hereditary, that would explain Dan's writer's block pretty well. I found it so hard not to disparage Linda as a selfish, whiny bellyacher, that I kind of just did. Tommy is a static and boring character, even for a kid. He exists in the story to be the sacrifical lamb whenever you decide talentless Dan should do his job or do apparently incapable Linda's work for her, however more often than he seems neglected, he seems more like a spoiled and undisciplined crybaby with more cognitive deficiencies than poor reading comprehension.I have problems with the writing for the game, as the game's primary tension is the supposed marital problems between Dan and Linda, which are barely mentioned. The only problems I can see the two having are related to Linda being an implacable whiner who blames Dan for her lack of drive, focus, and ability for most of the game (for perspective, I still got what I would consider the best ending for their relationship). This is made worse by the half-hearted attempts to frame Linda's personality as creative and indepenent using her own words, which make her look hypocritical and even more selfish and listless. While this can be considered a negative personality trait written into the character, I can't help but feel the writer is tacitly implying that women expect their husbands to do everything for them. Personally, I can't stand her the way she is written.There's never even an insinuation that Dan is writing the book to provide a living for his family, and given that zero of your decisions seem to change which or how the chapters play out, all the more reason for the player to never help him do it unless you think supporting his pride/hubris as a writer is important. The characters certainly never act like the book is at all important to their well-being. That said, Dan's choice is almost always about industriousness, the other two choices are usually about him satisfying the demands of his family, so it would make a lot of sense if you could 'lose' the game by failing to help him write a good book and meet deadlines. Several of the choices -seem- like they would be weighted to give you a better score with both the book and with the family, but that does not actually appear to be the case.Finally, I did not feel any of the decisions were particularly hard or weighty, and I feel I would not ever have made different decisions at any point in the game. The fully linear chapters and extremely repetative gameplay made my stomach hurt with frustration as I wanted and tried to hurry up and finish. The ending (as with all of the chapter plots) was mundane and predictable. The character outcomes were clearly linked to a hidden score and had no relationship to any of the actual decisions made throughout the storyline.If I didn't get this game with a bundle, I would be extremely upset about having paid any specific sum of money for the product.And, there you have it, folks. A review that nearly took longer to write than the game took to finish.Edit: Clarified the intro paragraph.			"

												The Novelist is a story driven adventure game that takes place in a summer home. The main character, Dan, takes his family to this place so he can get away from the city and focus on his book. You don't actually play Dan, or any of his family members, you play some sort of ghost, who is trying to influence their lives. First of all let me adress a small issue. This game is what I would consider ""Art"". Therefore, there isn't much in terms of the standard definition of gameplay. There are definitely choices, and different endings, but you really aren't doing much. Your watching the story unfold based on your choices. Especially if you play in story mode. There are 2 different types of modes. Stealth and story. In story mode, the family is unable to detect you, leaving you to be able to discover clues and read their memories with ease. This is what you would want to choose to just focus on the story. Stealth includes a stealth mechanic to the game, you must remain out of site. For the first time, I'd recommend using stealth. It makes it feel more like a game, even though without the mechanic I would still call it a game.Okay, the story. The story is great, and the choices, unlike other games that claim this, actually count. Your choices will reflect in the ending no matter which exact ""ending"" you choose. And I do not believe there is a perfect ending. No matter what, someone will end up disapointed one way or another. That's what I love about this game, because that is life. You can't make everyone happy. And when your in an outsider situation, that makes it even harder. The story isn't complex or epic, and it doesn't have to be. It's a simplistic story about a families life and problems. But it feels real, and I love it.I absolutely love story driven games, and I'm glad I spend 15 bucks on The Novelist. If you enjoy games like The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, and the sort, you will love The Novelist. I surely hope people give this game a chance. Buy At Full Price  "

""Human beings are born solitary, but everywhere they are in chains - daisy chains - of interactivity. Social actions are makeshift forms, often courageous, sometimes ridiculous, always strange. And in a way, every social action is a negotiation, a compromise between 'his,' 'her' or 'their' wish and yours."" - Andy WarholThe Novelist is a story driven narrative exploration game that strolls around quite loaded terms like choice, goals, drives, relationships, priorities and compromise. The concept that the game revolves around - influencing social dynamics to observe the result of interrelated choices and their consequences - is an interesting and hard to accomplish one. Sadly its presentation within the game both in definition and execution, is definitely flawed.Here, we take a quick glance at the Kaplans - a family of three going through a though time. Dan is an author who's stressed out to complete the novel that he's been working on, Linda has some worries about her marriage and family ties - also struggles on going back to being a painter. Tommy, their only son is having some adaptation and learning difficulties who needs his parents' attention and support full time. At the beginning of one summer, the Kaplans decide to pass their vacation in a rental villa by the seaside to have some quality time and possibly work through their problems, a villa that YOU reside in... In this detached little game, you are a ghostly entity - who's presence within the house will never be explained properly. You have the ability to stalk, observe and influence the Kaplans, thus deciding the story of this specific family in the end.The game has two distinct modes: Stealth or Story. In Stealth Mode, you have to avoid being seen by the Kaplans if you'd like to explore everything. If you are seen, they get nervous and focus on their annoyance rather than their actual problems. You are capable of travelling through possessing light sources within the house while you hide from their perception. This mode quickly gets annoying and breaks the immersion of the storyline that you are trying to reveal quite fast. In Story Mode, you are free to roam as you wish without worrying for them to see you, but even excluding that limitation, everything becomes boring and repetitive. You are stuck within the same house with the same tense mood and you basically memorize the possible locations a note may spawn after the second chapter. They never change or surprise you. It is not possible to miss something. You roam around, read notes, watch some memories, whisper what you decided to Dan while he is sleeping and you are done. Another chapter conquered. You only decide whose need is a priority and see the accumulated conclusions in the end.In each episode - there are 9 in total - you are presented with a couple of conflicting desires of family members. Everyone got different priorities and you must choose one specific desire to influence and accomplish, and maybe another one to half way accomplish through ""compromising"" which leaves you with one desire completely ignored. This is where things get a bit ridiculous. These 9 encounters oddly end up defining the whole being and interdynamics of a whole family! The definition of compromise in the dictionary is ""a settlement of differences by mutual concessions; an agreement reached by adjustment of conflicting or opposing claims, principles, etc., by reciprocal modification of demands"". Here, there is no middle ground between parties, no given opportunity to work on different needs, there is basically no settlement. Even real life doesn't work like this! We surely either act selfish or make sacrifices on things little or grand, but a human being is capable of undertaking more than one deed, feeling or accomplishment in a timely manner.A human being comes with dimensions - which is another huge flaw in this game. The Kaplans are obscenely selfish - without much appreciation for sacrifices or understanding of shortcoming. Their personal desires never seem to even coincide with the desires of others. It is not possible to sympathize with any one of them. Heck, they even do not talk within the same house hold! You are a ghost, stuck within their household for his/her all being and never see them talk more than a couple of automated remarks and some memories. They seem to communicate through written notes scattered around the house. I mean, what kind of family does that?I surely do understand the limitation of the developer team, thus I won't mumble much about the scenes, the environment and chapters being dull, stolid or repetitive; but I cannot accept the term ""compromise"" being misused for ""forced priority and selfish desire"". No remotely eligible father of a small boy would be so consumed with his ongoing artistic pursuit that he'd end up not putting together a toy car that would take 3 hours to assemble for 3 months! This really is ridiculous! So, I personally think this game comes with a possibly good concept executed without much sentimental or even practical depth. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for narrative exploration. I actually love games like Gone Home if they are capable of presenting the echo of an emotion, an idea or at least a state of being. In its current state and price, The Novelist surely doesn't deliver. Wait for a huge sale to satisfy your curiosity if you wish.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Kent Hudson's The Novelist is a game about choices. They are not life or death choices like most games tend to boil down too. Rather choices on what it means to be a husband, a father, and an individual who pursues a career. What makes the game most compelling is how genuinely authentic and sincere Kent's writing is throughout the game. I often fold myself struggling in the game to decide on whom I would give my priorities to: my wife or my career. Something that I struggle with and perhaps others do as well. I always applaud when art can imitate life in this way. Kent Hudson and The Novelist, while may be a late entry into this year stands on the shelf with games like Gone Home, Stanley Parable and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons..			"

												Although this game is 'story rich', I dont think the story is very good. Its full of cliches (writer with writer's block, boy wants to play, dad wants to work, mom tries to hold family together, etc) and extremely superficial. You make choices but they dont mean anything when the consequence is just text at the end of the scene. Its just so...predictable. All the kid ever wants to do is play, so, shocker, when you dont play with him he gets depressed. So what? Why am I suppose to care about the kid at all? The game doesnt give you any reason to like any of the characters.And we are suppose to believe that Dan is so busy he cant do anything else with his wife and kids but. . . hes not. He sits around the house all day, goes camping, fishing. In one chapter they show a schedule. It has 8 hours sleep, 1 hour break, 2 hours decompression. Really? Thats 11 hours where hes doing nothing. Real busy people rest half that amount on any given workday.I really hate to hammer an indie game. But it has a steep price tag so people should know what theyre in for. And for what it gives you there are better options out there. Gods Will Be Watching is a brilliant game about choices and consequences, with much better dialogue and characters that felt. . . alive. Or if you like walking simulators with notes all over, I would even recommend Gone Home before this, which has a very cute story, is the same length, and doesnt have you revisiting the same 4 rooms 15 times.

												This game is a brilliant change of pace from a lot of other games. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a game that fits into 'real life' (define that however you wish) so well as this one. A lot of the scenarios in here are perfect practice for what people would really want out of life, and I'm learning things about myself playing this. It's really interesting. Certainly may not be for everybody, but nothing worth anything ever is.			"

Posted: November 2, 2014
												   As for the beginning i should mention that i'm a highly emotive person but cold-hearted at the same time, who could watch any emotionally disturbing events and never blink an eye if circumstances demand so, however this game didn't even bother to try me. I'll probably get assaulted by some who presumably were tackled by the emotiveness of this game, but i'll take my chances since, frankly, there is no single reason why i would give it a thumbs up.   It is indeed a game which tends to appeal on emotions, but it fails this part too, except a few occasion when it manages to touch the player, and further on i'll explain why. First of all, it's almost one year after release and the game is still buggy. You can see that for yourself in the 2 screenshots i've posted on the game's community hub. Characters can sit on invisible chairs, type on invisible typing machines or read books while their heads are stuck in the table, etc, and all of that in less than 4 hours of gaming... Also, Dan, the main character developed a habit to close the doors of his office when he needs to rest or focus on the book he's writing, and doesn't want to be disturbed by his family. I got stuck in his office for quite a few times, having nothing to do, just waiting and wondering when will he finally open the doors so i can get out. At first i relied on the fact that me being a ghost, i'm not supposed to be seen opening doors, but imagine my surprise when i saw for the first time his wife walking in the office right through the closed door, and walking out through the other one. I was like ""WTF? I am the damn ghost in this house or this this family who clearly posseses more supernatural skills than i do ?!""Leaving all bugs and glitches behind, the whole purpose of the game is to find out what the family members wish for, and try to make them all happy, or at least feeling less miserable, by choosing somebody's wish and make a compromise with other member. Problem is the choices are sometimes ridiculous. For example: the mother wants to go camping on some place far from home, the father wants to go camping somewhere near by, and the son wants his father to help him launch his toy rocket. You choose father's wish to go camping somewhere near by and try to reach a compromise with his wife based on the fact that he's behind the schedule with his work on the book. Done. The son remains unhappy. WHY ?! Even if the father is so ridiculously busy at home, why can't he just take 5 minutes and help his son launch a toy rocket while they were camping for almost an entire day? And this is only one example from an entire list of unrealistic stupid choices one has to make.What else made me be so cold-hearted towards this game's attempt to appeal on my emotions ? The almost empty house, the dull environment, the repetitive actions of the characters which walk from a part of the house to another over and over, and mostly the lack of any active emotions between them. Upon the interaction of the characters in the house you'll just hear ""Hi mom"" and the answer back ""Hi darling"", and that's all, after which they all go do something different, mother watches TV, the son plays with a toy, and the father drinks by himself in the office or sticks his head again in the table and starts to read. Does that look like a busy family to you where they presumably can't find the time to satisfy each other ?There are many other things i could list, but looks like my review is becoming too long, so i'll just stop here. The overall experience felt boring and tedious. There is no way i could recommend to anybody this clearly overpriced and overrated game.			"

												Cannot really recommend this one.. It´s a very repetetive gameplay - you search for some notes, search for three memories and then choose which of the three family members you want to head onward with his goal... So there is little to no ""gameplay"" other than this, which is good, taking in mind that the control is lame and moving around takes much unnecessary time. The most difficult/interesting part should be the decisions and motivations of the family.. but honestly.. the wife is nagging, the father is a compulsive writer and the kid.. is just a kid. No really interesting/sympathic figure there. I skipped some of the long winded letters during the end, when the wife once again complains about the remote house (she surely didn´t know this before) and could only shake my head about the father, who thinks that a writer needs to be a half alcoholic to write good stuff.. the kid rarely get´s enough personality to care about him anyways.So, after 2 hours i reached finally the end, got a pre-made end for all three (which keeps me in doubt of how much all these meaningful decisions really influence) and i´m honestly glad it´s over.The rest.. music and graphics are sub par, but not really important either.. the heavy stomping sounds of the family members  , when they tromp about the house gets annoying and is in some way the only funny thing in this game (they sound like little elephants)... not recommended.

												I've been looking forward to this game for a while, as any game that forces the player to make difficult choices with some grounding in reality immediately piques my interest.  Ever since getting married about a year ago, I've had to ""grow up"" and realize that my choices are no longer my own, and that I must think of the greater interest of my wife and family in general as we both make decisions together.  Now as we get ready to give up our established jobs and prepare to move overseas for several years, where we hope to make new friends, raise any future children, and find new jobs, our choices become more and more crucial (and intimidating) than ever before.  These feelings had me anticipating The Novelist even before I played a single minute. Some have accused me of enjoying 2Deep4U games a bit too much; while it's true that mostly indie games topped my list of games I most enjoyed last year (Swapper, Gunpoint, Brothers, Guacamelee, Rogue Legacy, Stanley Parable), I've managed to maintain a cynical stubbornness against games that I can appreciate but otherwise just do not enjoy (Proteus, Papo & Yo, Dust).  After completing The Novelist, I can unfortunately say that my verdict of the game lies squarely in the latter category. The Novelist appoints you as a ghost in a house where you voyeuristically observe the life of the Kaplan family: Dan, Linda and their son Tommy.  The house is littered with notes, letters and drawings (Gone Home-style) which you can read to discover the daily problem du jour.  Thankfully, there is more human interaction than Gone Home, since you can also watch the family members live their lives and enter their memories to hear their thoughts.  After finding enough clues and thoughts, each member has an ""item"" that you can possess to convey how they would want to end their day.  If you find enough clues, you can also make a compromise possession with someone else, but at least one person will always have their daily wish unfulfilled. From what I can tell after two playthroughs, the first choice will always carry the most weight.  The compromise choice, if selected, seems to either mildly satisfy the family member or merely hold status quo.  The member whose choice you ignore will fall into worse and worse shape.  Each playthrough can offer days in random order, but the days themselves are the same and have no variety.  I didn't like this as you never see any ramification of previous choices in future days, besides some thoughts here and there.  Everything is eerily distilled into simple black and white scenarios and outcomes.  I'll avoid any spoilers, but the daily, monthly, and eventual final decision results left a lot to be desired.  Also, the final outcomes are incredibly disjointed, with certain distinct epilogues given for each character that hold absolutely no relationship to other members' decisions and epilogues. Actually, I think that's what annoys me the most.  For a game whose prime selling point is the idea of making hard choices and compromises for the greater good, the fact that your choices have no interrelation between members seems completely unrealistic and disappointing.  If I, as a father, take time out of my day to affirm my wife's hobbies and spend more time with my son, how does it make sense that I treat them the same horrible way depending on one of my one (father) choices, versus when I completely ignore them and put my priorities above all else?   In a game that prides itself on difficult decisions, I can give one clear recommendation on choice:Don't play The Novelist.			"

Everyone can't be happy 7/10This game has slow gameplay, but is still satisfying to play. I know not everyone will be into it, but keep reading if the following interests you, and you should know, this game faces realistic problems, and the game's adjectives present a very depressive situtation. You play as a spirit that lives in a house, where a family of three decide to spend their summer. These family members contrast in what they want, and how their summer should be spent. The father Dan wants to finally finish his second novel. The Mother Linda wants her husband to spend more time with her, have a closer family, and to pursue a possible future as an artist, while the son Tommy just wants to enjoy the summer, and isn't fully aware of the family's problems.As the spirit, you have the ability to observe these characters, read their memories/thoughts, find clues about what they want around the house. Once you discover what they want, you decide at the end of each chapter, who shall get what they want, and then you can follow up by giving a compensation to a second member (Not as good, but better than a depressing event for that character), while the third will get a depressing event. As the spirit, you can whisper to Dan at night, and pass what you decide on to his own thoughts.There are 12 chapters in the game, followed by an ending decided by the relationships that you've created between the characters, and your final choice. The game becomes more interesting as you feel for the tragedy that each character is going through because of your decisions, and even more so, if you are trying to keep everyone happy, similar to how I did. The problems that the family faced hit pretty close to home, which makes it even more tragic as they repitively face problems, and often feel empty, and disconnected.Like I said, there isn't a huge amount to gameplay, but if you're interested, I'd recommend trying it. It took me about 3 hours to complete it once, and I don't plan to play again, but there are other changes that can be made to the story. However, I do not feel that is enough personally to create replayability. Price is a bit high, I'd recommend trying this game if you see it to have a decent sale. Do you wish for the son to have a happy childhood more than Dan's acomplishment in completing a quality novel?Do you focus on your son's education struggles, or your own problems?Do you target Dan's drinking problem to help Linda?Do you wish for Linda to have a real chance at becoming an artist over Dan's career?Do you wish to destroy the family's already faulty relationship for their careers?And BTW, I ended up with two of the three characters happy after such a depressing game, so I'm pretty sure that's good.

												Great title for Dear Esther/ Gone Home/ Vanishing of Ethan Carter Fans. At the end of the game I really cared about Kaplans Family. Graphics are ""sufficient"" and soundtrack really suits the game.Score  8 out of 10 [ 10/10 if u got it from humble bundle for few $]. It takes about 2,5 hours to complete the game and I guess you can complete it few times to get different endings.			"

												I just finished this, and all I can say is it is probably one of the best games I have ever played.  People interested in intricate gameplay might be dissapointed with the simple controls and limited actions, but the story has tons of different outcomes, and i'm already halfway through my second playthrough!  Oh god, the story is amazing.  It is so real and so raw.  The art style is also really beautiful, and the side-story of the ghost that you play as is really cool. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Orthogonal Games Publishers: Orthogonal Games Initial release: Dec 2013Genre: Adventure #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationLife is hard. Working is hard. Having a family is hard. The Novelist tells the story of The Kaplan family during their summer break. To which through playing the game you can heavily influence the events of that summer. THE GAMEPLAY You are some sort of ghost that when not inside a light bulb you are probably slightly more opaque or corporeal than what the traditional notion of a ghost is. You can either play the game having the Kaplans react and cause you to fail upon discovery or just throw it into story mode and become invisible and focus on the objectives. The ladder is what I did.The game revolves Dan, his wife Linda and their son Tommy. You explore the home WASD'ing around and teleporting between lights. You must find notes, pictures, documents and items laying about the house; additionally being supernatural (I guess) you can delve into the memories of the characters as well and see what they are thinking at any given moment. Each chapter you'll find clues of what each characters desires are and how they want to go about moving forward. You will choose which (by this I mean whose) outcome you want each chapter and possibly working out a compromise with one other character. My only complaint is that this really, more or less, is just a walking simulator; It might have been served better as a text adventure to be honest. THE GISTThe outcomes will be very different based on who you decide to “resolve” certain situations with, as well as (if any) you compromised with. I'll tell you right now. Granted, I did not try my very best to keep everyone happy however one aspect of one characters life went exceedingly well. While the rest of that characters life among the rest got sorted out in a very mediocre (almost realistic) but very depressing in its delivery sort of way. Perhaps it was due to summarizing future decades into a few paragraphs. Though to be honest, I guarantee there are far worse endings than I got.Yeah, its one of those sticky indie art games that you've already made a decision if you like or not. However, this is one of the better ones yet its still not stellar. Its interesting.Follow my curation for more "

												　　The Kaplans, a seemingly average family who've decided to spend a summer like any other, in a beautiful vacation home similar to that of any coastal holiday residence. Or not? Mama Bear, Papa Bear and Baby Bear all have down-to-earth aspirations and wishes, but that is all that is normal in this summer home. For you become the sneaky little ""Goldilocks"" of this household with your stealth abilities to possess flickering lamps and pendant lights, making invisible bounds across the entire Kaplan abode honed over decades of haunting the inhabitants of this house. As the resident ghostly entity minus any ghoulish intent, your new arrivals, the Kaplans will be your brand new pet project. To them it's their lives; to you it's another day at the office helping those unknowingly in need of your insightful guidance. Not only do you gallivant from room to room while becoming some variation of a peeper, you own a penetrative ability which allows you to delve into the minds of family members and look into their recent memories. 　　Not as bleak as I'd worried it would turn out to be from other reviews, especially by the second month, it was an interesting look into the varying perspectives of individuals making up a family. Though it doesn't provide the depth that such a game could, it did succeed at igniting the interest I had lost for more inanimate genres where clicking objects and reading excerpts from newspaper clippings and diaries to progress a set storyline had become too routine to enjoy. This is especially a great change of pace for those who often spend time playing point and click adventure games and visual novels alike. The stealth aspect adds a light edge to the boredom and personally this vanquished the tedious norm, apparent in similar games, completely. I'd also expect this to be fun for do-gooders like myself who enjoy volunteering their own points of view and choices to others in an attempt to be an aide. Every choice and chapter requires a good deal of sacrifice and has sure consequences. Decisions are difficult and this adds most greatly to the overall suspense and amusement. Gameplay in Detail (v. mild spoilers)　　Gameplay is simple enough though the tutorial offered will help accustom you. Across a period of three months, chapters will open up spanning within a single day where you will be greeted with shining letters and blinking objects on various surfaces (truly easy to spot) to click and read/look at so as to get a grasp on the recent affairs of the Kaplan gang. Something will always be of issue and this is reflected in the chapter titles, aptly typed at the beginning of each episode. As you check each clue that has opened up in a new chapter, keep an eye out for single objects which stand out as you will be asked to search for object words for each character later on (becomes a bit of a hidden object game if you don't keep an eye out). 　　As everyone goes about their lives you will drift from one hanging fixture to the next, making sure not to be spotted. Each family member has the ability to spot you if you are not possessing a light. Every time you are spotted there is a split second to dash to any visible, switched on light you can get to (trickier as you progress). Once you are spotted for longer than a millisecond, the tag suspicious pops up next to the relevant character in the tab menu* and you cannot move to a light and must flee from them and hide till they can no longer see you. If you are spotted again by that same character repeatedly in that episode, they will be spooked and there will be ramifications in relation to the choices you can make. Going through the house successfully in the shadows (or more so the light), you will notice moments during the day when each character will have their back turned so as you can creep up behind them cautiously and peek into their memories with that spectacular penetrative ability I formerly wrote of. Tommy is especially swift so after you peek into his memory it’ll help to be ready to pounce on a nearby lamp as soon as you exit it or he’ll see you. This is as thrilling as The Novelist will ever really get but for a laid-back genre of its kind it is a welcome touch which most players will appreciate. 　　After this initial accumulative stage, you move on to check the thoughts of each character and receive an object word. With the clues found in a chapter you'll decide who you'd like the story to move in favour of and this is done by clicking the object in relation to this decision. At this point the day will be over and the Kaplans will go to bed. *The tab menu is a helpful resource to keep you on track of where you are in the game even if you stop halfway and come back and I found that many features in this game focus on keeping the story and immersive qualities intact, their priority.　　Night time for the Kaplans is the only time you can walk around without need to be stealthy though you can opt to start the game in story mode instead of stealth mode where stealth is not used (not advised as may end up boring). This felt like a subjectively delightful part of the game as the player is free to stretch and move around the house, reading a new set (two) of letters or journal entries from that of past residents which open up more story for yourself, the entity that has been here long before the Kaplans came and will stay for long after they are gone. It was unfortunate that this wasn't built up on though that would have lengthened the game too much. The house was more detailed than I'd initially expected as it is superficially bland but has strong attention to the minute details (as is important to the story). So it did become a slight compulsion for me to walk down to the kitchen each night and stand by the fridge, listening to the familiar whirring of the motor then stepping back to listen to the heavenly crashing of the waves right outside the door which I lamentably could not open. Simulation sickness tip　　While playing I was happy to note that though I am usually hypersensitive, I experienced little nausea with The Novelist. The lack thereof was mostly due to the fact I was hiding in the lights and moving through them which meant a lot of the whizzing about/motion was less dominant. Even at night I would gravitate through the lights at a prompt pace as opposed to sauntering up and down the stairs and around landings as that was invariably sluggish yet still induced ever so slight giddiness.　　The idea of a visual novel or point and click adventure game with stealth as the main game mechanic seemed intriguing. It was ironic that stealth could make such games more interactive as well. This was a game I'd waited to go on sale for a while and was intent on playing despite the indifferent reviews, then nabbed as soon as I saw it during the Humble Spring Sale. I expect it has several endings more than the one I stumbled upon but I was satisfied enough with mine in which I kept the choices rounded until the end and then went with Tommy which automatically found a compromise for Linda but didn't end badly at all for Dan (you'll see what this means if you play). It was gruelling to watch the Kaplans jump for joy only to be let down after the next chapter or repeatedly depressed from the choices you make for them and I was constantly trying to find a balance without knowing whether it’d hurt or help. The narrative in this game is well done and immersive but I didn’t enjoy the voice acting for Linda as although Linda seems sweet, I didn’t expect her to sound as young. I may play again in the future to have a go at some bad endings if there are any as I have the devious mind to make Dan a world famous author and live the crazy, disorderly life of the single divorced dad with young university freshers bowing down at his feet. 　			"

												I love this game!  That could be because I enjoy story-rich games, and I'm an amateur writer.  While it is relatively short to playthrough the game on the easiest setting, there are multiple endings that are fun to experience (I'm still trying to ruin the novelist's life, after getting him through the challenge happy and successful).The stealth mode is the most fun and immersive way to play the game, though!  You'll feel more connected to the characters when you stand next to them to read their emotions or see their memories.  If the family sees you, they'll freak out because you're a ghost--but you can possess the lights in the house to escape detection.I hope they'll make a sequel about another family, to be honest!  If you're looking for a relaxing, story-rich stealth game, you should pick this one up :)			"

												I will say that I was initially intrigued by this game because of the gameplay, story and etheral feel exploring the setting.  However, the novelty of The Novelist quickly wears off.  It is, unfortunately, extremely repetitive.  It does not encourage or reward exploration, it forces it.  It forces you to search every square inch of the same 8 or so rooms over and over.  Once you do, there is no catharsis.  Every ending is happy and sad.  I get that they tried to make it like life, but it makes you feel bad and it hammers home the fact that family is good, job is bad.  There is potential here, but not executed well.			"

												A sort of ""slice of life"" simulator, where you play a nosy ghost with the ability to bend people to your will. Sort of. Actually, it's like The Walking Dead, except your choices have actual impact. No, but really. It's also like Dear Esther or Gone Home, but with a little bit more actual gameplay (I highly recommend the ""Stealth"" difficulty level), and your decisions throughout impact the entire story and the Kaplans' relationships as well as the ending. You have to balance the father's career as a writer (side note: as a writer myself, Dan hit a little too close to home), the mother's stalled career as a painter, and their son's emotional turmoil--or you can fail miserably. Doom everyone to a life of misery, focus on one family member at the expense of the others, or flail around looking for a happy medium; the choice is yours.I'd definitely recommend picking this up on sale--$15USD is unfortunately steep for such a short game--and then setting aside an uninterrupted 2-3 hours with a cup of tea or something to play it all the way through. It's well worth your time.			"

												Firstly, this game has the best premise ever. In first-person, you play a meddling ghost who ""fixes"" people's lives by telling them what to do. This is one of my favorite things to do in real life.That aside, whether you'll like this game will be entirely dependent on whether you identify with the story or not. What some people here have called ""mundane"" and ""boring,"" I would call realistic and relatable. The plot is about making various difficult and sometimes heartbreaking choices, and the sacrifices family members make for each other. Personally, I think it's very touching and well-written. I've never played another game quite like this.			"

												You play a ghost or some other kind of supernatural force whom lives in a house by the sea and that likes to 'push' or guide people's choices in life. The game revolves around a certain family living in the house for the summer and trying to sort out their issues in life. Gameplay is simple and consists of moving around the house and hiding in the lights. Only a few controls. You have to collect various evidence and memories in each chapter and learn what each family member desires and try come to the best outcome. Basically you have 3 choices and can only pick 2 at once, and it's about keeping a balance between everyone and keeping everyone happy. It's a nice little story driven game, and isn't very long. Quite fun, only grab on a cheap sale though. 6.5/10.			"

												I didn't know if I should give this game a good or bad review, but then I took a look at the price and figured out, that it's not worth 15 Euro.I read a LONG user review and I agreed with him 100% - But I will cut it down to Pros and Cons.Pros:- Nice voice acting.- An idea for a game, which I've never seen before.- A realistic story - kinda...- Bathrooms wich were NEVER used.Cons:- The family you spy on are acting like what they are. Bots. They walk around the house with no purpose. If they watch television, they do it for like 30 seconds and then go stare out a window.- Not challenging. The game is driven by the story, but I missed a challenge. It was just like watching someone else playing it.- You never get a chance of actually seeing what happens - you only read their diaries and letters telling about what they are doing.- I felt like what I chose did not have any influence on the storyline.- Graphics not that good - not bad, but if you look out the window you clearly sees that it's an image of a beach... No depth.- Failed attempt to add gameplay. You try to fly around the house while watching them by using lamps. But oh no! A lamp is tured off... So what?- There's no need for the people to be in the house, really. They could juat as well be outside while you go around reading their private letters - which is not legal!- Kinda nice music, but it's awful for this game.			"

												The Novelist was an interesting concept. The idea that you are a ghost and you affect someone else's story in a good or bad way is really appealing. Unfortunately for The Novelist, gameplay variety was lacking, the story (which is the main part of the game) was boring and predictable, and the voice acting was meh.BASICALLY how the game plays out is this: there are three people in the house. The Father, the Wife, and the Son. The Son wants to do stuff with the Father. The Wife wants to pursue art and have more family time, and the Father must deal with that crap while also trying do his work. Every level, something each character desire changes a little bit, and it is your job to find out what everyone wants, and which two people will get what they want.Also, you must never be seen by any of the residents or else you will not be able to make them happy. So you get to teleport from light fixture to light fixture. The problem is, you can almost get anywhere without going out of a safe-zone light. This makes the game TOO EASY. Though I wouldn't really expect it from a game like this, there is isn't any sort of progression for your ghostly character gameplay-wise, so your ghostly powers stay the same throughout the game.The plot is boring and uninteresting as well. Half-way through the game, I realized I didn't care for the characters at all. Everyone is so unhappy all the time, and even if you fix all their dang problems, they're just sad in the next level with more problems to fix. It's honestly most fun to just ""level up"" the dad and make no one else happy. Then his after story makes him a world renouned author who drinks his nights away in misery because his Wife left him and took the Son. You can go through the game and try to make everyone happy by balancing out their wants, but the game part of it is dull, and the story is predictable.And also, it doesn't look that great either. If for some reason, you are waffling between this and Dishonored, get Dishonored instead. It also has a predictable story where you can mildly affect the outcome, but the gamey side of it is just so much more fun and enjoyable.Final rating: Meh/10			"

												What to do what to do? Will I let Dan (the father) focus on his Novel, become a best seller but let his family life go down in a drain? Or will I focus on Tommy (the kid) who seems to have a diffcult time in school and could really use his parents at the moment to help him around? Or maybe Linda (the mother) with making her passion for painting into something real? Go around the house and find clues in what the 3 characters want, explore their thoughts and memorries. All of that is all easy till you are set with the choice, who will i make happy this time with what they want, who will i comprimise with and who will be left dissapointed. That is the novelist, pick your side and see the outcome. Only takes about 3 hours to play, but there is replayabilty, some scenes look back on what happend, how one person was dissapointed and how that made them feel or affected. There is not much action required, you can play a stealth face in which you need to hide or play the easy mode in which it doesnt mather because the family wont see you. Recommended?Yes			"

												The Novelist is, not surprisingly, a story telling game. You’re a being, a spectre or ghost. It is never explained. There’s a family of three and the entire game takes place in a small cabin in the woods. The goal? Make decisions for the family. Gameplay is.. lacking. All you do is move about the house while trying to avoid being seen. Each chapter you need to find a certain amount of items, over and over. Once you’ve found all the items, you can enter the memories of the family members to find three memory snippets, again and again. The items aren’t very well hidden, nor are the snippets which can easily be tracked by listening. This cycle repeats itself for the 9 chapters it counts. It’s mind numbingly repetitive. The story is tailored towards the choices you make, a promise made in lots of games these days. This game does deliver. For the purpose of this review I’ve ran through the game twice, making different choices each time. I’m avoiding spoilers, but you can choose to truly neglect a family member, with devastating results. While this is pretty interesting, the final outcome is given in a typewriter animation, which fails to make you care about the results. The Novelist has potential, but it doesn’t utilize a lot of it. It’s not a fun game and it doesn’t have a great story either. While the character are relatable they never really come to life inside the game – only in the diary segments which got narrated. That only leaves you with a tale with an interesting dynamic outcome, but sadly that isn’t enough to make this a recommendable title. + Your choices truly matter+ Decent cell-shaded graphics+ Fairly original± Solid voice acting, but not everything is narrated- Boring, repetitive gameplay- Too easy- Small scale - Lacking conclusion4+ / 10			"

												In this game you play as a ghostorsomething who can positively interfere with the everyday life of a family. Every level you explore the house and the minds of the residents (yes, you have mental superpowers) and decide who to help, being careful to not disappoint the others. I like the idea and the overall realization, although the character design could have been more complex and engaging. Nothing really dramatic happens, and for most of the cases the individual desires you have to support or not with your actions are somewhat stereotypical and repetitive; basically the child wants to play, the wife wants attention and the husband wants to succeed in his work. At least for me, the choices were not very difficult, in the sense I did not perceive them as very strong moral dilemmas. In my opinion the game can be tried at a low price; it is an original idea and it constitutes an affordance for some kind of phisolophical reflections on the impact everyday choices have on life. Unfortunately, it does not the same for emotions too. 6/10			"

												Really refreshing and interesting experience, although ocassionally shallow and boring will leave variety of different kind of opinions varying from person to person.It is a game that your actions and choices have certain consequences on the story and its development. I would say that the game starts slowly at the beginning, and then follows a safe line not trying to be too initiative on trying something new over the time. As I've already said, really lackluster experience, especially at the end given that the actions and gameplay focuses on you doing the same thing over and over again. The game sums up in: you trying to figure out how to help people and overcome their obstacles whether publishing a book or painting or going on a trip. You can't please everyone, hence why your actions will have different effect on people around you. Mechanics that this game tries to implement and force are nothing too astonishing, and will often be recognized as tedious after a while.I would say that this game is a solid 5/10, nothing too special, but enough to get you intrigued in this 2-3 hours long journey. Definitely worth picking up when it hits the bigger discount, but bare in mind that this game focuses heavily on story and your actions on the progression, rather than gameplay and whatelse.  "

												It's an interesting idea, certainly. A ""real life"" simulator about a family and their problems and how they overcome them. Or don't. It's also well presented, and the music is pleasant without being overbearing.Unfortunately, the story is almost entirely confined to reading notes you find around the house - you barely get to SEE the plot, it's all told through writing. In addition, the game's plot refuses to let you compromise. At the end of each chapter you have to choose who gets their own way. If you're lucky and have found enough notes for the other people, in the next chapter you can try to redress the balance. But there's very little give and take. The characters take it in turns to be selfish, and there's nothing you can do about it. This is not how people work. Certainly not people in healthy relationships.Shame. It's an interesting idea and a good plot, but there's very little interactivity besides reading about things that have already happened. There's very little in the way of game mechanics - once you've mastered flitting from light to light, reading notes and going into people's memories to...surprise...find more notes....there's nothing else to the game. You could literally watch somebody else play this game and see everything there is to see.Oh, and it's VASTLY overpriced.			"

												Reviewed for my website: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/the-novelist-game-review/The Novelist is a completely story-driven adventure in which the player takes on the role of a supernatural being that decides a family's fate. I'd even go as far as branding it as an interactive story. It was an excellent narrative experience nonetheless.The gameplay is offered in two different flavors: Stealth and Story. In the stealth mode of the game, you're challenged to not be spotted by the family throughout the entirety of your playthrough. This is easily done, but there were a few scenarios where I made a few of the characters ""suspicious"". Upon the characters catching your appearance again, they become ""scared"". Once they're scared, you're unable to choose a compromise for that chapter (more on that later). The story mode of the game is for those that just want to experience the story, without the element of stealth playing a role.Essentially, you're tasked with finding each character's own desires through their thoughts and objects they've interacted with (drawings, writings, etc.). The majority of the story is told through these writings and drawings. The game is laid out in a series of chapters, covering the events during a summer in the character's lives. The player is the one that decides what will happen during this summer. At the end of each chapter, you make a decision based on the three family member's thoughts. You cannot please all three characters, but you can select up to two outcomes, called a ""compromise"".A compromise can only be accomplished if you have learned what each character wants, well, the characters you want to choose an outcome for. Upon selecting an initial outcome, you can then select another one. This is a nice addition and doesn't make me feel so bad about the terrible choices I made throughout my playthrough. The fact that not everyone can be happy is hard to accept and The Novelist truly shows this. Makes me wonder if it is really that difficult to manage a family. It was painful for me to always put down Tommy's outcomes, but they were simply not as important as the other outcomes offered, at least, to me.The Novelist employs a very anguishing story. It's simply... depressing, the way events played out. It is very difficult to get a great outcome for the family, without at least one member being very dissatisfied (and in my case, two). The game does show how difficult a family can be, but I never realized it could be this degrading, although, the family in this game is placed under a lot more stress than what you'd expect from an average family on summer vacation.The game's graphics were great. The style reminded me of Borderlands, but the name of this style escapes me. I believe it's called ""cel-shaded"". The music in the game was also excellent, although I am a sucker for game music, heh. The voice acting was top-notch, very well done. I enjoyed having the writings read to me, but a few of them (the writings from characters that you're never introduced to) had no voice to them, which was somewhat disappointing, but understandable.The Novelist was an excellent story, easy to immerse yourself in. I highly recommend it for anyone that plays games for the story, not so much for the gameplay. It truly is a fascinating game, if played by the appropriate player.

												I was warned. Saw few bad reviews and decided to play it anyway. I mean how bad could it be? Especially that more than 3/4 reviews were positive?But believe me - it's terrible.Gameplay, music, graphics - this is fine. Or maybe i didn't cared.Game is ruined by it's main rule. Whatever choice you made - there will always be one person happy, one less happy and one totally unhappy. Also author doesn't really understand what compromise means. Also some choices are just stupid.. I mean - how much time you need to play with your kid? Or how much time you have to spend with wife/husband to not turn into strangers? You can spend hour helping you kid to build a car without throwing your work/marriage out of the window. But not in this game. Usually people talk with each other. Thats why they understand others needs. Here we can see letters to friends, boss, other familly members and very limited signs of communication between Kaplan's familly itself. They are rather like 3 selfish cats put in small room than familly on vacations.IMPORTANT RULE THAT WORKS IN REAL LIFE (consider remembering it as it might be helpful):HAPPY MARIAGE = HAPPY CHILD In the meantime I finished game with Dan and Lisa living like on endless honeymoon and having good jobs, while their son was in terrible condition, bullied and living sad life. What the ♥♥♥♥? Author attempted to show some ""adult's live"". He failed. This game is bulls***.			"

												A game that focuses on storytelling instead of action packed moments. It feels a bit like reading a book. But, with visuals, you know ? I was actually a bit bored by it, despite the game trying to tell a good story about family and the choices we make in life.The choices you make during the game will influence the life of the 3 family members. There are multiple outcomes and it's fascinating to see that so much time has been put into the individual storylines. But as a game, it's a bit flawed. Gameplay is pretty much non-existent except for finding stuff to read and recollecting memories. I wouldn't necessarily call it a game, and I think it should only be played purely for its story, but it's interesting nevertheless. Is it worth the price ? Considering its current price *and* its length (about 2 hours) I'd have to say no.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												I feel safe in saying that if you've enjoyed games like Gone Home, you'll like The Novelist. It tells the story of a family away in a rented home for three months. The father is struggling to write a novel, the mother with her painting career, and the son with all manner of social issues. A lot happens in these three months and there's something special about this particular house.It's an emotional game and it's well written. The ""gameplay"" much like in other games of this type, is largely exploratory. There's no real challenge here and if you're the type that can't handle that perhaps stay away. You'll get about three hours out of the game, but I feel like $20 is a fair price for it.It has indie limitations, but it's difficult not to enjoy the growing trend of games like these.			"

												This game forces you to make decisions you don't want to make.  It will consistently make you questions those decisions and leave you feeling uncomfortable.  As a result, though, my investment in the game and the characters therein was multiplied exponentially.  After only a short time (I completed the game in roughly 2 hours on ""Stealth Mode"") I really cared about the characters and their well-being.  As a soon-to-be father I also found that the subject matter hits a little close to home, so that probably played a factor in my emotional investment.  I recommend this game and applaud the dev for his creative work.			"

												At times funny, at others soul crushing. A really wonderful vignette into the lives of a family over the course of the summer and how decisions have far reaching concequences both personally and professionaly. The game is short - completed in about 50 mins - but has decent replay value to explore the branches and impacts of prioritising certain characters and making compromises. Really enjoyable narrative driven game.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but I just didn't feel a personal connection to any of the characters.Being in a long-term relationship, I know the most important thing to do is to communicate. Neither Dan or Lisa seem to understand that. All of the characters in this game felt selfish, which is okay for Tommy since he's a little kid, but not for the parents. Also, Tommy seemed (ironically) the least selfish of all. He just wanted his dad to be a DAD, Do the things that dads do. Nobody here seems responsible. There were no real compromises that I saw.The choices seemed arbitrarily created, and there were times when I saw a really simple compromise. Maybe say ""Tommy can have his friend over next weekend"" or ""maybe the dinner can be part of your routine, Dan."" Maybe see if dan's friend could sleep in tommy's room or on an air mattress while Lisa's parents sleep in the master bedroom and they just deal with the floor or couch for a few days. Hell, Tommy even went to day camp and the parents did NOTHING with that additional time together without Tommy. Plus, camp is where you meet new people and Tommy seemed really good at that. Plus since he was getting bullied, maybe moving schools wasn't such a terrible idea.			"

												In The Novelist, your choices really do matter. You can choose your career over family, spending time with your son over working, and so on.You follow Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write his book. He has a wife and a son. He must choose between his work and spending time with them, and everyone must make compromises. You are spending the summer in a cabin by the coast.The Gameplay is nothing special, and pretty repetitive. It is very slow-paced, but you can move faster by traveling through light-sources. You must gather various clues around the house, to figure out each characters desires and needs. It does gets repetitive, and does not invite you to play the game for longer periods of time.The music is very simple and works well with the story. The voice-acting is solid, but nothing spectacular.The story is the main part of the game, and delivers it pretty well. I tried to make choices that would fit the family best, but always ended up disappointing someone. That made me try to make up for it in the following chapter, which shows that you care for the game & characters, which I did.I believe that the game is rather good, but should not be purchased at the current price (15 euros) Wait for a sale if you wish to purchase the game :)			"

												I only bought the game because I expected it to have a good plot.. Most people praised it for the ""difficult decisions "" it has you make and for how much it makes you bond with the characters. Well, maybe it's just me, but exploring 6 rooms for some clues then browsing through some memories *so called memories,actually mostly just finding a character that only has 1 LINE to say * does not make for an interesting and engaging enough gameplay.The decisions you get to make are not as ""life-defining"" as advertised, and most of the characters' reactions to them are a bit over the top. Like, which kid,if you ON ONE DAY don't take him to the beach to play in the sand gets depressed and NEVER snaps out of it? Get real. The idea of the game is not bad, but those who created this could obviously have put more work into it .			"

Short version: 66%If you like a story that is all about narrative, you will like the Novelist. If you are looking for a game where the choices can make a large difference, or it provides anything beyond narrative, you’ll be vastly disappointed.Long version:The Novelist is a lightweight choose-your-adventure story about a family of artists: a novelist father who is struggling with his new book; a painter mother who tries to get back to work and save her marriage; and a son with great artistic potential, but serious learning difficulties.All nine chapters follow the same pattern: each family member has a problem where the solution just happens to contradict the others’ needs. You play as a “ghost” reading aptly placed notes and peeking into their memories, then you must choose one of them who gets their wish fulfilled, one that gets a half-solution, and leave one of them hanging. So, in essential, all family members have a good, a neutral, and a bad outcome. This is true for the entire game: no matter what you did in the individual chapters, the final “score” determines their individual fate, which makes the core mechanic of the game largely pointless.The narrative itself is great and the chapters randomise at each play through, yet the replay value is still quite low. So, if you don’t mind paying this much money for what is essentially a 2-hour story about a Hallmark-card family and their completely storybook problems, you won’t regret playing it. But otherwise it’s nothing but a nice artistic experiment.			"

												Completion time: 4 hoursThe most effective look into family matters I've seen in a videogame so far. Alongside Papers Please, the best use of moral decisions and a branching narrative I have participated in. These both games allow you to use real world logic rather than in most videogames where you're trying to game the system to get the best rewards. Even though I'm not married or have a family yet, or am an author, I could still relate to all the pull-and-push of a family life and how compromises can be made but not all parties will be satisfied. How tough it is to maintain a work/life balance. I feel this game will be even more relevant further down the line in my life. I have to applaud how solid the gameplay loop was (clues->memories->compromise), considering it could've been a much simpler tourist-y game like Gone Home. It definitely is still in familiar territory with the notes, diary entries, light stealth, and it's nice to see established gameplay mechanics can still be used for effective storytelling rather than resorting to cutscenes or QTEs. Also, you can still tell an emotional story without a grand tragedy, which I believe is the shorter path to create drama. Or maybe I have to replay to find out!One criticism is for the stealth stuff, it never really ramped up in challenge when earlier the game mentions that lights will start being made unavailable to possess. I didn't really use the flicker distractions that much. But that didn't take away from the game's message, just solidified that it was going for a more laidback, introspective atmosphere. Either way, don't miss out on this game.			"

												Upon reading about the gameplay, I was quickly excited to see what this game had to offer, hoping for variety and a good story. Thankfully I got both! I was also surprised to hear some rather good voice acting that I hadn't expected to find in this game, but it really helped set the immersion.The game ""was"" short, but it was very fulfilling, especially having done it on Stealth-mode. Being short, I feel I can even play it a few more times to see what the results will be like if I make different choices.Some of the choices were easy to make, some were minor, but there were a few VERY tough choices. I beat the game in a few hours, but the choices, story, and affect from the characters made this feel like it went on for days, but in a VERY good way. I'm hoping for a sequel, given that there is room for it, but I don't even feel like there's much need for any change outside of making a new story and maybe a new environment.If I had any negative comments about the game, it would be reading up on the former entries of those in the house. They were great stories too, but I felt like they didn't explain much beyond that the ghost helped people who lived there. I was hoping to find out who the ghost is or learn more about one person at a time. It seemed the stories of the past got rushed by a bit.All-in-all, I highly recommend this game. Very easy-paced, simple, and enjoyable. A nice break from more intense games or a tense day.			"

												Despite how the other reviews are saying it's a bad game, I really loved it.The graphic style was ever so unique that I was drawn to the game. I'm a person who doesn't usually cry at the end of games, but I got attached to these characters - I learnt so much about these characters and about their backstories that each outcome left me sad. This game really left an impact on me because this relates to my home life too, as a child I found myself like Tommy in multiple ways and the surrounding characters were too similar to be comfortable at times.The ending of the game was a bit abrupt in some ways but ever so touching, I actually got watery eyes in the end. I felt like I had made the right decision for the family, even though one of them was hurt in the end.Overall, I really liked this game, although since it left an imprint on me, I wouldn't be able to play it again. I highly recommend it to people who suffer from SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder), or low depression. 8.5/10 :)			"

												This game's narrative complexity in how close to reality it is is what sold it for me. The reality of every choice is very well laid out for you and there are no right answers and no way to make everything great. Some choices you make affect different characters differently and in varying amounts. Definitely worth a look. This is another video game that proves that video games at large are an art form.			"

												I think you might need a spouse and children to appreciate this game.  My guess is there's just not as much emotional impact if you don't have real life experience balancing family choices trying to make everyone happy while still taking care of yourself.The gameplay itself is very simple: you just explore a house, reading clues, looking at drawings, and listening to snippets of dialogue to figure out what each family member wants.  Then you tell the title character, Dan, which choice he should make, which moves the story into the next segment, with a brief update on each family member's progress.  There is a mild stealth element in which you can ""spook"" family members if they see you moving around, which will close off their choice.  This can be turned off if you don't want to worry about it, but I kept it on and only spooked somebody once in my entire playthrough.I found some of the decisions pretty tough, but in the end I kept a very balanced approach and got an ending in which everyone seemed basically hapy and successful.  I'm somewhat curious to try it again while pushing really hard in favor of one family member or another to see what happens, but I'm not sure I want to see the sad endings.  Overall, I don't know if three hours of gameplay is worth full price, but I could recommend this on sale.			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2015/01/novelist-napiste-vlastni-herni-story/I don't know where to start with The Novelist. It's a brand new game modell which I appreciate and I'm very happy it got successfully through its development and is now available in here. First thing that I saw was the price, I'm sorry, but it's way too high. The feeling from playing it is great, don't get me wrong, but I just can't realistically imagine that many people choosing to buy this over some AAA that have similar price.I bought The Novelist on sale and I'm happy I did. By reading the family's thoughts and finding clues in their summer mansion, you can help them solve their relationship problems and choose wether it's worth it to focus on career in stead of your dearest ones. It's like you write their story by yourself, it has many possible outcomes. You can find a compromise, although the person whom you couldn't help will react kinda overly histerically, especially the kid. I was lucky to get a good ending and that left me feeling just wonderful. 7,5/10 "

												While the story is fairly interesting and the number of different outcomes is impressive for an indie game, I honestly couldn't focus on any of that because the environments and character models, as well as the gameplay, were so incredibly drab and dull.Games are supposed to be interactive, even if that method of interaction is just Quick-Time Events (see also: Heavy Rain). This game reminds me of Myst, only instead of a mysterious island with lots of secrets you have a generic, uninteresting family of three with some not-altogether-interesting problems which you have to decide how to solve after taking a stroll about the house and finding things that unlock options for you to choose.You would get about as much gameplay out of a DVD menu, if you had your neighbor come over periodically while you were out defecating to hide your remote on you.

												It is true that there are some tragically underrated indie games that try to takle personal, emotional narratives.  This is not one of those games.The premise is actualy quite good: you are a ghost inhabiting a summer home where you stealthily uncover and influence one family's problems.  I tend to be a big fan of similarly narrative-driven indie games like Gone Home and To The Moon.  Unfortunately, this great idea is executed poorly at almost every opportunity.  The art-style is bland and repetitive, the house is small and inadequately designed, the music is boring and ill-fitting, and the levels do not get more challanging or though-provoking as the game progresses.  By the end of your two hour play-through you will have experienced an interesting but ultimately disappointing game.			"

												This is kind of a scary game if you ask me. Reality simulator of 2013, forcing you making choices like an adult.The game itself is a very interesting concept, helping to put a family together when they are in tough times. The game helps you to think about a lot of things, scary things like the reality. The stealth mode was a nice touch to the game, it adds a bit more challenge and game play.But I have to say it was a little bit disappointing. The story was a little anti-climax, as some of the other reviews have already mentioned. The game could use a bit more mechanics like save-and-load or view-all-possible-route/achievements. The note reading and mind exploring gets repetitive and boring if you try to play the game more than two times, it's my personal opinion that those mechanics could help.I got the game while it's on sale so I'd say it's worth it, the game itself holds a great concept to be explored. Although I might not have gotten the game at the full price.			"

												The Kaplan family has temporarily moved to new house, led there by the husband and author, Dan Kaplan, who is suffering from writer's block. But it just so happens that the house is haunted by a spirit. But not the ""built on an indian burial ground"" kind of spirit. This is not a Stephen King video game (a.k.a. Alan Wake). Instead, it's more the ""greek muse"" kind of spirit. Which is a nice change actually.In The Novelist, you play this spirit, flitting from light bulb to light bulb, reading minds and searching memories to discover everyone's desires influence the decisions of Dan towards the best possible outcome. This game is about balance. Balancing Dan's writing career with the individual needs of his family while still maintaining strong family bonds. While I only played it through once, I got the strong feeling that there's definitely better choices and compromises to make. You can form a limited idea of what the outcome from Dan's actions will be and how you influence Dan probably depends on what you prioritise. Do you prioritise Dan's book being a best-seller? Or prioritise Dan's wife breaking to the local art scene? Or do you help the son make friends at school?The Novelist is simple, in looks and execution. There are only three characters and you never see yourself (or even if you have a material form). I did feel that there could have been a bit more effort put towards the character models, especially the faces, in order to feel a bit more empathy towards them. But, thanks to some decent voice acting and good writing, I don't feel that the characters are as robotic as they look. It's a simple, short play through, with limited, yet solid re-playability. I'm not sure if it's worth $15 US, but definitely worth a play.			"

												I love narrative-based video games, and I strongly encourage developers to continue on that track; however, I cannot honestly recommend The Novelist simply because it falls in that category.  Though The Novelist is a creative effort and tasks the player with some interesting decisions, it falls short.  The following three aspects were the biggest trouble areas for me:  dull and repetitive gameplay, unrealistic family dynamic, and unsympathetic, flat characters.  Even in video games with a strong narrative focus, gameplay is important and should be given the proper amount of time.  In The Novelist, the player acts as a sort of friendly spirit who spies on and makes decisions for the Kaplan family over the course of nine chapters during one summer.  The player reads letters, looks at lists, checks out drawings, etc.  In fact, he/she even has the ability to explore bits of the characters' memories and read portions of thoughts.  The player can play the game in stealth mode or simply explore the characters' house freely, a decision that makes little difference in the experience.  After determining the desires of each character per chapter, the player must decide whose wishes come first, with the opportunity most chapters for a ""compromise.""   These various elements of the gameplay may sound intriguing.  After all, perhaps you enjoyed exploring the house in Gone Home or reading minds in Divinity 2.  Unfortunately, these elements sound better than they actually are in the game.  As the player, you look at the same things in the same places in the same rooms throughout the entire game.  You only hear snippets of the characters' thoughts and memories, and this makes the game drag on, even though it takes less than two hours to complete.  Perhaps the dull gameplay wouldn't be as bothersome if the story made a little more sense.  I'm not talking about the fact that you play as a spirit; I can suspend disbelief for that.  No, I'm referring to the flawed family dynamic.  Dan, the titular character, is supposedly responsible for the decisions over the course of one summer that will determine the happiness of his whole family for the rest of their lives.  What?  First of all, in what world does the way a family interacts, in normal everyday life, during one summer impact them forever without the possibility for change?  I understand that this game wants players to think about how their decisions in real life affect other people, but I don't think this family was portrayed as realistically as it could have been.  I know that the main conflict was Dan balancing his writing career with his life as a family man, but why does that make him responsible for meeting every desire of his wife and son?  Apparently there had been some strain between Linda and Dan prior to the summer, but resolving that conflict should not be solely on Dan's shoulders.  I could see how that would make more sense if I had played as Dan, but I was a third party, so it seems as if resolving family issues should be a family effort rather than the task of one person.  Even if the player was put directly in Dan's shoes, shouldn't the other two characters, specifically Linda as an adult, shoulder some responsibilty?  People have free will, and everything in life is not so black and white; there are many shades of gray.If the characters of The Novelist had been more sympathetic and truly dynamic, I think the unrealistic nature of the narrative would have been easier to ignore.  The player finds information about the three characters from various notes, letters, drawings, etc. lying about the house.  In addition, the player can read partial thoughts and memories.  Other than that, the characters are portrayed merely through text and drawings at the end of each chapter.  The character interactions are shallow, and there is little depth given to any of the characters.  Mostly, Dan, Linda, and Tommy come across as selfish and/or pathetic depending on the circumstances.  Of course, everyone is selfish to a degree, but it made me wonder how Dan and Linda ended up together in the first place.  It is pretty obvious that neither of them fully support each other's goals, yet Dan seems to be the only one made to feel badly about trying to pursue his.  I found that strange.  As I said before, I love narrative games, and I would even consider giving this one a second playthrough, despite my issues with it, if the gameplay wasn't so cumbersome.  Though I have an interest in seeing the effect of different decisions, playing The Novelist didn't connect with my emotions or affect me in any deep way.  Watching a video of the various choices and consequences probably would have had a similar effect.  My only hope with this game is that is opens doors and inspires people to continue making narrative based games.  I think that is where the true potential lies.                  "

												Above all else, The Novelist succeeds at its stated purpose: to examine the continuous struggle of balancing conflicting needs. Through the lives and thoughts of the three Kaplans, this constant give and take becomes apparent, as does the internal back and forth between their own personal needs. The player is then put into the position of deciding both whose desire will win out and also what individual needs are going to have to go unfulfilled that week. Then they must stand back helplessly while their choices play themselves out. Due to the stress involved, it's likely that more game time will be spent deliberating than exploring or interacting with the Kaplans, which is a good thing as the actual act of playing gets rather repetitive and dull. There is only a single cabin with a handful of rooms to search and an explicitly limited number of things to uncover per chapter. The experience of playing as a whole quickly changes from pleasantly defined to restrictive and joyless.In addition to guiding the Kaplans, the player is also given the opportunity to learn more about the previous inhabitants of the haunted cabin. Those vignettes, however, end up falling equally flat as they seem to avoid any real answers to the mysterious nature of the player's ghostly presence. But those shortcomings are easy to forgive, and forget, due to the slow-forming, but genuine emotional bond with the Kaplans and how their tangled lives turn out. That is the focus after all, and unless you were taking notes, that's likely all you'll remember about this flawed but brilliant game.			"

												To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]GameplayInterestingly, the game offers you two different modes at the beginning, Story and Stealth. Although the core gameplay is the same, in Stealth mode the family can see you and you must remain hidden in order to be able to influence them. You accomplish this by hiding inside light bulbs, for some reason that is never explained. Unfortunately, both modes get tedious. In Story, the game has no challenge to it and it's basically just a mix of ""walking simulator"" and choose-your-own adventure gameplay. In Stealth mode, you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out in lightbulbs, waiting for family members to walk to another room.The core gameplay consists of you reading notes and letters left by the family members to find out what they want. You can also read their thoughts and explore their memories. Ultimately, you find out what each person wants and then select who gets their want by touching the object associated with the want. Gameplay then shifts to nighttime mode where you read more notes left by the house's previous owners and can choose a compromise for another family member to at least partially get their want.There are a lot of unique ideas present in this gameplay loop that I really like. The problem is, what I have just described is the whole game and you have to repeat it for nine chapters with very little variation. What feels very fresh and interesting at the start of the game feels way overplayed and boring by the end, even though the game takes only 2-3 hours to complete. In the end, I felt that the game only really had about 30 minutes worth of ideas and the game felt very stretched and empty as a result.PresentationThe game has a great cell-shaded aesthetic and the family members all move about and act in realistic ways. I found it immersive in this way where I really did feel like I was observing a real family go about their day. Unfortunately, the graphics suffer the same problem as the gameplay, as being confined to a single house with three characters for several hours means that you are looking at the same boring rooms over and over again.Sound DesignThe music does a good job setting the tone but isn't anything to write home about. On the other hand, the voice acting is great, which really carried the game since it's mostly about listening to the internal monologues of these characters. The actors were very convincing and were able to put a lot of emotion into their lines without hamming it up.StoryEssentially, the family has moved to a remote summer home so that the father/husband can focus on writing his novel. The mother/wife is unhappy in the marriage and an aspiring artist. Their son is struggling with bullying and schoolwork. It's not the most interesting story but it is very human and the characters feel like real people. It is interesting to see how decisions made in one chapter effect the rest and what ending you get. Also welcome is a ""The story so far"" feature when you load up the game.RecommendationOverall, I felt the game just got very stale by the end but it's still a unique experience that you may like if you want a non-violent, non-competitive game focused on family drama. If you like the ""Aspirations"" part of the Sims games, you may find something to like here. For most people, however, I think the experience may fall a bit flat. "

												To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]GameplayInterestingly, the game offers you two different modes at the beginning, Story and Stealth. Although the core gameplay is the same, in Stealth mode the family can see you and you must remain hidden in order to be able to influence them. You accomplish this by hiding inside light bulbs, for some reason that is never explained. Unfortunately, both modes get tedious. In Story, the game has no challenge to it and it's basically just a mix of ""walking simulator"" and choose-your-own adventure gameplay. In Stealth mode, you end up spending a lot of time just hanging out in lightbulbs, waiting for family members to walk to another room.The core gameplay consists of you reading notes and letters left by the family members to find out what they want.

StoryThe Novelist brings the player a handful of difficult decision between life, family, and work. This occurs at the end of each chapter and it is impossible to satisfy all of the characters wants and needs which ultimately makes your decisions hard to make. The effect of each decision is designed to draw you emotionally into the characters. For example, if your decision leads to making a character unhappy, if you feel empathetic and sorry for that character then you will try and make sure in the next chapter that your decision will make that character happy.GameplayThe gameplay element is interesting at first as you get to discover the memories and needs of different characters by wandering around the house and finding clues. For example, finding a drawing or walking up to a character and viewing their memory. However, at later stages of the game this mechanic of gameplay becomes repetitive and all you feel like doing is rushing and finding out what the character wants and progress with the story. To make the game less boring in this sense, you can activate a mode in which you have to be stealthy and not be seen.ConclusionAlthough the gameplay aspect is somewhat lacking, it certainly makes up for it in the story telling department. With the many different possible endings as a result of your decisions, this is an incentive to go through multiple playthroughs to find out what can possibly happen to the different characters. For the full price of this game i would say that it probably isnt worth it if you aren't into story driven games, however if you pick up this game on sale or in a bundle i would certainly recommend playing it, even for one playthrough as it is a relaxing experience :)			"

												Today I found myself sitting at my computer, bored senseless, wondering what to do. Then I see this game's banner appear on my steam store page. It intrigued me, so I decided to watch the trailer. Needless to say the game looked interesting, and I decided to proceed to purchase it. From the minute I opened it up and from the minute I finished my playthrough, I was completely immersed and hooked into this interesting story that developed around your decisions. I have not played many games like this, but to me it seemed like an original idea, and not some kind of sims clone. The art in the game is a nice touch as well. Its sort of Borderlands-y which really attracted my attention since that cell shaded art is a kind I really enjoy.------Spoilers may lurk below.------The story mainly consists of acts in which there are around 9. These acts each have 3 destinctive endings which you as the main character find out infomation about them and then decide wether to go with the Father's, Mother's or Son's choice. However, it doesn't just stop there, these acts intertwine with each other and change the story as they go. For instance, during one playthrough I decided that I wanted the son's outcome and told the Father to fix his toy car, since I had been slightly neglecting him throughout the recent acts. After this had happened, the car remained fixed through the duration of the rest of the game. However, during another playthrough, I found myself in the same dilema, and decided against fixing the car. Throughout the rest of that game, the car remained unfixed. I thought this was a really nice portrayal of how these decisions affect things in the long run, even if it is only for small things such as a background prop. It gives the story a little bit more dpeths and the idea that your decisions do actually matter in the long run. Another interesting idea that was given throughout the game was the idea of compromise. This was when you find out another family member's wants, and decide to compromise it with another family want. E.G The father wants to work on his novel some more, but his wife wants to spend time with him. The compromise you can select is where the father works on this novel and the next night they share a small but important drink together to help them stay connected. I thought this was a really good idea since it seemed to reflect real life a bit more, giving that idea of realism. However, you can only compromise with two characters, leaving a third disappointed. During my first playthrough and more memorable playtrhough of this game, Dan got the novel finished, accepted the job in the Uni and won an award for his book. Linda developed a stronger bond with Dan, and although she didn't go to Arts of all, she didn't give up on painting and lived a generally happy life together. Tommy was my downfall, where his decisions did not seem that important to me as he was still quite young, he became isolated and was bullied. He then found himself bouncing from dead-end jobs constantly around his 20s. Saying this game is difficult would be an overstatement. It's not. But the choices are where the difficulty meter kicks in. At the end of the day your decisions help affect this families future, and by doing so the consequences are also yours. It's whether you get so inbedded with the game that you begin to feel sympathy with them. This isn't the same for all people though.The game does also have its downsides, such as the ""space bar does everything"" rule. It doesn't, of course, but a majority of the buttons require this space bar, and sometimes things can become jumbled. For instance, during one scene a character was so close to a light that it was very difficult to click on her rather than the light, which was annoying since I was playing on Stealth. Another thing is that sometimes when you click on a light, your game will begin to have some sort of mini-seizure, cause your screen to go black and then re-open itself. It doesn't close but it does get annoying to deal with if it does happen.The bottom line to this review is if you like this type of game. If you are into more story driven, stealth based games then this is down your ally indefinitely, so more RPG based. However, if you arn't into that kind of thing, and prefer FPS and action based games, I wouldn't buy this, you would get easily bored.			"

												From the moment I laid eyes on this on the Greenlight page I had a feeling it was going to be a great game.  I wasn't disappointed.The story is well written and extremely interactive.  Every single chapter's decisions affects the rest of the game.  I played through it in one sitting (a four hour sitting) though I have hardly even touched the tip of the iceberg as there were so many other choices I could've made.  Highly recommended for its in-depth and interactive story, though it is a very art-oriented game and will not fill the void if you're looking for another Call of Duty.			"

												Or, Life is Tough Simulator. The Kaplans are a family of three, each one living through their own struggles; the writing is very effective in letting their dilemmas resonate with the player: if you've ever had to make a difficult decision, prioritizing one aspect of your life to the detriment of another, there's a good chance the Kaplans will click with you.If you've liked The Walking Dead, you'll probably like this game too, even though the tone is a lot more domestic and down to earth, more slow burning than the life or death choices or gut-wrenching moments TWD has. It's also an excellent game for introducing new players to first person games, for a variety of reasons, some of which are explained below.Playing in Stealth mode is very easy, but adds a little tension I appreciated, and I'd recommend keeping it on for a first playthrough, while Story mode (which will let you explore unhindered) is probably more suited to replays, should you be interested in finding out how your decisions could have shaped the story differently.The interactive sections will have you looking for 'clues' in order to advance the story, are not challenging at all and work well to break up the game in different sections that support pacing and the sense of time passing. However, there is a degree of repetition in them, and your enjoyment of the game will likely be greater if you don't try to finish it in one sitting (two worked well for me).The music is minimalistic and fits the game very well, complementing and lending extra power to the writing, the voice work is also well done. The visuals are a little sketchy, and the environment limited, Gone Home this isn't, but it's obvious the budget and the size of the team were very different (The Novelist is a one man project), overall the artstyle works well for this game IMO, and there's just enough detail to support the interactive sections.Two thumbs up from me.

												This review contains some spoilers so if you don't want that then read another one.This game got so much right in my opinion.There are 3 characters in this game:  a father, a mother and a son. These all represent a certain aspect in the life of Dan Kaplan (the father).He himself represents his work, he is trying to make it as a writer and wants to write a book that gives him a legacy. So people will remember his name.His wife represents family life, she always wants to do stuff with her husband despite the fact that he is always trying to work. She wants to save the family from a divorce.The child represents responsibility, he wants to do stuff with his father but he never gets the chance. as the game progresses and you stop choosing his side his drawings of him and his father will become bleaker because he can feel the gap between him and his father getting bigger.This game speaks to me as a person who comes from a broken household, I do not have a preference to whom I'd choose in this game to compromise with. Seeing the impacts your decisions have on the family keeps you thinking. The biggest thing about this game is your thought pattern expanding and you keep thinking ""What if"". This is the first game ever that made me pause the game and made me think about the consequences my decision might have.This game has a lot of impact on people who have been in this situation. Or trying it and putting yourself in the shoes of the people in this game.Will you let the father finish the book? Will you let the mother have her family back? Or will you let the son have a lot of quality time with his father? And of course ""What would have happened if I choose that in stead?""This game is worth the try and it is clear that the developer poured his complete heart and soul into this game.			"

												Story-driven ""game"" where alot of the enjoyment comes from how much you can relate with the 3 members of the family: father (novelist, procrastinator), mother (artist, early mid-life crisis) and son (learning issues, bullied). In each of the 12 chapters, each member has a specific need. You get to fulfill the need of one, make another compromise and disappoint the last. These choices affect how the story plays out.The game is confined to the family's rented summer home and to advance you read through notes spread around the house, sneak up on members to explore their memories and finally make your choice. It's nothing to write home about, just a means to progress the story.I give this game a reluctant thumbs up. It really depends on your mood and how much you can relate to a story about a young family trying to keep it together. I liked how it wasn't rosy; you had to make hard decision and almost always end up disappointing someone, but hey, that's life.			"

												The games starts with you witnessing three family members, Dan (husband/father), Linda (wife/mother), and Tommy (son), going on holiday for the summer so Dan can concentrate on writing his next book without all of the distractions that being at home brings. Needless to say that even going away from home with family members will still bring it's own distractions as the family members each have specific things that they want to do whilst they are away, which don't generally include just letting Dan get on with his book.There are two ways to play this game - story mode, or stealth mode. I chose to play the game in story mode as I just find stealth generally too frustrating, and I believe that from what I got out of the game's story-telling, I definitely made the right choice personally to remove the stealth element.Your role within the game is to observe the three family members. From your observations you will find out what they each want from a particular moment in time, and from there you can choose your preferred outcome for only one character, and if you have the time and inclination to do more investigation around the house for each remaining family member, you can potentially choose a compromise for another character who didn't get their first preference. Your decisions will have an effect on what happens in the future so choose wisely, and obviously someone will always end up being disappointed.You play as a ghostly presence within the house - one that can either walk around the house in plain sight (being careful not to get spotted, if playing in stealth mode), or one that can possess the lights/lamps within the house to travel without being seen. You can only be spotted by the family a small number of times in stealth mode per chapter, and after that you lose your ability to influence the choices the family make; however in story mode you can walk around at will which I found to be a much more enjoyable choice for how I wanted to play the game.In order to find the outcomes for the family members each day, you do this by reading notes/books/pictures that are strewn around the house, and by reading the memories of each family member and walking around the house playing as each character in turn finding clues as to what they would like to achieve.I found this game to be incredibly atmospheric. From the music to the cell-shaded visuals, it gives a sense of isolation in the big house on the cliff. Seeing how this (almost) visual novel plays out from your own choices I found to be a very personal and emotionally engaging process. I would also praise the voice acting as it really adds to the personality of the characters and the ongoing story.It is a little frustrating at times having to walk around the whole house at least 6 times if you want to find all of the outcomes/compromises for the characters, particularly when the family are all walking around doing their own thing, but in general that still didn't spoil the atmosphere for me. There were a couple of moments where the outcomes and compromises that I had to pick seemed a little bit unrealistic in terms of how quickly the family could seemingly start to fall apart, but I managed to pull it together enough for each character to get a mostly positive ending for all family members.This certainly isn't a game for people who want something action-packed, but if you want to be engaged with somewhat challenging decisions, character relationships and atmosphere, this would be a game I'd recommend trying, though I'd maybe wait for a sale to pick this up, as this is a short 2(ish) hour play-through for a £10.99 price-tag.

												The Novelist is a game about the intricacies of living and ultimately, the compromises one must make in life. The game offers an engrossing, albeit fleeting, experience. Your mission is to influence the actions of a cottage's inhabitants covertly as some random wayward spirit. The Novelist is a decent game, and it achieves what it sought to, but the price is far too substantial for such a short, simple game.  "

I honestly really enjoyed this game. I've read some of the other reviews, yes it was quite repeitive, yes it was quite simple. But I mean for a simple game with a nice story line, I'm the type of person who actually likes ot play games with decision. Although I wish the story went quite longer, I would hope to have a sequel to this game if anything. I really enjoy it. To make decisions based on what you feel like doing, cause in the end this game could be a life lesson, what if we really did blow off time with family to get our work done? It just shows the possibility of everything.			"

												The Novelist is a solid story-driven game, its far from reaching the highs of the best story driven games and it has its flaws but it kept my interest enough. The main focus is exploring the house and locating enough items and memories to figure out the family’s problems and to choose how to solve them. It exploration isn't as well executed as Gone Home, but it works fine enough. I played the mode where you don't have to hide because I felt like the hiding mechanic was just tacked on in order to try and make it more of a traditional game and it really isn't necessary. The consequences of your actions aren't super complex but they change it up enough to make it interesting and leave it open for replays. If you're up for something different give The Novelist a shot, especially when  its on sale.			"

												Novelist in a very interesting game, and one that I enjoyed more than I expected, actually!When I started, it felt very much like Gone Home, only with more characters than objects to help you piece the story together. Also, there is a ghostly mystery surrounding the whole thing. Too similar, I thought. However, by the end, this succeeded for me, as a result of the choices you make throughout the game.In fact, if you can identify with some parts of the characters, this game can really make you question a lot, not just about the game. Each choice felt significant, with trying to balance each character's goals with their problems, and I often had to ""put myself in their situations"", which worked surprisingly well!I've played the game once and I'm satisfied with that. Replaying it would probably destroy some of its charm. There are tiny things the change as the game advances, and the whole thing comes off very coherently.Also, very nice music! And it's done in a unique way: as I understood it, the music is procedurally played, meaning, the game has a pool of little musical phrases/scales, and they play at random. A bit like Thomas Was Alone.As a result, the music is not memorable at all, but rather textural. It sets the ambience very well. I thought it totally fit the experience, being very calm and serene, with some moments of dissonance. I'll be listening to the OST. If you want some narrative experiment, give this one a go. It has non-trivial interaction, for once! Solid recommendation, on this one.			"

												I spent most of my time following the story, waiting for things to fall into place enough for me to be able to piece things together effectively. I though I was a detective to be honest, I actually thought I was Vera (ITV Crime Drama series) because of the out-in-the-woods location.What I love about this indie game is that not only do you have the ability to play the game in storytelling mode or stealth mode, but the fact that the family don't have full facial qualities means that you're left with just their general demeanors to read.I won't spoil the plot, but what I will say is that you're on a temporary vacation and there's a lot riding on it. It's actually a pretty common storyline and many have gone through it before. It can feel slightly deflating however, when you finally 'crack the case' so to speak, not least because of the pond-life nature.It definitely is worth it if you've got a couple of quid just begging to be spent.

												The Novelist is a great idea for a game, and it manages to mostly deliver on its premise. The idea of a branching narrative based on the decisions made by the player, interestingly a novelist, is something that has tremendous promise and has generally been carried out well in Telltale Games. Here, in the Novelist, the choices the player makes do, in fact, guide the story though it does so artificially. I say that because the choice the player is faced with are usually those that pit the various family members against each other in situations that would not necessarily present themselves as opposing ideals. While the no-win situations presented in The Walking Dead make sense thematically and situationally, the ones presented here just feel forced. I do like the idea of the game, and think that this game is actually very well done, despite some of its false feeling delivered by the decisions, and the ultimately tough outcomes the player will receive. Regardless, the decisions you make do create some interesting situations. The graphics are good, the music is fitting, and the game is good for a playthrough or two. "

												I was looking forward to this game for a while, and I was not dissapointed. The Novelist allows you to play as some sort of ghost/spirit thing, that haunts (that makes the game sound cliched, but its not) the house that a family of three have decided to stay in for the entirety of their summer. You have to find different clues about each family member's thoughts on a situation, each chapter covers a different situation, such as Tommy (the son of the family) experiencing severe learning disabilities, or deciding what to do with Dan's inheritance when a family member of his dies. It is possible to choose one decision or to compromise and combine two, and making each of the people less happy but happy enough. There will always be at least one family member left dissapointed, and thats what makes the game great, it really makes me care about the family, and thinking that I need to do more to assist them, such as getting Dan to do some work as opposed to getting him to make sandcastles with Tommy. (I do this all the time, now Dan is about to lose his job and is on the brink of divorce, at least his son likes him) Different clues to the history of the house can be found whilst the Kaplan family are sleeping, and it is possible to explore the memories of the different family members. I strongly recommend the game.			"

However, by the end, this succeeded for me, as a result of the choices you make throughout the game.In fact, if you can identify with some parts of the characters, this game can really make you question a lot, not just about the game. Each choice felt significant, with trying to balance each character's goals with their problems, and I often had to ""put myself in their situations"", which worked surprisingly well!I've played the game once and I'm satisfied with that. Replaying it would probably destroy some of its charm. There are tiny things the change as the game advances, and the whole thing comes off very coherently.Also, very nice music! And it's done in a unique way: as I understood it, the music is procedurally played, meaning, the game has a pool of little musical phrases/scales, and they play at random. A bit like Thomas Was Alone.As a result, the music is not memorable at all, but rather textural. It sets the ambience very well. I thought it totally fit the experience, being very calm and serene, with some moments of dissonance. I'll be listening to the OST. If you want some narrative experiment, give this one a go. It has non-trivial interaction, for once! Solid recommendation, on this one.			"

												Now, some say this games story and choices are superficial and predictable. Obviously, these guys lack understanding for real social intercourse, let alone true family life. I'd like to point a few things out:When you were a kid, what did you want to do all the time? Think about it, silly. Play. Yep, thats what it was probably. All the time and under any circumstances. Or, at least, have some genuine fun (to be honest, thats what I'm seeking in my life even today, otherwise why the heck would I be playin' games instead of being productive in the traditional sense?).But did that really mean that you just wanted to simply 'play'? Wasn't there something 'deeper' going on in your head at the time? Maybe feeling your parents love or making a great experience with friends and family, something you would share for a lifetime? Building a secret hideout with your best friend, observe the people passing by and feeling all secure cause they appear to not notice your hidden cave? Showing off your new toys to your dad, silently hoping he would be just as amazed by it as you were? You tell me. I, for one, did have this kind of feelings. Although it may have looked all the same from the outside, there were some pretty amazing stories hidden beneath these 'superficial' ""Come on dad, I need to show you something!""s. And if you don't get these emotions, you either never went through childhood or you're the best example of our self-alienated, objectified masquerade which we're used to call 'culture'. The outcomes of the choices you make in the game are in not in the least bland or predictable. Of course, due to technical limitations (the whole story happens in just this one house, you don't get to see animated visuals of the outcomes etc.), the emotiveness of, in some cases, life changing decisions has to fall short of ones expectations. But in the end, the important connections between the events and the complicated nets of relationships in a family and its acquaintances have to be something you cannot but ponder on for hours. Also, it simply wouldn't be in favor of the game to try and 'show off' anyone and everything. Sometimes it's just better to not let one more supernumerary walk onto the stage. He's just an psychological element in the protagonists mind and therefore should be presented as such.In the end, the game did present a spot on realistic emotionality. It's not as daydreamy as in 'To the Moon', which's story is extraordinarily compelling, but which on the other hand lacks some interdependency between the real world and the alternative, parallel-universe. There are connections between these realms and as such they have to affect unto each other in a dynamic sense. This is exactly what 'The Novelist' does just right. Every character in the game broods over his very own feelings, stares into nothingness, pondering his/her possibilities and doubtfully asks the 'What if..?' question. But at the same time, the chars are actually aware of their presence in the actual situation, with all the barriers and complexicities you set up for their lifes by making tough calls. To me, 'The Novelist' presents a piece of completeness that, aside from technicalities, could hardly be topped in any way. "

												This game is really ♥♥♥♥ing deep.I played it after struggeling with life decisions. It opened my eyes, brought me to tears.It does not have a lot gameplay, but tells a quite interesting story in which you have to decide which family member gets the attention and steps closer to their goal. The Mother who wants to be an artist? The father who wants to publish his book as a novelist, or the child which needs attention from the parents.Dig deep into this ocean of feels.			"

												You play as some kind of ghost in the summer home of a family of three. In each chapter, you must make a decision: Who will you make happy? But this always means someone will be disappointed. Each choice will affect which ending you get.Interesting but I found it sometimes bleak. The graphic style is simple but attractive, also like the music.The game is quite short, which I think makes the default price tag way too high.This isn't bad, I just think it could have been a lot better.

												Good idea, unfortunately the game falls short.  My biggest flaw with it was no option of compromising.  At the end of every chapter you chose between 3 options, each being the desire of one of the characters.  You can pick a secondary option, but it seems like a complete afterthought and poorly implemented. The review by Hamakei pretty much nails the problems with the gameplay and the story.  This was one of the first games I played through with my girlfriend and while we were invested in the story and at times enjoyed the game for what it was, it is just lacking too much for me to recommend it to anyone especially at the asking price.  I got it on sale (as with a vast majority of the games in my library) but even so I can't recommend it.  If it is ever heavily discounted and you are interested in story driven games then pick it up, but most of the time for most gamers this is a disappointing game not worth what it offers.			"

												It's truly hard to recommend or not recommend this game. The Novelist is story-driven narrative adventure about a family ending up on summer vacation. By collecting  clues around the house, reading thoughts and exploring memories of three family members, you need to decide the course of their vacation, but also a course of their future. Dan is a struggling writer, Linda is his wife and upcoming artist and Tommy, their son - well, he's a son and he has some problems and he's in dire need for some parently love.Can you make Dan write his book without pushing away people he loves?The gameplay mechanics are interesting at first, and by ''first'', I mean first twenty minutes of your game time. You collected 3-8 clues placed almost on the same places in the house in every single act, you read thoughts by entering heads at the same locations throughout the game and by the end of second act (nine acts in total), you're shutting down stealth mode and playing story mode which differ in Kaplan family abbility to see you. The concept of using lights to hide away from Kaplans is interesting, but since their AI is not challenging at all, it gets pretty frustrating in a bad way. So you shut it down, move like a real ghost, collect clues by clicking, reading and listening and you're done after 1.5-2 hours.The story should be the selling point of this game, and let's be honest - it's not. It's cliched, emotionless and dull. Although at first I've truly wanted to feel heartbroken when I didn't fulfill wishes of a family member, I've discovered I didn't care about any of the characters at all - they're shallow and uninteresting. Game deals with some usual questions - work vs private life, alcoholism, priorities, ego vs your kids, but The Novelist doesn't have to offer anything revolutionary nor new in any way. I've wanted to play it again to discover new endings (if any), but the characters and gameplay are so dull I'll just not do it. And I'm sorry, but I can't force myself into loving it.Now, to be honest - It's hard to recommend or not recommend this game. Quite certainly, I don't recommend it at all with this price tag - 2 hours of pretty thin story and non-memorable characters, with flaw and repetitive gameplay can't really justify 14 €. However, if you get a chance to get it like I did on some Humble Bundle sale or something like that for a price tag of 2-3 €, get it, especially if you're into playing something a bit different.			"

												9/10 - One of the best novel/epistolary driven game experiences since Dear Esther. If you are looking for action - it's not for you.I've completed the game just now, and I would say that I am freaking amazed how a simple idea can make such a wonderful, soul-soothing, but at times - heartbreaking experience. It is a wonderful story about a family, the story that is shaped by YOU. You are a ghost, indeed, but it is not really about that. The game is called ""The Novelist"" because, despite the fact that Dan - the father in this family - is trying to write a book, you are actually the one who is writing a novel. You are writing a novel about the life of this family, and you make actions that are shaping the story, and I am sure this game has multiple endings, depending on what choices you make. Dan is trying to write a novel, his wife Linda is trying her luck at painting pictures. Their kid Tommy is trying to adapt to the new environment in new school and tries to deal with dyslexia. You choose who gets the momentum, and who will be dissapointed with their days. Sometimes you will try to make VERY TOUGH descisions.... Thats how the gameplay works, and your actions will lead to different branches of the story...I cried in the end, most of the actions I did were trying to help everyone... But that is not always how it is in real life. I cried in the end because I am going through the exact moment of my life right now. It's either my career, or my family. And in this game - i chose family. And now I am quite sure that this is what I am going to do in my life.I salute you Orthogonal Games for writing and developing such a good, mesmerising story that could actually make me think about my choices, and maybe think about life and family in general.I am giving this game 9 out of 10 for creating one of the best emotional experiences i've had in a while. This game made to shed a tear even though I am a grown man. *<[:D  I will take 1 point from this game because I didn't feel the gameplay gave me just a little bit more freedom to explore the house or the outsides and sometimes it felt a little bit repepetive and very straightforward. I felt it could have a bit more on the visuals, i mean the outside terrain could be improved (sometimes i am very picky on details) But other than that - it is amazing.			"

It is concise enough to draw me in despite my short attention span, and the outcomes of my decisons were sometimes tough enough to give sum real feels.  Some people say it can be depressing but I did not find this to be the case.This game does not have the over-the-top production value of a Telltale Adventure game, but this is fine because its portrayal of dynamic characters is still conveyed.  A comparable game is Gone Home which is also good.			"

												The Novelist was such a superb game; just what you'd want from an indie title. The game is basically a story about a family struggling to balance priorities. Your role is to help nudge the decision making along the way. You play as some kind of paranormal entity that moves around the house unseen and silently influences the choices that the characters make.The actual gameplay is very limited but the story here is excellent. It's a lovely story, brilliantly voice acted, and the whole thing just has a unique style to it that's hard to explain but really works.It has replayability too because in each chapter you cannot please everybody; you have to make compromises and so by the end of the game you wonder how it might have turned out if you'd made different choices. The game is fairly short and I wouldn't pay full price for it (I obtained it through trading) but if you see it on sale then snap it up!			"

												Do you get enough from monsters and the complex scenarios. The Novelist is the game you need to play to relax your mind. There is no fight and supernatural things. This is a totally warm family story.Father Dan is a writer who wants be successful in his writing career. Mother is a painter who wants to sell her paintings and be famous. Little boy Tommy is just an innocent little boy and he just wants to play with his toys. You are the invisible person controlling their destiny. You need to make some difficult choices to give what do they want. This game has a good atmosphere and you can feel the responsibility game gives to you.+Relaxing piano soundtracks+Nice graphics that reflects the atmosphere+Good gameplay mechanics+There's no cons for me :)I recommend this game to all indie lovers.

												The Novelist is a narrative adventure-ish game. You play as the ghost of a vacation house in the countryside. Your guests are a family of three: the novelist Dan Kaplan, his wife Linda and their son, Tommy. The game is subdivided into twelve chapters, each of which is characterized by specific problems the family faces, such as a death in the family, a drinking problem, or scheduling visitors. For each chapter, Dan Kaplan has to make a decision. You as the ghost spend your time figuring out what the family members want and desire by wandering the house and the family's memories. You then have to influence Dan by telling him what he should do in his sleep.The mechanics of the game are easily understood and executed. The difficulty of the game rather lies in making the decisions for the family, as you will see that they affect the rest of the characters' lives. As you can turn different ways in each chapter, the Novelist is a game that can be played over several times.The game is an affectionately told contemplation about our life choices and what we sacrifice for our family, for love, for our dreams.

												Writing is a hard, draining task. So are the restrictive controls in this game, if you don’t happen to be in the privileged in-crowd. Barring that, it’s a truly unique micro-society of a man, a woman and their child, trying to come to terms with their internally connected relationship with each other. Familiarity is the motivating factor in this quiet, spacious house that’s trying to be a home, with or without your extended guidance.			"

												This is a diffult one to review. You essentially play as a ""ghost"" ina  families house, track down relevent clues and read the minds of the inhabitants. In a way you play the role as an almost ghost social worker, picking and choosing which outcome or compromise for each character you will decide. No doubt, this is a pretty innnovative title. Does innovative make a good game? not neccesserily, and I think the gameplay is where this game falls flat. In fact, it isnt a game, and it isnt really that entertaining of a story either. It reminds me of those ""choose your own adventure"" books.So far I have been sneaking around ( I recommend you disable this mode, it makes the game even more tedious) and choosing the destiny of the various characters. I can see that clearly many different endings are possible here, but I couldnt imagine why anyone would want to play this game(loosely used) again to see alternate endinds?Right now I am 105 minutes into the game, and I would like it to conclude.After 2 hours I completed story and wasnt overly amused, nor moved at all by the rudimentary storyline. I cant say this was interesting, entertaining or intriguing. Therefore, I do not recommend this game.  "

												What is The Novelist?Genre: first person exploration game for adultsSetting: family on vacation trying to solve problemsDifficulty: 3/10 --> basically easyLength: 2 hours for a single playthroughMode: singleplayer campaignFirst of all: The Novelist is a game for adults. It confronts you with interpersonal situations you will encounter in your adult life (or have encountered yet). It is about taking responsibility, making decisions and achieving a balance in a family's needs.You play some sort of a poltergeist observing a family on vacation in a secluded house. The family consists of Dan, father and writer who is facing writer's block and has to finish his latest novel; there also is Linda, Dan's wife and former artist, trying to get a grip on her marriage with Dan and to start over her working career; and there is Tommy, their little boy struggling with grapho legasthenia and the need for playmates.Now, in every chapter you read their thoughts, find out about each of their needs and have to decide which sounds the most important to you to have this character make a progress. At the same time, the other two will be disappointed. As you can choose another one for a compromise, you might soften negative aspects for one further character.Eventually the player is absolutely free in his decisions; you can push forward only one character, letting both the other two drop badly; you can try to make them all happy; depending on what you choose the story developes further.And that is why I would recommend the game: How would you decide? What is your priority? And, in the end, how would you rate your decisions made?Really worth the price - and even more the experience!			"

												Interesting ideas in this game. Exploring thoughts and memories of a small family and making choices as to how to solve their problems. Reminds quite a bit of Gone Home, and maybe a little bit of The Walking Dead/The Wolf Among Us games from Telltale. The game itself isn't very challenging, its more just finding out about the family and deciding on the choices to make. Quite an unusual game, but not a bad attempt at a new game design.			"

												I like the idea of this game. I like what they were going for. Unfortunately the family's AI is too simplistic for the whole game to not feel uncanny. I can't bring myself to care about these people's lives because they feel like automatons, just shumbling around the house and muttering generic greetings to each other all day. On top of that the voice acting is bad enough to be immersion breaking on its own. But by far the most infuriating thing about this game is how often i feel like it's insulting my intelligence. Like, it's painfully obvious what each character wants just from reading their thoughts, seeing their memories, and watching their behavior, but you're REQUIRED to search all around the house for multiple scraps of paper they left lying around for some reason, that tells you what you already knew. And maybe i'm just a moron but throughout my entire experience with this game i never found a clue for Dan.			"

												In nine chapters, the player gets a glimpse at the ""complicated family life"" for Dan, his wife Linda, and their son Tommy. You play as a ghost/spectre-like figure that ""haunts"" the summer home Dan and his family have rented. The object of the game is to help everyone in the family be successful at their desires without having to sacrifice the desires of any of the other family members.I still don't really know how I feel about this game. I was so hype on this because the story sounded amazingly fantastic and something really deep and hipster: exactly what I'm into. It's also got elements of being a visual novel (my favourite type of game). But the writing felt like it was lacking and the side story with all the journal entries scattered throughout the house felt out of place and unnecessary.After my first playthrough, I don't know if I can recommend this game to the majority of Steam users. It's definitely got its niche market and while I hope this game succeeds and gains popularity, I can't say I have faith that it will.(Also, the meta at the end of the game was hella cheesy and I don't know if I appreciated it...but I totally did because it made me go 'so meta much lol wow'.)

												This game is a boring Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book. The characters are too archetypal to achieve any real characterization or depth, the choices are uninspired and telegraphed, and the visuals wear thin very very quickly. The voice acting is fine, but it is almost always delivered over letters or other text pop-ups the player is unable to walk away from. Forcing a player to stare and their screen for a minute or more at a time while delivering the same information twice is the antithesis of interactive storytelling. Whatever potential power the branching choices have is lost by their predictability, in both choice and outcome. I found myself bored with The Novelist, falling into a repeatable routine and waiting for the game to end. This is not worth your time, nor your fifteen dollars.			"

												The outcomes of the decisions are extreme, with each person practically ready to commit suicide over every little thing they don't get.  There's no ""family"" here.  Only a few of the decisions have them act like one (mostly her choices!) and still the others throw a fit, with little Tommy refusing to play with his toys for weeks.It's so bad, that I'll just spoil the ending for you:  If you pick the writer, the others basically fail at life.  If you pick the wife or child, the writer fails at life.It's the kind of binary choice that gamers keep saying they hate, and here it is in black and white.  Sometimes literally.			"

												We’re simply not used to having real emotional reactions to video games. Sure, some titles are getting better at it, but for the most part that’s something truly lacking in the medium. There is tons of adrenaline but not much else. The Novelist stirs up feelings and makes you want to bend to Linda and Tommy’s needs. But then that brings us back to the whole overarching concept of the game: there may not be a possibility to manage everyone’s wants and needs. If you haven’t been scared off by the concept it presents, then The Novelist shall likely prove a worthwhile experience.			"

												The Novelist is a unique game where you take the role of an apparition that resides within the Kaplan family's summer home. As you co-exist with the family you can go through their journals, look at their letters and even read their minds in order to get an understanding of their mindset.Dan is a novelist, married to Linda who is a keen painter and together they have a young son, Tommy. The game requires you to understand these characters and help Dan make choices that can have profound consequences. Every action has a consequence and in the Novelist these consequences can be far reaching and have lasting implications. This motivates a player who is even remotely invested in these characters spend time exploring the house, find every journal or letter and consider their choices carefully. It is not a particularly long game, however the length is appropriate for the limited gameplay. While your main objective is to investigate the house you must also not been seen by a member of the family. To achieve this, you are able to move around the house out in the open or you are able to jump between light fixtures without being seen. As the game progresses, lights are turned off making it more difficult to remain incognito. The variety of choices will result in every player having a different experience with the Novelist. The story moves on at an unhurried pace which may be offsetting for some. Likewise despite the relaxed pace it seems to end quite quickly. I finished the game in two hours and have no immediate intention to play it again. I am sure there are many who will question whether the price of the game is worth two hours of gameplay.I, for one, think that it is. The Novelist is a gameplay experience like no other with a unique premise, interesting characters and difficult decisions that will help engage you.			"

												""And so he sat down, Looked at the choices, And then wrote his novel""About:The Novelist is an interactive story game, while this may be nothing new to the industry The Novelist is focused on one thing and one thing only, Story. The story revolves around three members of a family known as the Kaplans and thier trip to an isolated cabin during the summertime. You are a ghost that lives in this cabin. As the summer goes on you will learn about the family, thier lives before coming, thier problems, and thier hopes and dreams. And you will play a part in changeing thier lives. Cons:Lets get some of the cons out of the way. The graphics are nothing, (though i image if youre into these types of games you dont care much for them) they're not special and certainly not high end. While its art style maybe somewhat different with is almost painted look it's certainly nothing you'll remember. In addition gameplay is paracticlly nonexsistant. Every chapter consits of looking around the house for clues and reading the memories of the family and then choosing from three options. The ""stealth"" mechanic is never really used to its full potential as everyone leaves rooms quickly enough to just wait and even if you are spotted it takes alot before they become spooked and thier option becomes locked. Pros:However none of that matters if you love a good story. The kaplans feel like a real family stuck facing difficult decsions that every family must make. At the end of every chapter youll have 3 choices to choose from. These choices feel real because no matter what you choose someone is always disappointed and there is always a consequence, just like real life. If you do good in each chapter you are also rewarded with a compromise, however this is only a half ending for whoever gets the compromise. So rather than getting 2 out of 3 happy endings you get 1.5 which is great because it forces you to make tough decisions. And even if you think you have it figured out and know which direction you want the story to go in the game will throw a curveball that may make you change your ideas. Verdict: 7/10To call it a game would be wrong, more like an interactive novel. However its story is still a great one that will force tough decisions that every family must go through. If your a fan of games like walking dead and to the moon youll be right at home here.Price:?Now what you should pay for this game is quite difficult. Paying full price is nice and good to helping out a small indie devloper. However $15 may be a bit much for a game that will only last 3-4 hours. And while it may have different endings this is the kind of game where youll only play once to see the ending that you would always choose. If you do intend to buy wait for a sale, even a small one like 10% off. You'll feel like you got much more bang for your buck and still get to enjoy a great story. The Honest Reviewer			"

												First off, the cons. It's a bit overpriced for what it is and has limited reply value. But my God it will get to you. It's a horrible game about the compromises we have to make between the different obligations in our life - do you focus on your novel? Your struggling marriage? Supporting your son at a key moment in his life? It's a constant balanacing act. You will fail and let people down regularly. In the end, I'd been a decent father and husband and had written a terrible novel. As a writer myself that was pretty humbling. It made me examine my decisions and values.  Ultimately, most of the games I play are escapist. The Novelist isn't at all. It's not about being a ghost, it's a game about being an adult and making adult choices.			"

												The Novelist is a game that explores the big question: love and family vs career. This game focuses on one particular family which you ""haunt"" to try and discover (and ultimately influence) their life story. Each chapter explores a new aspect to the family (a novelist, his wife and thier son) and every choice you make will affect the members of the family and not everyone is ever satisfied with your choices. Your choices will affect your overall ending.I would highly recommend this game for an interactive story into a families life where you spend most of the game trying to decide who would be the least upset by your decisions.

												I'm squarely in the new-dad demographic, so this game probably has an unfair advantage. :-) That said, I think it would be enjoyable for anyone interested in a quiet, contemplative, story-driven experience that you can play through in a small number of hours.The characters in this family are fleshed out in *much* greater detail than in most games, which makes sense. In _The Novelist_, backstory is not window-dressing to make you care slightly more about (say) running down a hallway shooting bad guys; instead, backstory *is* the game.The tensions and tradeoffs in this little family really rang true to me, especially as someone with a career, a wife, and a child, and all of us trying to juggle and find balance, just like the game's characters. My wife watched me play through one of the chapters, and she ended up crying (but in a good way). Like me, she was a bit floored at how ""real"" everything felt.My one nit is with the forced-choice mechanic employed in each chapter. At ""best,"" you can make one of the three characters very happy, make a second character moderately happy, and leave the third character out in the cold. I understood and felt how the game was trying to really force me into the mindset of limited time+resources where I had to make hard choices for the family. But by the end this particular mechanic seemed itself seemed a bit forced and forumulaic. I would have loved for the game to mix it up a bit, be less predictable, and find some other ways to present me with hard choices where not everyone gets what they want.Still, it was a great experience overall, and I highly recommend the game to anyone who's looking for a few hours of contemplating family, work, life, and all the cracks in between.

												This story-based 'puzzle' game is about juggling the wants of three members of a family, who start off in a bad position. By choosing who's desires to follow, who to comprimise with and who to ignore for the chapter, you will work out the family problems and attempt to fix them. Think that this is simple? you play as a ghost, who must use the lights to travel if you want to remain unseen, and interact with the world around you to find these individual wants and desires.I really enjoyed this game, and would strongly recommend it!

												The Novelist takes an interesting and novel enough approach to a choice-based game. I liked the basic gameplay of choosing between the three characters' wishes and exploring their home/memories, although it made every level feel largely the same. I also enjoyed the general atmosphere of the game and thought it was executed very well. I do wish that the choices affected the game a bit more than they did - as it is, a chapter's choices change the ending to their chapter, the placement of some objects around the house, some thoughts the characters have, and the endings seem more quantitative than qualitative (choose everyone's choice enough times and everyone lives happily enough, don't and some people are happy while some suffer).But overall, while the story's nothings exciting, it's very easy to relate to and empathise with, and the execution makes it an enjoyable experience as well as a well thought-out work of art.I'd recommend buying this game, but given the short play-through time and existing but limited replay value, I'd only recommend getting it on sale.

												First let me say that I found it a better game when I turned off the 'stealth' mechanic and just went through the story. I found the stealthy aspect just slowed the pace of the story down for no real reason.It was great to play a story game like this (or Gone Home) where you actually have an impact on the story rather than just finding parts of the story around. While the problem with A B C choices will always leave you thinking 'in real life I would have done D' but I think generally the choices were sound and I felt happy with my with how I affected their decisions. To some degree I did feel the game got a little repetitive when you have to start hunting for the new clues to move the game along each time but the story was good enough that I got immersed in it. I originally wanted to hate the characters but in the end I felt the writing was good enough to help me establish a connection with them and forgive them for their foibles, making them feel a little more realistic and somewhat loveable. If you enjoy story-based games such as Dear Esther and Gone Home, you'll enjoy this too.			"

												If there's one thing I've learned in adulthood, it's that free time is the most precious limited resource we have. The decision to do anything in life is at the expense of countless other potential activities, which is the fundamental struggle I deal with while playing video games all the time. Where will you invest your free time? Your writer's block? Your broken marriage? Your needy son? You can't do it all.The Novelist is a game about family, priorities, and compromise.Perhaps the game's most brilliant coup is casting you in the role of a ghost. It would be easy and incorrect to assume that the player character is the novelist himself. You, the ghost, work behind the scenes as an observer of the experience and can only help to influence the thoughts of the novelist. You the Player decide where he invests his time, and that decision (made at the end of each chapter by whispering suggestions into his ear while he sleeps) affects his wife, his son, and his career.Why is this so brilliant? It's a question of agency. If you controlled the novelist directly, you might get frustrated by the family's inability to communicate successfully. In fact, you might feel that frustration anyway, since each character begins the game with wildly different needs. ""Aren't I working on my career for the sake of my family?"" you might ask yourself as the novelist. ""Can't my family accept that a few months to myself will pay off in the long term?"" ""Why can't I make compromises that please everybody?"" ""Why can't my wife and son spend time together without me?"" These are all valid questions....but you are not the novelist. You are just a ghost. This is the rare game where your limitations as a player work within the context of your character, and your limited and indirect effect on the game world makes total sense.In the end, while you can only set the stage and watch it unfold, the way the game makes you think remains powerfully human. How do I take care of my family? How do I balance my goals and their needs?What will make me a happy person?			"

I liked the basic gameplay of choosing between the three characters' wishes and exploring their home/memories, although it made every level feel largely the same. I also enjoyed the general atmosphere of the game and thought it was executed very well. I do wish that the choices affected the game a bit more than they did - as it is, a chapter's choices change the ending to their chapter, the placement of some objects around the house, some thoughts the characters have, and the endings seem more quantitative than qualitative (choose everyone's choice enough times and everyone lives happily enough, don't and some people are happy while some suffer).But overall, while the story's nothings exciting, it's very easy to relate to and empathise with, and the execution makes it an enjoyable experience as well as a well thought-out work of art.I'd recommend buying this game, but given the short play-through time and existing but limited replay value, I'd only recommend getting it on sale.

												First let me say that I found it a better game when I turned off the 'stealth' mechanic and just went through the story. I found the stealthy aspect just slowed the pace of the story down for no real reason.It was great to play a story game like this (or Gone Home) where you actually have an impact on the story rather than just finding parts of the story around. While the problem with A B C choices will always leave you thinking 'in real life I would have done D' but I think generally the choices were sound and I felt happy with my with how I affected their decisions. To some degree I did feel the game got a little repetitive when you have to start hunting for the new clues to move the game along each time but the story was good enough that I got immersed in it. I originally wanted to hate the characters but in the end I felt the writing was good enough to help me establish a connection with them and forgive them for their foibles, making them feel a little more realistic and somewhat loveable. If you enjoy story-based games such as Dear Esther and Gone Home, you'll enjoy this too.			"

												I got this game in a bundle, although I'd already been considering it. I am really glad I played it. It's a lovely exploration of human relationships, and the two modes allow players to choose how ""hard"" they want to make it. I chose story mode, and really enjoyed trying to balance the needs of the different family members.On a personal level, it made me think about where I might end up - I'm planning to get married this year and we're undecided on having children or not, and if so, when. I found myself naturally prioritising the ""core"" relationship between the partners, then the career, and then the child was suffering, so my focused switched heavily to the child and the relationship. I guess that's what really matters, in my story, in the end. Thought-provoking.			"

												I am not %100 sold on The Novelist, but I do think that it is a work of art that deserves an audience, and a run through of the game will only take a couple of hours. It's an emotional experience, though I recommend you play it in Story Mode, instead of Stealth mode, which marred my first attempt at a play through.  I don't think the storytelling is anything particularly groundbreaking - structurally it feels like a choose your own adventure - but the subject matter is not one usually explored in a game, and for that I think it's worth a try. It's called the Novelist, but it might perhaps better be called 'The Father' because the game was really more about balancing his family life with his work and passions  than actually writing a novel. If this sounds like playing your life on a computer, you may want to give this one some room until you have a little more space to breathe.My main qualm with the game is that while the Novelist's artist wife Linda is drawn well enough (I guess)  with her own ambitions and approach to family, the game still presents a fairly patriarchal family worldview  - one that sometimes seems drawn to appeal to a fantasy of male martyrdom. Though Linda puts forward her views on family decisions, in the end it's her husband who makes all the choices about their life and their son's. So while the game can be genuinely affecting, ultimately, some of the sacrifices you make feel a little hollow. Arguably this is simply a result of the game mechanics, but my wife and I make choices about our lives together, and it's not all on my shoulders, nor hers. That said, the dilemmas in this game are well set up, and I felt really torn between advancing Dan's career, his wife's and the wellbeing of his son.  I was glad that, in my runthrough at least, both she and Tommy led fruitful lives, even if Dan didn't get to follow his dreams.Play it if you want an experience different from your everyday shoot 'em up.

												As a fan of interactive adventure games such as ""The Novelist,"" I found it to be tedious, and terribly slow paced. Maybe it's trying to come off as realistic, but the game offered no breaks in the monotony normally found in games such as these. The choices, though hard to make, always left you feeling unnaccomplished, because out of three characters, one of them was going to get the cold shoulder. Maybe this is supposed to reflect real life decisions, but honestly only left you feeling bad for the main character. His work, or his family? A hard choice to make both in games and in real life, but when either choice leaves someone mad at you, what's the point?   The characters are hard to relate to, or even feel sympathetic for. Random moments such as a funeral for a death in the wife's family clash with a big event that's supposed to boost your career. Yet even then your child throws a fit for not taking him to an aero show. Constant nagging from all three characters does little but leave you torn in which decision is going to benefit you the most, which usually ends in neglecting your child. The writing, while well presented, is generic and unemotional. The voice acting, though not a major part of the game, is wooden and almost robotic.    This is the type of game to be played in one long run in order to get the full experience, but the game drags on and gets very, very repetitive even when the devs try to switch things up now and then. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you were feeling in the mood to bore yourself to death.			"

												The Novelist is a seriously cool game. I think it’s a shining example of a step in the right direction for “walking simulators”.In the game you observe a family via possessing lights and eavesdropping, reading personal items, and occasionally entering their memories. Each day/chapter you gather as much or as little information as you like and then at night you must make a choice of which character will get what they want. The whole spying/influencing system keeps the game undeniably linear, but being able to choose whose desires will get fulfilled gives the player just enough control to make the story mean so much more than just watching a book. There is a mode (I believe it’s called stealth mode) where the family can see you, so you truly have to be sneaky, but personally I don’t think this mode adds anything to the game. The narrative itself along with the developers method of delivery make this title an absolute pleasure to dive into.If the whole “walking simulator” genre has left a bad taste in your mouth, give The Novelist a chance to clean your palette. Other developers should study this game and learn from it’s interactive elements.			"

												The first thing you have to realize about this game is that it's meant to be casual. If you walk into it expecting it to be action-packed and requiring masterful strategy, it's probably going to seem like a terrible game. On the other hand, it does pull off the casual genre better than just about any other game out there. Even more important than the gameplay is the central question of ""Can I attain my own goals without hurting those around me?"". Throughout the entirety of the game you have to consider your options carefully... but regardless of what you choose I can almost guarentee that you won't like the end result. Ultimately however you're going to have to answer the question for yourself.			"

												Much like Dan in the game, or at least my version of it, I am unsure what to say here.The Novelist is a fantastic game, I know it will not be for everyone. There is no action, although I did plan to do one thing and then because I was not fast enough got spotted and had to make a little boy cry :( So maybe some action!In essence this is a game of choice, and if you are like me just playing it thru makes you look at your own life's choices. I put it down a couple of times to go play Lego with my boy... this game, if you let it, will have an impact on you.A fairly short game and I did get mine on sale so the dollar per hour ratio may be a little high but there is some replay here, I want to see what happens with different choices... just how good can Dan's book really be?Bottom line for me, is this is a must buy.

												I'm just going to start off by saying that I loved this. Even though I was playing on my computer, it didn't feel like a game. It felt more like I was reading one of those choose your own adventure books, except with my mouse and keyboard.The story dragged me in very early, and I was emotionally invested from the start. I took about three and a half hours to play through it, as I wanted to make sure I found every piece of information, and spent time considering the decisions and what consequences each could have. While I made my decisions with all three of them in mind, I came to find that I felt like I was playing the character of Dan, which was easy for me to subsconsciously drift towards as there was a closer connection to him in the game and I felt more disassociated with the ghost; like I was Dan calling the shots most of the time.I did my absolute best to make everything work for all of them, and made sure Dan didn't neglect his family, and although I felt like he was wasting his time with the book at that time, I still gave him plenty of things that helped with the book. It wasn't right, though, because he needed to sort out the rest of his life with his family and such first and then the book would come.In the end (of my story) Linda did the art thing part-time and Tommy was popular at school. Dan and Linda loved each other and lived the rest of their life like their honeymoon, but Dan's career went nowhere. I wondered if there was a perfect ending, if there was a chain of correct decisions I could have made which would have ended the story perfectly. I may play this through again, but probably not anytime soon, however I feel like there isn't a perfect solution, and the reason that there wouldn't be is not because a better ending wouldn't be possible, but because this game is supposed to pose the questions to us, not answer them. What this game is here for is to give us perspective on life, and I for one am glad that I stumbled across this game. This review is for people who have played the game and possibly the people who made it, if they read this; it's not intended to be a review for anyone who hasn't played it. One thing that I also want to note is that I think the effects of the decisions in the game were not complex enough. There were usually three options, with each being good for one person and bad for the other two. If you had played it right, you could pick two, however I saw many things which I chose because in reality they would have helped more than one of them. For example, I felt that Dan playing the board game thing with Tommy would not only help Tommy, but also Dan, as it would allow him to have time with his son and focus on what's important, and I also thought it would be nice for Linda to see them two playing. I thought it might cheer her up, but there was nothing really to show any of that. Another decision I came across was Linda wanting to go camping and Dan wanting to collect firewood and go camping on the beach. I thought this was great because I could pick either one and they would both be happy, and so I picked Dan's one because I felt like Linda would be happy that Dan actually initiated the camping trip, plus Tommy would have a blast. Turns out she actually wanted to go camping in a different location, and she wanted to go there instead so much so that she left them and went there by herself, spraining her ankle in the process. That kinda baffled me.Also, for the final decision, I still don't know what the difference between picking the backpack and the painting was? Both ways they stayed in Laurente and Tommy went back to school, however one way Linda painted full time and the other she painted part time. I think I chose the part-time because it was an unpaid thing it seemed like (all proceeds going to charity), and then Dan tutored Tommy, and worked part-time I believe. I'm not sure what the other option would have brang, but after re-reading all the information in that chapter before making the decision, I still couldn't figure out the difference. I guess if someone could explain it to me that would be cool. So, while this is kind of technically a review, it's my feedback and opinion to the makers and everyone else, and possibly a request for explanation or discussion of certain areas.Also, in my scenario, I feel that as Tommy got older, he would no longer require tutoring from Dan, which would free Dan up to take a full time job, or get back into writing full-time or just on the side, which I can't remember being mentioned in the ending scenario. The gameplay wasn't perfect, and there were a few small issues for me, but despite all that, the story was untouched and it still gave me same emotional response regardless, so I give this game 100% on my scale. Thanks for the game, and even if no one reads this crazy long review-ish thing, it felt good to actually write out my thoughts... maybe I'll go somewhere for three months and write a whole book... (NOT!)			"

												I really liked this game. Of course, it's actually more of a commentary on life than it is a computer game, and understanding that makes it better. Essentially, you're a ghost of sorts whose job is to read the thoughts, memories, and desires of the family that comes to temporarily stay in your house, and then helps the father to decide what choices to prioritize in his life. Play your cards right, with balance, and everyone in the family ends up really happy and successful, or if you sacrifice a character's needs too much, they may end up miserable. I do think the endings were too preset (not really being directly linked to the precise decisions you make), and that some of the ""bigger"" decisions could have been weighed more heavily in favor of that character's happiness. Yet, still, I found myself replaying the game a couple times to try for different endings. I do think it would have been better if done on a bigger and more realistic scale, and yet it is pretty impressive for what it is.			"

												The Novelist, though suffering from a few flaws, manages to be an emotionally involved and touching game thanks to its narrative. There is no perfect way to resolve every scenario, as anyone who has tried to juggle the demands of a family or group of friends is aware, which in my opinion, is a strength rather than a weakness. Though the house itself can be repetitive to navigate and some of the dilemmas are pretty predictable, the strong writing (haha) and voice acting make the experience worthwhile. A short game whether you play using the stealth mechanic or not.			"

												To be frank, this game is packaged as a Stealth game. In reality, it takes walking right up to a family member and licking their face just to get caught. However, the game is really fun and the story is unique. It's the first game I've played in quite some time that made me genuinely lose track of time. The choices you have to make are actually hard to make most of the time. Of course you have to put Dan's needs first, but everyone else's problems are also inescapable. Do yourself a favor and try it out. It's worth the money.			"

												I really enjoyed the Novelist, it's not your typical choose your adventure type game, the consequences and outcomes of the player's decisions have real weight. I became invested rather quickly, and often pondered over some of the hard decisions, trying to find the perfect compromises. I would say the game is worth it based on just how much I cared about the characters. This game is definitely a must play if you're a fan of adventure games, or just a fan of a strong narrative.I did not choose to play the stealth mode the first play around because I wanted to avoid missing out on the compromises, which allowed you to do just a little bit more than otherwise. There were a few things that were not readily apparent, but I did skip the tutorial. My second play through was much more productive and I feel like most players if they have trouble the first time around the second will be a lot more forgiving once the stealth mechanics are down. To sum up, this game is great you should totally give it a go.			"

												So, I played this game and finished in a little under four hours, according to steam. I like the premise (as I've also read in the reviews) and thought it was an interesting idea. That said, I liked the voices of the characters over the appearance of them. The graphics were.....Well...way below par and at the pit of me? More than a little dated but you know, it doesn't matter too much as long as the story-line pushes you forward. That said? I hate Dan.  He was a self-absorbed, self-important jerk. I realized this halfway through. This is probably why I allowed his writing to fall by the wayside and he tried to catch up by getting a little too friendly with his bourbon. I don't like him. I like the other characters and I pitied them for having to deal with his crap. So. He lived the rest of his life wondering how he had come to making the choices he did over the summer, convinced that it was not his idea to be a decent husband and father. This is depressing enough to make me consider crawling into a bottle of bourbon myself.			"

												This felt like Compromise-Simulator 2013 in the best possible way! Pros:	 Great story and characters! Choices and actions with consequences. Good voice acting. I loved seeing how things in the house changed as a result of my choices. Okay gameplay that I liked (if you play the stealthy way anyways)... Cons:	 ...but the gameplay also got a bit tedious and repetitive towards the end.For each chapter you have to make a choice on who of the three in the family you are going to prioritize, and as an optional goal you could compromise with a second family member. That leaves one family member totally neglected for a chapter. Those choices were often really hard for me to make, and I really had to step away a bit and think about some of them. It made me realize a few things about my own family as well, and how tough many of the choices must have been for my parents when I was young... So I'm really glad I played this and got a better perspective. My grade:	8/10  "

												A great thought provoking game where your actions and choices directly influences how the life of the characters will progress. It's a beautiful game where it gives you a glimpse of the complexities of family life and makes you question your own values and beliefs. You get to see their life unfold through the perspective of each of the family members and the game gives you the chance to alter it as you see fit. 11/10			"

A nice game from somebody who's probably not (yet) a father...First of all, let me clarify that despite this review focusing on the shortcoming of the game, I wholeheartedly recommend the game.  Then let's dive in:THE GOODThe game is essentially a narration/exploration game (think ""Dear Eshter[dear-esther.com]"") with the notable exception that in ""The Novelist"" the player has to solve moral dilemmas at the end of each level.In particular the game follows a family during their summer retreat, and each chapter of the story ends with each family members having a different, conflicting desire.  The player must choose which family member's desire gets fulfilled.However - and this is the strength of the game - the stakes are hight as each family member's preferences contribute towards important, existential points (writing the book that may change the course of the man career, saving the relationship between the two adults, supporting the kid in overcoming being bullied and having difficulties at school).These are usually very well balanced dilemmas and the choice is never merely strategic: it is all the times phylosophical/moral: there is never a ""correct"" answer, just one that resonates more with each player's sensitivity, and that will influence the remaining of the story/the final outcome in a specific way.In that regards, the game is brilliant: it elicits emotions and reflections that overflow the context of the game and invite the player to think to their real lives.THE LESS GOODI'm pretty sure (given the credits) that the author of the game is married, but does not have (yet) kids.  This shows.  The relationship and emotional dynamic between husband and wife in the game is very credible.  The one between the father (or the mother) and the kid - although described with care and attention - is not as authentic.Parents truly ""feel the joy"" of their kids.  Even when they have to give up something of their personal life, parents are sincerely and completely happy for their's kid successes.  There is no regret nor second thought once the choice to prioritise your kid's needs over yours is done.  It's a very different feeling than that of - say - giving up something important for making your partner happy.It is difficult to put this difference in words (let alone in a language that is not my native one), but while an adult is happy for their partner's happiness, a parent tends to be happy with their kids.  It is not a better or more intense joy, it's just... different.So, my only (minor) criticism of the game is that it does not render this difference properly: the narration does not sound as authentic as it does in describing the relationship between spouses.Another (again: very minor) criticism I'd like to make is that the game is framed in a very ""man-centric"" way: in order for the player to choose the course of action, they have to ""tell"" the man what the family as a whole should do (why not telling it to the woman?).Also in the summary of the events as they happened in previous chapters, the sentences are all constructed in such a way that the man is portrayed as the decision-maker, and the woman and kid subjects of the decisions.  Again: this is an extremely small detail, but it stands out enough for an attentive player to notice.TECHNICAL REMARKSThe game is clearly the single-handed work of love of its author.  There is degree of identification between the man in the game (the novelist) and the author of the game which is apparent in many passages of the script and openly revealed at the end of the game.Because of the limited human resources on the project, many technical choices have been a compromise: very simple and naive AI of the characters, a tiny-tiny world (in fact a two-bedroom house!), low level of garphic detail.However the author not only stroke a good balance by investing on the things that make the game good, while ignoring those that would make it merely more ""shiny""; he also put great care in the delivery, so that the game feels simple from a technical perspective, but also very well executed.  More importantly one can feel the care the author put in its creation, and that makes you feel as the recipient of something beautiful.Again: the game is not perfect, but it deliver a strong memorable experience, and I wholeheartedly reccomand it to anybody, although - perhaps - an adult gamer will appreciate it more than a young one who hasn't a family on its own yet.

												6.5/10 - Push and Possess your way to the endThis game is a basic possession game, nothing extremely bad or exciting. I wouldn't pay $15, more like $5. You are Dan Kaplan, a struggling writer who has taken his family to a remote cabin in hopes of meeting his fast approaching deadline. In this story you push, read minds and possess 3 people; Dan, his wife and son. The choices you make impact not only your life but that of your family.Worth $5 or so, I purchased for $0.74...

												The Novelist is a visual novel set in a 3D environment, that's what it is. The 'stealth' section of the gameplay is barely present enough to register. It is also short, less than 3 hours per run through.That's just about the only caveat I'd give to anyone considering buying it.There's a lot more happening in those three hours of point and click than I've gotten out of some much longer AAA games recently. By the end of my first playthrough I was totally emotionally drained, on par with, if not moreso than, a playthrough of The Walking Dead.This is a game about tough calls in the life of a family over the course of a Summer break; a struggling writer, a full time mother trying to get back to life after putting it on hold to raise a kid, and a child with a learning difficulty in need of some extra attention from his parents.There are no right answers at the end of the day, you're going to end up making someone miserable no matter what decision you make and, for me at least, there were never any instances of an obvious 'best decision'.If you're looking for an excellent player driven story or if you're the type to get emotionally involved in the lives of characters then I cannot recommend this game enough. Each playthrough may be short, but there's plenty of replay value in seeing how different choices can affect the outcome.			"

												I found The Novelist to be a delightfully warmhearted look into life.  While some people may complain about how people never write in a journal or use a typewriter anymore, that's if you take the game as if it were based on a modern time setting, which I didnt see it as.  The obvious examples I can state are a cord phone, a typewriter, and a record player in the game.  That aside, I found this far more refreshing change of pace, where most games focus on the player mostly exercising their mind, this focused more on the heart and mind together.  The replay value is moderately high, being that you can have far different results with the decisions you make.  It is short, on a single play through, but felt the price was worth the change in pace.  One that deviates from the current same ol', same ol'.I rate this game an 8/10.  Especially for those seeking a short escape from the shooters and action-based games.			"

												The cursed writer who can't write anything without getting drunk ""on bourbon"".The annoying wife who want to spend more time with her husband - she is a painter, of course.The capricious lonely child who keep asking his parents to play with him (no wonder he was bullied).These are the three characters you have to spend the whole game with. Basically you will hear them complain all the time (the writer because he can't find ideas, the wife because her husband works too much and the child because he wants to play).They all annoyed me after 5 minutes (which is extremely problematic when the aim of the game is about keeping a family together + when the game is mostly story driven).But well, it can happen...maybe my problem...tastes and colours.... I still gave it a try for 40 more minutes before rage quitting.Basically, everything is black and white. For instance, if you satisfy the child then he will be happy but the dad and his wife won't be happy - then the next day if you satisfy the wife, she will be happy but not the two others...Can't the child remember that his dad did something for him the day before and be more neutral? No! Their memory last for one day and the day (chapter) after, blank, everything starts again, they have no memories of what person X did to person Y. WHICH is extremely problematic for a game making heavy references to memories (you can read old memories of the characters but yet they can't remember what they did few hours ago?).Of course with such system, your don't have the feeling that your choices impact the game that much. Which goes against what this game claims to be when they pretentiously advertise it as ""The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself."".Worst, you don't even care about choices you are going to make because issues the family is going through are banal to the extreme - it is more whines than real family issues.My overall feeling is that this game is extremely pretentious - from its excessive price, fake description (your choices don't impact that much the game), and its ""pseudo-intellectual"" vibe.

												This game is both a refreshing new approach to adventure gaming and a fantastic exploration of artistic expression. The story tells the tale of the Kaplan family - Dan (the novelist), his wife Linda (the artist) and their son Tommy. Interestingly enough, the player controls none of these characters but instead controls a disembodied entity (essentially a ghost for lack of a better word) whose exact origin or purpose is left intentionally ambiguous. You control said entity in the first person, exploring the Kaplan's new vacation home while simultaneously trying to avoid detection (thus spooking a given a family member). To help in this endeavor, you can possess lights and even make them flicker to attract the attention of the Kaplans, adding a stealth aspect to the game; it does, however, offer a 'story' mode where you are immune to detection as well.It quickly becomes apparent, upon the Kaplans arrival in threir new summer home, that things are not going well for this family. Thus, for reasons unknown, it becomes your job to dig up the proper clues to help resolve various conflicts between family members. This is done through exploration, a form of mind-reading, and the ability to enter the memories of individual characters for further discovery. Stay out of sight, find all the clues, learn the secrets, and then use this knowledge to influence the situation by way of subliminal suggestion (you literally whisper suggestions into Dan's ear while he sleeps)!All in all this is a really unique and interesting game which offers plenty of fun, as well as a really engaging story-driven narrative. Especially for that low, low indie price! If you enjoy adventure games, especially the more artistically expressive types, then definitely do yourself a favor and give it a go - if not, who knows, you may still end up enjoying it anyway!

The whole light jump thing was pretty cool too so I was expecting some more interesting, yet simple mechanics.But that didn't happen. I don't like searching around the same places and the pace is pretty slow.. Kinda boring, actually.I understand people might like the game, as it's minimalistic, easy to learn and it runs fairly smooth, but it's just not something I like.			"

It focuses on a family and the choices they make over the course of a summer that will eventually shape their collective futures.  An interesting topic and fairly well executed.  Perhaps a bit overpriced, it took me only about 3 hours to finish one playthrough.  However, apparently the game offers a lot of replayability, as many elements are randomized and the choices you make can change as well.			"

												Very mature and realistic story-driven game. It is very similar to Dear Esther and others in that genre. It is not going to appeal to everyone. The game focuses on choice and consequences of the decisions you take in the game. The choices will resonate throughout the entire game, affecting the dynamics of the family.Since you play as a ghostly entity in the house, there are 2 game modes. One which involves stealth, meaning you can not let any of the family members see you. The other focusing on story, which lets you freely wander around the house with no one being able to spot you. The game is relatively short. However if you enjoy games similar to The Novelist then you will highly enjoy this game. You will be torn between trying to appease everyone in the family, sometimes you will be upset that even with compromises; there is someone who is going to be upset with the choices you make.			"

												This game could have been really awesome but is sadly mostly boring and repetitive. You go around, looking for clues about what every family member wants (which isn't hard as the house isn't that big) and then decide what to do. You can choose two things and then the two family-members who got their will will be happy and the one who didn't will be sad.It could have been so easy to spice everything up a bit by having unexpected consequences.In one chapter dad wants to invite one of his friends to the house, mom her parents and the son his friend. For example if in that chapter it had turned out that mum invites her parents but they just annoy her because they won't stop asking about her life/work while the son has a great time playing with his grandparents it could have made a really cool game because you had to take into account that perhaps what a person wants turns into disaster. But it's always straightforward so the most complex thing you have to do is remember which compromises you chose in the previous chapter to avoid making one person to unhappy.			"

												When I first picked up this game I was very unsure about it, especially for a Let's Play but I went with it anyway. After the 1st chapter I found myself already getting wrapped up in the game. You truly become a part of the family and really bond with them in a way. You begin to feel attached to the characters, some more than others. To make this easy, I'm going to break down the game into a few parts...Gameplay-While gameplay isn't a huge part of this game it is cool how you can jump from light to light and sometimes they turn off certain ones to make it harder. It is also cool how if you choose the ""Stealth"" difficulty you have to be careful to stay out of the families sight so you don't scare them and blow your cover. Going through peoples memories and finding certain interactions they had done previously was a very interesting concept as well that was executed rather well. There are also clues for each family member around the house that shows what they want. After you find out what each family member wants, you can choose one to be the priority and then you can choose one more of the family members wants and leave them, sort of happy. The 3rd family member... well they're not the happiest people in the world. The game could get a little repetitive sometimes I must say.Style-The game is beautiful in its own kind of way. I really like the cartoon look it has with it. I feel like it fits the game very well. Voice acting-The voice acting was very good and seemed to fit each member of the family rather well. You could always sense emotion in the persons voice which really helped you figure out what was going on with them and what they wanted. Story-The story was absolutely amazing. It made up 100% for the repetitiveness of the game. The story brought me in so much that I forced myself to beat the whole game today. It gives you a lot of hard choices to make. It shows that no matter what you do there will always be consequences. The message, ""You can't make everyone happy is very strong in this game."" The choices you make can also tell a lot about yourself which can be a little scary at times. Length-The game is not very long. After I explored everything and completed the story line I had about 6 hours logged. I would say for the $15 price tag, it's well worth it! There's so much more I could praise this game about. There were very limited downfalls with this game and overall the story made it well worth it. I would give this game a....7/10-Luke			"

												I think this title is more important for the potentialities it creates and the horizons it illuminates than for its individual greatness. Overall, the game delivers the desired emotional effect but some of the weaknesses in character development make it difficult to fully engage with some aspects of the narrative. The game would have benefitted from a little more backstory. Ultimately, the game is a great vehicle for reflecting on one's own decisions and priorities as well as broader matters like family, career, and (maybe) freedom.The game revolves around a family's three-month retreat. Dan, the main character, is an author who is negotiating the demands of family life and the challenges of creative work. Similarly, his wife, Linda, who is herself a painter, struggles to balance life as a mother and wife with her desire to develop her artistic career. Lastly, Tommy, is Linda and Dan's child. He is mostly occupied by the preoccupations of any average child: the desires to make friends, please his parents, and to explore new possibilities. The player's task is to make decisions, through Dan, that try to take into account everyone's priorities.The Novelist is more narrative than gameplay. Yet, unlike other games in the same spirit, the Novelist does attempts to integrate gameplay into the narrative by offering the player the option of whether they will engage with the narrative on a ""story"" mode or a ""game mode."" The game mode requires that a player stealthily navigate the house while finding clues to progress the story. Exposing one's self to the family may cause story options  and decisions regarding how the family should proceed to dissappear. Alternatively, playing in story mode removes the elements of stealth and gameplay, allowing players to focus solely on developing the story and unlocking as many options for developing the story as available. The developers did a good job of integrating traditional elements of gameplay with the newly-developing narrative style.The Novelist does a good job of capturing the impact that apparently mundane decisions can have on the present and future lives of individuals. Nevertheless, the narrative has some weaknesses particularly in the development of Tommy's character. Unlike Dan and Linda, whose career and family challenges feel more genuine from the start of the game, Tommy's concerns do not feel as important until later in the game when he is dealing with his relationship to his father, friends at school, and academic success. I think the writers could have done better by emphasizing the relationship between Tommy and Dan from the beginning and developing his psychological status in the same way that the writers did with Dan and Linda. Ultimately, Tommy's character is a weakness and not a flaw. I don't get the sense that the writters didn't try to make a complex character, only that the complexities did not emerge as successfullly as those of the other characters.Overall, I found the game to be worthwhile. The novel approach of the game made it a useful platform for reflecting on my own priorities in life as well as broader philosophical questions. To the extent that players approach this game as a reflexive experience, I think the Novelist will find a special place in your gaming heart.			"

I don't even want to go into any detail why.The soundtrack was beatiful and peaceful. I could sleep to it. And like I mentioned earlier with the emotions, I haven't felt or thought that why since I played The Walking Dead series.This game was peaceful and made me feel happy, it's not for everyone, but it's worth a shot.

												I found The Novelist to be a delightfully warmhearted look into life.  While some people may complain about how people never write in a journal or use a typewriter anymore, that's if you take the game as if it were based on a modern time setting, which I didnt see it as.  The obvious examples I can state are a cord phone, a typewriter, and a record player in the game.  That aside, I found this far more refreshing change of pace, where most games focus on the player mostly exercising their mind, this focused more on the heart and mind together.  The replay value is moderately high, being that you can have far different results with the decisions you make.  It is short, on a single play through, but felt the price was worth the change in pace.  One that deviates from the current same ol', same ol'.I rate this game an 8/10.  Especially for those seeking a short escape from the shooters and action-based games.			"

												The cursed writer who can't write anything without getting drunk ""on bourbon"".The annoying wife who want to spend more time with her husband - she is a painter, of course.The capricious lonely child who keep asking his parents to play with him (no wonder he was bullied).These are the three characters you have to spend the whole game with. Basically you will hear them complain all the time (the writer because he can't find ideas, the wife because her husband works too much and the child because he wants to play).They all annoyed me after 5 minutes (which is extremely problematic when the aim of the game is about keeping a family together + when the game is mostly story driven).But well, it can happen...maybe my problem...tastes and colours.... I still gave it a try for 40 more minutes before rage quitting.Basically, everything is black and white. For instance, if you satisfy the child then he will be happy but the dad and his wife won't be happy - then the next day if you satisfy the wife, she will be happy but not the two others...Can't the child remember that his dad did something for him the day before and be more neutral? No! Their memory last for one day and the day (chapter) after, blank, everything starts again, they have no memories of what person X did to person Y. WHICH is extremely problematic for a game making heavy references to memories (you can read old memories of the characters but yet they can't remember what they did few hours ago?).Of course with such system, your don't have the feeling that your choices impact the game that much. Which goes against what this game claims to be when they pretentiously advertise it as ""The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself."".Worst, you don't even care about choices you are going to make because issues the family is going through are banal to the extreme - it is more whines than real family issues.My overall feeling is that this game is extremely pretentious - from its excessive price, fake description (your choices don't impact that much the game), and its ""pseudo-intellectual"" vibe.

												A great ""game"" with important choices leading to real different endings (not like in Walking Dead) - every choice matters.It's more a story than a game, I think the majority of you have already found out. You walk around the house and have to find notes for the husband, the wife and the son, and then decide whose wish to fulfill. In the night, you can fulfill one additional wish as a compromise, and then the outcome is presented. This is repeated 8 times (so 9 times in total, divided into 3 months).The voice acting was very nice to me, and I liked how the game challenged me with the ultimate choice between ""myself, my love and my child"". Moreover, it was interesting to me that chosing a compromise in the night (aka 2nd wish fullfilling) could diminish the primary wish I granted before.Example:a) Let the wife's parents come to visit.b) Let the son's friend come to visit to play.c) Let the husband's friend come to visit to work on the book.If you choose a) as primary wish and b) as secondary wish, it will be told that the parent's visit was not so great since the two boys were very loud and disturbed the others a little. So even that makes a difference.Played the game 3 times since I was so excited to learn what happens when I a) only concentrate on woman & boy and b) only concentrate on myself.			"

												Wow this was a surprisingly good game.  I'd recommend playing it on Story mode because I don't think it really adds anything to try and avoid having the Kaplans see you, mostly it just means annoyance trying to find a light where you want to be.  The decision making was really tough a lot of the time.  One thing that isn't immediately clear, the compromise option doesn't earn you as much success with a character as the primary choice.  Not knowing how the game works internally, I'd put it at something like a 2, 1, -1 for Primary, Compromise, Disappoint.  Also, make sure to look around in the house at night and read the extras that give you a history of past inhabitants of the house.  I missed one night by accident :(			"

												What a neat, story-driven game in soft of the same vein as Gome Home, but with some more consequences and decision making (even if some of the decisions seem rather arbitrary, but that's a minor complaint).If you liked the aforementioned Gone Home, you're also going to like this. I, myself, even prefer it to that game.The end does strike me as a little easy/shallow - but I expected that from the start and since I can't really offer an alternative to make it that much better, aside from some worn-out philosophy, I cannot harp on that too much.All in all, very solid game I can see myself playing again for different outcomes. The attention to detail as the story progresses has amazed me especially.			"

												Let me just start off by saying I got this game because at one point in my life, I had a strong passion for writing.  I still hold writing to be important to me, but it will no longer be my career of choice. As such, after hearing numerous stories of how taxing writing a book can be for the average author, be it on their sanity, nerves, love life, or even the amount of time able to be allocated to quality family fun, I really hoped to both emulate that and hear another good story in this game. That, and the fact that it seemed like it'd play out simlar to Heavy Rain, or Fahrenheit (The Indigo Prophecy). Now, the game itself spins a good story, but not nearly enough as I'd expect from a game all about writing, and titled ""The Novelist"". The story is too simple, and the choices you can make lack any real sense of worth to the other characters, or even yourself, if you choose to have Dan focus on his book. The choices you must decide on in this game can be easily compounded together to satisfy all parties, with good time management (which I guess Dan does not have). Gameplay is also very repeditive, stealth mode or not, and offers no creativity. The ""compromises"" are very disappointing, and seem to have even more of a negative imapct on the family than just choosing one solution to one person's desires.The game also fails to lift any emotion from me, as the voice acting sounds forced, unemotional, and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to be frank. Many lines are very cheesy, melodramatic, and sound as if taken out of a cancelled soap opera. Many of the Visual Novels here on Steam have more tear-jerking moments than this entire game does, and that speaks volumes, considering the VNs on Steam are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves, short, and were made solely for a quick buck on Steam. I digress.This game does not meet or even come close to the potential satisfaction it could have delivered by such a unique concept in a game; therefore, I cannot reccomend it. For me, not only was it the potential wasted that made me not want to reccomend this game, it was the fact that none of the story even evoked the tiniest bit of empathy within me. It lacked heart, and emotion into the voices, and the dialogue itself.Don't even consider spending more than $4.			"

												In The Novelist, the player has control over some spirit or being which resides in the house this family came to spend the summer in, and you're supposed to influence their lives for the better by making decisions for them. The family consists of a father who is a novelist and came to this remote location to get past his writer's block and reconnect with his family, a mother who loves painting but hasn't been able to focus on it after becoming a mother, and finally a son who gets bullied at school and doesn't have very many friends. The father has become quite neglectful of his family because he is way behind schedule on finishing his novel, and through the course of this game you see him struggling to manage the progress of and ultimately finish his novel as well as keep his family happy.The gameplay consists of stealthing around the house by possessing light sources in order to find and read diary entries or letters written by or to the family members, as well as read their thoughts and explore their memories. After having found enough of these for a character, you can see what they want and choose that as the resolution for this chapter, disappointing the other two characters. But if you managed to also find out a desire of at least one other character and haven't spooked them by getting detected by them, you can choose their desire as a compromise for the chapter, making two characters happy. To finish a chapter, you whisper your decisions to the father in his sleep, which makes him execute the choices you made. Well, in most cases at least.There were plenty of things which bothered me about this game, such as having choices I made conflict with others when they really didn't have to, characters just not doing what I chose for them to do or all characters' desires to be small and trivial enough to all do in one night but still being forced to only make up to two happen, and so on. Yet in the end every character's outcome was just as I had hoped, even though it felt pretty awful being forced to disappoint at least one character over and over again, and because of conflicts and such I didn't always get the outcome for a chapter that I had hoped for. I can't tell how much my choices even mattered in the end, if at all, but I like to think they did because the outcome I got in the end was what I was trying to achieve. I can definitely see one of the final choices allowing for drastically different outcomes, but since you can't start from specific chapters I won't play through it all again to see if it actually does, especially since I'm very content with how it turned out.Verdict:This game isn't the best when it comes to its narrative, and especially not when it comes to its gameplay, which gets very repetitive. But when it comes to teaching players a valuable life lesson and delivering an important message, this game is probably one of the best out there. For example, having to decide on whether the father should continue writing his novel which is already way behind schedule, write an ad for his wife's art exhibition so she has a bigger chance to break through and achieve her dream or spend a good few hours every day tutoring his son who is behind on a school subject really captures the fact that life is all about making sacrifices and that no one will consistently get what they want. Another messages that this game delivers really well is that you should never take your family for granted, and  that having a nice and functional family requires effort from everyone involved. Other than that it also emphasizes how stressful it is to try and contribute something that lasts to the world and make your existence matter, and that you should never give up on your dreams.It was quite a reality check for me, making me think about some things I usually don't or haven't before, as well as an inspiring experience overall.

												Dear Esther is still the worst project I’ve ever had to endure. As an experience, I am willing to offer it some credit due to its well executed narrative, but all you do is walk around a fictitious island for no longer than an hour before the credits roll. That is not a game; that is a digital story, and those arguing the opposite possess a thwarted view of the medium that is stripping gamers like me off their money.Why would I bring up Dear Esther in this review? Because just like it, The Novelist is a digital experience that shoe horns gaming elements in order to reach the wider audience on Steam. Art nuts will raise their fists at me preaching the advancement of the gaming culture, while I berate them for supporting such flagrant experiments with little to no gaming elements.The Novelist is a simple project that puts you in control of a specter, floating around a house to uncover the stories of all its three occupants: A father, mother, and their son. Each of them is looking to fulfill a need, and it is up to you at the end of each chapter to choose who actually pulls it off. Should you choose an outcome that has the father focus on his novel, his wife will get lonely, and his son will get depressed because he is not spending time with him. There are compromises that you may offer characters you did not support, a pacifier to pamper their low self esteems and lack of will, by choosing to cater to them after your desired intention is completed. If you chose to support the father’s novel, for example, you will get the chance to support one of the other members: Instead of spending the day with your son, you sit with him and read, or instead of fully assisting your wife in promoting her art gallery, you help her with copy at the end of the day. These are all do-it-yourself story elements, and do not compromise a game.Had The Novelist been on offer for a couple of dollars I would not be ranting, but when an experiment like this is sold for $15, with no mention anywhere that it is a non-game, I lose my♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you like digital experiences the likes of Dear Esther and Gone Home, then you may enjoy The Novelist for what it offers; otherwise, stay clear away and save your money for actual, deserving indie games.

												I sadly was not able to enjoy this game at all, and this is coming from someone who absolutely loves these narrative non-games, such as Dear Esther, Gone Home or even more abstract ones such as Proteus.But this... half way in, it almost felt like a chore to me. I had to force myself to finish it, and got very little out of it.The game mechanics felt very repetitive and meaningless. Every chapter, you had to find a set of clues which all happened to be more of less in the same place, you had to look at three memories, then get the final clue and choose one of the 3 dilemmas to solve (most of which were very cliché). You didn't really get to find much insight in the characters or get attached to any. It really felt more like a game than a narrative story.And even the main mechanic, light jumping, which you use throughout the entire game, felt very poorly constructed. Some lights were very poorly positioned, and then they started introducing annoying and useless false difficulty by turning some off...In general, this game definitely didn't deliver in the premise, at least not the one I was expecting, of getting an emotion story and insight in a families life. It was a fun little game I guess, but most definitely not worth that price point.			"

												The game seems interesting, but after playing it for 3 chapters, I'm calling it quits. Pros: The movement system is fun. The problems are complex and feel legitimate. If you neglect one thing for another, there are repercussions. They are genuinely interesting issues.Cons: Bad voice acting. The typing recap sections are slow. You can skip them but then you don't get to view the text. The stealth mode is really unnecessary. The game is also very repetitive. Find clues, go into a memory, find the memories, read thoughts, repeat.Neutral: This game feels like Papers, Please. Technically it is a game, but you lose no matter what you do. You're playing, but it isn't particularly fun.I guess it isn't bad, but it wasn't for me and I don't intend to recommend it to anyone I know.			"

												The concept is great and the game is simple enough.It does make you consider how you divide your time in your own life, which is more than you can ask from an independent game, although, if we are honest, The Sims more than covered this a lot earlier.The novelist reminded me of the first Assassin's Creed in the way that the story was good but the tasks were so mind numbingly repetitive that it was a bit of a pain after you got the hang of it, even in stealth mode.Great concept and a very interesting game but it is way too simple, way too linear and incredibly monotonous after a bit.I hope it makes sense to say that even though I am happy I experienced such a game, I am not able to recommend it..

That completely undercuts the entire point that the game is trying to make and changes it from a recommend into a not.  Watch someone else's Let's Play instead if you want to know what happens.			"

												This is an interactive story where you play an author struggling to balance his life and his career. Your choices shape how the story unfolds. The unique mechanic of playing a ghost, peeping in on people's lifes and advising them in their sleep was really interesting.Beyond what the game is objectively, it was meaningful for me on a personal level as well. I played this game as I am struggling with my dissertation, marriage and kid. The game had an almost therapeutic effect on me. "

												On the whole, a pretty enjoyable and well polished title for the fans of story-based, exploratory and choose-your-own-adventure type games. Not sure if i'd pick it at full price but it's a good deal while on sale.Things I Liked:* Dans struggles REALLY resonated with me, reminding me of periods working on my first indie game, and now the second* I found myself sometimes choosing one person's resolution even if I rooted for another character, because I thought this path would actually help them moreOn the downside:* The gameplay gets a bit repetitive quickly, looking for the same clues in similar places in the same house over and over and over. Tho I can see how that is subliminally part of the message.* While I enjoyed the ride and occasional unexpected twists, I felt most of the outcomes were very predictable, and pretty much knew where things were going before I even made the choices. A somewhat archetypal themes. Would've enjoyed a bit more unexpected results.			"

												A moral choice management sim presented unnecessarily as a first person perspective game.The moral choice is stretched over several days and ultimately takes the form of helping one of three people. Irritatingly (and unrealistically) the choice is zero-sum, meaning that whenever you choose to benefit one of the three you simultaneously harm the other two. Because of its zero-sum nature, you cannot 'win' this game - there is no way to play it so as to achieve a 'better than expected' result - you can only choose how you want to distribute the benefit/harm.The choice takes the graded form of 'Help this person the most' (+1) vs. 'Help them a little' (+0) vs. 'Harm them' (-1), meaning that in a sense it is possible to reduce an entire playthrough to an (implied) balance sheet. You get a bit sick of navigating the environment and interacting with everything only to find that there is no strategy to the game and you're just as well picking a random character when deciding who to benefit/harm.

												This is a very good game where you're an ""observer"" and you affect the 3 people you observe. They're a family. Writer father is having troubles with his book, son and wife. Each chapter you play you first have to find clues about each character and read their thoughts to see what the desire. You can only fulfill 2 desires, so sometimes you got to leave 1 family member disappointed. The story is very neat in the game and it's fun to see what an impact your choices have on the characters. In general a very good game if you're looking for decisions that influence the story.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Review: The NovelistSome Good Things: In Depth Storyline  Multiple Great Endings  In Depth Characters  Story Tree  Made me Cry.(Out of Happiness) Some Not So Good Things: Is Very Emotional (Bad for Younger Kids) Not Enough Backstory (But had Decent Amount)I say: So Worth the '$'------------------------------------------------------------------------As Stated by: PetsycatThe Novelist is a story driven adventure game that takes place in a summer home. The main character, Dan, takes his family to this place so he can get away from the city and focus on his book. You don't actually play Dan, or any of his family members, you play some sort of ghost, who is trying to influence their lives. First of all let me address a small issue. This game is what I would consider ""Art"". Therefore, there isn't much in terms of the standard definition of gameplay. There are definitely choices, and different endings, but you really aren't doing much. Your watching the story unfold based on your choices. Especially if you play in story mode. There are 2 different types of modes. Stealth and story. In story mode, the family is unable to detect you, leaving you to be able to discover clues and read their memories with ease. This is what you would want to choose to just focus on the story. Stealth includes a stealth mechanic to the game, you must remain out of site. For the first time, I'd recommend using stealth. It makes it feel more like a game, even though without the mechanic I would still call it a game.Okay, the story. The story is great, and the choices, unlike other games that claim this, actually count. Your choices will reflect in the ending no matter which exact ""ending"" you choose. And I do not believe there is a perfect ending. No matter what, someone will end up disapointed one way or another. That's what I love about this game, because that is life. You can't make everyone happy. And when your in an outsider situation, that makes it even harder. The story isn't complex or epic, and it doesn't have to be. It's a simplistic story about a families life and problems. But it feels real, and I love it.I absolutely love story driven games, and I'm glad I spend 15 bucks on The Novelist. If you enjoy games like The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, and the sort, you will love The Novelist. I surely hope people give this game a chance.--End of Quote			"

												A writer and his family take a short vacation at a beach house. You are kind of a ghost that lives there and you follow the family during their daily life on this vacation. You find out about their desires and fears and can manipulate them to make a certain decision, or not. There have been many reviews written about this game that explain why it is just bad. I'll just emphasize that it is very frustrating to play. It feels like a punishment because while trying to meet the needs of the family you never can satisfy everyone and it becomes frustrating having to always compromise in an illogical way. Overall the characters sometimes seems so utterly egoistic and selfcentered that it is no fun following them through their struggles. I don't recommend this happiness-draining game.			"

												This game, made me cry. The decisions I made in the game affected everyone (and I didn't realize how much it affected everyone until the very end). Puts life into perspective a little. The first couple decisions you make in the beginning of the game you tend to shrug off but as it goes deeper and deeper you have to make some pretty tough calls. You feel bad for all three of them but in the end you realize that only one decision can be made, with one little compromise to boot. Someone's going to be hurt, and unfortunately my first playthrough ended pretty abruptly as I crossed the line of no return. I could have gone with the other decision but it was going to be tough keeping up and making sure it didn't happen again.I definitely recommend this game if you're willing to make some tough decisions and see what happens when you do.

												The Novelist reminds me of a Stephen King book in that there is an ending. The conflict is resolved, but the resolution isn't always one that sits well with the reader. In this case, I found myself towing the line. Trying to make everyone happy (as is my curse) and I deemed my own ending to be satisfactory, if not a bit melancholy. I have no doubt that my ending would be better or worse for others and that's what really makes this game enjoyable. Watching the story unfold, wondering if you made the right choices and then going back again and playing to see if a different choice would have made a difference. Since the game presents the sequences out of order, each choice really is unique. In real life, you're stuck wondering if a certain path would have lead you to something greater. In The Novelist, you can explore those own questions about your life through the Kaplans. In a nice, safe environment that can be turned off when the questions start to bug you. At least, I did.			"

												When I first started to play ""The Novelist"" I did not expect to develop a connection to the characters and their stories. The gameplay was very unique and I enjoyed being able to view each character's thoughts and memories while having to hide from them (although I started off in Story Mode, I decided Stealth Mode would be a lot more fun). While there technically are no ""wrong"" or ""right"" decisions, I couldn't help but find myself to choose the more, erm, ""sound"" ones. But either way, depending on what you do, the story changes and I really enjoyed that. The extra stories of the previous tennats were a nice addition. I found myself at the end of the timeline almost in tears and that is a good thing. I've only done one full playthrough, and the fact that there are so many different choices to make with so many different outcomes makes me glad to have purchased this game.

												This is more of a love letter to the developers than a review.I absolutely adored it. It felt like a real family. My choices didn't have the impact I thought they would have, like having Dan drink didn't hurt their relationship at all. He had all the symptoms of an alcoholic, yet it caused little to no problems. I guess their overral happiness was the deciding factor. I just thought the ending could've been darker. I assumed the ""ghost"" failed at his previous attempts at helping the family, so I expected that it shouldn't be possible to have good endings for everyone, yet it was fairly easy. In any case it's an amazing game. In a way, it felt a lot like Papers Please and that's really saying something.I loved how real Tommy was, he reminded me of my own childhood. Since I am not a father myself, thanks to this game I can sympathise and understand my parents better. I can now understand why I couldn't spent as much a time with my father as I would like, and why my parents fell apart.Also, as an aspiring author this game gave me courage to continue writing. I'm looking forward to new games from Orthogonal. Much love.			"

												This is a great story, although I think it may be slightly pricey for what you get. Yes, I like the different outcomes you can get from this, but if you're someone that likes to skip dialouge and does not like to read, this is absolutely not for you. The mechanics are really repeptitive, and it is really easy not to get ""caught"", even in the hardest mode. This is less of a skill-based game, and moreso a game based around character development. There are more action packed, engaging games out there for the money, but this isnt a bad game for someone who is looking for something different. I am having fun though :D Justifying the price though, that might be a little tricky. As this review is written, the price stands at 14.99 USD			"

												I consider myself a pretentious gamer, given that I'm a big fan of STORY when so many others seem to have abandoned it as the foremost gaming ideal. Whether it's the Sierra On-Line Quest adventures of old, the whimsical originality of LucasArts or the classic Bioware RPGs, I've always welcomed games which draw me into a mythology, a complete, hermetic tale. It never mattered what the subject was - classic fantasy, pirates, post-fallout apocalypse. Quality and consistency of dialogue and character were always the watchwords.Yet, as pretentious as I claim to be and as much as I love the games of yesteryear, I rarely finish the story-driven games of today. I guess, over the years, I've become as impatient as all those console gamers who dominate the market. Games like Dear Esther - while I recognise their superb quality and importance in today's market - actually just bore me. As much as I want to like them, I grow dissatisfied too quickly.The Novelist is not such a game. I was compelled from the outset to continue. I think the real world setting had a lot to do with this: the story grips you from the outset because it's completely REALISTIC. It feels like you're peeking into people's real lives. The three main characters are so wholly, so beautifully represented, that it's easy to imagine that they're your neighbours.It's rare for a game to offer a sense that your choices really matter. This is one such game. And I know this is probably, single-handedly, the most oft-used and yet eminently inaccurate characteristic reviewers like to ascribe to RPG/adventure games. But having just completed this game, I can tell you it's completely true: I know I could go back and select different choices in order to elicit a totally different outcome.There are so many peripheral touches that round out this experience, too. The gameplay is inspired: you can choose to dive, freestyle, right into the story without hindrance, or you can spice it up a bit with a stealth element that you just wouldn't expect in this kind of game. The sound mechanics are excellent and actually add to the gameplay, as you follow various audio cues to advance the story. The voice acting is credible and mature. And the game's author even makes the credits totally readable by paying tribute to each person's contribution to the overall game.This is my first review on Steam, and I'm glad that The Novelist is what drove me to write it. Whether through Steam Greenlight or other avenues, we need to support developers to make more like this. They're the future of PC gaming.			"

												In some aspects The Novelist is quite like Gone Home: you also get into the strangers' house, and not only can you go through their notes and belongings, but also memories. And though that The Novelist tells you a story of a family who goes to a summer vacation house. The father wants to write a book, the mother wishes to paint, and their son just wants to be with the parents.It's not really a game, but not an interactive movie either. On one hand, it does have a bit of gameplay. On the other, it doesn't really have cut scenes and whatnot. What it really feels like is reading a book where you can influence a story to some degree (doesn't look like too much, though).And while The Novelist has it's flows, overall it's an enjoyable experience which makes you wonder what are the most important things in life.

It's quiet and somber and allows you to delve into the lives of the Kaplan family while having the opportunity to fix some family problems. Stealth mode is there mostly to make things feel more tense, but if you simply want to invest in the lives of the family you can. I would definitely recommend for those who like getting into people's business, lol.			"

												4/10Only the story keeps tha game playable, but even that has its flaws. I think (not 100% sure) no matter what you chose, you can't make everyone happy.Gameplay is completely repeatable- search the house for clues (often same objects), read everyone's memory, pick 1 or 2 compromises. Rinse and repeat 9 times. The mode in which Kaplans can see you and you have to remain stealthed makes it even more annoying.Graphics look cheap and strange. Music is just 1 looped track.I would like to see a different ending, but just can't see myself replaying 2h only for that reason. "

Too bad; either one or the other suffers and your wife will definitely suffer. Try to juggle all three?

												The premise is good: we have to make choices, and every choice has it's downsides. How do we balance our choices against each other, if at all?I don't care much that the graphics are bland. I could have overlooked that the mechanics are repetetive and boring, or that the voice acting could have felt more engaging. But it's just... Everything. I really liked Gone Home, just to make a comparison. It could be argued that Gone Home has even less of actual gameplay mechanics than The Novelist does. But where Gone Home is thick with atmosphere, The Novelist has none. Where Gone Home unravels its story in a way that feels natural and organic while building the tension, The Novelist just says ""find  X paper notes, then do it over and over"". Gone Home is full of details, The Novelist is not. I really wanted to like this game, but it was not worth the investment, even though I bought it on sale!My advice is: avoid.(Disclaimer: I only played through maybe a third of the game. Time is too precious to waste on this.)			"

												The novelist has a very interesting concept.  I was actually kind of looking forward to it, but it's very hard to get into.  So, you are a ghost that can move around this house.  You are suppose to stay hidden, but they have a mode where you dont have to hide so that you can enjoy the story line.  Here's how it works, an issue comes up for all three family members, and you decide who you are going to help.  You can compromise with a second person, but really you only help one.   You do this over and over again, until you just get bored.  I have not finished this game, but it doesnt add any new elements, and doesnt get harder.  The only way I can see you enjoying this game is if you are actually interested in the story line.  The story line isn't really that great, though.  I guess the game is worth trying, but there's not a whole lot of apeal.			"

												The Novelist is an adventure/discovery type of game. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who like a good storyline and plot more than slashing some zombie's heads off. In each chapter of the game, you are faced with a major dilemna. If you choose to fufill a character's wish, you could upset the other members of the family. However, in each chapter, you can find a comprimise with one additional family member, but you're always going to upset one character.The story is deeply moving and even made me rethink some of my current relationships. It often left me craving for more.The over-all length of the game is about a 2 1/2 hours playthrough (if you're going fast) I took longer because I wanted to value each minute of it and explore everything the game has to offer.The price is a bit high in my opinion, and never went on sale in the 2013 blowout sale (sadness), but hey, if the developer wants to get rich off of this AMAZING game, more power to him! I think the price is well worth it just for the experience--OH! and did I mention those amazing graphics? Nothing overly-realistic, but easy on the eyes with it's 3D 'comic book' illustrations.Side notes:-Linda's (dan's wife) face does look a bit creepy if you get too close to her-I prefer playing in free-play mode (where you can't be seen)-This game is way too amazing to be developed by one person!-voice acting was magnificent!!-[Easter egg?] the meal-list on the fridge changes every chapter and left me laughing Overall rating: 9/10			"

												Recommend, but it's a qualified one.  I really appreciate what this game is doing and I quite enjoyed its nonviolent stealth mechanic and its storyline.  The graphics were nice, the voice acting was good, the music was nice.. the whole thing was a little too ..nice.  The storyline was about making the tough decisions between career and family, something many of us find resonant, and there were no easy answers to some of the dilemmas presented.  Someone else compared it to the first Assassin's Creed and that's not too far off - a promising concept and core mechanic that needs a little more time to mature.Spoilers follow.  The player is a ghost but that entire plotline (via the journals visible only at night) did not resolve - am I K--- ? Or am I an older spirit that inhabits this house and K--- was a person that I drove to suicide?  Or redemption?  Have I as the ghost been haunting this house and helping the various visitors with their life problems since 1948?  Or earlier?  It's not made clear.  Maybe I missed a journal or two.  Considering how the other story beats were hammered home so repeatedly (including The World's Most Obvious Children's Drawings) this was needlessly obscure.  My other problem also involves the storyline.  Sorry, it falls back a little too much on cliche for me to really get invested in the characters.  A struggling writer with an alcohol problem and an ambitious spouse feeling stymied is the stuff of a million short stories.  As soon as I saw that whiskey bottle on the kitchen counter I knew what I was in for.  It wrapped up a little neatly and yes, while I chose the best outcomes I could, I felt the story needed a little more drama and conflict.   Maybe I'll play it again but make the wrong choices.  Or go with Tommy's wishes every time.   Just to see what happens.			"

												I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It's not the best art style I've ever seen but the impact your gameplay has on the characters’ lives really gets your conscious working overtime. Playing a ghost (I guess) living in a vacation house rented by a family for the summer, you spend your time learning about them. Discovering their desires and diving into their memories. Each chapter you have to make a decision about which character you want to help the most. Your decisions carry a lot of weight though because making one character happy will always make another character disappointed. I found this intense as I often wanted to make everyone happy but the game forces you to gather the information first, weigh up the information and consider the consequences carefully before actioning a decision. A great lesson to be teaching.			"

There's a father (A writer stuggling to craete a good story), a mother (A painter trying to find time for their family to be together), and a son (A small boy with reading comprehension problems. You are the one who decides what happenes to them. Will you make the right choice for the best of all of them?			"

												I normally don't play these kind of games as I am not a story driven or emotionally driven gamer, but I decided to try it out since it was on sale this Christmas. I have to admit that this is the first time I have found such a game amazing and emotionally connected. It might be because I can relate to the Novelist as a writer where I am a indie game developer. The struggle of juggling family, friends, work and everything else all the while trying to meet deadlines and realize a passion and dream.So you play as a ""Ghost"" whos purpose is to ""help"" one of the three characters which the writer, his wife and their child. They are on vacation in ""your"" house. You explore their memory and observe their day to find clues to their problems and solutions. You can only pick one solution every chapter, which progresses the story and unfolds the tention between the family. Will the marriage break? Will he finish the book in time? Will the kid hate his father?As the ghost you move from light source to light source, you can flicker the light to create distractions and if you wish you can leave the light source and become more physically visible. But you can't be seen, if you get seen more then twice something happens.Similare games: Dream, Journey and Dear Esther.MINOR SPOILERS:Example of interesting mechanics: If you flicker the light too much and often, they will write to their rent owner that something is wrong with the light. And other stuff happens later depending on how you play and your choices.If you got seen they write in their diares about it and things happen there too.So I recommend this game if you want a different experience that is less game mechanic driven but more story/narrative and emotionally driven.

												Apparently this game is meant to be deep and emotional and contain multiple hard choises. Well, it isn't and doesn't. I couldn't give half a **** about the whiny father, the annoying mother and the insuffrable brat, and do take note I loved To the Moon and A Bird Story. The choises are not hard whatsoever, simply meta-thinking through every level, choosing only by thinking about the previous and next levels and giving a balanced amount of good choises to every family member ensures you get the borderline implausible best ending for everyone. This is even though in every level, regardless of your choices, every time the ""wronged"" party takes it disproportionately hard. All family members are both completely incapable of any choices themselves, or any kind of independent life control without the help of a disembodied helpful ghost. and whiny idiots to whom every every stepback and non-ideal outcome of any situation is a ridiculously hard hit from which they seem to forget quickly enough however. This could be just me, but I have seen games that strive to cause emotions done much better.			"

Your actions seem to have little effect on anything. The plot is pretty cliche in a bad way. Make this story a book, and I would buy it and read it. But as a game, it is kinda lame, and the whole ""sneaking around"" and interactivity just seems barely tagged on. Seriously, I don't know how you could 'fail' in this game, sneaking around the house is so easy, and even if you are caught once, you have enough time to possess a lightbulb and get away scotch free.TL;DR this game isn't really a game, and the story isn't worth playing through it.

												The Novelist digs down deep into the psyche of a family of three. Each person has worries, fears, doubts, hopes, and dreams. Yet, it's up to you to decide who gets what and when. Those decisions effect everyone, not just the three people in the house. You have to listen to the deepest secrets of their hearts and either help them come together through compromise, or achieve their individual dreams at the cost of alienation. The Novelist is a wonderfully written experience and I highly recommend it!			"

												I remember seeing this game on steam greenlight and voting for it instantly. Very glad to see it now on steam because it is quite good. The Novelist is a game that is all about it's story. The game play is essentially walking around the main character Dan's house (or possesing light bulb to light bulb) and discovering what each person living in the house wants. Ultimately you get to decide the fate of the family and of the Novel that Dan is writing, and that is why the game works.Your desicions mattter. It's that simple, but you get to decide the course of the game and that was what made it fun for me (and play it twice). Do I want Dan to write a really good novel, family be damned? Ok, that's possible. Or I can get his family stronger than ever. Or just flat out ruin all of their lives. No matter what you choose to do, the game tells a good, realistic story with  consequences for your actions. Also it tells the story with a nice graphical style and eerie soundtrack.I reccomend this game, consider it on a sale or if you really like story driven games			"

												While ""The Novelist"" isn't a big game with all the flash, spit and polish of a big time game. It has a depth that most of the big games just cannot obtain.You play a ""Ghost"" who's only objective is to follow and learn about a family (Dan, Julia and Tommy) throughout their summer holiday. In doing so, you will learn about their wants and needs, through notes, diaries and by reading their minds. Then you have to make a choice about which option you wish to follow and by doing so, you impact the families life beyond the summer.I bought and played this game for the story and in doing so I found it a worthwhile play. Definitely worthy of the two awards it almost won, but sadly didn't.I do love how there is a comprimise option available, it allows you to give a quarter (i think) of ""Dans"" time to someone else without impacting the main choice (I'm glad it dosen't split it 50/50).The ending I enjoyed, as it actually took into account the choices I had made throughout the course of the game and actually does tell you what everyone did with their lives post ""Ghost"" interferenceThe only things I had annoyances with about the game were first of all, Tommy's drawing (In his head). Even after I had spent a whole day doing what he wanted and another two days of a compromise it didn't change, he just seems to feel a little distant with Dan if you're not with him 24/7 (which may be what they learned after researching how children react to certain things, If so, I apologise to the creators).The other annoying thing was Dans doors. In one mission I chose an option, which made Dan close his doors to work on his book. The part about this that annoyed me was that you can't walk through the doors, or jump to another light to bypass it, you're stuck waiting for him to come out and let you in. Or if you're unlucky you end up stuck in there waiting five minutes for him to open the door. Not a big one, just time consuming and slightly annoying.To sum it up:Pros++ A story that makes sense and is fun to experience+ Character interactions that are very believable+ Nice charming music+ A Branching story that effects the whole game (maybe only in subtile ways)+ Controls are simple (Only w,a,s,d for movement and space and e for interactions)Cons-- No action or excitement, just a nice story.- The models aren't amazingly graphic (but really, they didn't have to be)- What people think in their heads about a situation are silly and sometimes foolish (but isn't that something all humans share)Total Score = 9.5/10To conclude, I would recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys a good story or an interactive story. My only negative that I can think of when recommending ""The Novelist"" is the price tag, $15 is a huge amount of money for a game that lasts no longer than possibly 2 hours. I would like to suggest that if the creators are reading these reviews, that they drop the price to maybe $10 or even $5. A little low I know and possibly stupid you may think, but sales will go down unless your prices do too, just a suggestion.Other than that, beautiful game, beautiful story.And FYI, yes my writing isn't the best and neither is my grammer, you don't need to tell me :P			"

												This is a story of a father, husband and author struggling to balance work with family life. You are a ""ghost"" and placed into a family house, where you must observe them to find out there problems. What makes it unique is the ability to choose your own story. As the story developed and I got to know the family, I started to find myself genuinely struggling with what decision to make for them. Your decisons can have consequences and you will sometimes leave some family members dissapointed, but opitunites come along where you can make others happy if you didn't before. I didn't feel as connected with the characters as i have with other games and it can sometimes seem a bit repetitive. But for a short game it works well.			"

												I normally like exploration games because they're forced to tell a good story and the main mechanic is empathy. The Novelist, though, managed to annoy and make me wish for at least one of the characters to slip into a coma so they'd stop complaining so much. It's basically a story about three selfish people who live together and refuse to comunicate their needs or desires to each other so they just go around being passive agressive. You come in as Casper the friendly ghost who solves all their problems and yet they still act like spoilt brats and pout all day. In the end there's no real sense of completion since you know they'll just basically go back home and make each other miserable again. If playing God is what you're into, go get yourself a copy of the Sims. At least it'll let you remove the pool ladder once in a while.			"

												I have finished the first chapter. Don't expect it is a ""game"" in a traditional sense. It has some elements of games but it only set you up with an environment where you explore the story bit by bit, from one chapter to another. You will face some dillema for each character, some of them about work, some about love relationship, some about family matters. You will be likely to discover more about yourself when you have made certain choices in the game. The graphic is simple and cartoonish. Gameplay: moving around and hide from the character and search for clues (yes this is the only gameplay.)			"

												The Novelist is a story-based game that sees the player take on the role of a ghostly character, assisting the Kaplans, Dan, his wife and his son, in their decisions over the course of a summer break. Gameplay-wise this means finding letters and memories to find out what each family member wants and then finding a specific item in order to fulfil that want. However, you can only please one person each time, compromising with one other which results in there always being a third that doesn’t get their wish. Unfortunately, in terms of gameplay, this becomes very repetitive, quickly turning into a hidden object style game. Where the game hooks you though is from the responses of your actions from each character. Each action’s consequence can be felt emotionally from them and a connection between them and the player is formed. As this is seemingly a rather rare occurrence within the medium, this was a delightful thing to happen. Hopefully future videogames can draw on this and help to create more connections between their players and the characters in their game.The small scale of the story and the before-mentioned repetitive gameplay will put many off, but for those that can look past those points then there is something worth experiencing here.Read My Other ReviewsCheck Out My Curator Page "

												A man takes his wife & young son to a secluded vacation home so that he can focus on writing his next great novel; little do they know that the house is also home to an unknown supernatural force that can worm its way into the father's mind. No, it's not The Shining, it's The Novelist. In it you play a spirit (or something?? it's not actually specified) haunting a house on a cliff. Your goal is to influence the choices of the father/husband character, Dan, by learning as much as you can about him & his family through written & drawn clues scattered around the house as well as by entering each character's memories. Each chapter presents a situation to which there are three solutions: one that most benefits the dad, one the mom, & one the kid. You can also make a secondary ""compromise"" choice that will at least partially satisfy one of the other characters if not totally please them.If ""Stealth"" mode is enabled you have the potential of being spotted by the family while you gather clues during the day, which causes you to lose certain opportunities. You can become invisible & move from one place to the next without being seen by possessing the home's light fixtures, but you can't gather clues when you're in a lamp, so you also have the ability to make a light flicker to distract the family away from where you want to go. There is an alternate ""Story"" mode where you are invisible no matter where you are. In both modes there are some situations where characters will close doors on you (usually if they're mad about being neglected); you can't open or pass through the doors but the family usually opens them again soon enough. There's a subplot that involves gathering clues about the house's past, but that is not mutable based on the player's choices so it feels more like filler material.The gameplay is fairly straightforward, if a little tedious at times. Think ""Gone Home"" in a scaled-down form. The graphics are quite lovely, especially the vistas visible through the windows. Several people have singled out the voice acting as exceptional but I didn't find anything remarkable about it. The plot is... okay. I didn't care much for any of the characters, but I still wanted to make good choices for them. There are multiple happy endings & sad endings possible, although not very many, & none too exciting (certainly nothing close to The Shining in that respect!).Overall though this was a nice game to spend a bit of time on; it's pretty relaxing & there's definitely not anything high stress about it. I enjoyed playing through making choices ""organically"" the first time & then running through it quicker in subsequent replays to get different outcomes. I would definitely recommend doing ""Stealth"" mode for your first playthrough to get the most out of the experience; enable ""Story"" for replays so you can move from choice to choice & clue to clue much quicker & don't have to deal with spending time on repeated material. It goes quickly enough when you do that.Even though it would seem there's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, spending time in this game's world really is soothing, & having different options & routes to take is fun. I like that it's an indie game too. I am happy with my purchase -- but, after all, I bought it on sale, which I would recommend.			"

It was such a fantastic decision.I'm a senior now and Christmas break just started and I'm re-playing for about the fourth time. I still love the game. This game's beautiful story is dripping with subtext and has helped me through some rough patches.Thank you to the devs and I would recommend this game even at a AAA $60 price tag.			"

												I really liked this one, quite the nice little experience.This is a 'game' as a support to tell a story or rather your version of a story, as your choices will affect the outcome. You're basically a ghost in a house where a family moves in for the summer, and you can 'strongly suggest' what path should be chosen by whispering to the people in their sleep. Each day you can only satisfy one desire, and optionally try to find a midway solution for one other person, leaving the last one frustrated.The writing is all too realistic in representing the fight to try to balance a carreer and a family, dreams and immediate needs, aspirations and desires. You are facing writer's block on a deadline. Your son wants attention and needs support no to fall behind in school and have enough self esteem not to get bullied all the time. Your wife is looking for an outlet for her artistic ambitions as well. So little time...Mechanically you listen to them, see their memories, find enough elements to be able to make an impact on their decisions while they sleep. There's not so much ""gameplay"" in here except basic exploration of the same little house each day, unless you enable the mode where they can see you and you have to keep hidden behind them or in the lamps. I have not tried it but that sounded really annoying so I stayed in purely story mode when you're totally invisible to the humans around.This game can be haunting, especially if you're an adult with kids. Playing at work during lunch I needed a couple of minutes to get my thought process out of the Kaplan's life back into my own.Pricing might be a bit high, but this is steam.. just wait..			"

												In The Novelist, you play a meddling ghost that seemingly cares about the family renting your summer home, but actually doesn't give a darn what they want, leaving you to invade their minds and choose their life paths for them.Skulking around from room to room, you discover clues to what Dan (a struggling author), Linda (an once and possibly future painter), and Tommy (lonely child) want to do that week. You then can choose whose desire is most important and go that route. Afterward, still images show the fallout of your 'wisdom.'At nighttime, you can seek clues granting additional insight to the house and your role, and you can creepily hover over the sleeping family and listen to their dream thoughts.This game offers two modes, but I don't know what the developer was thinking. This isn't Splinter Cell -- skip the stealth mode, and focus on the story. After all, what's the fun in ruining-- I mean, guiding lives if your ghostly powers can be stripped from you by being spotted?-----Time to put on my serious pants. I think the premise of The Novelist is brilliant, and there are some powerful moments, but the choices often ring artificial. There were a handful of times that all three members could have compromised, but -- as per the game's rules -- only two of three could be chosen. Also, there were moments where it seemed like there would be positive gains for one or more family members, only for negative ramifications to be thrown in your face because the game's writer didn't think things through.Finally, the endings -- especially Tommy's -- seemed at odds with his own personality, let alone some of the story paths.And that whole stealth mode nonsense...Basically, The Novelist is interesting and worth a playthrough, but I can't really call it good. Nonetheless, I'd at least recommend it if you can nab it for a deep discount. On September 8, 2015, it was $2.24 and I think adventure and narrative fans would absolutely get their money's worth.

												Following the successes of games like Gone Home and Actual Sunlight, The Novelist is another one of those games that will make traditional gamers question whether or not it actually is a game. A huge fan of exploratory/narrative games, however, I did enjoy my 3-4 play-throughs of the game. It doesn't capture the voyeuristic feel quite as fully as Gone Home and doesn't have a story quite as deeply touching as Actual Sunlight; rather, The Novelist falls somewhere between the two as a somewhat memorable, very relatable, and surprisingly touching experience as a voyeur into regular family life. It's a decent game, and although it certainly isn't mind-blowing, it has enough to be worth a play or two.You play as a spectre living in a house that the Kaplan family decides to move into for a summer. Essentially, you ""ghost"" around the house, reading minds and notes, and help the father (the Novelist) make decisions regarding his family. There really isn't much in the way of gameplay (other than a half-hearted and arguably useless stealth option), so the game could be seen as somewhat of a modern Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel. Where the game shines is how sincerely and authentically the writing in the game reads: in fact, by the end of a playthrough, you really do care about what happens to the relationship between the mother and the father. It's because of this emotional investment that I found myself playing the game through several times, wanting to find out what would happen to the mother if I did this, or that.Of course, while The Novelist did manage to get me emotionally invested (which, admittedly, is not a difficult task), it does fall short on a few too many things to be considered a memorable or truly laudable game. Off the top of my head, the game failed terribly at getting the audience to care about the child, the ""stealth"" mechanic was almost laughable and mostly obstructive, and several playthroughs of the game would reveal the endings to be somewhat shallow. Most importantly however, where the game could have been fantastic in its realism, it ended up backing itself into a corner by trying a little too hard. The problems Dan Kaplan faces that summer are very real, but by stressing that ""the decisions Dan made that summer would come to define his life"" (or something similar), The Novelist almost invites cynicism and throws away any chance it could have had at feeling truly authentic.All in all, The Novelist is a decently good game for what it tries to be. Although nobody is likely to remember it a few years from now, it's a promising first foray into narrative indie game development for Kent Hudson.			"

												(Originally posted January 13 2014)Just finished playing The Novelist, a thought–provoking adventure game about balancing the competing demands of family life. While the premise of all life–affecting decisions that affect the family being made by the titular male character is a bit offensive to modern sensibilities, given the game's setting in a era of manual typewriters and hand–written letters, it's forgivable, I suppose. The game is structured in a way that makes me suspect that there is no truly ""good"" ending—I think that someone (one of the game's three characters) will always be left with the short end of the stick, and while that may be a bit contrived, it achieves its intended purpose.I would certainly recommend this game, even to so–called ""non gamers""—it's more about observation, experience, and choice, then about gameplay mechanics.

												Its a ok game to pass some time.  But not verry fun,groundbreaking or mindwakening in anny way(at least for me).You take mundane but important choises for a family father,,like real life decisions.  You have to prioritize;- yourself/the novell or- Your wife(that is a mix of mather for here own painting carer ,yourself and the kid)- Your kid/school and reading problems12 chapters each ending in a choise(and if youre not seen) and a compromise(extra choise with less focus on it)And it all effects the other issues in the game as well, your wifes job, kid and mariage problems ect.Not being able to sleep and intruiged by the idea. I bought this game and found it somewhat entertaining and like i had a impact.. though a somewhat boring story i still wondered at the outcome.I played trough it once, taking my time exploring the story. I probably wont play it ower ,, but i asume there are a number of twists on the story. "

												As much as I hate to say, it has let me down a bit although I was not all disappointed. It still has some good things in the game.The game length was terribly short. I finished the game at only close to 2 hours and buying this game at about $10 does not seem to be all that reasonable (That is the discounted price. The original was close to $20 in SGD) and the gameplay becomes repetitive: Find clues for each character's desires, make a decision, see the outcome and then repeat again. It gets more boring and despite attempts to make things slightly more exciting, it only gives way to 1 or 2 intense moments.Despite that, the story line is extremely flexible. The story is right below, in the description. The rest of the story is pretty much in your own hands. Each decision will even make the character's thoughts or insights different and has the possibility of impacting the ending. What it does good as well as that it is impossible to balance the time and sacrifice is a need. When you make a decision, you affect others in a bad way. It actually forces you to keep questioning if whatever the character is doing is so important and whether another event is more important than the other. You will find yourself spending time on one of them and yet all at the same time, forsaking relationships.3.8/5 It's most unfortunate that the game's story cannot hold out the repetitiveness of the game and the length or it might have been better :/ Until the, get this game only at a discounted price. 75% discount would be better.

												I regret writing this review, as I was really hoping the Novelist, which got a ton of main stream attention, was a worthy entry in the line of ""slice of life"" poetic games like Dear Esther and Gone Home.Unfortunately, where both Dear Esther and Gone Home have something interesting to say about both games and life, The Novelist flounders and gets lost in a sea of ""first world problems"" that makes it hard to empathize with any of the characters.  From a gameplay perspective, the game is boring, symetical, and repetitive.  After finishing the first chapter, you'll be amazed by the potential.  By chapter three, you'll realize you're caught in a gameplay loop of boredom: Find three clues for each of the three characters until you complete each of the three chapters of each of the three episodes.  Yes, that is boring game design.Real Life doesn't work in threes.  So, the family feels compartmentalized, fake and droning.  Unfortunately, where the game could have excelled is with allowing your choices to have meaningful effects on the gameplay paths.  Unlike The Walking Dead, this game is self-contained, so it would have been much more realistic to have a few branches based on player decisions.  Unforutnately all of the ""branches"" are just props placed around the house and a simple follow up letter or picture on the next day after your decision.  Ultimately, there's a recap at the end of the game which crams your decisions into three (that number again) binary ""good"" or ""bad"" results.Ultimately, this game had a lot of potential.  The base format would be a great idea for a scenario where something interesting happens.  White Patriarch trying to decide whether he should drink whiskey or build his son's car is not interesting.   At least not in the way it's presented here.Thumbs down, unfortunately.			"

												A great balancing act between one's dreams and obligations. True to life, the conflicts that arise between a man and his family cause a sense of gravity and depth for every decision and, more importantly, omission.I personally recommend playing in Story mode before trying ""stealth"" mode. That way you can soak yourself in the narrative and not worry about being stealthy. Highly recommended for people who are drawn to narrative driven games like Stanley Parable, Gone Home, The Walking Dead and Dear Esther.			"

												I voted for this game to be Greenlit and was happy to see that it has mostly lived up to the potential it showed then. You play some sort of ghost or spirit that inhabits a house which a writer named Dan and his wife and son rent for the summer so that Dan can focus on working on his next book.  The game is divided into several chapters as the spirit you have to move throughout the house reading letters, reading the family members thoughts and exploring their memories to find out the desires of each family member. You do all this while trying to remain undetected (though if you want to focus on the story you can turn the requirement for stealth off). When you've uncovered each family members desire you have to pick one and whisper it to Dan so it is acted upon. The family member who's desire you picked will be happy but the other two will not. At the end of the chapter after you've made your choice you get to see the outcomes on each character and it is quite difficult to see the negative outcomes as you do end up feeling sorry for them. It's a pity the game doesn't have more solutions that would satisfy more than one character so your decision can become an agonizing choice.The real strength of this game is the story it weaves about the family. You get to know each character and how they feel through their memories and the letters you read and while the story this game tells about them is the typical trials and tribulations of a family, it's done so well that you do end up caring about them and that makes the choices you make that bit more agonizing. The only downside of this game is that the exploration side where you move about the house trying to find letters and look through the families memories gets boring after a short while as it gets repetitive doing more less the same thing in every chapter. Overall though this is a great story based games that will please people who enjoyed games like Gone Home and Dear Esther. It's a 7/10 from me.			"

												Playing early versions of Kent Hudson’s The Novelist excited me over the potential. When it came out, it had exceeded all my expectations. Balancing decisions and making compromises with your career and relationships with your wife and son is very difficult. Often you’ll go into a chapter feeling like Dan absolutely needs to spend more time in one area of life and something happens that makes that decision much harder to make. I’m totally in love with the randomizations and natural unbalance the game presents. Nine chapters in a random order, three potential choices, even the music throughout the game is randomly generated. The Novelist is brilliant.			"

												A choice based game where you play as a ghost like being who floats around getting to know the family and their problems. You can investigate and find out what each character wants, then at the end of the day whisper into Dan’s ear, what he should do. Pretty straight forward but you decisions keep caring over as the characters keep thinking about what they did or did not get to do. Are you going to be a helpful ghost? Or try to pull the family apart? Help Dan decide… if he even decides at all, or is it just you putting ideas there?A short, fast game but definitely worth a replay to see how things would turn out differently when you favour one character over another. 7/10I wouldn’t say it’s worth $17 CAD but a good game to get on sale!

Real life is never as simple as the binary choices the user is expected to make in this plot and many people will feel quite frustrated and disatisfied with the limited possibilities.

												A game that gets to the heart of what it means to be a good person.  It's a question I've wrestled with my entire life.  There is a line-- somewhere, for everyone-- that has to be drawn.  When do you stop helping other people and start helping yourself?  You can always be helping other people.  You could be doing it right now, but you're not.  You're reading this.  To find a game that forces you to make those decisions is both welcoming and painful.  I played it straight through, and I won't tell you the ending I received, but it's probably obvious.  I would imagine that Jesus had to take time for himself.  I would imagine Jesus wanted to escape from everything and be alone his entire life because it decreases the obligation and the guilt that goes along with not helping others.  But he kept helping.  And died for it.  I guess there's a quiet beauty in that.			"

												This game clocks in at just shy of 2 hours. Most of that time is spent crawling all over the same map, over and over again, searching for ""clues"" while trying not to get detected by the humans. In nine chapters, you will search one single confined map as many as 36 times for roughly 135 clues - and that's the entire game. You find 135 bits of trash and make nine decisions, choosing each time from six possible alternatives. That is the entire ""game;"" much like To The Moon, this is a visual novel, not anything a normal person would describe as a game. Frankly, I don't see why this has gotten such accolades.The execution is plodding to say the least; when I said most of your time will be spent ""crawling"" over the map, I wasn't kidding - the player's movement speed is agonizingly slow; learning to blink most effectively from one light fixture to the next is necessary just to pick up the pace a little.As one tabletop gamer's wife once observed, ""it's twenty minutes of fun packed into four hours.""

												While ""The Novelist"" isn't a big game with all the flash, spit and polish of a big time game. It has a depth that most of the big games just cannot obtain.You play a ""Ghost"" who's only objective is to follow and learn about a family (Dan, Julia and Tommy) throughout their summer holiday. In doing so, you will learn about their wants and needs, through notes, diaries and by reading their minds. Then you have to make a choice about which option you wish to follow and by doing so, you impact the families life beyond the summer.I bought and played this game for the story and in doing so I found it a worthwhile play. Definitely worthy of the two awards it almost won, but sadly didn't.I do love how there is a comprimise option available, it allows you to give a quarter (i think) of ""Dans"" time to someone else without impacting the main choice (I'm glad it dosen't split it 50/50).The ending I enjoyed, as it actually took into account the choices I had made throughout the course of the game and actually does tell you what everyone did with their lives post ""Ghost"" interferenceThe only things I had annoyances with about the game were first of all, Tommy's drawing (In his head). Even after I had spent a whole day doing what he wanted and another two days of a compromise it didn't change, he just seems to feel a little distant with Dan if you're not with him 24/7 (which may be what they learned after researching how children react to certain things, If so, I apologise to the creators).The other annoying thing was Dans doors. In one mission I chose an option, which made Dan close his doors to work on his book. The part about this that annoyed me was that you can't walk through the doors, or jump to another light to bypass it, you're stuck waiting for him to come out and let you in. Or if you're unlucky you end up stuck in there waiting five minutes for him to open the door. Not a big one, just time consuming and slightly annoying.To sum it up:Pros++ A story that makes sense and is fun to experience+ Character interactions that are very believable+ Nice charming music+ A Branching story that effects the whole game (maybe only in subtile ways)+ Controls are simple (Only w,a,s,d for movement and space and e for interactions)Cons-- No action or excitement, just a nice story.- The models aren't amazingly graphic (but really, they didn't have to be)- What people think in their heads about a situation are silly and sometimes foolish (but isn't that something all humans share)Total Score = 9.5/10To conclude, I would recommend this game highly to anyone who enjoys a good story or an interactive story. My only negative that I can think of when recommending ""The Novelist"" is the price tag, $15 is a huge amount of money for a game that lasts no longer than possibly 2 hours. I would like to suggest that if the creators are reading these reviews, that they drop the price to maybe $10 or even $5. A little low I know and possibly stupid you may think, but sales will go down unless your prices do too, just a suggestion.Other than that, beautiful game, beautiful story.And FYI, yes my writing isn't the best and neither is my grammer, you don't need to tell me :P			"

												The Novelist is one of those games that helps you think more than you should not about the mechanics but about the decisions you make. In the game you play a ghost who tries to reconcile the issues of the familiy evenly and in hopes that they end up all well. I found myself thinking at the end of the game why i chose to neglect the child so much and whether that reflects my personal priorities in life. Overall The Novelist is a great game that i recommend.			"

												The Novelist is an original and refreshing idea in storytelling slightly imperfectly executed, but still well worth playing. Coming out of the gate, it's an exhilarating storytelling experience that really gets you engage in the game. The chief issue is that the further you play, the more repetetive and almost rote the gameplay becomes. Add to that some fairly contrived-seeming conflicts of choice, and it falls a little short of the mark that it sets at its outset. However, that mark is so high that what you get instead is still a really worthwhile experience. Part of me wants to replay the game and see what different choices result in, but there's no way to do that quickly, so I'll have to wait until there's more time. I won't be surprised if I do some day return to it, though. If you have any interest at all in unique gameplay and game-based storytelling on a personal level (dealing with ordinary people's lives rather than having to guide the Chosen One to defeat the Emperor of All Evil), then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

												I guess this is just not my cup of tea.The game os more based on observation. It is not that challenging and the story is not that brilliant to keep you engaged.If you read a lot of books, and prefer to think, and not only observe I can't recomend this to you.			"

												In The Novelist, you play as a ghost in a house where the Kaplan family has come for a summer vacation. The husband is the titular novelist, the wife is attempting to get back into painting and their young son  has a slight learning disability . Both the child and wife wish to have more family time (amongst other things), whereas the dad is under pressure to complete his current novel in an attempt to meet deadlines. There are also many other events that happen (all narrated via text or background image+text) but I won't go into those to avoid spoilers.The basic gameplay is fairly simple: Teleporting from one active lamp to another (stealth) in your field of view. This is disabled is the difficulty mode called Story. You are suggested to be stealthy so that you have increased story options. Going into people's memories to encounter small ""clues"" regarding what the character wants. Investigate different objects in the household such as reading notes, diary entries and seeing drawings made by the little boy. Making choices regarding whose desired outcome should play out (the husband's, wife's or child's). There is also an additional option for compromise on one of these outcomes (I think this is not available if you are seen by the family member, but I'm not too sure because I was never detected). The compromise is not always a positive thing, so it feels like a different option not just a second desirable outcome that makes one more family member happy. At night--when everybody is asleep--you can explore the house for clues related to it's past. This is always in the form of diaries or notes that glow.What I liked: The story choices have some genuine emotional impact, at least for me. You may read some of the other reviews which do not agree with mne on this front. The gameplay is simplistic without making small mistakes like too many collectibles, over-dramatic scenes, frustrating/inconsistent stealth mechanics. Some of the other reviewers had issues with bugs but I didn't have any issues (I have completed the game once). The voice acting is very good, and most (if not all) the notes and diary entries are narrated if you enable that option. The Story mode difficulty option is a good choice if you want to introduce the game to a non-gamer.What I misliked: The characters do not have any real in-game chatter/conversations. This was a real bummer but I can understand why this decision was made; if you are in another room, you cannot see the body language of the characters as they talk.  The short story arcs of the history of the house do not really tie in to the main story and are way too short to evoke a genuine response. While the shortness is explained in the context of the story (the house has cheap rent and few takers because of its past tenants' short stays), I think that the brevity robs the stories of genuine emotional impact. The gameplay gets repititive after the 2-hour mark or so. Thankfully the game doesn't overstay its welcome by much.Other notes:The ""About This Game"" says that: The decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself. While ymmv, I think this was true in my case. There is no one solution makes everybody happy (in a family) and this comes out beautifully in the game. I think at the end of the game, you should have been shown a tree showing the branching decisions you've made and the results of each so that you can look at the ending in a clearer context. "

												Oh boy i wish i could like the game, but the lazy writing ruined the great style of the game. First of iam a really really big fan of cel shading, love it. Then the gameplay, instead of the overpriced walking simulator you have actual stuff to do. You walk through the house searching for clues to figure out the ""dilemmas"" of the family. Then you are able to read the thought of a person he has right in this moment and when you press Space you enter the person's mind and have to search for 3 memories he has. The game is split in 3 parts, which consists of 3 parts on their own. The game even started nicely, he has a writing block, the boy got bullied in school and she, well makes everyone problems to hers. The choices in the beginning made sens and were connected together, so it was logical that choosing one, made the other not possible. But later into the game the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Not only you are annoyed of the whiny attitude of the man, no the choices were more and more on their own and choosing one didnt make the other impossible. But the developer found it okay, that choosing to help the boy, made it impossible for the woman to wear a sweater, who just lies on the very bed she is sitting on. And if that is not enough, she seriously gets upset because she ""couldn't"" wear the sweater and of course her mother calls, she ""hears"" that her daughter is upset, but well her mother is cheap and didnt want to talk about.......she not able to wear a ♥♥♥♥ING SWEATER.

												Over the course of three ""months"", I had to deal with the imaginary hardships of a virtual family of three, struggling to pull together all the fictional unraveling threads of their simulated lives.A failing couple, a writer trying to keep up with his responsibilities, a mother trying to take her own place in the art world with her talents, a child with a reading disability who needs support, and an endless onslaught of stuff getting in the way.Ultimately, nothing you do will turn out quite the way you want. As with Life, you do the best you can.So, Dan finished his book to critical acclaim and retired after a distinguished career.He and his wife, Linda, became closer, bouncing back from the precipice of divorce, instead growing old together in love.At the cost of Linda's hopes for her paintings... and of Tommy's success in life, growing up to be a talentless nobody.It may be the headache and fever from the flu I'm dealing with as I write this, or my emotional exhaustion from my own problems in life, but I cried.I'm still crying. I ask myself what I could have done differently. Did I spend too much time on the book? Should I have let Tommy stay at his school? Perhaps avoid moving so as to let Linda work for her art-based charity group? I ruined the poor kid's life, and it shocks me even though he's just a few pixels in a game.But perhaps I'm crying because I know I could play again and make different choices for Dan, Linda, and Tommy.Perhaps I'm crying because we don't get that chance ourselves.Play this game once.  Only once. It's not fair to get do-overs.I'm sorry, Tommy.			"

												  The game's minimalist art stole my heart from the moment I saw it. Not only is it easy on the computer- its simply wonderous on your eyes. The entire concept behind the game is uniqe and refreshing. I'm rather tired of shooting zombies, nazis, or aliens.    The ambiguity within the game makes the story entirely your own, which is beautiful. The characters are relatable- and I felt actual disappointment when I wasn't able to make all of them happy. It also told me quite a lot about who I was as a person and where my priorities lie. I can honestly say that a game has never done that for me since Shadow of the Colossus. I honestly don't want to replay the game with different choices- not because it was bad but because it would ruin my immersion.    The game is overall beautiful, memorable, and fun.     I don't have a lot of bad things to say about it- if anything at all other than that I was sad it was so short. Of course, it has a lot of replay value and I understand its shortness it not being a triple A title.    I give it a 9.5/10 and highly recommend it for people who are looking for a more artistic and story-driven game.			"

												Yes it is slow and very indie. But you love that otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. The novolost uses a rather cool mechanic where you go around a house collecting memories and information from letters or drawings. After that you can make a decission what will happen to the 3 inhabitants. A man who is writing a book (you can help him achieve that), his wife who to be happy demands time from him (which you can choose) OR there kid who wants attention from his dad aswel. If you play it write you can choose helping two persons. I really felt sorry for the person who i didn't pick every time and the fact that you can get a different outcome with every chapter makes it nicely replayable. Is it worth the 15 bucks? I don't think so. Should you get it for half or less in a sale. Yes you should. exploring the story on you own is just really nice just like it was with Gone Home. Just get gaming!			"

												The Novelist really does provide a wonderful experience that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions as you try and meet the needs of two struggling parents and their child. You play as a ghost in their summer house, being able to possess lights in order to get around. You are able to walk around the house (instead of possessing lights), but if you're playing on Stealth mode (which I recommend, because it's not that hard and hence adds a bit more to the experience) and are spotted, this will have negative consequences on the lives you are attempting to save.The main idea of the game is this: you search the house for clues as to what each character's dilemma is. Once you have found these clues, you are then able to search through their memories and try and figure out a solution. Then you choose your solution, which is always a difficult choice given the ramifications. Following this, whilst the family is sleeping, you are able to search the house for information about the history of the house and discover what *you* are. Given that you did not spook any characters whilst looking for information, you are given the ability to make a compromise on someone else's dilemma, making them less disappointed, but there is always someone who will be disappointed.At first, I thought this concept would get boring and repetetive, and after the first month (there are three in total), I thought this was becoming the truth. However, I became intrigued with each character and their story, desiring to make each the most satisfied they could get. Doing this, though, is what is hard. It reminded me of decision-making seen in Telltale's games, where you would feel proud of your decision at first, but no matter what decision it was, you then felt sad and like you really messed up. I don't want to spoil the game, as it is very heavily story-driven, but I will say it again: it was an emotional rollercoaster, but one that I enjoyed all the way through.For the $15 pricetag, I would say waiting for a sale would be a good idea, at least 50% off. It's not that it's a bad game, because I clearly pointed out that it was an enjoyable experience, it's just short. Not TOO short, because I finished it satisfied, but not long enough to justify the price. The aesthetic, sound, controls, and performance had no issues with me, too, so I'd say that anyone who likes a story-driven game (e.g. Telltale games, Brothers) will thoroughly enjoy this little experience.Enjoy :)			"

												An interesting story driven game. You play as a benevolent spirit that helps guide the decision of the father in this family of three while they are on vacation. Will you focus on your novel? Or will you focus on your family?The gameplay is nice for a ""walking-simulator."" This is the game Gone Home wishes it was. In fact forget Gone Home exists. Play this, when someone mentions Gone Home assume they mean this game. It has all of the character driven story that Gone Home has along with the ability to fail, AND it also has decisions that impact the story. Will you work on your novel? Will you take your child to the beach instead? What about the wife you're neglecting?One of the better inclusions the game has is the ability to switch the stealth gameplay on or off.  This is an inclusion that acts as a wonderful way to bridge the gap for those that only want to experience the story.The Novelist isn't the best Walking-Sim game out there, but it certainly is one of the most enjoyable.

												It's a cool concept. It captured this interesting feeling of being a phantom, watching others live their lives and dropping hints into it. The big flaw is the boring story, which lacked any meaningful conflict or stakes. I kept waiting for the writer to get too drunk and hit the kid, or the kid to set something on fire, or the wife to pick up heroin as a hobby that could enhance her art. None of that happened. It was a mostly vacuous story of very insipid lives. The most interesting thing was that one weekend the writer guy's friends might drop in while the artist wife's parents were in town, possibly down on their luck; the kid wanted to have a sleepover, too. I couldn't find how I could pick all of these to happen, so I went with the wife's parents stopping by, with the guy's friends on the side. The friends didn't come and the parents were pleasant, apparently loaded too. At least the snorefest happen offscreen. What a flaming giftbasket of upper middle class defecation. It's basically a fantasy game for poor writers who need a little wish fulfillment. I don't know if I should recommend it of not. Okay, I recommend it to people who like boring and bland stories.			"

												I'm not normally one to play this type of game, but I found myself coming back to it constantly as I became interested in how the story was unfolding.  At first I thought it would be relatively simple, but each time I made a choice I ended up feeling bad for one of the characters no matter what I did.  I was determined to win the game though, so I kept playing.  Only to find out in the end that it isn't so much about winning, as it is about making choices.  Because that is what life is all about isn't it?  Making choices.  The easy ones, and the hard ones.  It's about juggling things to try and reach a happy balance.I was honestly happy with the game, despite how short it was.  I purchased this in the Humble Bundle pack, so as it came with a few other games, I was happy with the very small price I paid.  I doubt I would pay full price for the game though, despite it being a good concept.Overall, I think I would give this game about 7/10.  It was interesting, and the concept was great.  I doubt I'll play it much now that I've finished it once (I got a relatively happy ending for everyone, thank the gods), but it was enjoyable nonetheless.			"

You can investigate and find out what each character wants, then at the end of the day whisper into Dan’s ear, what he should do. Pretty straight forward but you decisions keep caring over as the characters keep thinking about what they did or did not get to do. Are you going to be a helpful ghost? Or try to pull the family apart? Help Dan decide… if he even decides at all, or is it just you putting ideas there?A short, fast game but definitely worth a replay to see how things would turn out differently when you favour one character over another. 7/10I wouldn’t say it’s worth $17 CAD but a good game to get on sale!

												I really liked this one, quite the nice little experience.This is a 'game' as a support to tell a story or rather your version of a story, as your choices will affect the outcome. You're basically a ghost in a house where a family moves in for the summer, and you can 'strongly suggest' what path should be chosen by whispering to the people in their sleep. Each day you can only satisfy one desire, and optionally try to find a midway solution for one other person, leaving the last one frustrated.The writing is all too realistic in representing the fight to try to balance a carreer and a family, dreams and immediate needs, aspirations and desires. You are facing writer's block on a deadline. Your son wants attention and needs support no to fall behind in school and have enough self esteem not to get bullied all the time. Your wife is looking for an outlet for her artistic ambitions as well. So little time...Mechanically you listen to them, see their memories, find enough elements to be able to make an impact on their decisions while they sleep. There's not so much ""gameplay"" in here except basic exploration of the same little house each day, unless you enable the mode where they can see you and you have to keep hidden behind them or in the lamps. I have not tried it but that sounded really annoying so I stayed in purely story mode when you're totally invisible to the humans around.This game can be haunting, especially if you're an adult with kids. Playing at work during lunch I needed a couple of minutes to get my thought process out of the Kaplan's life back into my own.Pricing might be a bit high, but this is steam.. just wait..			"

												A man takes his wife & young son to a secluded vacation home so that he can focus on writing his next great novel; little do they know that the house is also home to an unknown supernatural force that can worm its way into the father's mind. No, it's not The Shining, it's The Novelist. In it you play a spirit (or something?? it's not actually specified) haunting a house on a cliff. Your goal is to influence the choices of the father/husband character, Dan, by learning as much as you can about him & his family through written & drawn clues scattered around the house as well as by entering each character's memories. Each chapter presents a situation to which there are three solutions: one that most benefits the dad, one the mom, & one the kid. You can also make a secondary ""compromise"" choice that will at least partially satisfy one of the other characters if not totally please them.If ""Stealth"" mode is enabled you have the potential of being spotted by the family while you gather clues during the day, which causes you to lose certain opportunities. You can become invisible & move from one place to the next without being seen by possessing the home's light fixtures, but you can't gather clues when you're in a lamp, so you also have the ability to make a light flicker to distract the family away from where you want to go. There is an alternate ""Story"" mode where you are invisible no matter where you are. In both modes there are some situations where characters will close doors on you (usually if they're mad about being neglected); you can't open or pass through the doors but the family usually opens them again soon enough. There's a subplot that involves gathering clues about the house's past, but that is not mutable based on the player's choices so it feels more like filler material.The gameplay is fairly straightforward, if a little tedious at times. Think ""Gone Home"" in a scaled-down form. The graphics are quite lovely, especially the vistas visible through the windows. Several people have singled out the voice acting as exceptional but I didn't find anything remarkable about it. The plot is... okay. I didn't care much for any of the characters, but I still wanted to make good choices for them. There are multiple happy endings & sad endings possible, although not very many, & none too exciting (certainly nothing close to The Shining in that respect!).Overall though this was a nice game to spend a bit of time on; it's pretty relaxing & there's definitely not anything high stress about it. I enjoyed playing through making choices ""organically"" the first time & then running through it quicker in subsequent replays to get different outcomes. I would definitely recommend doing ""Stealth"" mode for your first playthrough to get the most out of the experience; enable ""Story"" for replays so you can move from choice to choice & clue to clue much quicker & don't have to deal with spending time on repeated material. It goes quickly enough when you do that.Even though it would seem there's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, spending time in this game's world really is soothing, & having different options & routes to take is fun. I like that it's an indie game too. I am happy with my purchase -- but, after all, I bought it on sale, which I would recommend.			"

												A nice relatively quick game to past the time. As the game progresses towards the end it becomes tiring on a two pronged level. On the one hand, the gameplay becomes a bit repetitive as each level you essentially do the same thing. However, the story and choices become much more ""emotionally"" difficult to make. Depending on what you value as a person within your own life, the decision in the last chapters become some of the hardest to make. Those with a strong literary ties will struggle making the final decision.			"

												In The Novelist, you play a meddling ghost that seemingly cares about the family renting your summer home, but actually doesn't give a darn what they want, leaving you to invade their minds and choose their life paths for them.Skulking around from room to room, you discover clues to what Dan (a struggling author), Linda (an once and possibly future painter), and Tommy (lonely child) want to do that week. You then can choose whose desire is most important and go that route. Afterward, still images show the fallout of your 'wisdom.'At nighttime, you can seek clues granting additional insight to the house and your role, and you can creepily hover over the sleeping family and listen to their dream thoughts.This game offers two modes, but I don't know what the developer was thinking. This isn't Splinter Cell -- skip the stealth mode, and focus on the story. After all, what's the fun in ruining-- I mean, guiding lives if your ghostly powers can be stripped from you by being spotted?-----Time to put on my serious pants. I think the premise of The Novelist is brilliant, and there are some powerful moments, but the choices often ring artificial. There were a handful of times that all three members could have compromised, but -- as per the game's rules -- only two of three could be chosen. Also, there were moments where it seemed like there would be positive gains for one or more family members, only for negative ramifications to be thrown in your face because the game's writer didn't think things through.Finally, the endings -- especially Tommy's -- seemed at odds with his own personality, let alone some of the story paths.And that whole stealth mode nonsense...Basically, The Novelist is interesting and worth a playthrough, but I can't really call it good. Nonetheless, I'd at least recommend it if you can nab it for a deep discount. On September 8, 2015, it was $2.24 and I think adventure and narrative fans would absolutely get their money's worth.

												This is a game that I am going to give a very soft recommendation for, because while this game has plenty of faults, I still enjoyed playing through it and I think others would too.At it's core, The Novelist is a game about interpersonal conflict and the moral and ethical struggles that comes with trying to balance the wants and needs of individuals in a family. Each chapter in the game presents the player with three desires, one for each member of the family, and you are asked to make a decision based on these desires. I personally enjoyed exploring the house to find all the clues to each family member and I also enjoyed going through their memories to learn more about the situation as well.However there are several problems I have with The Novelist, the chief one being that the story in and of itself isn't that interesting. It's a typical story, Dad wants to work on his novel, Mom wants to save the marriage and get back into a profession she had to give up when the kid arrived, and the kid wants to play with Dad and is struggling in school and is bullied. We've all seen stories that use these elements elsewhere, and they used them a lot better there. Another issue I had was that the individual chapters didn't seem to be all that connected. Each chapter felt more like variations of the same 3 or 4 issues and the decisions made in the previous chapter seemed to have little influence in other chapters.			"

												I just finished the story and want to share what a wonderful experience this game is and why.This game does not have AAA graphics or something like that. You propably won`t even catch the atmosphere all the time because some phrases of the people repeat very quickly. The whole game just relies on the story you are creating. Even if I did not know too much about the family members, they felt like desperate but warming natures. I even had a hard time playing the game because I did not want to leave any of my beloved ones behind.Keep in mind that this is rather a deep and saddening atmosphere/story so if you are a whiny person by nature, you propably will cry at least once.The playing time is rather short with 3 hours but it felt like this time was enough to enjoy what the game wanted me to give. When I finished I felt rewarded for every second, I spent into it.Thanks for this honest and rewarding game!			"

												The game is well written, I'll give it that. It gives a stream of difficult choices to make when trying to balance out the family and keep everyone at least somewhat happy.However, it's not much of a game. That two hours that I put into it? That's how long it took for me to finish it up. There's a severe lack of actual gameplay. You're a ghost that's trying not to be discovered. It's ridiculously simple to not be found. Even if you are found, you have a second chance to avoid ""spooking"" the person that found you. And if you do spook them? Well, the only consequence is that you can't pick their compromise at the end of the chapter.The game's not really worth the $15 I spent on it, which is quite unfortunate. If you can pick it up on sale, go for it. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing.			"

												Pros: lovely storyline, realistic family issues, lots of ways to make choices and affect the outcome of the story. Beautiful artwork, both when moving through the story and when seeing the panels depicting the outcome of your choices. The voiceover work is extraordinary, especially on the part of the father figure. Cons: movement is a bit repetitive. Setting never changes. Sometimes it was hard to position yourself to view a memory.A bit short. Definitely requires another play-through. I made good choices last time, so maybe this time I'll try and screw things up a bit. Absolutely worth sitting through and playing, though, a good chunk at a time.			"

												The Novelist is a game that wears the title ""art game"" proudly. The game is short, and can be beaten in about 2 hours, though you're intended to replay through the game if you don't get the best ending (which I got my first try). It's an interesting concept for a game. You play as a ghost that inhabits a summer beach house, as you watch the lives of a novelist and his family unfold over the course of the summer. Your job is to sneak unseen through the house and find various clues about what each family member wants to do for the chapter. You can only pick one of the three options, though at night if you succesfully remained unseen through the day time, you're allowed to pick a compromise option for another member as well. While the game does succesfully avoid the label of walking simulator, the truth is the game play really isn't all that fun. It's insanely easy to remain undeteced through every chapter, making the stealth elements not really matter all that much, and in fact you can even turn off detection in the options menu without any sort of penalty as far as I can tell. Despite controversies surrounding Gone Home, that game at least had a sense of exploration which added a little bit to the game play. Here, there's really nothing. The house is a small two story house with nothing really to explore, or find. The games biggest down fall is that you don't really don't end up caring about the characters. There's nothing incredibly interesting about them, and most of the game consists of them complaining about their lives, or another member of the family. Since you can only choose up to 2 of the 3 options given to you on any given night, this means one is always going to be dissapointed. The only real strategy is just to get on a rotation of selecting each family members option every 3 days, so you can somewhat please everyone. There's no big complicated moral questions that you have to weigh before selecting one such as games by Tell Tale. Here the decisions are rather inane, such as, "" should the dad play a board game with his son, or should he spend the night writing a bit of his novel?"" If this sounds exciting to you I recommend picking the game up when it's on sale. If you like art games, there are better ones out there than this.			"

												The Novelist is, overall, a fairly well thought-out game. Allowing you to manipulate a family's thoughts and influence their decisions. Although the family's reactions and conclusions are often closer to the extreme side of things, this game was still an enjoyable experience.My one peeve is that Linda (the wife) is a bit unrealistic in her reactions. If you don't do exactly what she wants, she acts unhappy and selfish. Even if you have Dan spend time with their son Tommy, she still feels neglected. I really grew to dislike her.			"

												An inteligent game (experience?) in which you attempt to influence and balance the aspirations and emotions of Dan (Husband and writer), Linda (Wife and artist), Tommy (Son) while they have a summer retreat to try to help Dan write his latest book. You can choose to support one character in each chapter (level?) of the game, and then if you havn't been spotted you have the chance of picking one of two possible compromises.The balancing act of trying to keep everyone happy allthewhile trying to get Dan's book finished is a tough one indeed.There are two game modes (difficulties), one which I refer to as stalker mode, which is the tougher mode, in which you have to avoid being spotted. Or story mode, in which you can just concentrate on the story side of things.If you enjoy the likes of inteligent games/experiences such as Dear Esther and Ether One, then The Novelist will be right up your alley. But if you are looking for non-stop action and shooting suff (Eagle, flag, explosions, ""'Merica"") then you would be better looking elsewhere.			"

												This game clocks in at just shy of 2 hours. Most of that time is spent crawling all over the same map, over and over again, searching for ""clues"" while trying not to get detected by the humans. In nine chapters, you will search one single confined map as many as 36 times for roughly 135 clues - and that's the entire game. You find 135 bits of trash and make nine decisions, choosing each time from six possible alternatives. That is the entire ""game;"" much like To The Moon, this is a visual novel, not anything a normal person would describe as a game. Frankly, I don't see why this has gotten such accolades.The execution is plodding to say the least; when I said most of your time will be spent ""crawling"" over the map, I wasn't kidding - the player's movement speed is agonizingly slow; learning to blink most effectively from one light fixture to the next is necessary just to pick up the pace a little.As one tabletop gamer's wife once observed, ""it's twenty minutes of fun packed into four hours.""

												The Novelist is an original and refreshing idea in storytelling slightly imperfectly executed, but still well worth playing. Coming out of the gate, it's an exhilarating storytelling experience that really gets you engage in the game. The chief issue is that the further you play, the more repetetive and almost rote the gameplay becomes. Add to that some fairly contrived-seeming conflicts of choice, and it falls a little short of the mark that it sets at its outset. However, that mark is so high that what you get instead is still a really worthwhile experience. Part of me wants to replay the game and see what different choices result in, but there's no way to do that quickly, so I'll have to wait until there's more time. I won't be surprised if I do some day return to it, though. If you have any interest at all in unique gameplay and game-based storytelling on a personal level (dealing with ordinary people's lives rather than having to guide the Chosen One to defeat the Emperor of All Evil), then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

												As much as I hate to say, it has let me down a bit although I was not all disappointed. It still has some good things in the game.The game length was terribly short. I finished the game at only close to 2 hours and buying this game at about $10 does not seem to be all that reasonable (That is the discounted price. The original was close to $20 in SGD) and the gameplay becomes repetitive: Find clues for each character's desires, make a decision, see the outcome and then repeat again. It gets more boring and despite attempts to make things slightly more exciting, it only gives way to 1 or 2 intense moments.Despite that, the story line is extremely flexible. The story is right below, in the description. The rest of the story is pretty much in your own hands. Each decision will even make the character's thoughts or insights different and has the possibility of impacting the ending. What it does good as well as that it is impossible to balance the time and sacrifice is a need. When you make a decision, you affect others in a bad way. It actually forces you to keep questioning if whatever the character is doing is so important and whether another event is more important than the other. You will find yourself spending time on one of them and yet all at the same time, forsaking relationships.3.8/5 It's most unfortunate that the game's story cannot hold out the repetitiveness of the game and the length or it might have been better :/ Until the, get this game only at a discounted price. 75% discount would be better.

												Following the successes of games like Gone Home and Actual Sunlight, The Novelist is another one of those games that will make traditional gamers question whether or not it actually is a game. A huge fan of exploratory/narrative games, however, I did enjoy my 3-4 play-throughs of the game. It doesn't capture the voyeuristic feel quite as fully as Gone Home and doesn't have a story quite as deeply touching as Actual Sunlight; rather, The Novelist falls somewhere between the two as a somewhat memorable, very relatable, and surprisingly touching experience as a voyeur into regular family life. It's a decent game, and although it certainly isn't mind-blowing, it has enough to be worth a play or two.You play as a spectre living in a house that the Kaplan family decides to move into for a summer. Essentially, you ""ghost"" around the house, reading minds and notes, and help the father (the Novelist) make decisions regarding his family. There really isn't much in the way of gameplay (other than a half-hearted and arguably useless stealth option), so the game could be seen as somewhat of a modern Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel. Where the game shines is how sincerely and authentically the writing in the game reads: in fact, by the end of a playthrough, you really do care about what happens to the relationship between the mother and the father. It's because of this emotional investment that I found myself playing the game through several times, wanting to find out what would happen to the mother if I did this, or that.Of course, while The Novelist did manage to get me emotionally invested (which, admittedly, is not a difficult task), it does fall short on a few too many things to be considered a memorable or truly laudable game. Off the top of my head, the game failed terribly at getting the audience to care about the child, the ""stealth"" mechanic was almost laughable and mostly obstructive, and several playthroughs of the game would reveal the endings to be somewhat shallow. Most importantly however, where the game could have been fantastic in its realism, it ended up backing itself into a corner by trying a little too hard. The problems Dan Kaplan faces that summer are very real, but by stressing that ""the decisions Dan made that summer would come to define his life"" (or something similar), The Novelist almost invites cynicism and throws away any chance it could have had at feeling truly authentic.All in all, The Novelist is a decently good game for what it tries to be. Although nobody is likely to remember it a few years from now, it's a promising first foray into narrative indie game development for Kent Hudson.			"

												(Originally posted January 13 2014)Just finished playing The Novelist, a thought–provoking adventure game about balancing the competing demands of family life. While the premise of all life–affecting decisions that affect the family being made by the titular male character is a bit offensive to modern sensibilities, given the game's setting in a era of manual typewriters and hand–written letters, it's forgivable, I suppose. The game is structured in a way that makes me suspect that there is no truly ""good"" ending—I think that someone (one of the game's three characters) will always be left with the short end of the stick, and while that may be a bit contrived, it achieves its intended purpose.I would certainly recommend this game, even to so–called ""non gamers""—it's more about observation, experience, and choice, then about gameplay mechanics.

												You are an haunt in a house occupied for the summer by a dysfunctional family - a depressive, alcohol-prone father, a mother who gave up her painting career for family and a son that utterly ignores her, fixated as he it on the fatherly figure whose attention he so much craves that his happiness entirely depends on him.What the game does brilliantly is to remind us, the players, of the tragedy of familiar life, in which the parent's goals could be fulfilled, or at least compromised, if not for the children throwing numerous wrenches in the works. The message is apparently clear: if you want to fulfill your dreams, your descendents won't be heppy, and if you make them happy, you will have failed at your path, ensuring they will fail at theirs when their time as parents come in an eternal cycle of self-denial. Or not :) What remains is that you, the player/presence, whose actions touch so many, seen from time to time creeping right behind someone loved, whose presence is felt thoughout history and with the power to change the minds of the occupiers, you will still be alone and hiding, never really living a story of your own - not until you get out of the house.

												In the Novelist you play as a vauge, intangible, but somehow visible, entity that can somehow influence the decisions of people living in a secluded house. You must sneak around teh house examining letters, journals, and even combing through the memories of the inhabitants, then make a choice for one of them that will necesarily mean sacrificing the happiness of the others. It's an interesting idea that's realized well in purely mechanical terms. I'd slike to try a game using the same engine that tells a more interesting story. Unfortunately, the actual game is terrible due to being the poorly told story of a horrible clan of boring idiots. The people in the house arbitrarily fixate on doing particular things, and then cannot be happy unless everyone else is forced to do that and only that. They'll decide to go camping, for example, and then they will talk of nothing else until ti's been decided. You can literally peer into their very soul and all you will find is them saying they want to go camping. To be sure, there's existential terror to that idscovery, but not the kind the creator intended.If you really want to see a good idea squandered, maybe pick this up in a steep sale. Otherwise save your money.			"

												This game has some flaws. Maybe, the gameplay is a bit redundant and overall repetitive. The graphics are rather simple (not ugly, simple!) and there is a low density of details. True.On the other side there is a game that is pretty heart shacking and intellectual challenging. The game is basic, but that has its meaning because it focuses you on the story, the characters, the development and, most of all, your decision! This game is simple, but it is maybe the game where your decisions have the greatest impact on the development of the story. Therefore, not only “the novelist” is not “not a game” – it pushes the idea of controlling the story, not only its outcome, in a progressive direction. That this can’t be without flaws in the performance. But a game doesn’t have to be perfectly save, to be good. Any experiment has its mixed outcomes. And therefor, “The Novelist” should be played because of its great outcome AND because of its flaws.  "

												Uneventful and slow.The gameplay is extremely repetitive. This would be acceptable if the story could hold its own but the characters are bland and the consequences for the player's actions are unfulfilling.  It is essentially a soap-opera played by 3 one-dimensional characters in a single house. Every cliche ""issue"" that could be experience by a white, middle-class, suburban nuclear family is covered in the duration of the game. It falls down to the player to decide which member of the unlikable trio deserves some kind of help in their endeavours. Each character has something they want to do or want someone else to do. As the player, it is your duty to scour the house for glowy things to press space on and then read whatever clue it holds within. All the clues are a simple rewording of the same message; Dad wants to work on his book so he can provide for his family, Mum wants to be more independant, Kid wants to build a sandcastle or some other meaningless drivel. Once you've found all the clues you can make you decision and find out the consequences (The results of your hard work are usually more whining on the family's part) and do the same thing all over again, except with different glowy clues in different places. This process continues on and on, with little to no character development or indication of story progression, it's just more problems popping up like moles in a whack-a-mole.If you even manage to reach the end, it's highly unlikely that you'll want to go in for round two. In my advice: don't buy this.			"

												In this title the player is a ghost who walks around at a snails pace or possesses light fixtures to do nothing. You are haunting the cabin of the blandest family possible. There is hardly any characterization or interaction in this story driven game. Your objective is to fufill the desires of one single person either the writer, the mother or the child. Once there desire is fufilled, it is revealed that the lives of the other two family members will take a negative turn; though it doesn't really matter to the player because of how generic each character is. Everyone is devoid of any personality whatsoever. The writer just mopes around never really writing a book the whole time he just fiddles around with an outline that isn't even finished. The mother paints unimpressive scenery. The child only scribbles crayon drawings of his father with himself either to the left or to the right of his father.On the subject of interaction, there really is not any between the player and the world or for that fact the non playable characters and each other. Every character avoids everyone in the immediate area to the point that they have developed this anti social habit of leaving notes all over the cabin to communicate with eachother.Gameplay consists of reading enough notes so you can use your ghost powers to read a persons mind so you can find a physical object. Once you find that object you finish the quest by entering a characters bedroom at night and whispering boring suggestions into there ears to influence them into living life in a predetermined way.Graphics are horrible. They remind me of this unfinished free game called ""Facade"" which is a much better game in every regard to ""the novelist"" and pretty much is the exact same type of game. The only difference is that Facade actually lets you interact with everything in the area and not only is there consequences for the NPC's but for the player as well. Which makes it a fun replayable game unlike the novelist.Bottom line The Novelist is recommended for people who want to buy gifts for people they hate.Recommendations for people who want an actual game with a proper story and game play; ""To The Moon"" it's like a 16 bit RPG with puzzles instead of random turn based battles.

												A great little gem that demonstrates how choices don't have to be world-changing in order to be deep and thought provoking. This game almost perfectly blends fulfilling optimistic dreams with gut-punchingly negative repercussions. Although the gameplay itself got a touch repetitive and it's a bit short, The Novelist's down-to-earth story and decisions make up more than enough for it. I thought it was well worth the $3.74 I paid for it.			"

												Allow me to preface my review with this: I very much enjoyed the time I spent with The Novelist and I think that it signifies a good first step for Orthogonal Games as a developer. However, I cannot recommend the game at full price (at the time of this review said price point is 14.99 USD).     The environment takes on a simplistic and limited asthetic, confining the player to the workspace of a small two story house. Despite the house's intended purpose being to signify a new beginning for Dan and his family I couldn't help but feel that the house was in someway devoid of life. My first instinct was to blame the very ""samey"" colour pallet that The Novelist employs. However, the more I think on it the more I believe it has to do with the fact that the characters simply do not interact with the environment around them; save for very minor things such as Dan using his typewritter. The house is a stage, but the actors refuse to make use of the props.      The system of making choices is thankfully simple, however, so too are the choices themselves. Many of the choices felt as though they were not meaningful in the long run. There were a few occasions where the choices did not conflict with eachother or could easily be done in conjunction with eachother; which is counterintuitive to the very idea of only being able to make one choice and a halfhearted compromise with another. As a result of the simplicity many of the choices outcomes, and indeed the overarching story's outcome, were entirely too predictable. In fact, the bits of story that I found most interesting were the short moments spent discovering the history of the house.     The stealth mechanic gets in the way of the game's strongest asset: The story. However, there is not enough occuring during the segments of the game where the player is allowed to freely roam that keep the game interesting without it.      The story, and indeed the writing itself, are of a simplistic nature and are somewhat interesting. However, the characters themselves felt more like fassades for the player to toy with than fully fledged individuals. As a result the story, at times, feels rather dull. There are interesting directions that the game could have been taken that were simply ignored or declined.     Overall The Novleist culminated into an interesting and somewhat enjoyable experience. However, as stated above, I could not recommend it at full price. With a steep sale? Certainly.And as a personal aside: You absolutely do not have to be a parent to ""get"" this game. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from having a child of your own that you would not get otherwise. The greatest benefit I could see coming from having a child of your own would be a slightly stronger emotional connection with Dan. However, should you not be living a life blessed by comfort and ease at every turn, you should find it easy to make this same emotional connection if you do not have a child of your own. The most significant conflict in The Novelist is the act of balancing the many facets of a person's life, not the arbitrary ideals of what it is to be a parent.			"

												Moving in surprising ways, The Novelist is an excellent game for those who enjoy recent indie jams like To The Moon or Always Sometimes Monsters. At its very core, it is a game about choice that defies simplistic morality models (""tap the blue text to be GOOD, tap the red text to be EEEEVIL""). With apologies to excellent games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age, the decisions you are presented with in The Novelist cut against such black and white notions of the world. Each choice you are faced with is microcosmic. Each one lacks that ""save the world or watch it burn!"" weight that seems second nature to games. Not that this nature is bad. I only say this to bring attention to the fact that, while the decisions in The Novelist appear on the surface to be so small-scale, they feel incredibly impactful. This game is, on many levels, proof that the big, dramatic moral decisions in many choose-your-morality video games today are the EASY decisions.On another level, this is a game about..playing a game. Rather than take on the central characters as avatars, you float around in a demi-god mode, critically affecting their lives as you go. This distance between you and the characters is brave in and of itself because playing through that distanced demi-god mode makes you choose just how close to or estranged from these characters you wish to be.Mechanically, the game is sound and easy to control. The eccentricities of the challenge involved in ""stealth mode"" (where you must go undetected by the family) do not impede enjoyment of the game (it is always very fair). The voice acting is not amazing, but it is good. And the art style is pleasant to look at without obvious glitches or whatsthats that might pull you out of the game.			"

												Like most games it has its good points as well as bad points, and this is all opinion based. The story is rather simple, predictable, and sometimes does not make much sense; the graphics are pretty sterile too. I found some of the characters (mostly the wife so far) to be faulted to the point where I kinda wanted as a ghost to come down and slap them a bit. But, I found the idea of playing  helpful ghost very unique and interesting. And it shows a glimpse into some of the pressures a professional writer can have (the idea that yes i am home, no i can't devote the entirety of my time to you i do have to work). The game is very atmospheric with a slow almost sad tone to everything from the voices to the music. unfortunately for me because of that sad atmosphere I can't play much. If you suffer from depression I'd recommend caution with the game, but otherwise its refreshing and enjoyable.			"

Not As Pretentious As I Thought!Look, most art-games are non-games. I'm happy to report that this fits MY definition of a game. You can... no, you WILL make the wrong decisions. Constantly. And that is what makes this game so powerful. My favourite aspect of the gameplay was that the play can decide on how much to immerse themselves in the story, or the plight of certain characters. Apart from this, the game has a beautifully eery atmosphere in which you might feel spooked for a moment before you remember that you are the spectre in this game - threw me off a few times.This game is not for everyone, but I believe the situations depicted in the game make for a gripping experience for most people. Bare in mind that I went into this game with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Either way, no bugs, ran smoothly, easy to control and had simplistic controls. Don’t skip tutorial or tips; they only appear once.Long story short, I had fun with it, don’t expect too much of it, but give it a fair go if you are game.			"

												An absolute gem of a playable novel. You can tell that the creator has poured years of his love, frustration and inspiration into this work, and it pays off. The three voice actors are brilliant, and the scripts are so realistically well done. The emotional connection you inevitably - and suprisingly quickly - create with not only the main characters, but also tenants of the 'haunted' house from the long distant past, will leave you in tears or at least vocally voicing your joy or sorrow at each twist and turn of their fates that your ghostly character has helped to shape.I've almost exclusively played this game in Story Mode so far, and I would recommend to do so for maximum replayability and exploration of the different storylines you can travel down. For a thrill and more of a 'game' feel, Stealth Mode requires your ghost self to hide among the light fixtures and investigate the Kaplan family's dilemmas without being seen.			"

												This game, seemingly based somewhat on Woolf's novel 'To the Lighthouse,' was a marvelous experience. While it is heavily story based and has multiple endings, it DOES have gameplay, unlike some of the Indie walking simulators that you find. However, you'd have to be really silly to actually get punished for failing to do a good job with the gameplay, I feel. Still, it's enough to keep you actually playing the game while watching the story unravel according to your actions.The game highlights some of the same existencial issues that 'To the Lighthouse' does: it highlights family and relationship issues in day-to-day living, and the problems balancing work with the two. It also shows that the lives of all people invovled are transient and fleeting, and all that's left of us afterwards is our art: whether it be the books we write or the paintings we craft. The shared symbol of the lighthouse and some of the shared activities of both families gives them both the same ambiance, I felt. Regardless, definitely look into this one, as it leaves you something to learn and ponder about your own life.			"

												This is, at its core, the story of a family struggling to keep one another's priorities straight. ""Video game"" is not really the right word for it; I consider this more of an interactive short story. The gameplay is not part what shines here; it's the characters, the choices, and the consequences. The well written and engaging storyline is directly affected by your decisions from beginning to end. I love that this game forces you to make difficult choices that adults can relate to, without leaning on cheap tropes like many other games that attempt to do the same thing. The family is not fighting for their survival; for once, we have a game where everyday life is enough of a challenge.Overall I highly recommend this to anybody who appreciates games that really make you feel.

												This game for 15 dollars? No. I finished this game in 80 minutes. The story is so short and there isn't really any depth to the choices. I literally knew the consequences of each action and knew it wouldn't make any strony collateral damage in the ending. For example and this may be a spoiler: I gave no strong attention to the novelist and in the end he still got the letter that forces his family to move if I choose. The consequences draw up only to the end of each chapter, making the story feel stupid. The area is restricted to one tiny house with little objects. The game is very limited and a predictable story about marriage problems and work. Want a heartwarming story about family? Go talk to your parents or kids or the guy or girl you like.			"

												I think this game has a really interesting concept and think it would be entertaining... if you could figure out what you're supposed to be doing. You are a disembodied viewer (like a friendly ghost), seeking clues to help a family of three persons (the novelist husband, painting wife, and their son). You aren't meant to terrorize the family, and are supposed to stay ""out of sight,"" and can hide in light fixtures ""somewhat"" easily. If a family member sees you enough times... game over. Although I did find a few clues, and thought that was enough to progress the story, either the computer didn't acknowledge my work or else I didn't find near enough clues. I was almost always discovered because I keep searching and searching for clues while the family members walked about the home. The story seems to have quality. I was never sure what to do, though, as far as clue-hunting. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game in good conscience.			"

												I can dig it. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like unique ways of story-telling and don't mind if the gameplay suffers a bit because of it - though the story doesn't seem to be special by any means - then you might should give this a go. The User Reviews are Mostly Positive. I don't believe I've ever seen a game with 5+ reviews rated as either strictly Positive or Negative; thus, The Novelist is... just above average, as it were. I agree with that assessment. That second sentence seems to contradict itself, but I find the game as a whole to be sum-how greater than it's parts (teehee). The story is one of a family on the verge. From the game's tutorial, it seems the father is the priority. You are some sort of entity; it is implied at the end of the first night that  you are, basically, a ghost haunting the house. Your purpose is to play implicit life-coach for the residents. The father is a struggling author what wanted to get away from it all and make things simple so as to better concentrate on his work. The mother is a fretful wife who makes better use of the solitude of the rented vacation home by painting, all the while yearning to bridge the rift that's formed between her and her partner. The child is a son wondering about this thing called ""life,"" wanting to be a kid, to spend time with Dad, to be just like Mom.You do not wish to let the family know of your presence. You can possess light fixtures to move about the house and can walk freely when the coast is clear. There are notes, letters and images to read and view strewn throughout the house. From these - and from the thoughts of the people themselves' - you can gain insight into their relationships and into their pertinent desires. If they are between you and one of the papers, you can cause the light fixture you're currently possessing to flicker, so as to distract. If they catch a glimpse of you, they apparently become wary (to say the least) and are less susceptible to your methods.There are two difficulties to choose from: Stealth and Story. The former necessitates the use of traveling from light fixture to fixture, the latter renders the game a walking simulator. Having picked Stealth, I have been in plain view, albeit a bit to the side, of the people and (as far as I can tell) not been detected. Maybe their cones of vision are something like... 37°. This is to call into question the integrity of The Novelist as a game.After having learned as much as there is to presently, you can go into each individual's memories and glean a bit more from a few snippets. Upon exiting their mind, you can read their thoughts once more and discover what their wish (end-goal for the chapter) is, what item you must collect for it. If you find all of the notes and memories of either or both of the other two - once you make your primary decision -- once everybody goes to bed --- you can, both, scour the house for notes that reveal the history of the house (and of you) and find the item for a secondary objective; you whisper your decisions into the man's ear and get a cutscene explaining the consequences of that compromise. There will always be at least one family member that doesn't get what they want/("")need(""). This is a game about the balancing of relationships, of choices, of stealth... and of being creepy.I have spent minutes just staring at people sleeping and hanging out in bathrooms... just waiting...Ha. And again. ha.Seriously: If any of that sounds interesting - and I don't know how it can't, at least in theory - I recommend you at least try the game. I will say that some will NOT find the product to be executed as well as the premise suggests, when considering that it's a video game; either find the gameplay to be lacking, or the story (which is the focus) to be too mundane.Indeed, the one YouTube personality I follow - Jim Sterling - holds the opinion that, too often, walking simulators commit the crime of telling rather than showing; of having the game focus on, i.e., the aftermath of a much more interesting event than the one you, as the player, are involved in, i.e. learning of the event afterwards. Though this specific critique couldn't be laid on this game, I feel the core complaint is the very essence of The Novelist. Though you influence the outcomes, you are not directly involved in the story at all, and are thus a glorified camera-person.EDIT: Practically, $15 is far too substantial an asking price. Not to suggest that the work put into the game isn't worth that, but it is to say that, as a gamer, I can tell my fellows that there are more competitive titles in the Market, though I will concede that many of those have even less traditional gameplay (i.e. mechanics that make them more'n walking simulators / visual novels (not that there's anything inherently wrong with either, but to say that there's a difference between story-driven games and games built to tell a story... yeah, so the latter might be written as ""("")games("")""))... I'd wait for at least a 25% off sale.			"

												I'll start by saying that I don't have children and don't have contact with my family.  Not in a bad way, I'm just a deeply selfish person.  My wife and I would rather soend our money on holidays, games and cats than anything serious like bringing up a child.  What's the point of this surprisingly personal and seemingly irrelevant disclosure?  Well, despite my shortcomings as an adult human, I loved The Novelist.The Novelist is a game that will mean something different to every person who plays it, depending on their point of view.  The way the game plays is that a small family have rented a house for the summer - the father sees it as an opportunity to work on his book, the wife sees it as a chance to rebuild their failing relationship and it is supposed to be a chance to address the problem the son has at school.  You play as a spirit that haunts the house and it is up to you to influence the father at the end of each day as to how to handle an event (or events) that will affect the family.  You do this by gathering information on each person's take on the event and coming to a conclusion as to how best to handle it.  Find every piece of information, and you will be allowed a compromise at the end of the day, meaning that one person will come away happy with the result, one placated and one potentially unhappy.This is all simply done, and can be played as either a casual point and click style game of (admittedly limited) exploration, or as an stealth-lite game that has you trying to avoid the family seeing you, and thus becoming spooked and denying you the ability to come to a compromise with them.  Playing this way is actually quite engaging and adds a light air of tension added to by the lack of saves during the day, meaning you have to live with your decisions and mistakes.Although I found myself drawn to the characters, it wasn't necessarily through their actual interactions.  If anything, that would be the weakest part of the game.  The characters' personalities are all explored very well through diaries and journals, but doesn't come across in the world of the game.  It can be argued that it adds to the otherworldly feel to the game, but I think a lot would be added by the characters showing more... well... character.Anyway returning to my opening paragraph - I felt when I started the game that I would absolutely be on the father's side.  The game is called The Novelist, he is earning the money in the family and the house was rented to allow him to work on his book.  So, fine.  Cut and dried, let's get this book printed!  Well, no.  Reading the wife's personal thoughts and fears about how close to divorce they are without him realising was actually quite scary.OK.  Let's focus on the relationship and put the book on the sidelines, the kid will be fine.  The outcome of my first decision showed that the child was disappointed and I could live with that.  What I couldn't live with, was seeing him devastated at the next outcome screen.  So, well done, game!  I felt bad and went about actually making decisions for the good of the family as a whole.As I played, it actually took me back to a holiday where my own father had to take time to study through it, something I haven't thought about in years, and realised that the developer absolutely nailed the scenario.  I actually found myself sympathetic towards each member in the family.  I wasn't working towards some winning gamestate at the end, but toward a scenario that would make everything OK for them all.  I was drawn in completely.I obviously had a deeply personal connection to the game, so would it stand up without that?  I don't see why not.  It is short enough that it can even make a nice talking point if you play with another person as well.  On the whole, it is easy to recommend this game - I won't deny that you need you need a degree of empathy and maturity to fully apreciate it, but that's no bad thing.			"

												This game has some flaws. Maybe, the gameplay is a bit redundant and overall repetitive. The graphics are rather simple (not ugly, simple!) and there is a low density of details. True.On the other side there is a game that is pretty heart shacking and intellectual challenging. The game is basic, but that has its meaning because it focuses you on the story, the characters, the development and, most of all, your decision! This game is simple, but it is maybe the game where your decisions have the greatest impact on the development of the story. Therefore, not only “the novelist” is not “not a game” – it pushes the idea of controlling the story, not only its outcome, in a progressive direction. That this can’t be without flaws in the performance. But a game doesn’t have to be perfectly save, to be good. Any experiment has its mixed outcomes. And therefor, “The Novelist” should be played because of its great outcome AND because of its flaws.  "

												An original work of art.It's not exactly a game, but a beautiful and meaningful personal experience. I hope each time more games like this are developed with cutting-edge bravery, because it's already been a lot of time since games were only a kind of useless kid's stuff.Congratulations Mr. Kent Hudson,  I take my hat off to your work :)			"

												An interactive story that's written quite well, and has a variety of hard choices to make. The environment is bland, the characters aren't the most original, the gameplay is pretty much non-existent, and it's very short. Still, I found the game very engagingand I recommend it, just not at full price.			"

												This is a ridiculous story line. Picking the outcome at the end of each chapter, which then makes the other two people ""dissapointed"". Let me lay it down. There is three characters known besides yourself, a ghost or something. The characters known are:                   - The Father = Some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥writing another bad book and has writers block.                  - The Mother = Another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that wants to quit her job and become a full time painting artist.          And - The Son = A kid stuck between a struggling marriage and was just moved from his old house. I think he had a friend back in the old town he misses or maybe his Bro died, because he has a few crayon drawings of him and another kid.           AAAAAAAAAAAAANnnnnyyy Way. You go through and pick the outcomes of who gets what they want at the end of each chapter. Well damn..... you have two grown adults that can't grasp reality and wanting what they want, and willing to totally neglect the kid for theirs. SO! The only logical choice at the end of each chapter is the kids happiness over the mom and dad's. If the parents would have some sort of common sense they wouldn't be worried about themselves and do whatever it takes to take care of the kid. Yeah didn't play the entire game so there could be some sort of better story going on. But I can't sit through and make the kid unhappy for two childish seeming adults. Thanks to anyone that read, goodnight.			"

												When I first heard about a game, where you play as a writer trying to balance concerns for his family against the demands of his deadlines I was intrigued, but not quite enough for the price tag. I'm glad I waited for a sale, because I find the game very mediocre. The most serious problem is that the very simplistic gameplay elementels don't suit the narrative structure that is the game's main selling point. Basically it a single level repetitive 1st person stealth game. You are a ghost that must remain unseen, explore the house in which the Kaplan family of three lives, read their thoughts and letters. Then brain wash the titular novelist in his sleep so that he will make the decision you find most appropriate. If that hasn't deterred you from trying out the game I'd advise you to wait for a sale to grab it. It's can be completed in 1½-2 hours or much less you disable stealth and don't explore each chapter. It can be longer if you wish to replay it. But I don't find it interesting enough for a replay. There are better story driven games out there, stronger in both narrative, emotional depth and gameplay, even all at once, whereas this game is pretty lackluster in all these aspects.			"

Essentially this is a game where you're constantly balancing happiness levels between Human A, human B, and human C. The problem is you can only please two people each round, so you have to take it in turns to see who gets left out. In the end this game just gives you the illusion of free will.

												The Novelist is an interesting take on the interactive novel genre. You play a ghostly presence that lives in a summer getaway house, inhabited by a struggling novelist, his wife and young son. Gameplay is minimal, limited to spooking around the a house by possessing lightbulbs, taking care not to be seen by the family.

												If I were to compare it to other games, the Novelist would be in the same vein as Dear Esther, Stanley Parable, and Proteus.  Technically they're games, but not ones that most gamers are familiar with.  The draw of the Novelist is more in the story and presentation than in the game mechanic.  There is the stealth aspect to the game, which increases the difficulty for collecting clues that are essential for influencing the ending, but it can be turned off by those who don't want to deal with it, thus why this game is considered casual.  Toggling this option is available at anytime in the settings and having it off or on does not have any impact on the ending.  Also there are no achievements in the game so completing the game only in stealth is only a personal reward.  The only reason for playing with stealth mode is to increase the difficulty of the game for those looking for a challenge as being spotted at anytime will limit choices that alter the ending.  Unfortunately, the small, unchanging environment will probably not interest players for long as it will begin to feel reptitive after a few scenes.  I personally turned it off after a while.In other words, play Novelist not for the game mechanic but for the story it presents.  How well rated the story is depends on how much gamers resonate with the Kaplan family.			"

												The designer for this game left his job working with huge teams to make an entire game by himself, and it shows. I'm glad I bought the game because I have hope that the money he's made with this game will lead to something worth playing in the future, but this ain't it.The script gives the illusion of choice, but you're following a narrow path with gameplay that is little more than hide and seek. I bought the game hoping for a compelling storyline, but it rarely reached beyond evenly distributing attention into three buckets, with a unsatisfyingly easy end.The whole game is half an hour long with no reply value. Buy the game, download it for an afternoon, then save the room on your computer content that you just donated money to a good cause.			"

												Love action-packed adventures with an expansive statistics system? Well this is not that. This is a very different type of game.

This game is a very good example of games with a more mature, serious plot, which I've not seen very much at all.But I do think the pricing is a bit too steep. I'd have rather payed $10 for it and have had no complaint whatsoever. It's a short game but the replay value is there.			"

												A great balancing act between one's dreams and obligations. True to life, the conflicts that arise between a man and his family cause a sense of gravity and depth for every decision and, more importantly, omission.I personally recommend playing in Story mode before trying ""stealth"" mode. That way you can soak yourself in the narrative and not worry about being stealthy. Highly recommended for people who are drawn to narrative driven games like Stanley Parable, Gone Home, The Walking Dead and Dear Esther.			"

												I voted for this game to be Greenlit and was happy to see that it has mostly lived up to the potential it showed then. You play some sort of ghost or spirit that inhabits a house which a writer named Dan and his wife and son rent for the summer so that Dan can focus on working on his next book.  The game is divided into several chapters as the spirit you have to move throughout the house reading letters, reading the family members thoughts and exploring their memories to find out the desires of each family member. You do all this while trying to remain undetected (though if you want to focus on the story you can turn the requirement for stealth off). When you've uncovered each family members desire you have to pick one and whisper it to Dan so it is acted upon. The family member who's desire you picked will be happy but the other two will not. At the end of the chapter after you've made your choice you get to see the outcomes on each character and it is quite difficult to see the negative outcomes as you do end up feeling sorry for them. It's a pity the game doesn't have more solutions that would satisfy more than one character so your decision can become an agonizing choice.The real strength of this game is the story it weaves about the family. You get to know each character and how they feel through their memories and the letters you read and while the story this game tells about them is the typical trials and tribulations of a family, it's done so well that you do end up caring about them and that makes the choices you make that bit more agonizing. The only downside of this game is that the exploration side where you move about the house trying to find letters and look through the families memories gets boring after a short while as it gets repetitive doing more less the same thing in every chapter. Overall though this is a great story based games that will please people who enjoyed games like Gone Home and Dear Esther. It's a 7/10 from me.			"

												Another interesting indie game.It is short -- about 1 1/2 hours per playthrough, but it lends itself to multiple playthroughs. The game is about choice -- when there are three characters with three different goals (a husband with his career, a wife and her career, and a son with difficulties in school), what is the right choice to make? Often the answer is complex, and there is no right answer. Give up to much for your family, and you might end up resenting your family. I recommend, if you are into the indie/story based plots, or interested in how choice can be done in video games. Compare the choices/outcomes in this game with Fallout, Mass Effect, and Walking Dead.			"

												This game, seemingly based somewhat on Woolf's novel 'To the Lighthouse,' was a marvelous experience. While it is heavily story based and has multiple endings, it DOES have gameplay, unlike some of the Indie walking simulators that you find. However, you'd have to be really silly to actually get punished for failing to do a good job with the gameplay, I feel. Still, it's enough to keep you actually playing the game while watching the story unravel according to your actions.The game highlights some of the same existencial issues that 'To the Lighthouse' does: it highlights family and relationship issues in day-to-day living, and the problems balancing work with the two. It also shows that the lives of all people invovled are transient and fleeting, and all that's left of us afterwards is our art: whether it be the books we write or the paintings we craft. The shared symbol of the lighthouse and some of the shared activities of both families gives them both the same ambiance, I felt. Regardless, definitely look into this one, as it leaves you something to learn and ponder about your own life.			"

												It's quite more then a game, it's a immersive reflexive experience where you play as a 'something' (maybe a ghost) that analisis every events, thoughts and memories of each one of the three characters of a tradicional family and take the decisions for the father of the family. You can choose between take care more of your son's progress in school and life or incentivate your wife emotions, turning her hobby in a carreer or you can choose dedicate to your own book writting spending some selfish time for your personal growning. Every and each decision you whisper at the father of the family   affects the whole family during the progress of the game so then you have to be carefull in what sacrifice take in behalf of what character to accomplish the happiness of everybody.The fact of the game presenting multiple endings (and so much) it's really impressive because it take in consideration every decision taken since the game starts and make me question: is there a bad ending or it just the way people find happiness that is different one of other?The interesting thing you can notice is if you are not a father/mother and husband/wife you can have a notion of where you would be going if you were one and if you actually already are you will notice where you are going choosing your priorities or not instead or your family.It's a deep, reflexive, philosophical, short, ""non-replayable"", conscientizing, real game that primary focus on our nowadays decisions as a family integrant.How not to recomend?

That raises the question, who exactly do you play as? You may never know. Are you a ghost that helps this family specifically? Or anyone who lives in the house? Are you even real? There is a long string of questions that could have added more to the story had they been answered, but instead the mystery remains.7/10			"

												Like most games it has its good points as well as bad points, and this is all opinion based. The story is rather simple, predictable, and sometimes does not make much sense; the graphics are pretty sterile too. I found some of the characters (mostly the wife so far) to be faulted to the point where I kinda wanted as a ghost to come down and slap them a bit. But, I found the idea of playing  helpful ghost very unique and interesting. And it shows a glimpse into some of the pressures a professional writer can have (the idea that yes i am home, no i can't devote the entirety of my time to you i do have to work). The game is very atmospheric with a slow almost sad tone to everything from the voices to the music. unfortunately for me because of that sad atmosphere I can't play much. If you suffer from depression I'd recommend caution with the game, but otherwise its refreshing and enjoyable.			"

												Overall, this felt just far too contrived for me to ever really connect to. A huge part of it is that it's tough to link to the sympathy of the character difficulties because its all based on what is, ultimately, feeling like some sort of rich/upper-class background where the choices center around one character a professional writer, one character wanting to be a professional artist, and the needs of their kid. The choices that have to get made at that point just start to feel ridiculous. Each week there's multiple days off, they're traveling to have a summer 'off' working, and so to be in that situation and still not being able to manage compromises like ""read to the kid and work"" just feels ridiculously absurd to me.Beyond that, the whole game just gets repetitive. Each time is walk around, find all the clues, making a fairly arbitrary choice, and then repeating the whole thing another dozen times. It wouldn't be so bad if that changed up location each time, but for being in that location the whole time, the limited scope and repetitive motions got tiresome. The controls for getting around also were pretty frustrating, as there's an interesting attempt at using lights as a way to jump from place to place in the house, but it really didn't work well and often got in the way. It really could have benefited from better control design, so that space wasn't required for everything, and sometimes even to carry out different actions on the same things.The lasting disappointment for me is that there was an indication that there's an underlying backstory to the game that was never resolved, and hinted at something interesting. Instead, the game ended with a ""where are they now"" type ending that felt far too overblown, and stems from that same mindset going into the character backgrounds, that they can't just be moderately successful, but that it had to be to some grandiose extent. It just comes across as overdone, and not exploring something that could've had a lot more potential.Really couldn't recommend it, it drags along without packing much punch.			"

												Its a ok game to pass some time.  But not verry fun,groundbreaking or mindwakening in anny way(at least for me).You take mundane but important choises for a family father,,like real life decisions.  You have to prioritize;- yourself/the novell or- Your wife(that is a mix of mather for here own painting carer ,yourself and the kid)- Your kid/school and reading problems12 chapters each ending in a choise(and if youre not seen) and a compromise(extra choise with less focus on it)And it all effects the other issues in the game as well, your wifes job, kid and mariage problems ect.Not being able to sleep and intruiged by the idea. I bought this game and found it somewhat entertaining and like i had a impact.. though a somewhat boring story i still wondered at the outcome.I played trough it once, taking my time exploring the story. I probably wont play it ower ,, but i asume there are a number of twists on the story. "

												A game that gets to the heart of what it means to be a good person.  It's a question I've wrestled with my entire life.  There is a line-- somewhere, for everyone-- that has to be drawn.  When do you stop helping other people and start helping yourself?  You can always be helping other people.  You could be doing it right now, but you're not.  You're reading this.  To find a game that forces you to make those decisions is both welcoming and painful.  I played it straight through, and I won't tell you the ending I received, but it's probably obvious.  I would imagine that Jesus had to take time for himself.  I would imagine Jesus wanted to escape from everything and be alone his entire life because it decreases the obligation and the guilt that goes along with not helping others.  But he kept helping.  And died for it.  I guess there's a quiet beauty in that.			"

Not As Pretentious As I Thought!Look, most art-games are non-games. I'm happy to report that this fits MY definition of a game. You can... no, you WILL make the wrong decisions. Constantly. And that is what makes this game so powerful. My favourite aspect of the gameplay was that the play can decide on how much to immerse themselves in the story, or the plight of certain characters. Apart from this, the game has a beautifully eery atmosphere in which you might feel spooked for a moment before you remember that you are the spectre in this game - threw me off a few times.This game is not for everyone, but I believe the situations depicted in the game make for a gripping experience for most people. Bare in mind that I went into this game with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Either way, no bugs, ran smoothly, easy to control and had simplistic controls. Don’t skip tutorial or tips; they only appear once.Long story short, I had fun with it, don’t expect too much of it, but give it a fair go if you are game.			"

												Yes it is slow and very indie. But you love that otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. The novolost uses a rather cool mechanic where you go around a house collecting memories and information from letters or drawings. After that you can make a decission what will happen to the 3 inhabitants. A man who is writing a book (you can help him achieve that), his wife who to be happy demands time from him (which you can choose) OR there kid who wants attention from his dad aswel. If you play it write you can choose helping two persons. I really felt sorry for the person who i didn't pick every time and the fact that you can get a different outcome with every chapter makes it nicely replayable. Is it worth the 15 bucks? I don't think so. Should you get it for half or less in a sale. Yes you should. exploring the story on you own is just really nice just like it was with Gone Home. Just get gaming!			"

												Oh boy i wish i could like the game, but the lazy writing ruined the great style of the game. First of iam a really really big fan of cel shading, love it. Then the gameplay, instead of the overpriced walking simulator you have actual stuff to do. You walk through the house searching for clues to figure out the ""dilemmas"" of the family. Then you are able to read the thought of a person he has right in this moment and when you press Space you enter the person's mind and have to search for 3 memories he has. The game is split in 3 parts, which consists of 3 parts on their own. The game even started nicely, he has a writing block, the boy got bullied in school and she, well makes everyone problems to hers. The choices in the beginning made sens and were connected together, so it was logical that choosing one, made the other not possible. But later into the game the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Not only you are annoyed of the whiny attitude of the man, no the choices were more and more on their own and choosing one didnt make the other impossible. But the developer found it okay, that choosing to help the boy, made it impossible for the woman to wear a sweater, who just lies on the very bed she is sitting on. And if that is not enough, she seriously gets upset because she ""couldn't"" wear the sweater and of course her mother calls, she ""hears"" that her daughter is upset, but well her mother is cheap and didnt want to talk about.......she not able to wear a ♥♥♥♥ING SWEATER.

												In The Novelist, you play a meddling ghost that seemingly cares about the family renting your summer home, but actually doesn't give a darn what they want, leaving you to invade their minds and choose their life paths for them.Skulking around from room to room, you discover clues to what Dan (a struggling author), Linda (an once and possibly future painter), and Tommy (lonely child) want to do that week. You then can choose whose desire is most important and go that route. Afterward, still images show the fallout of your 'wisdom.'At nighttime, you can seek clues granting additional insight to the house and your role, and you can creepily hover over the sleeping family and listen to their dream thoughts.This game offers two modes, but I don't know what the developer was thinking. This isn't Splinter Cell -- skip the stealth mode, and focus on the story. After all, what's the fun in ruining-- I mean, guiding lives if your ghostly powers can be stripped from you by being spotted?-----Time to put on my serious pants. I think the premise of The Novelist is brilliant, and there are some powerful moments, but the choices often ring artificial. There were a handful of times that all three members could have compromised, but -- as per the game's rules -- only two of three could be chosen. Also, there were moments where it seemed like there would be positive gains for one or more family members, only for negative ramifications to be thrown in your face because the game's writer didn't think things through.Finally, the endings -- especially Tommy's -- seemed at odds with his own personality, let alone some of the story paths.And that whole stealth mode nonsense...Basically, The Novelist is interesting and worth a playthrough, but I can't really call it good. Nonetheless, I'd at least recommend it if you can nab it for a deep discount. On September 8, 2015, it was $2.24 and I think adventure and narrative fans would absolutely get their money's worth.

												I normally like exploration games because they're forced to tell a good story and the main mechanic is empathy. The Novelist, though, managed to annoy and make me wish for at least one of the characters to slip into a coma so they'd stop complaining so much. It's basically a story about three selfish people who live together and refuse to comunicate their needs or desires to each other so they just go around being passive agressive. You come in as Casper the friendly ghost who solves all their problems and yet they still act like spoilt brats and pout all day. In the end there's no real sense of completion since you know they'll just basically go back home and make each other miserable again. If playing God is what you're into, go get yourself a copy of the Sims. At least it'll let you remove the pool ladder once in a while.			"

												The Novelist is deceptive in its title. While the story is indeed primarily about a novel writer, the writer isn't who you think it actually is. The touching aspects of this story allow you to really question your values in relation to family, career and love, balancing all between. The Novelist pushes you to examine your values and decide what you might do when life tugs on you in all those horribly different directions. What is more important, that your son gets the help and love he needs and deserves, or your career that your family might live a comfortable life?I generally hate it when games make me cry, but good tears were made and for that I think the creator of The Novelist deeply. I've never had an experience like this before.			"

Observing the family life and influencing them is fun and with some tough decisions, though they're pretty robotic and bland outside of the notes and cutscenes.+ Some of the writing is really quite interesting and pulls you in, other times the stakes seem a bit melodramtic.  Rather than sympathize for any one character, I find myself asking why the husband even got married and had a child considering his obsession for writing only.  - The backstory of the house and the entity occupying it started off interesting, but then became bland and irrelevant.- The wife's voice acting was rigid and bored sounding.

												A man takes his wife & young son to a secluded vacation home so that he can focus on writing his next great novel; little do they know that the house is also home to an unknown supernatural force that can worm its way into the father's mind. No, it's not The Shining, it's The Novelist. In it you play a spirit (or something?? it's not actually specified) haunting a house on a cliff. Your goal is to influence the choices of the father/husband character, Dan, by learning as much as you can about him & his family through written & drawn clues scattered around the house as well as by entering each character's memories. Each chapter presents a situation to which there are three solutions: one that most benefits the dad, one the mom, & one the kid. You can also make a secondary ""compromise"" choice that will at least partially satisfy one of the other characters if not totally please them.If ""Stealth"" mode is enabled you have the potential of being spotted by the family while you gather clues during the day, which causes you to lose certain opportunities. You can become invisible & move from one place to the next without being seen by possessing the home's light fixtures, but you can't gather clues when you're in a lamp, so you also have the ability to make a light flicker to distract the family away from where you want to go. There is an alternate ""Story"" mode where you are invisible no matter where you are. In both modes there are some situations where characters will close doors on you (usually if they're mad about being neglected); you can't open or pass through the doors but the family usually opens them again soon enough. There's a subplot that involves gathering clues about the house's past, but that is not mutable based on the player's choices so it feels more like filler material.The gameplay is fairly straightforward, if a little tedious at times. Think ""Gone Home"" in a scaled-down form. The graphics are quite lovely, especially the vistas visible through the windows. Several people have singled out the voice acting as exceptional but I didn't find anything remarkable about it. The plot is... okay. I didn't care much for any of the characters, but I still wanted to make good choices for them. There are multiple happy endings & sad endings possible, although not very many, & none too exciting (certainly nothing close to The Shining in that respect!).Overall though this was a nice game to spend a bit of time on; it's pretty relaxing & there's definitely not anything high stress about it. I enjoyed playing through making choices ""organically"" the first time & then running through it quicker in subsequent replays to get different outcomes. I would definitely recommend doing ""Stealth"" mode for your first playthrough to get the most out of the experience; enable ""Story"" for replays so you can move from choice to choice & clue to clue much quicker & don't have to deal with spending time on repeated material. It goes quickly enough when you do that.Even though it would seem there's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, spending time in this game's world really is soothing, & having different options & routes to take is fun. I like that it's an indie game too. I am happy with my purchase -- but, after all, I bought it on sale, which I would recommend.			"

												Relaxing but engaging game with a pretty neat choose your own adventure type feel to it.  Read a few other reviews before writing this so there's a few things I would like to point out as a pseudo-response.  I played this on the ""stealth"" required mode, which was not difficult nor tedious; you get a feel for it rather quickly and it adds an element of suspense to your actions throughout the game.  I imagine that it could be rather slow and repetetive for those playing on the ""story"" only mode.  The story overall was pretty neat, you get some insights into the history of the house you are in, the Kaplan's wants and needs (from each individual's perspective and that of their family members), and maybe even backstory on the entity you play as.

												An inteligent game (experience?) in which you attempt to influence and balance the aspirations and emotions of Dan (Husband and writer), Linda (Wife and artist), Tommy (Son) while they have a summer retreat to try to help Dan write his latest book. You can choose to support one character in each chapter (level?) of the game, and then if you havn't been spotted you have the chance of picking one of two possible compromises.The balancing act of trying to keep everyone happy allthewhile trying to get Dan's book finished is a tough one indeed.There are two game modes (difficulties), one which I refer to as stalker mode, which is the tougher mode, in which you have to avoid being spotted. Or story mode, in which you can just concentrate on the story side of things.If you enjoy the likes of inteligent games/experiences such as Dear Esther and Ether One, then The Novelist will be right up your alley. But if you are looking for non-stop action and shooting suff (Eagle, flag, explosions, ""'Merica"") then you would be better looking elsewhere.			"

												This game, seemingly based somewhat on Woolf's novel 'To the Lighthouse,' was a marvelous experience. While it is heavily story based and has multiple endings, it DOES have gameplay, unlike some of the Indie walking simulators that you find. However, you'd have to be really silly to actually get punished for failing to do a good job with the gameplay, I feel. Still, it's enough to keep you actually playing the game while watching the story unravel according to your actions.The game highlights some of the same existencial issues that 'To the Lighthouse' does: it highlights family and relationship issues in day-to-day living, and the problems balancing work with the two. It also shows that the lives of all people invovled are transient and fleeting, and all that's left of us afterwards is our art: whether it be the books we write or the paintings we craft. The shared symbol of the lighthouse and some of the shared activities of both families gives them both the same ambiance, I felt. Regardless, definitely look into this one, as it leaves you something to learn and ponder about your own life.			"

												The Novelist is deceptive in its title. While the story is indeed primarily about a novel writer, the writer isn't who you think it actually is. The touching aspects of this story allow you to really question your values in relation to family, career and love, balancing all between. The Novelist pushes you to examine your values and decide what you might do when life tugs on you in all those horribly different directions. What is more important, that your son gets the help and love he needs and deserves, or your career that your family might live a comfortable life?I generally hate it when games make me cry, but good tears were made and for that I think the creator of The Novelist deeply. I've never had an experience like this before.			"

												I really loved this game. Played through with story mode just to get an idea of what I'd be getting myself into and could definitely see myself playing this again with stealth mode to see the challenge. I found it to be quite sweet in the way the story(ies) was told depending on your choices and made you consider priorities (work, family, life) to get the right 'balance'. It falls more into the category of artistic/storytelling games but the game mechanics were decent and allowed enough exploration and player interaction to feel like a 'game'. I have no idea how varied the outcomes were, but it is that question that makes you want to start over from the beginning (and get your money worth).			"

												I just completed this game after a short 95 minute run. I would only buy this game if you want to play over and over for a different outcome. It was a waste of money if you play this only once. I went in thinking it would be just another choice after choice and nothing happens, but this game will send chills down your spine with the soundtrack and the facts. It may seem like a fictional ghost story but this game is more than real. 7/10. Doing another run for sure.			"

												Not a huge fan of the relatively static cycle of the game. The plot grew interesting only once in a while and I found that the gameplay hindered my experience by desyncing me from the narrative flow, really lengthening the amount of time in between the story bits which drove me to enjoy the game.

												The Novelist is a game that falls into that bucket of games that aren't exactly interactive experiences like Dear Esther, but still not nearly as involved gameplay wise as the majority of mainstream FPS games.  The title sees you patrolling the Summer home of a frustrated author and his single unit family as some sort of ""presence"" or ""ghost"".  There are two distinct game ""difficulties"", in the first you can patrol the house on foot (I assume its on foot, the player's avatar is still a bit of a mystery reserved for hints found in the notes scattered through the levels) without the NPC's noticing you.  The second takes on a more stealth-based approach, requiring you to hide from the family as you peruse through their thoughts and belongings.  Basic gameplay involves you searching through the house and possessing the thoughts of the family to determine what the hopes, needs and feelings are of each family member.  You can navigate through traditional walking or via possession of light fixtures.  After you discover enough information to continue, you can either stick around to get the rest of the missing information, or make a decision on how to influence the father's thoughts.  After a you commit to your choices, the house switches to night, where you can discover notes relating the experiences of past denizens of the house and finally pass your decisions on to the father.  The story threads hinge very much on which characters you choose to make happy at the end of each day, and the choices directly effect the NPC's moods and relationships with each other as the Summer progresses.  You can go the route of making everyone as happy as possible, or focus only on the needs of a single family member depending on your decisions.  The house looks pretty and has just enough detail in it for you to have to search for clues during the day without getting lost in the clutter.  For a game that depends a lot on moods, the characters have somewhat blank painted-like faces, a smart decision on their part as now the characters con convey their mood via body language instead of heavily involved face posing.  As someone entering the working world trying to balance time between family, career, and hobbies, the game really clicked with me conceptually, and though its very subtle in its pace and approach to gameplay, I still found myself enjoying it for the duration of a Saturday afternoon.  Length (~3 hours) may be a consideration for some, so waiting for a discount might make it more of a bang for your buck.			"

												A while back, I received this game among a bunch of others in a Humble Bundle. Since this isn't typically the genre of game that I play, I added it to my library and promptly forgot about it. Just a few days ago, upon noticing the game in my library, I installed it with the intent of farming some steam trading cards and deleting it afterwards.Allow me to say that I am *SO* glad that curriosity got the better of me and I decided to give the game a try. In complete honesty, I can say that I don't think I've ever become so emotionally invested in a game's fictional family as I did with the Kaplans.This being said, I would recommend that anyone playing this game should play it in Story mode as opposed to Stealth mode. The stealth mechanic can get a bit annoying and clunky, while also making the Kaplans' stories that much less immersive than you building/observing their lives free-rein. This puts a greatter emphasis on the game's ""Story-Rich"" tag, and less on the ""Stealth"" tag, which in turn--I believe--plays to its strengths.			"

												This game promised a narrative-focused, decision-making stealth game. And that's exactly what it was.I've only played it once, but I always got the sense that things would turn out differently if I made different choices for the family, and more importantly, that things would go very bad if I made the wrong choices.If I would critique anything, it would be that the characters seemed a bit bland and overly sensitive to what are ostensibly first-world-problems.That, and the detective-work mechanics were a bit too easy. They got the point across, but in similar games like Gone Home, you really feel like you're digging through other people's business and feel a bit apprehensive about what you mind find. All those things in consideration, I enjoyed flitting around the house as a ghost and debating which family member to help when. If I were an indie developer, I'd be proud to have made something this tight on the first try.			"

												The Novelist is a touching and thoughful narrative game, which despite its simplistic mechanics and presentation manages to pose some genuinely challenging moral questions to the player. The game lacks some polish, with many aspects feeling rather clunky, and the gameplay is very much secondary to the narrative (to the point that the main gameplay mechanic - avoiding being spotted by the family - can actually be switched off so you can relax and enjoy the narrative), but the honesty of the game more than makes up for this.I would recommend this game for anyone looking for an unusually genuine and heartful narrative experience (think The Beginners Guide, Gone Home etc.), and who is willing to see past its rough edges to get the most from the experience.

A touching little game with choices that actually matter ""The Novelist"" is one of the few games that keep their promise of offering several choices with an actual impact on the story's outcome. It also is one of the few games that leave you with a strange feeling in your stomach. Through the protagonist's actions and mistakes you can learn a lot about your own character, your life goals, what you are doing with the time you've got on this planet and how you treat the people you love.I really like games that actually encourage you to start thinking in a deeper way. That's why I'll definitely recommend it to anyone who is open to questions like this.In ""The Novelist"" you are going to face daily problems almost ever young family encounters nowadays, thankfully without any kitsch, unrealistic ""happy ends"" or over-the top dramatic situations. All the characters are understandable, there is no villain or bad seed. And you will never be able to please everybody with your decisions. Just like in real life. That's what makes this game so special.The gameplay itself isn't much of a challenge - there is a ""stealth""-mode, but not getting spotted isn't actually hard. So don't expect a hardcore game full of adrenaline and high speed. The graphics are in a ""Firewatch""-like style, simple, but pleasant to the eye. Same goes for the music.But beware: you should be ready to read a lot, otherwise you'll get bored very soon. As a quick reader, my first game took approximately 2-3 hours, but seeing all the different endings and reactions requires several playthroughs. And if that's not enough for you, you can always buy it at a discount.			"

												The Novelist is one of the greastest game storytelling games out there. You won't find another diamond like this one.Pros: 1) The story and theme are crafted to perfection. Everything makes logical sense. The characters are simple to understand and grasp. You're intrigued at every time whether it's by curiousity, suspense, hard choices, and/or personal reactions to the result. There are backstories that don't affect the main one which increase morals taught and entertainment. I personally joyed over the latter effect obviously. To avoid spoilers, I won't go further.2) The graphics are great and there is no lag. Even though the game itself is more important than graphics, this can be a good plus.3) The controls feel comfortable and reasonable.4) Anyone who aided in making this creation seemed well credited especially advisors and programs. Cons: 1) The stealth may feel repetitious if you're not interested into the story, but I must say it's a bit fun, and it makes sense when the video game is based more on story than sneaking; otherwise, it wouldn't have been as great. A harder challenge feels worse with a terrible reward.2) It involved a lot of reading, but I definitely enjoyed myself when the pace was mixed with stealth. Overall, I have no regrets. If you want to hear an excellent story while pacing the reading with sneaking, buy this game. In the case that you are purely looking for a stealth game challenge, then I would reconsider. I hope the dev continues making games as great as this one, and even if he didn't, at least he created The Novelist.			"

												You play as supernatural being, genius loci, who can influence family living in your house. Story arc is split to 12 chapters, and in each chapter all 3 family members want different things. You can only side with one them and make compromise with other; third end up unhappy.Your task is... well, it's up for you. Do you want to help little Tommy grow up happy and creative person? Do you want Dan to be successful writer? May be it's Lisa who you feel for? Or may be you want them all to be happy family? You can do all that.The game is pretty short, can be beaten in one evening, but replayability is quite good, since you can try achieve different goals.As for downsides, 1) gameplay is pretty easy (difficulty mode like ""Nightmare"" could improve that) and 2) voice acting could be better sometimes.

												The concept is nice. But gameplay is boring. I quit after 3 chapters.You are limited to one house and 3 persons.You are a ghost who has to learn their thoughts. This is obtained by standing behind them and pressing space bar.To get the requered thought to get further in the story you also have to find notes, pictures and objects. So you go from one room to the other and just look and click. There are no puzzles and you don't have to solve any riddles or anything. Just point and click. At the end you'll get to make the decision if the husband will follow the desire of  wife, kid or his own. But whatever you do, the decision leaves 2 people malcontent. e.g. if you play with the kid, the wife is not happy you don't support her career and the husband is not happy because he misses deathlines for his book. Kind of stupid.The Sims are more realistic on human relations.			"

But the choices that I had to make on behalf of the characters were heartwrenching. The scenarios were so realistic-situations that most of us will be in at one point or another. I don't think I chose well during my first play through; I'll have to play again and see if the outcome will be different. Overall I really enjoyed this game.

												It's an intriguing concept, but this game is really boring in its execution. It moves at a really slow pace, and takes place in the same location for far too long. Perhaps if there were more to explore and uncover, it would be more interesting. Unfortunately, it's a hunt for documents while remaining unseen and traveling back and forth through light fixtures until the end of every chapter, when you make a simple decision.The depiction of a family in a rough time and what they do to get through it is pretty emotionally interesting, but it's ultimately everyday life stuff and doesn't really hook you as much as the supernatural aspect would have you believe.

												I definitely recommend this game to anyone reading this review. If you've seen any gameplay videos yet (on the Steam Store Page, or in another review online), you probably have a good grasp of what it is like to play The Novelist. It's a simple, story-driven game in which the player tries his/her best to guide a family through daily compromises in their lives. The dad wants to work late, the mom wants some family time, and the son wants to go fly his kite. My wife and I played the full game together, and we both found each scenario to be very realistic - and sometimes extremely emotional! The choices in-game carry such weight, mostly thanks to the developer's strong writing. The characters each feel real, reacting naturally to and remembering all of your choices.The game lasts a few hours, but I would not be surprised if most players wished to play two or three times to explore different paths through the story. Overall, it's a worthwhile, moving game.			"

While it is very story rich, and some of the choices are more difficult to make, it does get a bit repetitive after the first play through, as you do the same thing in every act, (find clues, dodge the people, still stuck in the little house) but there is a casual level so you can speed through the game and see the other outcomes. It would have been nice if it wasn't in the house the entire game, or at least have been a bigger area. I'd still recommend it.			"
