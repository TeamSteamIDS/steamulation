												A game that covers the spectrum.I had read the reviews and wasn't expecting much, but when I saw the game on sale for less than 4 dollars I thought I would give it a go. I am glad I did.Some aspects of this game are really great, others are awful.The artwork is fabulous and it helps the game exude atmosphere. It reminded me of 'Evil Under the Sun' with a bit of 'Black Mirror 1' and 'Syberia' thrown in, but in the mountains. The hotel was a dream to explore as it is huge and would be a fantastic place to stay. I loved the short sections outside, with the snow falling. The artists did a fab job.Difficulty is not too tough. I only needed to check a walkthrough once, when I couldn't fathom how to lure the owner out of his office. Kaisa is certainly very cute.The music is lovely for the most part, though a couple of horrendous rock pieces come in at odd moments and not just when entering the room of a particular character.Gameplay is ok, with a clear changing cursor.Now for the bad. The story  is a real slow boiler, which is a good thing as it sets the scen beautifully and allows us to get to know the characters. However, when the main events finally happen, the story just ends. I had the most nonsensical ending  to a game ever and though there are different endings none make a lot of sense, with an absolutely ridiculous twist at the end. So the game takes a good few hours to brew and then when something big finally happens, it ends. Crazy. It is like the developers suddenly lost interest to continue the plot.The translation is poor, though understandable. Sometimes it appears that characters give a comnpletely different answer to the question being asked. The voicees being better than the inaccurate subtitles. It's crazy that the developers didn't get someone who can understand proper English to check the translation. The character voices range from ok (the main character, Kaisa, and Olga) to horrendously bad (Alec, for instance). Also the voices are obviously done with the actor not having a clue as to the context in which they are supposed to be said. A basic error.So, I am going to recommend this title as parts of this game are very enjoyable indeed, though the ridiculously abrupt and silly ending ruins the experience in the end.			"

												Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is a game based on the novel of the same name by the Strugatsky brothers, the generally pretty great Russian sci-fi authors who also wrote books like Roadside Picnic, which was the basis of the movie which was in turn the basis of the STALKER series. I've never read this particular book, but I figured anything related to them couldn't possibly turn out that bad. I was horribly wrong, but I don't need to tell you that, because I doubt anyone was actually planning on buying this game to begin with. But I'm going to go over it anyways because I need a therapeutic rant session to recover from playing it.The first thing you'll notice within five seconds of starting the game is that the voice acting is absolutely terrible. Just listen to the opening dialogue of the game, and you'll see what I mean:

 . Well, actually the first thing you'll notice is that despite originally releasing in 2007 the game only runs in one resolution, and it's 1024 x 768 and cannot be changed, but still. There are one or two actors who border on decent, but for the most part the game sounds as if they hired a bunch of bums off the street and paid them in bread to do the voice acting for the game. It's kind of hilarious, and was mainly what kept me playing through the game, but it also made the story impossible to take seriously.Luckily, there really isn't much story. Again, I've never read the novel this was based off of, but I highly doubt it went quite like this. You spent the first four or five hours of the game doing absolutely nothing relevant to the plot, mainly involving stupid puzzles like helping the hotel owner fix the room service call system that never gets used again, or choosing a dinner from various categories that doesn't cause the other guests to laugh at your choice (I don't know why having too many vegetables in your meal is grounds for making you redo a ""puzzle"", but what do I know?), or playing billiards with another character that isn't even really a puzzle so much as just a billiards flash game implanted into the game. Then in the last 20 minutes or so of the game the story finally starts, you talk to each of the hotel's residents, and then it ends, and the game explains the story to you. As you might have gathered from that last bit, the store page is pretty misleading. It mentions ""15+ hours of gameplay"", but I finished it in less than 6 and I can't imagine it taking 15 hours unless you just get lost in the unnecessarily large hotel. The store page also makes it seem as if the hotel guests have AI routines and go about their own lives, hinting at a system something like how Deadly Premonition's characters go about their day, but the game doesn't have any sort of time system and the characters just move from place to place as you solve the puzzles like in any adventure game. I used to think RunAway was the worst point-and-click adventure game I'd ever played, but I'm not sure if anything will ever top this one.			"

												There are a few negative moments with this game like, some of the voice acting. But If you do like puzzle solving and classic point a click games, than give this one a try. These classic type of games are few and between. I feel that some people weren't giving this one a better chance. Story line is pretty simply, you are a detective solving a possible murder. Characters in game are some what interesting, but will get boring after awhile talking to them. And the setting in game could have been worked on more. Breakdown - Graphics: 2/5, sound 3/5, fun factor 3/5, difficulty 3/5, controls 4/5.			"

												Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is a point and click adventure made in the same spirit as such classics as Syberia and Still Life .  The Steam Overlay works, but unfortunately the game does not support widescreen, and the resulting image will be letterboxed, which is not uncommon for games of this era.  The diaglogue and animation are servicable, and if you are a player who enjoys playing detective in a point and click adventure, Dead Mountaineer's Hotel certainly delivers.			"

												This was a very dull game. There was no humor that I could tell. The dialog was dull and boring and very mono toned. It was as basic as you can get with a clicking game that did not have alot to explore. The overall game was really hard to understand what was going on and what the main objective was. There are 4 different endings to this game so that is the one thing i found enjoyable. It was really hard to understand were to go and what to do in the game while playing since the dialogue didn't give much hint to it. The graphics were decent for how old this game looked and played. The music came in at the worst times. The only mini game that was enjoyable with this game was billiards, but that had its downfall due to the computer having mad skills when it needed them. It was a complicated point and click game that wasn't satisfying at all. I kind of wished I didn't buy this one but am glad I finished the game  to tell you guys not to buy it, even if you are a fan of this genre.			"

												Ok, so after lots and lots of hours I basically just gave up.  I liked the solving puzzles and figuring things out, but it was like the old days of the game Mist where you just didn't know what the heck to do next.  Basically just guess your way through stuff.  I mean, I guess it would recommend it since it actually was a challenge at times and pretty fun looking around.  I never beat the game and wish the clues were a little more obvious.  This game would be awesome if it had seamless loading.  But I guess they decided to made every room a scene or something.One more thing though.  I thought the voice acting was trolling the player at time especially the voice acting of the main hotel manager guy.  It was pretty weird how they did the voice acting, not really sure what to ever say about it.Give it a shot and maybe you'll get farther than I did.			"

												Nice, old-scool graphics, reminded me a bit of Syberia. However, story-wise it was a complete blah with no ground for anything and tons of mistakes:You have tons of locaions (rooms) and such, most of which you never need in the game. It makes reacing places so difficult!You have tons of actions which bring nothing to the story. A number of items which you can view, say what they are and that's it. Usually, this cancels the ""view"" action in such games. Once you see it and know what it is, if it's uselss otherwise.. it just mustn't stay active. Here, it's the opposite.You have a generator and a room which you may never ""see"". Collecting stuff with no need for it. Tons of useless mini-quests (like seeking for the same item twice).Idiotic ending.			"

												There's some good stuff here, interesting characters, and setting thanks to the novel it's based.  I would say it's better than the film of that novel, which can be seen on youtube, but it's all so very slow, the hotel is quite large and as soon as your character gets to one end of it, he's sent back to the other.  Also there are too many puzzles and tasks which don't actually require any puzzling.  I would recommend it if you're interested in the Strugatsky brothers (of Stalker(aka Roadside Picnic) the Inhabited Island, and Hard to Be a God)  but not to anyone else.			"

												I had initially planned to reserve this feature only for providing positive input on games that I truly felt deserved some attention that they might not generally get, but I've given this some thought and think people really need to be warned about how bad this game really is because the pictures can be deceiving.The art is nice. I will give it that. However the atmosphere is ruined at literally the FIRST moment one of the two initial characters you see speaks, as their voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard. These people's voices would not be out of place in a film like The Room. There is also absolutely no introductory exposition. The main character (whoever he is, I think he's a cop, could be wrong) immediately starts angrily grilling people on things with nothing to explain his motivation or why the player should care. Add on the terrible voice acting and things get very painful, very fast.As well as no explanation of the story, there is also no explanation of the controls. I figured out the basics of moving and picking things up as that's as generic as can be, but upon reaching my first real puzzle I was completely at a loss as to how I should be manipulating the items in my inventory or making use of them in the environment. I poked and prodded, clicked and reclicked and what should've been a very, very simple task of just poking the end of a key to make it fall out of the lock on the other side of the door turned into an impossible task when nothing I did registered. This is where I gave up on the game in disgust.I purchsed this game for $2.50. I do not feel it was worth that amount. You have all now been warned.			"

												I like point and click adventure games, but didn't like this one at all. The voice acting was very bland, like they read from a script and that's it. The hints of what to do or who to speak to were either vague or non existant. And the story wasn't that great to begin with, and got even weirder near the end. Even if you like adventure games, with no replayability, you would do well to avoid this one, and get something else instead.			"

												The voice acting in the English version is amongst the worst that I have heard anywhere. I would rate it as almost unplayable. In German however it is a different story. My German is very poor indeed but  having already heard the intro in English I could fill in the gaps of the German version. It really was better acting.  It is possible that this game deserves a thumbs up for the story and visuals but I will have to park it until I get better with my German. A great shame.			"

												Although the concept sounds good on paper, Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is by no means a good game.The key hook, the murder, happens too late to really draw you in, and while the mountaintop hotel is pleasant to look at, it is filled with barely noticable items, and can rapidly become a nightmarish maze if you don't pick up the easily missable map at the start of the game. Puzzle solutions are either esoteric or require scouring the entire hotel for a misplaced item, the best ending requires completing an infuriating mini-game of snooker, and the voice acting and character animations are shoddy (although if you consider the absurb plot twist at the end, these lacklustre performances are all perfectly explicable).Peter Glebsky (your character) constantly sounds incredulous, although on the plus side, he does vaguely resemble Richard Armitage.Don't climb this mountain.

												Absolute. Waste. Of. Time. This game was gifted to me, so I went ahead and gave it a go. The graphics aren't too bad -- if you don't mind laziness. Objects were recycled from scene to scene, and sometimes not even altered or rotated. The script is also terribly rigid. Your cursor will show you various places you can click to go -- but you HAVE to follow the script and can only make one -right- choice every time. That aside, the worst part of the game is the dialogue. I don't know if they had a deadline to meet or what, but the voice actors sound like they're reading the script cold and have no idea how to inflect any sort of emotion into what they're saying. It's torture to listen to. For that reason, it's likely I may never finish this game. /Anti-Recommendation			"

												First off it should be mentioned that 'Dead moutaineer's hotel' is an old russian movie, which would be fine if the store page would mention it, so you could research the movie at least a bit in advance.Both Knox and VanDine would turn in their graves when seeing this misleading summary, that actually makes you think this is a fair and square detective mystery, while it actually isn't.And even if you are tolerant enough to call it a detective mystery you will soon find out that it isn't fair at all, since:The number of clues telling you that everyone here is an alien robot,built to observe humanity is exactly zero.Rather late in the game you get a clue that aliens might be somehow involved, by finding a strange device which would as well be a very sophisticated bomb.But no matter how you look at it, its not enough of a hint to make you even remotely aware that EVERYONE (the detective included) is just an alien robot.The only remote clues in that regard you ever get is hearing that one of the cast apparently carried out some superhuman task (Think it was carrying a safe on her shoulders), as well as aforementioned strange device. - Notably very close to the end of the story.But even if you consider this a detective mystery with sci-fi elements this clue, as well as the device simply come to late for you to be able to make 'xyz and txz are in fact alien robots. And yet again, even if you would consider this a valid clue, there is no clue at all that you, the detective himself and the entire rest of the cast, is one of these robots too. As a movie adaption - passableAs the detective story it pretends to be however it fails hard.			"

												Worst. Game. Ever...I continued to wait for the game to begin all the way until the credits rolled. There is so much wrong with this game, i continued to play thinking surely it must get better, but honestly, trust every other review when they say this is the worst game ever. • The voice acting is terrible, i've heard more heart felt believable conversations with my pet cat. Voice acting isnt a make or break for a game but still its a major minus. • There is no story!!! Im on a holiday break, the hotel is named after a dead mountaineer, it has a museum room which was once his. Ok. Some one's been smoking in the room and there are some shoes which dont belong there. Hardly a case for Scooby Doo. Then thats kind of it, you spend the entire game following idle tasks with no story, no reason other than to advance the game. then when the end does come you simply dont care.• It's really slow! You walk everywhere, there is no option to run, even in a hurry ""Quick, we have to get guy on the roof here because his friend is badly injured, slowely walks to roof."" there are some scenes where you can double click and fast travel through the room without having to actually walk the entire room, but yea this plays really slow and clunky. • You will not care about anyone. I didnt even bother to learn their names, i really wanted this to be a good game, i thought from looking at it a steam sale that it could be good, but no, coupled with the bad voice acting you find yourself unable to connect with any of the characters. There is a plot twist at the end. at least if there was a plot, there would be the twist but for me and my experiance, it was the beginning of the story, which then ended some 2 paragraphs later. And while im on it, as a plot twist its utterly wank. Buy this game only if you have played every other game on steam... and only if it comes on sale for £1... and only if you get that £1 from someone else.			"

Voices are okay but direction is not - you coud tell they were just reading what they were given with no context.   Some more $$ thrown into localization would've helped.  Maybe other languages are better.  Apparently this is based off of a novel.  Maybe reading that first would've helped make the game more sense, but playing this first makes me completely uninterested in trying to find the novel.			"

												Ready for a mystery game?  Then grab scooby doo jump in the mystery and drive it off a cliff, just end it all now if you plan on finishing this game. The voice acting sounds literally like their reading off a page, no matter what the characters are doing, walking, or running, in danger, their voice stays the same flat or unconcerned.  Get ready for ALOT of bad voice acting since this game is story driven.The main character sounds angry at everything when he talks, just looking at in game items makes him mad.  I am guessing he is mad for being in one of the worst games ever made.  I got five minutes into the game and got stuck, unable to continue, with no hint system or anything I turned it off and deleted it.   Every single time you move to another screen the game loads like an old Resident evil game, except in this game its not passing through a door, just walking to the other side of a room makes the game load.  This game is so bad it makes you feel dirty for owning it, the kind of dirty you cant wash off.  Rating:  0/10  Value: $-9.99  (Notice that is negative, we should be PAYED to play crap like this!)

												Very mediocre and uninspiring game. Paying for it more then a couple quid is just waste of money. Only buy if it is on a massive sale and you are desperate for an adventure game. "

												Uhhhhh...yeah...Great price but I could only play it for 5min.  The voiceovers of the characters is pretty dry and non-interesting.  Didn't catch my attention so I'm deleting it from my computer.			"

												In short: boring, pointless and confusing.Longer version: I'm a sucker for this kind of adventures and pride myself for having a very high tolerance. This one certainly looked nice when looking at the screenshots and reading the intro. But when you get in the game there's nothing happening. One wanders around the hotel, clicking through all the dialogs, picking up stuff, solving a few puzzles, yet still doesn't get any idea what this game is about.And that's the main problem. I couldn't figure out what to do! The dialogs are stiff and boring and I got sick of seeing the same scenes over and over again as I had to constantly clicking my way through the hotel.Summary: Spend your money on another game. This one is no fun and is one of the very few adventures I actually stopped playing. I didn't event want to consult a walkthrough. I just can't be bothered.			"

												Dead Mountaineer's Hotel is pure brilliance...knocked down a few pegs by some glaring flaws.  At its heart Dead Mountaineer's club is a beautiful, brooding, sophisticated, crime noir mystery.  The incredible artwork is supplemented by great music that eventually gets repetitive over time because there are only a few measures.  The story builds up quite a bit of suspense and intrique that strings the player along and leaves them wanting more.  The locations, while pretty much all within the confines of a dilapitated ski lodge are surprisingly numerous, though could possibly still stand to be supplemented.  Quirky characters, each of which has his/her own personality and self-interests coupled with a creepy environment that always hints at some form of potential danger on the horizon makes for a rather paranoid journey through the wash of clues and suspicious events the player has to sort through in figuring out how the crime took place, if there even was a crime.  Sounds like a masterpiece, doesn't it?  Well, not quite.  Unfortunately, there are a number of flaws that prevent the game from being the forerunner of the puzzle/adventure genre that it really aspires to be.  First, the pacing is odd.  There are moments of intensity while other moments leave the player wandering around with no real direction.  While freedom given to the player to solve some story elements in different orders in a way that actually allows for multiple story endings is a great addition to this game, there are some minor problems with the way the developers implemented this feature.  The player can actually break the game by doing something before doing another required task, which leads to some sort of missed cue in the game that stops the progression of the major game events.  This is probably the biggest problem with the game.  Another, lesser problem is that the game is slightly anticlimatic, partially because the major events in the game overshadow the ending, and partially because the game builds up so much suspense as the game goes on that we're expecting a bigger resolve toward the end of the game.Being the adventure game fanatic I am, I still enjoyed the game enough to put more than 51 hours into it, but I don't think everyone would share my exuberance.  Given the flaws, I would recommend it for unbending fans of adventure/puzzle games.  At the same time, I would probably advise those who are new to adventure games and more casual adventure gamers to steer well clear of Dead Mountainer's Hotel.  For those types, there are plenty of other challenging adventure games that do not have the same pitfalls this one has.In the end, I would rate this one at a solid 6.5 out of 10, because in the areas where it excels it does so gloriously.

												Overall I enjoyed the game enough to make it worth a play through. The game was made in 2007 so the graphics by now are pretty dated. Though still decent enough that it shouldn't be a bother. The game plays like a typical point'n'click adventure game, about a detective investigate what appears to be a murder and the strange going ons inside the hotel. For the most part the game is pretty cliched and honestly lacking in story development until towards the end and then BAM! The game took me about 6hrs to play through all the way. There are some large negatives though. The voice acting is really quite terrible. It wouldn't surprise me if whoever localized it into English also provided the voices themselves.			"

												This game is awful. And the more awful thing is I have finished the game. And the most awful thing is I have finished and watched all of the three endings. I just can't forget this awful game that I have finished YEARS AGO.The voice acting is awful, but it's nothing. It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game, but that really is nothing! Because, you think the graphic and atomsphere looks good, so you think the story should be fascinating, at least not bad, right? WOW, snow storm, mountainners, serial killer in a hotel? NO!!!This game tought me one thing that I will never forget. That is, if most people say the game is bad, really bad, then it IS bad. Don't try to think about buying it. If you just can't keep yourself calm and think wisely to not buy it, then don't play it! Don't even try to think about it, DO NOT! REALLY! You'll regret throwing your money away, but it's not a big deal, it's nothing!!! The most horrible thing is you'll then get punished by the game and you WILL DEEPLY DEEPLY REGRET what you have played. This horrible game does not punish you at the begining or in the middle of the game, it punishes you in its endings. It has three endings so you can get punished three times if you want to, and you will want to because you just can't help getting the other two punishments after the first one. And you'll regret and never forget that! FOR YEARS!			"

												Doesn't work properly without changing game files, installing third party bloatware like DIVX, and basically jumping through way too many hoops.I wasted more time on Google trying to find ways to fix thios piece of crap than actually attempting to play it.Ended up uninstalling without having actually played, as the mouse wouldn't work (among other problems), rendering the game unplayable.I'd almost classify it as malware, but I'll settle for fraud.It should be removed from the shop, as I'm pretty sure knowingly selling products that don't work isn't exactly legal, but since Valve doesn't seem to care, stay away from it unless youlike wasting money.
