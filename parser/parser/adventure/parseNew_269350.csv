Early Access Review
								In its current state, I cannot recommend Montas.  The movement is extremely slow, from normal speed walking to what seems to be sprinting, or what I would call, ""running knee deep in mud.""  It gets to the point where you become so frustrated because you are being controlled by the game's slow movement speed and animations.  You feel confined and you cannot go at your own pace.  I feel as though the developer was not confident enough in their design to allow the player to move at their own pace.  I find this to be a major drawback.  After several minutes in ""slow-mo,"" I started to feel nauseated and frustrated at the same time.The platforming, due to the slow movement speed, can be a frustrating task.  I fell a few times due to the clunky, slow movement speed of walk and run.  Mind you, I have played more than my fair share of platformers since the 90s.  I am not claiming to be an expert at platforming, but character movement speed and fluidity is important if you want to platform properly.Another glaring flaw in Montas are the visuals, which is splattered with blur effects and post processing effects that only add more to a distorted image.  It is difficult to enjoy the scenery when every pixel is smeared with post processing effects that ruins the game's visual fidelity.  Overall, I do not feel like Montas is worth playing due to these setbacks.  By the time you proceed to the ""scary"" and ""horror"" elements in your dark journey, you find yourself pulled away from the atmosphere that is nothing more than a void.  To further add fuel to the fire, the opening sequence did not draw me in, nor did it introduce me to anything I would be interested in playing.  The terrible pacing that feels like you are being mind controlled by the developers in a horrid dream, hampers any sense of imagination and player choice.  Montas feels like a game without proper direction and it is poorly executed.  And I do not mean to rub salt on the wound, but it is no wonder why Montas was in a PC bundle deal a few months ago that went for as low as $1 for entry donation.  The developers do not even have confidence in their own product.  I would not recommend it to any of my friends.Rating:  5 out of 10			"

Early Access Review
EDIT: November 19Though the game is early access, it's really worth buying.PROS-Dynamic atmosphere. Especially when you set the game to top notch settings. If you have Oculus Rift, terrifying terrific.-Great ambience. Sometimes the music and the sounds get me instead. Imagine going down a corridor and constantly hearing ""Someone's here. Leave."" whispered to your ears. Get a good pair of headphones!-Very immersive. There's a whole town waiting to be explored. I haven't mentioned the sewer system, have I? -Scary. Yes, scary. About the game's horror-o-meter, besides only a few cheap scares, there are elevators, hallways, and illuminating corners. Plus, as I mentioned the sound effect is enough to bring you a good horrifying experience. There are enemies, too. The cool thing is that there's little time for you to react when seeing enemies, and they usually appear out of nowhere. Test your guts, and your mind.CONS-The game is still in the testing phase. That gives it bugs like frame drops. Frame drops are significantly reduced as of update #7.-Light effects are not as good. Sometimes, as you go around corners, the lights go out. This is more of a minor annoyance, really.-Enemies are not too smart. Just run like hell away from them and you'll be fine. I really expected something more challenging.-The character moves at a snail pace.-It's pretty difficult to move things around.-Inventory system is still incomplete.-Some market-sold computers might not be able to handle the graphics. I test the game on Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Intel Core i7 2.00GHz processor, which runs smoothly but gets choppy in certain highly-detailed and illuminated areas.Overall: 8.5 out of 10. You'll just have to see for yourself.			"

Early Access Review
								Montas is survival horror game that really focuses on immersing you with its atmosphere. As you explore the environments you can discover multiple paths that can lead you to hidden secrets and content. I was honestly paranoid and scared from the very start even when nothing had attacked me yet. Eventually you will come up against enemies that will chase you down Amnesia style and you must avoid them. This game is currently in early access so it's not a complete game and I did come across glitches and annoying level design flaws but that will be fixed during early access I'm sure. I really recommend trying Montas out for yourself if you enjoy horror games. Here is my video preview of Montas:

			First impressions on Steam's early access game Montas. Very promising game, amazing atmosphere Don't forget to subscribe and share the video with your friends.		

Montas has all the right ingredients to be a great horror game with a lot of exploration to do, platforming and puzzle solving.As an early access game the developers did a very good job not to spoil the story much but it still gives you a lot to do in the game. The city is very much open with plenty of dark corners and secrets, you can go wherever you want, if you are not too afraid to go there...The atmosphere is amazingly creepy, most of the time you have no idea of what's going on and what's real and what's not and if you are dreaming or awake and that makes you fear the game and trust nothing in the game.Lighting is great, sound is also good, there are a few glitches some frame rate drops, some animations also need polishing but this is still a beta.Have in mind that this is not the final product but if you are an horror fan you should at least try it.

Early Access Review
								Short Version:Great game! :3 really scary even as a beta. can't wait for full release of the game! the atmosphere gives you the chills. x.xLong Version:This game is a mystery within a mystery. You have no idea what you're doing, you follow your instinct. Normally, this would be a bad thing, however the way they give you all the choises of where you can go, it makes you feel free from the story and that you can do whatever you want. When you finally get to a place where you were supposed to get to, you're like......wow, too bad i didn't explore more, OH WAIT i can always just go back and check the things out that i missed! :D. This game requires you to spend time in it, and to explore every single corner of the game. Also, not to mention that this game will give you a heart attack without using the ultimate power of pop ups. The sound in the game is enough to make you want to press escape and instantly just want to click that exit game button as soon as possible. The effects can really just start taking over and you just feel in danger and like you should run 4 ur lyf. There was literaly where i was pushed to a point where i just pressed Alt+F4 because of a scary noise that kept going louder and louder. Some Fun/Funny Times I Had:Alright....soooooo..without giving any spoilers here, i got out of some sewers and i decided HEY LET'S PICK UP A TRASH-CAN AND PUSH IT AGAINST THE MONSTERS FACE THE WHOLE TIME TO DODGE IT :D, without expecting it to work ofcourse, i tried it and it worked, so it kept walking into the trashcan, and i was like AH! D: and held the trashcan up a bit higher, then he was stuck underneath the trashcan and i slammed the trashcan down, and poof, i murdered a monster (and by that i pushed him to glitch completely into the ground). My reaction: O.O ...... wut did i just do....I would give this game a 8/10 for being fun and enforcing exploration, not to mention keeping it's horror gamestyle. I can't give it a 10/10 considering it's still in beta, however the score might go up once the game is fully released. Worth every penny.			"

								A really nice and atmospheric horror exploration game, where you have to run sometimes. And its early access what i like in this genre because it feels organic when you play a game and after the next update new areas before closed are available then or pamm a new enemy`s hiding behind a corner. it sounds crazy but this game feels endless in a really good way. You will never delete it you want to play it again and again to explore and go through these strange worlds. One thing i really love ""the handmade graphical art on the walls ingame"" awesome motives you will love it. A story i don't need, you are the story, it feels like youre dead and you have infinite time to go through different portals. But you have to play it and you will see :)			"

								Montas has a very immersive, and creepy, atmosphere. With the usage of the Unreal 3 engine the graphics are great. Needs some polishing up (fixing bugs, adding features, etc.) but that is exactly what you expect from an Early Access game. If you aren't bothered by some bugs (they'll be fixed eventually) I would definitly recommend buying this now, otherwise wait a while as they release patches and polish it up. If you are a fan of immersive horror games you should, for sure, give Montas a try, especially since it is only $10 at the moment. I can't wait for the finished game, it's going to be great!			"

								Well I've put some time into this game, and I understand it's early access, so I've tried to temper my expectations a bit.  Pros:  Great ambience, and suspense.  Cons:  Playability is tedious, I feel corraled and guided in ditections.  Exploration leads to mostly dead ends.  Not enough backstory, or point to the game.  Not enough items or interactions with items.Advice would be to put some form of crosshairs to aid in interactions with items, put more items, more backstory, don't seal areas off leaving only one path.  Having played from the begining several times and having had a good amount of game expereinece, I find the initial challenge frustrating afte the frist elevator ride down so odd and difficult that I suspect their is no sollution other than to die.  The second challenge once you get ouf of the white room again seems the only way to progress is again to die.  All in all I'm dissapointed in the game because I think you have something here, but find it mostly tedious and the time I spent playing up to this point,   was time wasted.  Perhaps it's just not my type of game.I think any person who was in a situation like that would find any kind of a weapon for defense, and if I wanted answers out of those locked offices I'd break those windows and get into them.  I'd read the crumpled papers on the floor and in trash, move pictures to find anything behind them, and certainly a light switch lol in an office area.I hope the game improves becuase like I said you've got something there, but it's very time consuming and frustrating.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review! Will Update On Final Release:Montas is a horror game for the person who doesnt want to ever feel safe. The world can change around you just because you aren't looking at it; although not in huge manners, more like smaller, creepier ways. Many times I've walked down a hallway, only to turn around an find that some horrifying mannerism of an enemy has formed behind me. With no attack function (which only adds to the horror of the game, just like Outlast) i have to flee, hoping that the elevator I called has arrived and that the doors will close in time for me to escape.Montas is a great game to keep you on for toes and scared to look around doors and corners. However, it does have many flaws, because it is an early access game at this point.Flaws include the inability to change the key mapping (making it impossible for laptop users to play if they don't have a mouse), intermittent issues with the player falling through the floors or being catapulted across the map, objects becoming stuck or broken; many of these are the usual issues an EA game could suffer from.The developers were silent for several month but recently uploaded a new patch and have been active in the discussions where players have been reporting said flaws and bugs. I hope that in the future, these bugs will be fixed and I am very excited for the final product (if i'll be able to finish it without crying from fear)If you can cope with the flaws of the current status and you are a fan of horror games, such as Outlast, Slender etc. then I urge you to support the game developer and give Montas a try :)			"

								Even though this game may not be finshed polished product, it still has so much to offer in terms of atmosphere and scares. Everything from shadows to mysteriously opening doors will have you on edge. You know a game has good atmosphere when ten minutes in a flying manhole cover causes you to scream and flinch, along with whomever is watching over your shoulder. The minor bugs in no way impeded gameplay, might have just eased the tension a bit. Some say don't buy since it isn't finished but I say do so. You won't be disappointed.			"

								The game is completely broken,after the first 5 mins your character will get stuck,you will not be able to move at all.Not recommended until they fix this game breaking bug.edit: i gave the game another shot,this time my character got out of the map and got stuck of course.I haven't uninstalled a game so fast in ages.

								Broken game. In 30 minutes of gameplay:The character got completely glitched into the terrain twice.The character fell through the worldI saw ""enemies"" glitching through walls and terrainWhen I took damage there was no indication, and no indication of death, you just randomyl respawned whilst walkingI saw enemies stuck still in a walking animation.All character models had clipping issues.EVERY single texture is ultra low quality.There is literally nothing redeeming about this.

								Shows a lot of promise. A bit let down by some really terrible enemy AI. The implied horror in the early game was a lot scarier than what I saw of, admittedly in-dev, later game where enemies are introduced. I willingly walked up to one of them thinking it was an NPC hobo. Then it grabbed me.It's very much a work in progress when I wrote this tho, so more implied horror and less illusion-shattering shamblers please :p			"

It's interesting up to a point and then it just falls apart like they just gave up after a certain point.  So this would be a perfect example of unfinished.			"

								Montas is a very dark and abstract game that leads you through paranoia and insecurity. The game itself is still in early access and very raw because there's only two developers working on it at the moment. But even with that, I would say it is a success.The game immersed me and was very fun to play and the art is very creepy / good. The subtle scares, the tension all leading up to a conclusion really did make this game stand out among all those jumpscare-throwing games.Keep in mind when purchasing, the game is far from finished and might look very different later on.

								I can't beleive this game has any good reviews. WARNING CHAIRS AND TRASH CANS MOVE ON THEIR OWN!Cons:1. Glitchy. Can fall into the world and never stop falling. Glitchy textures. Creatures AI's are glitchy and were walking into walls.2. Horrible walking. To make any progress in this game you'll need to hold the shift key down at all times.3. Very little scares to be offered and lack luster when they do happen.4. No updates in over a year and no signs of improvement.5. Notice in the youtube trailer people are getting scared of nothing because that is what happens in the game.Pros: 1.It looks nice besides some glitchy textures and could be scary if someone was still working on it.2. Scares are random at certain points. "

								I highly hope I glitched the game into beating it in about 2 hours. Because if not, a $9.99 price tag is kind of unacceptable. Hopefully they'll add more content, areas, length, etc. during Early Access. I loved the atmosphere, the creepy/subtle scares, and sound design, I'll give it that. It has to be one of the most unique horror games I've ever jumped into. The ending though, made the least of sense. Montas is still worth checking out though, even in the state that it's in. If you're a horror/atmosphere buff that's willing to pay a $10 admission, I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

There are countless little impressions that will linger in the back of your mind as you wander on. The atmosphere is unique and haunting. An experience such as this is really rare nowadays. Go pick this one up and give it a go. And don't worry: no cheap Slenderman-like jumpscares or anything. Just pure immersion and a lasting impression.			"

								I highly recommend not getting this game during early access. There are literally holes in the map that make you fall through the world. On top of that, if you dare pause during a cutscene your game will break and bring you into areas off the map. With that being said this game has great potential, the game looks great and has a creepy atmosphere that's pretty unique. A definite buy once it's finished.			"
