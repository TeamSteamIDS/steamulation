												This is a review of the first game of this bundle: Ben There, Dan That.Ben There, Dan That! is an adventure game in the purest tradition of the genre. If you’ve played LucasArts adventures in the 90’s, you are in familiar territory (and also, lucky). Same if you played 90’s Sierra titles (except you weren’t so lucky). Indeed, you’ll find again every emblematic ingredient: look/use/talk/walk commands, inventory management, branching dialogs, humour…The story begins with our two heroes, Ben and Dan (who happen to be digital incarnations of the game designers) coming home from a jungle expedition, just in time for watching Magnum P.I. on the TV. Unfortunately, the aerial is broken and you must help our heroes fix it. It very soon happens that Ben and Dan get abducted by aliens in the process. They (and you) must therefore navigate through alternative dimensions if you want to go back home.There are three areas in which Ben There, Dan That! shine. The first is its humour. It is plentiful and very funny. It touches on many topics and doesn’t avoid controversy (positive discrimination of handicapped workers gets laughed at, for instance). It’s neither politically correct nor polite. Ben and Dan are not above ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and “♥♥♥♥♥♥” jokes. So it may not be to everyone’s taste. Most of the humour, however, consists of meta-jokes, aimed at adventure game mechanisms themselves. Those are equally funny, although by the end of the game, that theme will have overstayed its welcome. It also means you probably won’t enjoy the game that much if you’re not an adventure game veteran.The second remarkable feature is the puzzles themselves. Despite the completely bonkers story, the puzzles remain logical and avoid frustration for the player, without feeling childish like the recent horde of “casual” adventure games. I didn’t need a walkthrough in order to beat this adventure and I never stayed stuck for long. Despite the relative easiness, my intelligence never felt insulted. It was therefore the perfect balance for me. Polish is the last award-deserving area. In other adventure games, when you are bumping against a particularly devious (or illogical) puzzle, it is common to start trying everything, using every inventory item on every element in the room. Here, because the puzzles are not very difficult, it is rarely necessary to do so. But I encourage you to adopt that behaviour nonetheless. Because almost all combinations, stupid or smart, have been thought of by the developers and there is almost always a funny line of dialog to reward any desperate action. It’s really remarkable, as other games too often punish you with something bland, along the lines of “I can’t do that” whenever you try something original/stupid. There are weaker aspects to the game though. The story is unimpressive. And despite their individual qualities, the environments (or “rooms”) lack coherence. The game universe feels disjointed and the “parallel dimensions” premise doesn't really excuse that.I'm not a big fan of the technical aspects either. The art style is primitive and something of an acquired taste. The backgrounds are made to look goofy but mostly they are bordering on the ugly. I got used to it in the end, but it means I didn't get a very good first impression. The animations are very basic, and frankly idiotic. I know some will defend them, but to me it looked stupid without looking funny. The best that can be said about the music is that it is unobtrusive. It must also be said that there is no voice acting, but that can hardly be held against the game.If you can live with the graphics, and if you've played enough adventure games to appreciate the meta-humour, then by all means, I recommend you purchase the game. It's funny and it's designed with care and attention to details. It's enough to pleasantly fill the better part of a lazy Sunday afternoon.			"

												If you don't like point and click adventures, you won't like this.  If this is among your first point and click adventures, you won't understand or appreciate this game.  Play a few others first.  At the very least, play the Monkey Island series first.These two games contain two types of humor: absurd, potty humor and jokes that poke fun at point and click game design and the thought process of players.  Some of my favorite moments in the game happen when Ben and Dan bicker about picking up random objects or trying to combine two very different inventory items.  Ben and Dan frequently break character to talk about the merits and downfalls of the genre.  They are aware that they are living in an adventure game world.  I view these games as commentary on point and clicks first and a ridiculous tale about time travel, aliens, and Hitler second.  The art style feels intentional rather than amateur.  One of my favorite aspects of adventure games is the wide variety of art styles, so the graphics here don't bother me at all.That said, I think that the first game (Ben There, Dan That) is slightly stronger because its jokes don't stoop to the same level of disgustingness as its sequel.  Some of the sequel's jokes nearly cross the line and seem to exist for the shock value.  I appreciate the humor more when it's better integrated with the point and click meta commentary.  There are also a few puzzles which, while funny, aren't very intuitive.  Especially in the sequel, you'll be asking yourself ""What's my overall goal again...?""I'd rate both games 4/5.  I enjoyed them because I enjoy point and clicks.  And when I play other adventure games in the future, I have no doubt that Ben and Dan will be in my mind cracking jokes about the silly inventory items I try to combine out of desperation.			"

												If you like British humour, you're going to love this. The writing is clever and it's one of those rare things - a FUN point and click game. It's not something only Telltale can do, I know, I'm just as surprised as you, dear reader!Anyway, it's a couple of currecies, and totally worth the tiny price. I enjoyed it so much that I even went to their site and gave them MORE money because honestly, I feel like they're selling it way cheaper than it's worth.			"

												It pains me somewhat to give both of these games a negative review since I'm a huge fan of Point & Click adventure games and the game stars two friends named Ben & Dan. From the start, the user interface and controls are a mess and a nightmare. You simply cannot left or right click something or somewhere, you have to scroll through several different actions just to do anything. This becomes incredibly tedious and inefficient - why can't the controls be like every other point & click adventure game? The game features no voice acting at all, so at times the player is stuck listening to no music or the same music looped over and over. Sometimes the diagloue goes on way too long and is very uninteresting. The game tries to be funny with its own unique humor, but it really is overdone and becomes bland fast. There is a lot of backtracking so moving back and forth to the same areas becomes a chore just to progress and the puzzles are also pretty irratating. Some puzzles just do not make any sense and the art/animation is simply not my style: it is pretty terrible. There are a ton of other point and click adventure games out there, which are way more fun - so steer clear of this one unless you want to be in for a lackluster painful ride.			"

												Short version of this review: If you like, or have ever liked, point and click adventures, buy this game. You will not be disappointed.Both Ben there Dan that! and Time Gentlemen, Please! are charming, witty point and click games like they used to be back in the day when that sort of thing was popular. The humour (though more adult) will likely have you not only laughing out loud (genuinely) as it lovingly takes the p**s out of itself and the games it's inspired by. The puzzles are just off the wall enough to be interesting but not massively frustrating. Although the graphics aren't 'great' (well, not fancy, anyway) they fit the games perfectly. I really have not played a game as funny and enjoyable as this in quite a long time.My only quibble about them would be that they're too short - but that's only because I wanted more. Even at full price, there's plenty of value for money here for the playtime.In summary, buy this. BUY IT. Why are you still reading this? BUY THIS GAME. Unless you despise point and clicks, (why?!!) in which case, probably don't bother.			"

												Ben and Dan are a pair of seasoned point-and-click adventurers who also happen to be your average British smartasses – though their jokes tend to be noticeably dumber (in a good way) and dirtier (again, in a good way). While trying to fix their TV in time for a relaxing episode of Magnum, P.I. they set off a chain of events which leads to the universe-hopping and time-jumping plots of Ben There, Dan That! and its sequel, Time Gentlemen, Please! The places and times they visit get sillier and sillier, but who really needs a deep plot when you've got good jokes?Heavily influenced by classic point-and-click adventure games, both of the Ben and Dan games take their sense of humor and game feel from those old titles. Every line is a bad joke, an embarrassing pun, or an eye-rolling bit of meta-humor, and it's all a blast to read. The writing hits that perfect tone of ""smart in the dumbest way"" and keeps the energy high with line after line of funny, stupid goodness. It's hard not to be impressed with the writers when the necessary evil of attempted item combinations yields lines that are just as funny as the main dialogue. There must be thousands of lines across both of these games, and I can't think of even one that I didn't enjoy. The art style works into this, too, with a rough look that is nevertheless very charming, colorful, and quite cohesive across every level.Of course, while old adventure games were remembered for their writing and aesthetics, their gameplay isn't remembered quite so fondly. Unfortunately, Ben and Dan sometimes dive headfirst into those nasty pitfalls. For every few puzzles that goes along smoothly and logically, there will be a puzzle that will absolutely stump you, leading to far too much time mucking about in an overflowing inventory or with the finicky interface. The later puzzles of both games tend to throw logic out the window and require solutions that, while amusing once you know about them, are basically impossible to find without a walkthrough. Still, despite taking the bad with the good of the classic adventure genre, I'd say that the good is easily good enough to outweigh some awkwardness in design. Worthy new entries into a near-forgotten genre.			"

												Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! are two separate games in that follow our heroes Dan and Ben as they attempt to simply watch a marathon of their favorite TV show Magnum P.I. While rigging up a makeshift television antenna, our heroes transported to an alien ship, to different eras and to different dimensions. As they try to solve their way back to their own home and return to a much needed television break. (Alice in Wonderland type traveling)Gameplay is like standard point and clicks. You interact with objects, sometimes bring them along or use them on other objects or NPCs. There are puzzles but not too difficult to solve which jokes and riddles. Some may be a bit tough, but in hindsight it's ""why didn't i see that or get that joke"". The story is easy to follow and easy to pick up. These games are filled with humor and quick quips about the events around them. Dan Marshall and Ben Ward do a marvelous job integrating humor into their game. The game may not be for everyone but for people who like jokes and like point and click adventures, this game is worth buying and worth your time trying. It's light on your wallet and can give you a few laugh in the few hours you play through this game.Only issue may be if you don't really get the humor that can be off-putting. Some humor may be seen more mature. But simply you will recognize in time, it is a lot Dan and Ben taking shots at the environment, npcs, and each other.Definite must play. Especially at the price.Also, there is a rumored third game coming soon. - You can follow Dan Marshall @danthat - and see what he has in store for the future adventures of Dan and Ben. "

												Not the greatest point-and-click adventures I've played. Granted, I paid maybe a dollar or two, but most of my time spent with them was disappointing. The humor and writing is pretty decent, but the puzzles are nonsensical and the gameplay is irritating (it's one of those games that has about six or seven actions you have to scroll through to find the thing you're supposed to be doing). The art is awful but I suppose deliberately so, and I got used to it. Still, not a ton of fun, unless you're hardcore into this sort of game.			"

												""Ben There, Dan That!"", the first game, was actually the better of the two I think. They've both got the same awful (mostly on purpose) graphics, and annoying UI, but the writing was better in the first game. ""Time Gentlemen"" had way more backtracking and the humour was less clever and more of the fart joke type of humour. Still, for the very, very cheap price I paid for this I can't complain. Definitely enjoyed ""Ben There, Dan That!"" a lot more, although I can't say I recommend the games unless you can pick them up for roughly the ridiculous price I paid of 40c. Otherwise, there are better adventure games out there.			"

												First things first: If you are new to the Point&Click-Adventure Genre, you should not start with this.Ben and Dan are obviously two veterans of the genre and the games pretty much expect some basic knowledge from you.I cannot call myself a veteran, but I made it through both games, but I have to admit, that some (or maybe some more) of the puzzles can be mindbendingly puzzling and/or irritating.I kinda think that that should be part of a P&C, though.The story itself is pretty hilarious and totally crazy. I think the humour is kinda British but I didn't really have trouble with it. I found the game very funny.Unless you want this to be your first impression of Point & Click adventures, do get it!			"

												This was an adventure game that I picked up on a whim during one of the Steam sales.  I don't recommend it.  It feels like one of those amateur 2D adventures that you can download for free from the AGS website.  The game tries to hook the player with dry, sarcastic humor and with references to more popular (and well loved) games in the genre, but fails to bring anything worthwhile to the table.  The animation is literally stick figures flailing their arms and legs about.  I'm certain that the authors love 2D adventure games, but in this case, they should have stuck to playing them instead of creating this drivel.Skip it.  There are much better 2D adventures on Steam that are worth buying.			"

i will post a separate review about each gameBen There, Dan That!tbh, this game isn't bad, but not the best in it's genre .. Ben there Dan that is an adventure point & click game. it has an interesting storyline about time traveling, aliens, zombies, dinos, multi-dimensions .. etcthe dialogue is hilarious, the jokes are awesome, the game has it's moments (it will make you laugh hard at some points, i won't tell you & spoil the fun 0:) ), the graphics are acceptable but they have a bad effect on the game-play somehow (WARNING: sometimes it's really hard to pick up stuff, sometimes you will ignore some important items thinking that you can't pick it up .. well the truth is you are touching something else near the item, just keep trying till you get it in your inventory), the puzzles are easy & funny to solve but sadly there is no steam overlayOverall, this is a good game, it  gave me 3.3 hours full of fun & laughing, i would recommend it to my family/friends, especially that it was free & bundled many times. 6.5/10Time Gentlemen, Please!this game came to complete the previous game ""Ben there Dan that"" ..i just completed it & i can see clearly that they improve it in many aspects-this one have better interaction with items and environment-it's longer (7.7h in this one & 3.3 in the previous one, so it's 11h in both games)-the story still interesting & enjoyable, you will find hitler, dinos, robots & time machines ... but tbh the ending was quite inappropriate, they shouldn't complete it that way.-much more puzzles, (it can be hard sometimes)-they've added steam overlayregardless of the ending, this is a good game, much improved & enjoyable. 7/10			"

-Quick Review-Ben there, Dan That! and Time Gentlemen Please! are point and click adventure games developed by Size Five Games, and the pack was released in 2009.


I can't screenshot, so I artwork. 
Community Created Artwork for Ben There, Dan That!
By: Atratzu

			I feel like I shouldn't comment on this... You know... As an american. But I definitely see the humor and snickered at the thought of Britain being the 51st American state. :P		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: This is the continuing story of Ben and Dan who just want to watch Magnum Pi, but keep having terrible luck before they actually get to watch their program.This game is definitely very British, but I don't see how that would be a count against it, down to the very condescending dialogue between Ben and Dan I thoroughly enjoyed playing through the game.


Screenshot - Using an item 
Community Created Artwork for Ben There, Dan That!
By: Atratzu

			I'm uploading screenshots to use with my review. This is just showing how you use an item on a door. Elementary, Dear Watson.		


Gameplay: To give you the basics of the UI. This is a point and click game... in other words, when you get stuck you will progress to try A with B, and B with C, and A with C.Much to my amusement/frustration Ben and Dan noticed and called me out on it. I had to look up tips and hints on the first level because apparently I lost the part of my brain which works with point and click adventure games.You right click to toggle between different selection modes, the ""foot"" will tell Dan to walk to an area (Do remember to walk around, sometimes the level scrolls, or you need to walk to an edge to go to the next area...),  the ""eyeball"" will make Dan say some snarky comment about an object which may or may not help you, the ""hand"" picks up items or interacts with objects, the ""dialogue box"" will have Ben Talk to an object... even a wall or door (again, much to my amusement and frustration), lastly, Dan's head indicates you want DAN to do something.Throughout the game you'll pick up useful items, to see your inventory, bring your mouse cursor to the top of the screen and click on the Bindle to see your inventory. This is the menu which also lets you save load options and quit.Conclusion: The Selling point for this game is most certainly the humor. There are snarky comments made between Dan and Ben, there are reoccurring themes, self aware jokes, dark humor... what's not to love?The problem is... if you're like me and not gifted in the ways of point and click, or not patient enough to try everything with everything... You're prone to get frustrated or tired of playing. (If it get's really bad, pro tip there are guides to walk you through the game)


And then I told them to walk into the ladies bathroom 
Community Created Artwork for Ben There, Dan That!
By: Atratzu

			Oh excuse me, I mean the ""ladies loo"". ...or water closet. ANYWAY! the dialogue was very funny!		


I would discourage playing through exclusively with a guide though, because there's plenty of humor for just trying random stuff... Like trying to get Dan to touch Ben's bed. Or trying to use Dan with Lava, or Trying to use Scissors on the Bible...			"

												Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! are two short point and click games following the adventures of Ben and Dan. The gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a point and click; mainly, collecting stuff, combining stuff, and using stuff in other stuff.What makes this game stand out is its humour, which, although crude at times (cointaining what some people would consider obscene/offensive jokes), is full of references, and the dialogues tend to include some fourth-wall breaking moments. This is a game that doesn't take itself seriously, and it's very fun at that.The first game is Ben There, Dan That!, followed by Time Gentlemen, Please!; I'd recommend playing them in that order, as the intro alone to Time Gentlemen, Please! becomes hilarious after you've gone through the previous game.All in all, these are fun, short games.

												Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! Special Edition Double Pack Review - Raymond KTSummary: What’s worse than finding out that your future evil selves have set about a series of events that wipes out all human life on the planet? Going back in time to fix things with half a mind on preventing coathangers from ever being invented, and accidentally setting up an alternate-universe Hitler with an unstoppable army of dinosaur clones instead, that’s what! Whoopsie! [Zombie Cow Studios]British. Humor. Lots and lots of British humor. In a nutshell, that is the way Time Gentlemen, Please! can be explained. The game has relatively simple graphics and color schemes, and the music is also simplistic and not overwhelming in the slightest bit. The music actually doesn’t have much to overwhelm, because all of the dialogue must be read for yourself, so no clashing of the voices and music here! However, you must sift through many jokes in just about every dialogue session to read what you really need. Now, I don’t mind British humor one bit, but when you beat a dead cat so much that you can’t recognize that little ball of fur anymore as it blows away in the wind, that’s a bit much.This game is sure to delight some old-school gamers out there. But not my cup of tea "

												Clever dialogue, bad game.  Sure, at first I enjoyed the humor (to a point, it does get obnoxious) but the controls and gameplay are really bad, completely ruining an otherwise mediocre game.  Clicking on anything, whether to examine or use, causes the mouse to disappear and lock while it slowly shows a wall of text that must be clicked through.  You cannot undo this in any way, so you must sit and wait and scroll... a lot.  And if you click one extra time while scrolling (at the last click), then you must go through the process again.  Virtually everything you examine has a multi-phase text dialogue you must click through in this fashion.  So much time wasted.  There is also a right-click-fest required to go from ""eye"" to ""hand"" and back (buttons would be better).  Add to this very slow character movement, quite poor graphics and animation that could be from a middle school project (no offense), and a small non-resizable window.  The puzzles themselves are too simple and the interface is gamebreaking.			"

Ben There, Dan That! and Time Gentlemen, Please! are a pair of the earlier point-and-click games on Steam.Pros: HumorCons: Graphics, Sound, ControlsThese two low resolution protagonists, Ben and Dan, will somehow manage to save the world and be funny on their adventures, though not exactly in that order and probably not at the same time.  It helps to have some experience with British humor and vocabulary (an aerial is an antenna, for example).The graphics and sound are poor to say the least. Controls are no better; the majority of actions will be completed with the 'hand' yet it shares equal space with several less useful cursors.  Of course, the difficulty is inflated in typical point-and-click fashion (thermos on lava, it all makes sense!).  With the number and availability of free and high quality point-and-click games nowadays, these two have difficulty standing out.4/10			"

												The game wasn't really for me personally. Positive:-I appreciate alll the hardwork indie gamers/developers put into their works and the effort and ambition they pour into the tireless, ungrateful hours of their product.....having said that, it leads me toThe Negative:the point and click genre is done much much better in other games like sam and max and even something more recent as The Walking Dead by Telltale. The comedy of the game is very stale, tries and uses random humor as its niche but doesn't really do well with the jokes and content of that humor, although in all fairness, comedy is subjective, but damn it be all if im gonna subject my self to this very nonsensical point and click adeventure! On top of that, just playing through the first part of the game mechanics was already frustrating, as the pieces to the puzzle didnt really make any sense, nd i just ended up cliking places until i got something right, and then mixed another item with another object till it porgressed the story....which also doesn't make sense. Sorry guys, this wasnt for me, but please try again!			"

												As a guy named Ben in real life, I connected with these games on a personal level. These games perfectly simulate the average everyday life of anyone who is named Ben (and also Dan, but it's not nearly as immersive of an experience with him). That being said, these are the most entertaining point-and-click games I have ever played and there is plenty to enjoy in both of these games even if your name isn't Ben or Dan. 10/10 would Ben again.

Graphics are terrible. and just like many point and click games, you can gett stuck at a spot and not able to do what a walkthrough says and have no idea what tiny little step or interaction you missed at some point during the game that the dev decided you must do to proceed.

												""Time Gentlemen, Please!"" and ""Ben There, Dan That!"" are linear PnC adventure games that were written and designed by fans of most of the classics of the genre.  This is probably the ultimate fan tribute at the time of their release.  That all being said though, these games really don't constitute a real cash value.  Sorry fellas.  The graphics are incredibly simple.  The interactivity is minimal.  The humor is pretty flat.  The challenge lies only within pixel hunting.  If you are a real diehard fan of all PnC games, buy the pack for under a dollar, and be warned that your time will probably be wasted.  Thankfully they are pretty short in length.  Everybody else, just simply don't bother.  You can download much more entertaining PnC games for free elsewhere.			"

Granted, I'm not a real fan of the point-and-click action genre, but I just couldn't stand this one long enough to try and play through.  Pros:+Lightweight, I guess?+Small downloadCons:-RESOLUTION LOCKED TO 640x480!! What is this, 1995 or something?-Unintuitive interface-Tutorial is extremely minimal, once you manage to find it. I spent five minutes trying to figure out how to change items.Midrange:*Graphics aren't great (besides, who plays at 480p?!) I know it'sn ot the focus of the game, but i would at least want to be able to see it on my 1080p screen.*At said small resolution, items to collect are TINY. You have to be a ace-one mouse sniper to get them if you don't have a DPI switch button.Bottom line:It's great for free, but I wouldn't waste money on it. "

												Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That is an adventure game pack that has a very peculiar art direction as well as humor. Like many other games of this genre, the puzzles aren’t particularly hard but they are ridiculously arbitrary; more so in this game than in others. As a result, some players may have a hard time figuring out how to solve a problem because it’s not very obvious. The story is extremely over the top, one plot example is the main characters traveling to a different timeline to stop Hitler and his dinosaur army. The art appears to be very experimental, but does have a sense of style to it. That can be bad or good depending on what you consider art to be. The humor is very British and adult so unlike Sam & Max I can’t recommend this to children’s. Overall a good title to buy if you are hardcore in to the Adventure genre, for everyone else steer clear as you will likely not play this game beyond the intro menu.			"

												I've got to be honest, I only picked this up because of it's cheap sale price and the positive reviews.  For what I paid, this turned out to be a good bargain.  This package includes two point and click adventure titles.  While I enjoyed the first title more, both are still solid games.  These games were obviously crafted by people who have experienced the history of point and click adventures, as there are a lot of tongue-in-cheek jokes relating to this genre.  While the games were humorous and I had fun, neither of these games are particularly revolutionary and the backtracking can get repetitive.  In addition, they're obviously low budget affairs compared to other point and click adventure games on Steam.  If you can pick these games up for cheap when they're on sale I say go for it, otherwise there are better options for the price.  The first game I would give a 7.5 and the second game I would give a 6.5, so overall this package is a 7/10.			"

												I have separate reviews for both games included in the double packBen there, Dan That.This is a legitimately funny and great point and click game. Ben There, Dan That has the point and click elements you expect: inventory, combining items, interacting with NPC’s, puzzles. But it does this with really great humor. Throughout the game I was chuckling to myself at the dialogue between Ben, Dan and the characters. It was breaking the fourth wall a lot and poked fun at itself and the genre. I truly enjoyed playing this and wish it was longer. The art style is great and fits the story. The rough and wobbly animations of Ben and Dan walking around are hilarious. The puzzles are fairly easy to figure out and you won’t get stuck with anything. Change settings for best experience +Configure the game and use one of the the Hq2x or Hq3x graphics filters. It will let you choose a higher resolution.  Pros+Funny dialogue throughout+Art style+Puzzles are not difficult (this could be a con for some people depending on preferences)Cons+Not widescreen? For lovers of point and click games I would highly recommend this for a quick play through. It’s only about 4-5 hours long but filled with great references and humor. I believe I paid $1 for this in a double pack with Time Gentlemen, Please! So this is an incredible value. Final Score: 8/10Time Gentlemen, Please!The story picks up from what happened after Ben there, Dan that. You are trying to fix what happened to the world and stop Hitler from ruling the world. You are introduced to ""Time Warps"" which are just different levels of the game, which are in different time periods. You can fast travel between any of them at any time which is fantastic. There is also a Time Machine that can age and de-age certain items. This is a nice touch to get you thinking about what might work in there.The game mechanics, etc. are all the same.The puzzles, again, are fairly easy but I thought at some points it was a little harder than Ben there, Dan That. I unfortunately had to check a guide online very briefly to make sure I was at least on the right track in a few parts. I didn’t play these games back to back, but this one seems to have a lot more profanity in the text. Which is great! It would always catch me off guard when they would swear. This is just as funny as Ben there, Dan that. Pros+Same pros as Ben There, Dan That.+Longer than the other game.+Hitler story is unexpected and awesomeCons+No widescreen support that i saw. Not a big deal+Found myself stuck doing the ""using everything with everything"" more often than the last game.Taking my time through this game and getting slowed down several times, I logged 13 hours. Which is much longer than Ben There, Dan That. I can’t complain! 7/10 Good			"

												Love comedic point-and-click adventures from the days of yore? Are you a fan of (slightly naughty) British humour? Then these games are definitely for you. They're cheap too, and you get two games for the price of one.The story is suitably nonsensical: the second game involves Hitler controlling an army of mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex, a suicidal robotic AI and a whole bunch of time-travelling hi-jinks.Unlike most low-budget adventure games; a lot of effort has been expended on making every possible interaction with the game world produce some sort of humorous commentary (with the occasional ""breaking of the 4th wall"").The first game, ""Ben There, Dan That!"", is technically free from the developer's website (feel free to give it a try), but considering the dwindling quality of adventure games in the modern era, I believe that any true fan should be able to contribute a few € or $ in support of hilarious, quality indie adventures.In retrospect, this sounds like a sales-pitch XD.

												Ben There, Dan That is a lot of things.It's ugly, truthfully. It's crude (in many senses of the word), definitely. It's locked into a tiny resolution, puzzlingly. It's paying homage to its roots, certainly. It's poking fun at pop culture and specific events, absolutely. It's short, unfortunately.If you can get past the presentation and all its warts, and you have a bit of a warped sense of humour, you'll probably find more than a fair share of chuckles (or at least smiles) within this game. I do stress that it is s a love letter to classic adventure games, right down to the occasionally frustrating puzzles. Know the genre, and know this game. If you don't like point and clickers, and all that they stand for, you'd best pass.-----Time Gentlemen, Please! is what would happen if LucasArts made an adventure game adaptation of a Bill and Ted movie written and directed by Edgar Wright. What more needs to be said?More than BTDT, Time Gentlemen, Please! is a proper, fleshed-out game. It looks better, is polished, has a stronger narrative, is funnier, and... well, it's better. Not that BTDT is bad, but TGP is great.I do think that the puzzles can be a bit... Sierra at times, but thankfully Ben and Dan humorously remark on that, haha.The games are available for dirt cheap, but adventure game fans should find value even at full price. I certainly did.			"

												These are short, darkly humored tributes to point-and-click adventure games of the past, such as the SCUMM games of the early 90's.  It pays to be familiar with those games when you play this.  The British humor (humour?) might not be the most accessible, but the absurdity is funny enough (nazi dinosaurs and such).  There is nothing in these games to take seriously, and that is refreshing.  I won't give these games 5 stars out of 5, because the humor does lose its charm if you play too long, they are kind of short, and they managed to perfectly capture the tedium of point-and-click games a little too well.  But if you like your humor dry, silly, and crude, and have enjoyed adventure games in the past, it's worth checking out.			"

												Highly recommended! Although the first one is pretty short, it gets you started on the whole story and shouldn't be skipped. The puzzles were pretty entertaining (I think I only got really stuck once, so they're not too hard, but they aren't all dumb puzzles) and the humour is great! Buy it now!			"

												Short, but fun pack. There are some puzzles that will make you use that brain of yours.  I like the stories in them, a little humour, even the graphics. the music is also nice :D The problems i had were the length of the game (second one you can beat in one-two days or even shorter if you know what you're doing) and that one time where i had to restart the game because I glitched in the cutscene.  Also Lack of soundtrack to download. Maybe a minor complain, but I do enjoyed the tunes in those games and would love to hear them outside the game. Still a good pack to get on sale.			"

												I've only played Ben There, Dan That! so far, but I'm guessing the quality is similar across the two games.  And that quality level is very, very high.  This is a fun, funny, and well-considered nod to the  first generation of adventure games.  In fact, in terms of the writing, it's better than quite of a few of the oldies.  The banter between Ben and Dan is consistently amusing, occasionally hilarious, and always very snappy.  Outside of that, the game is like a grown-up version of all the games of old.  You get into some relatively adult situations, with a lot of amoral behavior, including a few murders, but it somehow remains totally light.  Absolutely recommended for any veteran adventure gamer.

												Ben There, Dan That and Time Gentlemen, Please! are two typical indie point & click adventure games that try to bring back the atmosphere of the old wacky LucasArts titles with a large dose of British humour. And it’s not just a gut feeling: the games are full of references and easter eggs about titles such as Sam & Max, Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle and all other loved classics.The first game was originally released as a freeware, and like most of the freeware adventure games, it’s more of a showcase of the writing and game design capabilities of the two creators, not a full game. Still, the story works in its own completely absurd way, the places you visit are designed well, and the puzzles are sometimes hard, but not too difficult. And it’s one of the few adventure games where item usage does not equal the main protagonist robbing every person blind, the items come from very logical sources. (Well, mostly.)The sequel was made as a commercial game and the developers really wanted to give as much as they got. And the problem is that they gave too much. The story takes a very drastic turn in Time Gentlemen, Please, and in the end it becomes too convoluted even for the writers. The puzzles start as quite challenging and I the end they reach almost impossible levels. In the meanwhile the trademark absurd humour start to fade slowly to give room to the increasingly complex plot.But the game has saving graces, and mostly in the main ideas behind the different time periods, where the developers constructed the most far-fetched, zaniest alternative timelines you can see outside of Doctor Who. And all of those are featured in Day of the Tentacle-like four-dimensional puzzles of course.To sum it up, these games – particularly the first one – are excellent for those who love British humour and still hold a special place in their hearts for the LucasArts adventure library. And if you like a good challenge in brain-twisting puzzles, then all the better.But if you don’t like games where some puzzles remind you of Gabriel Knight 3, or absurd humour is not your cup of tea (or pint of ale), then you will find very little enjoyment in these two.

												Ben There, Dan That! [FINISHED] is a point and click adventure game made by a British indie team. The constant British dialect and references make this a great game to play for anyone that is British and the game itself is also very humours and brings a smile to one's face.The game follows Ben and Dan, two best friends who go on an interesting adventure; the story is amusing to play though and has lots of surrealism throughout.The problem with this game is that this is a difficult point and click and the graphics are pretty poor. Because of this gameplay and the visuals I cannot recommend this game and the other elements of this game do not make up for it.Time Gentlemen, Please! [DID NOT FINISH] is essentially more of the same but it has nicer (still not great) graphics and it's gameplay is slightly more fluid and improved.6/15 - ""Interesting, but ugly and difficult to play.""

												Quirky art style aside, the game is simply overload with crazy♥♥♥♥♥humorous filled dialogue. This is one game you wanna play just for the sake of the dialogue. Personally though I almost skipped this as I couldn't for the life get pass the first puzzle (fact is it's logical as hell but I am just missing something). But a quick google search for the missing manual and a quick flip, you are good to go. It would have been better if they included the instructions in game but considering it's age...well. Despite it's shortcomings, not working with steam overlay, weird resolutions and such, it is worth it for the sake of reading those dialogue (try interacting with everything!). This is one game that doesn't take itself seriously. From the start, you are already shoving a firecracker up your dead pal's (Dan)♥♥♥♥♥to 'reanimate' him! You play as Ben with Dan (your reanimated pal) following you everywhere. You are also able to 'control' Dan by the 'D' key (google the manual) too.			"

												Ben There, Dan That is another Point&Click (...AGAIN?! BUT IT WAS SO CHEAP IT WAS PRATICALLY FREE) that has a whole well of humor, they search to the bottom of that well, and bring good laughs to the heart and then some, only some because of that sweet ending. One could say references are abudant in this pocket adventure (very much pocket), but who knows and who cares, it all works. Much like the graphics as well. The good ol' days of Flash (it is flash right?) are.......flash. The only beef to contend with is lack of music and voice acting from Dan and Ben themselves. Oh well. And the puzzles are fun50 CENT'S THOUGH!?			"

												With the revitalization of P.O.C. adventure games, we are given a game that harks back to the oldschool style. How does it hold out?Story- Ben and Dan are two programmers (both real people who put themselves in their own games) who must go on an epic quest in order to catch reruns of Magnum P.I. On the way, they are kidnapped by aliens bent on world domination and so Our intrepid heroes must travel through the very fabric of space and reality in a race against time to save the world and catch old 80's sicoms. In the sequel, a week has past since the end of the world so Dan and Ben now find themselves traveling through time to fix everything (making things worse actually) and try to stop Hittler and his unstoppable robo-dino army from ruling the world. As you can see, the story is as rediculous as can be but then again, it is a commedy. The humor of the game and its story may not be for everyone but any fan of Monty Python-style humor will get a kick out of this game. C+Graphics- The graphics have a rather charming appeal that grows on you, and what I mean by that is that it looks like the microsoft paint doodle of a 15 year old kid when he is board. The animation of the characters are almost non-exsistent. But the enviroments are varied and do draw you in wanting to know what you will see next. Like I said, it does grow on you. D+Sound- There is vertually no sound effects in the game and music is sparse but what music there is is quite fun to listen to and reminicient of the old 8-bit days. CGameplay- The game follows a simple P.O.C. format and you can interact with nearly anything with anything for humorous effect. It does kinda get annoying when you have to scroll your mouse through a number of command points (look, talk, touch, etc.) and if you accidentally past the command you want, you have to scroll through everything again so it would have been nice for a reverse scroll to be available. The challege of the game itself is actually very fair, as in not too easy (via Telltale) and not too hard (via Lucas Arts), and is quite fun to explore the different resposes to different actions and very rewarding even if you don't get it right.B+Overall- This game is obviously not for everyone. But it is an absolute blast to play and one of the funniest games to play. Highly recommended. C			"

												Do NOT, under any circumstances, get the idea in your head that these games are at all appropriate for children based on the graphics. I could imagine someone doing so, and want to warn against it right now. These games are strictly for teens and up, with profanity, adult humor (including sexual references), and mild violence. They are also quite amusing for what they are, so I definitely recommend them for the target audience.The only downside is one that is shared by many such games, in that many of the puzzles make zero sense, requiring either a great deal of random guessing or the use of a guide to get through the games. Yet, at least in these games, the randomness fits. The entire storyline is so absurd to begin with that it's actually all to be expected in this case. Regardless, the real appeal here is the British humor, the adult level of the story, and the crazy storyline. It being a point and click game is really just a means to an end in order to convey all of that to the player. I've definitely been entertained, so it works well.			"

However, this game is short... not really that funny or imaginative. 2 hours of OK time spent until completion. Time Gentlemen is even worse, starting off promising but ending in such random solutions to simple problems. Hats off to those of you which find the solutions easily, but I found that difficult to the point of zero fun. If you absolutely LOVED sam and max original, this game is likely for you.

												There are excellent games hidden behind the awful controls of these games. The humor is funny enough, but you need to click for the most basic things like walking across a room way too much to change the cursor, access Inventory and such. Maybe modern times made me lazy, but I recall that I didn't like this control scheme on the old Sierra games back in the day either which is why I barely finished any of them. I have the same issue with these games and not finishing them either. A verb menu or context-sensitive cursors would've helped alot here. On the upside, these kind of controls allow for some funny additional dialogue and obscure attempts that are absent in most modern games.If you can look past the controls (I can't), you will find a strange and funny game that you might enjoy - and it's plenty 'o cheap to buy too!

												""Ben There, Dan That!"" (BTDT) and ""Time Gentlemen, Please!"" (TGP) are two connected point & click adventures. The former's shorter, just an intro to the other which offers more of everything. To summarize, both games feature:- ""retro"" graphics (as seen in the screenshots) and everything that comes with it (like shoddy, sparse animation)- no voice acting, just text- sort of unfriendly controls- lots and lots of puzzles, which are sometimes non-sensical and/or require some pixel hunting- crude, morbid and politically incorrect humor... in combination with the visual aesthetics this creates an odd contrast of cartoony lighthearted presentation for otherwise hard R material- about 10-15 hours of gameplay in total, depending on how often you get stuckDespite the flaws, the humor and the crazy story make this worthwhile. I found both BTDT and TGP to my liking, and would recommend them - but buy ONLY if you can accept the humor, as it is the focal point of these games!			"

												Ben/Dan is a short and easy point-and-click adventure game, an obvious homage to Sam and Max Hit the Road and a work of love with lots of flavour text. Time Gentlemen is the sequel to Ben/Dan, and it's essentially a many times longer romp with harder puzzles, with the ""giggling like an idiot"" factor intact.  The sense of humour in these games oscillates through juvenile weirdness, references and meta jokes.I recommend them both. >:)			"

												Tedious.  BTDT and TGP have been sitting in my games list since the 2012 summer sale and I finally looked at them and though ""I should really play at least one so I didn't waste the money.""  Unfortunately now I feel like all I've accomplished was to throw a few hours of time after that money.  I've only played BTDT and as another negative review stated that it is the better of the two, I'll pass on TGP.  I quite liked the artwork in BTDT, and that's the only good thing I can think to say about it.  Beyond the artwork, there is nothing to take hold of.  You are in charge of two characters, whose differences seem to boil down to:- one is a slob and one is tidy (the only time this comes up is when you view their bedrooms, which is about 30 seconds of gametime, and leads to nothing)- one has slightly darker hair than the other- one wears an outfit referencing one popular 80s movie franchise, the other wears an outfit referencing a different popular 80s movie franchiseI played the entire game and I still can't tell you which was Ben and which was Dan.  The characters, as demonstrated above, give you nothing to grab hold of.  In fact, other than ""because two people made it and they bot hwanted to be in it"", there seems no reason to even have two characters.  One tags along making comments about tagging along, and does nothing the main character couldn't have done himself.  The 'banter' was overflowing with references and fourth-wall breaking comments, none of which were actually funny and seemed more like they'd just been put there to fill up a word quota.  Quite honestly, it reminded me of my time spent managing others in the food service industry - guiding a couple of interchangeable slackers with a 12 year old's sense of humor, whose only driving motivation in life is to get home and watch TV, through tedious task after tedious task in mindnumbing detail.  Only at least in the food service industry I was getting paid to do it.The story was no better.  If you're interested in the game, stop now if you don't want to know the ending, but quite honestly... it's not going to spoil a thing for you to know what happens.  One starts out needing to repair the tv antenna so they can watch 80s TV.  Hardly motivating, but surely it will pick up?  Not exactly.  They are kidnapped by aliens and spend a lot of time getting back only to find the aliens are themselves and have set them up for world domination.  The story ends with Ben and Dan being world leaders.  That's it.  If you think I've lied and spoiled everything, you're wrong - this isn't stuff you find out as the game progresses.  No, the entire game is spent with the aliens making vague references about ""the plan"" and the last 2 minutes of the game is a cut scene where the story is told entirely in the age-old method of ""tell, don't show"".  The rest of the game is just the failed humor and ""combine things until something works.""Other complaints:- there appears to be no option to mute (at least turning down sound effects did nothing for me, and that's the only option given), and the music is midi-like and *really* repetitive.- the 'following' one would frequently stand in front of what I needed to click, meaning a few attempts at clicking only to get another variation on stop trying to pick him up/I don't want to touch him/whatever dialogue- there was a very weird problem with the 'cow' door where clicking on it would lead to a tedious scene where both characters would walk all the way to the opposite end of the hallway and then back again before entering.  There is no way to speed up the characters' walking speeds or 'skip' walking scenes.  Which means if you miss a few items in the previous rooms, you're going to be spending a lot of time watching that hallway go by in both directions.			"

												If you don't have this game, buy it. Seriously.It's a pretty simple point and click puzzle adventure game. Okay, cool. But what really lets it shine is the humor. It has tons of jokes, puns, Sci-Fi references (along with other references too!), dinosaurs, Nazi dinosaurs, Britishness, etc. Ben There, Dan That is the first game, and I found it shorter than the sequel. I think it took me somewhere between an hour to three hours to beat the first time? I can't really remember. I'm almost done with the second (Time Gentlemen, Please!), and I have over six hours in that one. As I play the game I can't help but examine, talk to, and otherwise interact with everything on the screen. The creators really don't hold back the punches here; the characters will comment about almost everything! The puzzles are very creative and I always get a rush of satisfaction (and usually a laugh) when I figure them out.So in a nutshell, it's a fun and hilarious point and click puzzle adventure game that is well worth the price.Now I have to run off and figure out how to beat Hitler and save the world.

 Ben There, Dan That A fun, quirky, goofy point and click romp throughout alternate dimensions. First, the gameplay: your controls are the usual point-and-click fare, no surprises. You have an inventory of objects you find along the way that you use to accomplish specific goals- and almost any of these objects can interact with one another, either to make something useful, or to get a remark from Dan about how stupid the combination you just tried is. There's trees and subtrees and subsubtrees of interactive dialogue with characters you meet along the way. You may also interect with literally everything in your environment, too. Basically if you can see it, the developers wrote an action for it.Style is very cartoony, but fun. Don't be looking for top-end graphics here, it's quite choppy! I personally feel like this just adds to the silly, goofy feel. Character design is pretty standard for Dan and Ben, but some other characters you meet are pretty funky looking.The game constantly makes one-liners or jokes. It's very tongue-in-cheek, and they break the 4th wall all the time. I promise some of these things will literally have you laughing out loud at least once. Funny dialogue, funny situations, funny level designs... the whole game is one giant cheesy gag and it's fantastic.The one con Ihave to say against this game is it's length. It was over far too quickly and left me wanting more. Luckily there is... Time, Gentlemen, Please! A continuation of the first game with even more exploration, interactivity, and fleshed out story arc. Much longer than BTDT, too. Everything good about the first game is in here too, but better. Some of the puzzles are *really* hard in this game, miles beyond anything in  the first. They also added a time element that involves crisscrossing timelines and seeing alternate versions of people and places.Two thumbs up. Buy it. For an even sweeter deal, get it on sale. You won't regret it.			"

												In this not so clique-y but definitely clicky adventure game, you find Dan and Ben in a situation already being wrapped up: with Ben (the one in the Marty McFly puffy vest) putting the finishing touches on his plan to reanimate his dead buddy Dan (the one in the Indiana Jones jacket). Not sooner do they finish this adventure off and reach their flat do they get zapped into another adventure. These two characters know very well they are point-and-click adventure players, and the humor is based on this notion. While I didn't really laugh out loud at the dialogue, the script is quite clever. The puzzles are challenging without being too nonsensical, and the music is (when there is any - don't expect a score to follow you the whole game) is enjoyable. If you're a fan of Hugo's House of Horrors and LucasArts point-and-clicks you might like this game.			"

The puzzles aren't that hard but the game itself does make fun at the adventure genre but nothing quite to bend your grey matter muscles.

												If you're a fan of Point & Click adventure games, particularly the LucasArts games, I think you'll enjoy playing these two. The first, ""Ben There, Dan That"" is not great, suffering from a lot of linearity, but it was still fun enough to play through, and definitely worth playing as a preface to ""Time Gentlemen, Please"". This one had more polished writing, better puzzles, and felt more open than the predecessor. After the opening stages of the game, there are a lot of paths of exploration and puzzles available to be solved. I did get stuck a few times, but on all but one of them I was able to figure out the solution after taking a break from the game. One puzzle I did have to look up a walkthrough for, but it was only because what I thought was one game-object was actually two, and I needed to click on the ""second"" one.On the whole these were fun for me to play through, with many good puzzles and few bad ones.Two things that may impact your enjoyment of the game. The humour is quite crude. If that's not your bag, then I think you'll find the writing grating. It's also quite a self-aware and self-referential game, which some people can't stand.			"

												Well, I can officially say that I've used Hitler's bloody feces as an intergral tool in a video game. So there's that.Time Gentlemen, Please is the sort of point-and-click adventure throwback that gives you a bunch of ridiculous items and asks you to find practical uses for them. Unlike a lot of the classics I thought the solutions to puzzles were genuinely clear and the few times I got stuck I felt like it was my own fault for not trying something obvious.  There are enough puzzles that need you to find out a specific way to use an item rather that just using it in the right spot so it doesn't feel like a case of just using everything on eveything else until you stumble on the solution. On the whole it's on the easier side as far as these games go.The writing in the game is more the star of the game than anything else. It's a pleasant change of pace if you get sick of adventure games that simply repeat ""I can't do that"" for everything that isn't solution related.  Attempting to combine most items or use them with most things in the world will give you unique dialogues for each action. Often with little hints towards solutions hidden in them. The humor alternates between referencing classic adventure games and toilet humor. At first it's pretty funny to examine random items and get rewarded with♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes, but it wears a little thin by the end and if you're new to adventure games all the references will probably fly over your head. It's definitely has an intended audience that will find it hilarious and the rest will probably scratch their heads. Overall I thought the jokes and one-liners were funny way more often than not, just by the sheer volume of them it's a little tiring by the end.Also I'm not a fan of having to click through the different look/talk/use/move options, I'd rather be able to select the one I want, but it's not horrible by adventure game standards, just frustrating after a while.Ben There, Dan That is also included in the package. It was a freebie game that was the blueprint for Time Gentlemen, Please. It's much shorter, but it still has the same mechanics and clever writing. The puzzles are pretty one-dimensional though though.			"

												If you suffered through EGA and VGA, then you know the games these pay homage to. There were others, to be sure, but the Lucasarts adventure games were the pinacle of the genre. They were the only ones to be genuinely funny - Telltale can kiss my♥♥♥♥♥♥  Now, these are the funniest, and you get them both for the price of a tape from the high-street video shop circa 1989.

												Where most adventure games have charm and silly object interactions, TGP! has it non-stop. It smoothly and consistently breaks the 4th wall, and does not sacrifice humor to vulgarity, but uses it to enchance the humor instead. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Racism"" slider in the options. How could you say no to that?!This game does something amazingly right that I've never seen any other adventure game do - it continues to be funny and interesting even when you're stuck. There is dialog for almost every object and item interaction; the normally annoying job of trying to use every object with every other object is actually RECOMMENDED in this game. It really is no exaggeration when I say it has literally 10x more dialog than even the most verbose adventure games. Do start with Ben There, Dan That! though. It is simple and short (~2 hrs), and you'll quickly see the humor this series employs.4 out of 5 foxes.			"

												In short: Blunt, Funny, Witty, Smart. a Classic! Give these a shot!I have reached these games by complete chance. The depth of them and the similarity I felt to a game type I almost forgot surprised me, and left me wanting to come back to play every time off I took a time off. Hell, I got bored with other games after having another taste of a real quest game!Both games have a unique atmoshpere, which makes me feel how some good old adventure games I still remember made me feel.The dialogue is very funny, the puzzles are sophisticated, and solving them gives the same old satisfaction of a complex riddle being cracked. Reminds me of my favorite quests, such as Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, and competes with them easily and fairly.Some scenes are so tough, they leave you wandering for a while, trying to 'get' what the solution is, sometimes even what the puzzle is!These games are hard in a good way, in which using the brain in a different way (or a hind guide) is a must.This game is a modern rebirth of the classic quest genre. Recommended for everyone, specifically for those who know they like quests already, but also for those who don't - and will find out about it soon.			"

												The operative word for these games is crude. The sketchy artstyle matches the humor: gross, awkward, unpredictable. One moment you're digging through dinosaur boogers, the next you're collecting samples from Hitler's toilet. Your reaction to those two examples will probably give you a good sense of whether you will find the jokes appealing.What's underneath the crudity is a lovingly rendered, shockingly well-executed pastiche of the best LucasArts adventures. The comedic timing in these games was carefully studied at the foot of Monkey Island, and the inventory puzzles call back to the most infuriating moments of Day of the Tentacle. The puzzles in both games can be extremely challenging, but none of the solutions go into cat-mustache territory -- every puzzle makes sense within the world's twisted logic, and most seem obvious in retrospect once you tease out the solution. The size of your inventory helps push you towards reasoning out solutions instead of trying everything on everything else (though the volume of funny responses will maybe push you to do that anyway.) Finishing each game gives you that deep feeling of smug satisfaction, which is really the highest recommendation for a point & click.Also, these games are probably way underpriced because each would have individually stood as a full-price, 6+ hour adventure game back in the 90s and you get both for one low, low price.

												Fun and relaxing adventure with enjoyable protagonists. Lots of text, sharp lines and meta-jokes - the characters make fun of their own pixel-ish ugliness and game behavior, there are references to other oldschool adventures and genre traditions. A noteable amount of foul language, and characters some may not like to see (Hitler), but it all remains parody. Some interesting puzzles, especially when the time travel comes into play requiring you to think in the fourth dimension. You get to combine a few dozen items too - just like the old times.			"

												If you look up ""lazy"" in the dictionary, you'll probably find out that it says ""whoever made this game."" (I'm actually not sure because I haven't checked.) In any case, if the two typos in the title haven't given it away already, these guys didn't spend any time on this thing. First of all, it's not 3D, and I don't mean it's not ""works with your nVidia 3D vision monitor"" 3D (which it also isn't), I mean it's just flat, like the reading on a heart rate monitor hooked up to a dead child. Second, all the words are in writing, and I don't mean they're written down in the game's script, which I guess is okay, but I mean they're not voiced! You have to read with your eyes! Lame. Third, this game lacks a cover system and in this day and age that is inexcusable. Fourth, this game claims to be an adventure game, when really it is an adventure LAME. Or something. Don't ask me, I'm not a word person. I'm an ACTION MAN.Fifth, this game is very cheap, which probably means it's bad.			"

Although separate games, they really should be treated and played as one single long adventure since Time Gentlemen, Please! is an immediate sequel to the much shorter Ben There, Dan That!

												If you're a fan of witty, funny adventure games, you can't get much better than this indie pack.  The writing is always sharp and the puzzles will rarely involve huge leaps in logic, unlike some other games.  Plus you can't beat the price!""Ben There, Dan That"" is the smaller of the two that takes place directly before ""Time Gentlemen Please!"", so you want to play that first.			"

												A great fun adventure game. It brilliantly lampoons the point and clicks of the nineties whilst retaining the charm that made them great. Amusingly sarcastic and crude and amazing attention to detail in that even when you use the wrong things there seems to be a dialogue line for everything. No stock ""that won't work answers"". Also, it's stupidly cheap so everyone should buy it, maybe then Dan will make a third part.			"

Pretty much just like you remember your old days though, before games were all talkie AND moving pictures: no spoken dialogue.  It's an indie game with a limited budget.  But if you skipped through the devil-talk out of the compute-box anyway because you could read faster, then you have no excuse for not giving them money.Also in their next game you run around people's genitals fighting STDs.

It's not a very long adventure, or a terribly difficult one (interracting with every single thing in every single way, the game still only took me 5 hours to beat), but you get this AND the sequel for $5.

Posted: September 23, 2012
												These are both very fun little games.  I've started looking into highly-regarded indie games, and these two came up in a search.The games focus very heavily on absurdist humour, and the wacky interplay between the two protagonists.  The two characters are really the two game designers who made the game, so Time gentlemen please starts out in Ben's apartment while they're watching TV.    Dan accidentally sets in motion a very fun point-and-click adventure where you have to perfom some ridiclous acts in a variety of very strange locations.The Point-and-Click mechanic is very standard fare: all the items you need are found in the area where you use them.  You have to use all the items (usually) to proceed to the next area.  All irrelevant items are usually ditched, to avoid confusion.   There was almost no time I was completely stumped.  The game doesn't rely on cheap tricks like making one pixel of the screen a clickable object, or require you to go back to somewhere where something which wasn't clickable, now IS clickable,  due to totally unrelated things (I'm looking at you, Day of the Tentacle).  In actual fact, the puzzles are really well put together.If you can get over the hilarously amateurish animation of Ben and Dan as their crazy legs stagger them across the screen, what you'll find is a great game where your main reward for trying X on Y is a piece of sarcastic wit hurled at you, or Dan. Some of the take-downs are so cutting you end up feeling sorry for poor Dan.  But he knows he's a bit rubbish and plays along with it.These games are pretty cut-price, but inasumch as they stand toe-to-toe with some of the early PaC adventures, like Monkey Island, these two games are simply excellent fun, with great writing.I can't recommend them enough.  They don't take to long to play through, and can really give you some good laughs.			"

												Jack rabbits that aren't actually named jack out of carpets that are never shampooed.I love reading the dialogue of these games. Very funny, but I sucked at this game. It might just be me but i could not solve half of these puzzles. If you want to play a game that will make you laugh then go ahead by them. If you want a game with hard puzzles that just are more ridiculous then you actually think they should be then go ahead and pick up this game. I wouldn't personally recommend this game, but hey two games for one price is always a good deal. So I'll give it a thumb up, but be warned if you are not witty. On the other hand there are great walkthroughs online. If you would like to read just the dialogue there are a few videos on YouTube of this game so you can get the humor from there and maybe save yourself the frustration.			"

												Does anyone genuinely miss old school adventure games? Moon logic puzzles, constantly clicking, looking for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t slightly different coloured pixel, instant deaths. I played a lot of these games as a child and they were certainly instrumental in my formative years but the idea of investing all that time and effort at this age is unimaginable.TGP&BTDT at least gives you the items you need to solve problems and doesn't throw out much in the way of red herrings but it doesn't really stop the game from devolving into ""rub two items together, or on item on something until you get the solution"". It doesn't help that the control scheme also implements the old grab/talk/look interaction system which you have to painstakingly cycle through using the right mouse button.The final nail in the coffin is the atrocious dialogue and humour: 4th wall breaking, 90's tyle edginess that your 15-year old self would have loved. It's tedious and awful.Credit where credit is due I guess for releasing an adventure game when they were unofficially dead but adhering so closely to the tropes of previous years and the embarrassingly bad writing makes these games entirely unplayable.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												Warning: These games contain laughs and brain warming puzzles. At certain times of the year a general sensation of smugness can be had due an even cheaper price. It is not recommended to play while attempting to become pregnant although in certain cases it has been proven to increase your attractiveness.Don't know what 'point and click' adentures are like? Here's a tutorial. Point to 'Add to Cart', Click, point to 'purchase', Click. Congrats you now own two great games. Rewarding huh? :)			"

												This is a humor based point and click adventure.  The game is all puzzles and finding funny dialog.  A good chunk of the games puzzles do not make sense.  After a while you start to realize you must just go around causing generalized chaos to beat some of the levels.  I basically beat it mostly offline at work during breaks over a couple of weeks.  Its a decent point and click adventure because of the humor.			"

												Ben There, Dan That! and Time Gentlemen, Please! are both funny short point-and-click adventure games.I found them very similar in humor to the monkey island games, it's really silly, even if it feels forced at times, but I loved it.Being this ultra cheap I'd say you're not losing anything if you try it out			"

												I don't even know how to start talking about these two games... These two make a hilarious and most insane adventure I've even gone through. Really crazy plot, unusual solutions, jokes all the time.Some of the crazy things you do involve:* shoving fireworks up the butt* accidental killing* messing up the time line, changing history causing Hitler to search for a golden coathanger as an item of power with the aid of an army of dinosaurs* fooling a mouse to sex an inanimate object* a lot more I can't tell to avoid spoiling too muchBoth these games are packed with inappropriate humour and some delightfully wrong situations. They're stuffed with lots of funny dialogues between the two main characters and contain countless of references to popular culture, mostly other games from the genre. They constantly break the fourth wall. Generally the best parody games ever, they made me laugh hard so many times. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												Time Gentlemen, Please! and Ben There, Dan That! is the sequel to Ben There, Dan That!, so if you have played that title you have a general idea of what to expect from this one.  Basically it is an adventure game with intentionally ludicrously bad graphics and surprisingly good audio and music.  Widecsreen modes are not supported, but the Steam Overlay works fine.  Whether or not you like the game will come down to the appeal that the rather sophmoric humor has to you because the actual gameplay and puzzles are usually fairly simple.  The developers should be commended for making an easy icon based control scheme that doesn't require a lengthy tutorial to learn, as well as for daring to break convention by mixing high res effects with the ugliest sprites I have ever seen.  Lastly, this game, like it's predecessor is very cheap so it's not much of a risk to buy it and try it out.  I would recommend this game to the adventurous.			"

												Ben There, Dan That and Time Gentlemen, Please! are true Lucas Arts style games.  While Ben There, Dan That betrays its orgins as a free tribute to adventure games in its sometimes uneven puzzle pacing, it manages to overcome those origins through the often hilarious banter and its attention to fine detail. My ongoing recommendation in both of these games is to click on everything with everything multiple times.   Time Gentlemen, Please! in contrast is one of the most refreshing and inovative adventure games to come out in recent years, not only is it massively polished but its puzzles manage to simultaneously pay homage to the great adventure games of the past and to genuinely surprise.  Compared to the often overly ornate, plodding, and cumbersome modern adventures of Daedalic and King Art, these games are a breeze and a joy to play.			"

												Oh neat !!! Another steam sale, this game is super cheap... I wonder if i should buy it? Well the answer I give to you, is a resounding NO !!! (Wait... you didn't play this long enough to give a fair review !!! -> Offline Mode)This game tasks you to ""figure out"" how to advance by providing random tools or having you find/pick them up. You then need to figure out where to use/take these tools. I really did try my best to play this and enjoy it, but it essentially breaks down to a cheap flash game which forces you to click on everything and removes any possibility of an educated choice. Not a type of game I enjoy playing. It really removes the feel of it having a ""puzzle"" to solve.			"

												While this is widely regarded as one of the best modern Adventure games (an old dead genre from the 1990s), with passable graphics and a fun quirky set of gameplay, technical laziness prevents a thumbs up.The game runs in windowed mode whether you like it or not, there's no evident full screen option making the entire experience unpleasant - it's simply not up to the calibre expected of a modern PC game.

With tongue firmly in cheek, sit back, relax, and put your mind to work solving puzzles, and reading some very funny dialogue. It's like a book, only good!From an horrific and untimely death in deep, dark Peru, via preposterous-and-suspect alien invasions, to whipping back-and-forth in time to stop Hitler and his army of robot Nazi dinosaur clones, this is one set of adventures you're unlikely to forget.

You'll probably ragequit when you can't figure out what should be the simplest of puzzles, but when you get back to it and figure the puzzle out you'll realize it didn't really make much sense at all so your ragequit was justified.

												Ben There, Dan That! captures all that was fun and funny from the best of the Lucas Arts adventure games. It is most closely related to the original Sam and Max but it has a bit of Zak McKracken in there too (all of classics really).  The humor is adult and edgy but also goofy and fun.  Don't let the graphics fool you, they quickly seem to fit the syle and humor.  The music seems to remind me of goofy Sam and Max tunes.  There is enough to explore around and hunt for funny dialogue events (they wrote unique dialogue for almost all object/verb/subject combos).  The puzzles are just hard enough to be interesting.  I haven't played Time Gentlemen yet but I'm sure its good too.  *Warning* the game is written from a british point of view, which I think is a really good thing but you might not agree. Ten thumbs up on this easily overlooked game.			"
