												214 Games in my library as of this writing. While I've regretted buying some of them, NONE of them hit me like this one. $40 down the drain. If it's ever on sale for $5...DON'T BUY IT! Let me just state that I'm one of the biggest Dead Island fans on the planet. Spent much of my life playing DI 1 and Riptide on consoles and PC. So I essentially bought the games twice each with no regrets. I've even spent plenty of hours on DI.E. So yea, I'm a fan of the franchise, but this installment is starting to make me question Deep Silver (something I NEVER thought I would do). Why they would let the Dead Island name go to crap like this and actually publish something like this is beyond my understanding.Graphics/Sound: Looks like it was meant for tablets and smart phones. The voice acting is so bad, it's impossible to even try and immerse yourself.Contols: Combat is terrible, stealth is terrible, gunplay is terrible. It's all just terrible.Story: I could not bring myself to finish this game. I tried and tried and pushed through as much as I could. Aside from the technical side of things being sub par, the story itself is anything but enticing. I wanted to know the origins of the virus, but not like this. I'd rather not know than waste any more time on this...""game"".You've been warned, Dead Island fan or not, stay away from this one.			"

												I love Zombie games, and although I have DI and DI:R in my library, I decided to give this one a shot before the others. Yes, I've read the negative reviews, and decided check it out myself. It has often been noted (negatively) that this is not an Open World game, and for that reason, it's a bad game. Well, Resident Evil and Silent Hill weren't Open World, either. A lot of backtracking was involved with those games. Did those excellent titles suddenly become bad games? No, I don't think so. Yes, EDA is quite linear whereas RE and SH were quite complex. But you know what - I enjoyed it nonetheless. There's a lot to be discovered if you leave the designated path. I'm still struggling with two achievements. Another criticism that has been noted is that there's no multiplayer option. Folks, this is an action adventure with a fixed storyline. It's 100% focused on telling a background story, just like good old adventure titles. Could you imagine a multiplayer Monkey Island? This story is Cliff-centric. Introducing other playable characters just wouldn't make sense. As I said, I haven't played the other titles yet (but I will) and as such don't know how the game blends in with the series, but as a standalone, linear, Metroidvania-style action adventure, it is good entertainment. Maybe I'm biased because I paid 5 bucks when it was on sale. Anyway, I enjoyed it!			"

												Escape Dead Island is a spin off title of the Dead Island franchise, but will this be worth your time ?Escape Dead Island takes place after the events of the first Dead Island game. We play as Cliff. Him and his two friends Linda and Devan travel to a island Narapela to discover what happened in Banoi.The game takes a different approach in the story telling department. The story takes center stage and it adds mystery elements making you question what's real and what's fake.Focusing on the story is this games biggest weakness. The story is a total mess and it's just all over the place and not to mention it doesn't fit into the franchise.The gameplay is horrible. It's mostly a stealth game where you can go loud and it becomes into a beat em up. You have the same stamina bar that's in the original Dead Island games.  The stealth in this game doesn't work. The game expects you to go around the zombies or stealthily get to your objective, in reality the game spawns zombies in front of you so it's impossible to go around them and they spot you even when you are behind them.The game has one thing I enjoy and that is the cell shaded look. I love the art style, but I can't appreciate it fully because of the terrible character models and the texture pop ins that happen way too often.This game is also quite difficult. Zombies can take you out in two hits and checkpoints are far from each other, so you need to beg to God you have a run which doesn't mess you up.The game took me 4 hours to finish. It's incredibly short and there's no replay value what so ever. So don't expect a second playthrough.In the end I might say Escape Dead Island is one of the worst games I have ever played. The story is horrible, the gameplay is boring, the stealth is broken and not to mention the game is beyond broken. There is no reason to own this game cause it's a horrible. It's not even worth owning for hardcore fans of Dead Island.Final Rating:2/10 - Do not buyIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I really don't know about this one.Many critics complain about the linearity of this game, or the controls, or the (boring) story etc.I really had no problems with any of these things. For me, the controls are fine, I like the graphics style and I don't mind how linear the game is most of the time. Not every game can be open world and not every game should be open world.So what kills it for me? It's basically two things. For one, the placement of the cutscenes is just awful. When you die, it often makes you re-watch unskipable cutscenes again. Also, collectibles do not save after respawing at a checkpoint, so you have to pick them up again. That's just BS! The second thing is the very last level of the game, which just throws wave after wave of difficult enemies at you - with barely anything between them. This is by far the hardest part of the game and I hated it, because it is just extremely poor and lazy designed. It's the same problem that Deadpool has, where they couldn't come up with something better at the end of the game than throwing more and more hard enemies at you just to hinder you from progressing faster. The last level of Escape Dead Island almost completely ruined the whole experience for me - which was otherwise pretty good I have to say. What a shame. With that being said, I cannot get myself to really recommend this game, although I liked it quite a bit for the most part.			"

												A terrible generic adventure game. Not a Dead Island game at all. A poor stealth system with glitchy enemy ai and horrible melee combat. No replay value whatsoever (Had 80-90% of all hidden items on the first go). For this price the game is a rip-off. Take a look at the more in-depth reviews if you really wish to try it since i will no longer waste my time explaining why it is what it is. Cheers!			"

												Before you get wrong ideas, I'm a big fan of the Dead Island franchise, but this.....this game has nothing to do with Dead Island or Riptide.Absolutely nothing at all.A lot of people complained about Riptide basically being just a cheap ripoff and DLC for Dead Island, but honestly, I feel that with this game my money have been thrown into the void.I'm sorry, I've tried playing it, giving it some time, but I think that at almost 5 hours I'll just give up and let this game be.Now let's be honest with each other and admit that we paid 40 euro or dollars or whatever just to get the key for the DI2 beta.We got trolled big time.And I'm amazed at how stupid I was to fall for it.Voice acting.It does not make you feel part of the story.It's just some random people reading some lines from a script.Other than that nothing at all.It doesn't quite feel right and I'm sorry for this.Graphics.Who wants a Tell Tale's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rip-off?Combat.Same 3 attacks.The weapon just changes shape.That is for the melee.What else?Oh yeah.PLOT.This big unknown.♥♥♥♥ me, I've found almost 50% of all collectibles and I still don't understand♥♥♥♥♥♥What the hell is this all about?Just plain stupid.Overall, my vote, my personal opinion and my recommendation is that you do not buy this game otherwise you'll get very disappointed.Totally not worth this price and the beta key, well they could do that for free.Don't buy it.Get a better game.There are 100s of them here on Steam, especially at this price.

												Despite the franchise’s rough reputation, Deep Silver aren’t afraid of milking the Dead Island brand for what it’s worth. In addition to the main game and semi-sequel, we’ve also got a proper sequel in the works, a MOBA, and now a third-person action adventure game. Escape Dead Island is the latter. Swedish Fatshark are at the helm this time. The result is a more story-driven game. This franchise seems to be cursed, so this game comes with its share of problems as well. The audiovisual presentation is all over the place. It’s not really a bad-looking game, but the cel-shading is so overdone that the game looks extremely simple at times. One can wonder what it would look like if the cartoony filter was removed. The music is alright, but the voice acting is generally subpar. And once again, we’ve got a zombie game that takes itself far too seriously. So you can’t just wave it off and call it “unintentionally cheesy”, either.Most striking of all, is the complete departure from Dead Island’s core mechanics. No longer will you roam an open world, freely craft and upgrade your own weapons that you use to hack up and loot zombies. This is more or less linear experience, where you hardly find any weapons at all, and there are no RPG-elements to be found. Looking at the screenshots, you’ll be forgiven for thinking it’s some sort of interactive story á la Telltale fare. It certainly is more story-focused than any previous Dead Island games, but there’s much more actual gameplay here than in a Telltale game; but the gameplay is so simplistic and repetitive, you’ll wish there was none at all.The story presented here isn’t all that bad. It’s nothing prize-worthy, but it definitely taps into some interesting things with its character gradually going insane. And it satisfyingly ramps up towards the end, too. You, as the player, will start second-guessing what’s actually happening and what’s only in protagonist Cliff’s head. It reminded me of Spec Ops: The Line; it’s got that same sort of “The gameplay is so mundane but I really want to see what happens next in the story!” vibe. Only here, the story isn’t nearly as good. And the gameplay is even less rewarding. And at nearly twice the price compared to what Telltale charge for their much better adventure games, Escape Dead Island is a damn hard sell. I’d only recommend it if you get it on a sale. And even then, you might end up bored.			"

												Escape Dead Island is a generic and technically-flawed spinoff to a series of which it shares minimal resemblance. Visually it preserves vibrancy of a tropical island but the zombies lack menace. The rigid tropical island contains too many arbitrary barriers, and far too much backtracking through agonizing passageways. The story is vague and generic, easier to ignore and hardly necessary for fans of the franchise. There is a general inelegance to all aspects involved with killing zombies too, as the melee combat is clunky, stealth is flawed and the shooting is inconsistent. As a spinoff, it brings nothing compelling to the franchise while reducing the enjoyable aspects. Unfortunately there is no easy cure to the problems in Escape Dead Island, and future games in the franchise should avoid direct contact.Read full review[www.newgamenetwork.com] "

												Ok I think possibly this may be my first review in all the years I've had steam and the hundreds of games I own, call me lazy, I dunno.But this game, I felt the strong need to express my utter disappointment, as an avid Dead Island fan from the start I actually pre-ordered this with sheer excitment.That excitment quickly went to disappointment, £35 wasted!Gameplay is repetitive and dull, combat is clunky and just not like how it used to be, graphics look awful, maybe some people like that whole comic style look, but for me, it really took away from the game. Voice acting terrible! No ability to upgrade your weapons in the same way that you could in all the Dead Island games, or actually have any choice as to what weapons you'd prefer to use, you don't even have a choice of character.If you - like me - are a big Dead Island fan, DON'T waste your money on this, this is nothing like Dead Island!!UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT !!! WASTE OF MONEY !!! STAY CLEAR !!!			"

												I've played Escape Dead Island for nearly six hours now and the game just keep on making me angrier and angrier for every minute. Love the comic art style, but the rip-off Borderlands presentations of the different zombies annoys me.The meelee combat is awkward, clumsy, and the fact that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera is included in the weapons wheel can get you easily killed if you press the wrong key in the middle of a fight because CLIFF LIKES TAKING HIS TIME ON CHANGING WEAPONS. The stealth elements are broken since the zombies detect you right away, it's all about good luck most of the time. The story is uninteresting, generic and cliché and I just want to finish the game already. I don't even have to comment on the voice acting and the non-existent sense of humour. It tries to be funny, but doesn't succeed which is embarrassing. Now, about the zombies. They are copies of the zombies in L4D and they respawn as soon as you go back the way you came and zombies spawn in totally LOCKED rooms. That annoys the hell out of me. The laws of physics simply don't apply to this game. Escape Dead Island is simply an ANNOYING and frustrating game. Avoid or only buy at a big discount.			"

												The only good thing about this game is its story line. Everything else is either lacking or down right annoying. My biggest complaint is the save system; the problem is that the save points themselves are set in terrible positions. The game is pretty tough at some points so expect to rerun many sections of a lab. Now this isn't necessarily a bad this except you will end up traversing annoyingly long corridors many times over and quite often these paths are completely empty, oh did I mention long? What becomes extremely annoying is that often there is some sort of sound byte or even medium sized cutscenes after a save point. Guess what you don't get to skip each and every time you respawn. If you are 'dying' to delve into this story then be all means be prepared for some frustrations but great immersion, otherwise, stay clear.			"

												I really wanted this to be a great game..Cons:- A checkpoint system that saves at the worst times, and espesially in front of cutscenes or far behind where you were.- Unskippable cutscenes, even after you've already seen it. Making the checkpoint system even worse.- Infuriatingly difficult at times, and not that I don't want a challenge. But a certain mini-boss is now as good as unbeatable.- Lips do not move out of cutscenes, which in 2014 is unacceptable.- No crafting- Lots of backtrackingPros- The story is not that bad, actually interesting considering the mystery element.- The artstyle, I really liked it.- You do get some weapon upgrades.- StealthSo do I recommend the game? I honestly do not know.. At times it is a blast, but then it is just horrible. So I suggest maybe watching a few reviews of people playing it first.  "

												As a big Dead Island fan I couldn't wait for this game to go on sale so I could play the prequel.  Most people had bad things to say about it, but I think that has more to do with expectations than anything else.  First, THIS IS NOT DEAD ISLAND!  Yes, it is a pre-quel, but that is all it shares with the series.  This has different graphics and game mechanics.  This is like a much more interactive Telltale game.  You don't upgrade your weapons or characters like Dead Island and it's not open world and very linear.  For what it is, a story driven adventure game with somewhat clunky combat, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  You take on the role of Cliff Calo, who, with the help of two friends, sets off for Narapela to find out what kind of experiments are going on there.  You explore the island trying to find the mystery behind the zombies.  Combat consists of melee and guns, with melee being my preference.  As you go further in the story, you open up more areas of the island and discover upgraded weapons, some of which allow to enter previously unaccessible buildings/areas.  The story builds up pretty nicely.Now, I will say that the end of the game is probably my least favorite part.  The story gets progressively crazier and unbelievable (even in a world with zombies) and the combat jumps in difficulty in the last two missions. Shoot, in the last mission it's like a completely different game with the bosses.  I lucked out that the game sort of glitched and had the last boss stuck on some rocks so I could just unload my pistol and kill him.  So, be aware that the end is not as satisfying as one would wish.Also, I stumbled into the free Underwater Labs DLC story when I thought I was completing a different game mission and it turned out to be one of my favorite missions of the game.  So I would highly recommend you be sure to find the entrance to it and do that mission.Overall:  6 zombie headshots out of 10			"

Posted: December 5, 2015
												Above all, this game tought me one important lesson: If it's not fun, stop playing!In short: Not recommended, unless you like torturing yourself with bad mechanics, or bland stories which don't get to real conclusion.-Lots of backtracking-Combat mechanics are rather flawed-Fails to be fun-+Story is twisted, which is good, but gets weaker and weaker at some point, to an unsatisfying ending which leaves many holes open-+A rather short game, mostly linear, has small map, but that isn't necesarrily bad. Depends on your taste.+Good graphics+Good soundtrack+Good free DLC+Collectibles are..alrightWhile not being 100% disastrous it is also not too far from that point, and that's a shame because it has potential for something more.And no, I didn't fall into the trap of expecting it to be like Dead Island or Riptide. I knew, or at least thought I knew, what I was getting into. I knew this is NOT RPG, I knew that it is mainly an 'action' title, with a small map, short length, etc..And these are true, and personally I have no problem with them. It's perfectly alright, and ever since I saw the trailer when the game was about to come out, it got my attention. Therefore I quickly grabbed it when it was finally on sale.While I guess you could say this game is worth at least those 4 bucks, and you'd be right, I still feel my time was terribly wasted.This game is simply not all that fun, and, sometimes it does so in a cruel way.Gameplay-wise, you would mainly run around some other zombie-infested island - a mostly linear experience - advancing with the story and smashing zombies along the way.As I said earlier the island's area is relatively small, although appropriate for the game's type and length. YET somehow the developers arranged the game in a way that makes you BACKTRACK A WHOLE LOT. I Hate backtracking. And playing through the game, you'd find yourself walking through the same areas, threading the same caves, climbing the same ladders, using the same ropes, crounching under the same foliage, over, and over, and over, again.Did I miss something?Oh yes, you won't JUMP over anything.Our hero is capable of sending zombies to their ultimate deaths but cannot jump.This may sound like a minor detail, and if the game was done correctly it could have been. But doing all this backtracking just to run around some annoying not-too-giant obstacles just makes you think WHY CAN'T YOU JUMP CLIFF? WHY????The combat, which is a big part of the game, won't save things either, for the simple reasons of it being repetitive and monotonous, but above all, way too laggy! The controls would always respond in delay, the combat mechanics feel flawed and clunky.Also, our hero would die SO FAST. No matter how much medkits you'd collect along the way, (and these would tell yo that you've raised your max health, yeah right!), you'll just keep dying quickly, without even realizing what's happening! At first these buggy mechanics are bearable, but later in the game on the parts which are meant to be more challanging, it becomes a pain in the butt.Switching weapons is also not too quick or responsing, and the result is a combat which is not flowing at all, and you'd pray to end it as quickly as possible.Yes, you will pray. Or just quit. Or just break your computer, as I almost did.There are also MANY collectibles throughout the island. usually these are logs\recordings\etc you'd have lying around and well hidden, there are also snapshots which you can take with your camera. I actually found this aspect nice and enjoyable, but it grew tired soon enough, and didn't make up for the rest of the game.The one thing which really kept me from leaving this game mid-way to rot in the depths of my ""Don't Like"" category on Steam, was the story. And as much as it hurts to say, it wasn't too good or worth it, as well.It is very twisted, which is actually a good thing in my opinion. It is also very bland at some points, which is neither good or bad for me, and can be easily made into superb plot with just one single strong ending.There wasn't.I guess the concept was alright and a somewhat original twist to the classic zombie stories (Some evil corporation spreads the virus because it wants to rule the world\it is just plain stupid), but still, the story is not getting too clear throughout the game. For many of the events, you'll never figure out if they ACTUALLY happened or are simply a fruit of our hero's rather limited imagination.The ending doesn't properly close the game, there are many holes and questions unanswered, and it is simply not justifying the time spent on.No need to say the chatacters have no depth or any development (storywise).My expectations were high because this game is supposed to be ""the missing link between Dead Island and Dead Island 2"" as the description said. But it didn't really surprise or bring anything good. Oh, and there's one very notable connection to the previous titles: (again, storywise) Xian Mei (hope I wrote that correctly) would be our guest star, her purpose not too clear, and while on previous games she seemed like the kindest person on earth, here she's mostly an annoying ♥♥♥♥♥ with an annoying accent.Not being racist here.So, there it is, with a heavy heart I would definitely NOT recommend this game, unless you like torturing yourself. There are some bright sides which are worth mentioning, although they fail to save the game from being what it is.The graphics are actually pretty good, not too demanding and not too fancy but has a cool comic-style which is very refreshing to the series and I always like to see in video games.The soundtrack is splendid! Feels like a waste for this game, but, it really keeps the atmosphere in a good place, very dramatic and tense, very fitting, very epic, simply great!Unfortunately, these make the game look like a nice package while the inside is an utter mess.The Underwater Labs is also worth mentioning, for being a free DLC, it is quiet good and mostly enjoyable. While it doesn't have much connection to the main story, it would take you aside to an hour or two of something...else. It is probably the only portion of the game which was actually creepy for me. There was a special emphasis on sneaking around instead of storming your enemies, it was bizzare and twisted, tense, and, well, good. Until the game mechanics ruined it and it's final section almost made me quit the game for good.Maybe I should have.			"

												Generally, a fun game and interesting story.  There are 2 things that make this game INFURIATING.1) The checkpoints are too far apart and in MORONIC places.  How about putting them just immediately prior to boss encounters like every other game ever made?2) You can't skip cutscenes rendered with the game engine.So basically, you encounter a challenging section... ok, fine.  You die.  You respawn and go through the same 2-3 minutes of monotonous gameplay, including an unskippable cutscene.  You die again.  You repeat this 10 times.  You wish that the developers would drown in acid and die.Please learn something from this devs.  The steam reviewers have spoken.  This ONE issue has killed this game for many.  Keep the challenging sections, yes... but be SMARTER about the respawn points and let us skip all cutscenes.  I want to be back in there kicking the♥♥♥♥♥of that boss within 10 seconds.Get it on sale DO NOT pay full price. "

												While I like the art style and combat of this game, I find the lack of saving or even more closely placed save spots very very aggrevating.  I also feel like they should have rebranded this game as a new title rather than following dead island. It's cool how they tie in the story a bit, but overall I feel the new graphic style is offputting to most dead island fans, but as a new game entirely it would have been accepted more.I give this game a 6/10, mostly because of the save problem. The game will let you travel a very long ways and fight many enemies before throwing you against a enemy with crazy strength with no save inbetween. If you die you will restart at the very beginning and any collectibles you got will also reset.I also feel like this game struggles too much to try and implement jumpscares, which dead island was never about. It has a FEAR element of things popping in and out of thin air.Unless this save situation is changed, I honestly cannot recommend this game.			"

												Could have been much better.Graphics are cool, and tehre's some good parts of a game. But it falls mediocre and lots of little issues makes it very annoying, like the badly placed checkpoints, that leaves you really away from the places you die and makes you watch over and over again the cutscenes without allowing you to skip them. The level design makes you walk over and over again parts of the map that are really not interesting, the bad colission when you'e crouching will prevent you from using properly your stealth skills.In the end of the game things get very buggy (wasn't like this in the most of the game) changing the number of ammo you have, not swappting the weapons (at normal speed or at all) and lots of things that will make the extremely difficult scenes from the end really hate the game.The character seems to get weaker and weaker, loosing the stamina really quickly and leaving you surrounded by the most dangerous zombies (that will kill you on 2 or 3 strikes) of the game with no chance of moving, fighting back or even taking damage... what's the point of making a stamina/health bar that runs out whatever you do? if you run, dodge or hit it consumes the tiny stamina bar (that doesn't improve at all along the game) and you're done, zombies start spawning around you and there's nothing to do but seeing the (from the 10th time you see it) annoying animation of respawning.I wasn't going to give it a bad review, but from mediocre that was from the very beginning went to really annoying and frustrating in the end.Also (I think it is ridiculous that developers and testers didn't notice this) I couldn't even keep up with the logs, as they are shown in a masive black square with the text in the middle of the screen and doesn't even pause the action, so if you want to read them you have to hide in a corner while you do it. Was it so difficult to put the text on the bottom or top of the screen so player can keep going and listen to the log? Lots of simple things bring this game down for me.I wouldn't recommend it, only if you get it cheap on sales, it may worth it, but there are so many other good games to play...			"

												As many of the other reviews have pointed out here, this game is not at all like Dead Island. It is an action stealth game, with a strong focus on story, and a lot of the complaints about it seem to be from people who did not read the description or any reviews and wanted just more of the same DI. I also liked DI, but please, judge this game for what it is actually trying to do here.Pros-Amazing story. One of the best stories involving zombies period. It's not the standard ""bunch of survivors who don't get along,"" it tries to do something new and really succeeds.-Good graphics. Cell shaded comic book stuff, but occasionally uses that look to do some really cool, surprising things.-Fine combat/stealth. This isn't the reason to buy this game, but it works fine. Hits feel weighty, like they should, stealth isn't overly complicated, and you can usually handle the stand-up fight if stealth fails. Takes a little thought to get dodging and timing right, but once you get it, it's fun and not particularly frustrating.Cons-A little clunky. EDI was developed by a small team, and it kinda shows. Nothing is particularly fluid, but not in a way to really take you out of it. Some invisible walls and getting stuck on terrain, but it's better than quite a few AAA titles out there.-Unskippable cutscenes. Some are skippable, but most are not, and they replay if you die after one. Annoying, and they waste a few seconds each time.-Weapon switching. It takes about a second after selecting a weapon, for Cliff to start switching, which is frustrating when the zombies you were shooting jump at you, and you want a melee weapon quick. This killed me most of the times I died, and you really need to do some planning for when you will need something.A final note: when I started this game, I was not very into it. Cliff begins as an incredibly insufferable character, the tutorial has you going back and forth though the same areas, and I hadn't really got a handle of the combat. But, having played trough the whole thing, there is a good reason for those things. It is important that Cliff is a jerk, and the game is better for it, same with the backtracking. So keep with it, and play it for what it is, a truly great story in a good action-stealth game.			"

												Are you looking for a game that has a great story, exciting fights against zombies, that completely immerses you in the game? You wont find it here in this game. The zombie fights in the game gets repetitive with just swinging for the fences until you run out of stamina. The story isn't all that well either. You are a group of teens looking for a story about the zombie outbreak. And then after that, somewhere down the line the story leaves you wonder what is real and what isn't, and not in a good way. As for the last boss fight, there were times in the rest of the game where I had more of a challenge than the boss. Just run and gun it. And for bugs, as soon as I started playing not 5 minutes into the game I ran through a door just to fall out of the world. Should have took that as a warning for the rest of the game. And when you get to the end of the game you see what looks like the game was either rushed or the creators lost interest in it with dialogs running together with you trying to figure out which part is happening now. I liked the graphics at first where it looks like a comic book. But after a while it just runs together with lights flickering everywhere and rooms being tilted where you have to turn your head just to get through the level. At time I just had to force myself to finish the game. That is not something you want for your game. All in all I would not recommend this game.			"

Escape Dead IslandUnfortunately this game is a painful struggle the whole way through.Most reviews explain the main points of where the game went wrong, so I won't rant about it, but I was quite excited to play this game when I bought it and have since been really let down.The best part about this game is the style of graphics (similar to Borderlands graphics) and how amazingly colourful everything is.I am forcing myself to complete this game, but once complete I'm sure ""finishing the game"" will be added to the ""the best part about this game is..."" section of this review.3/10Wouldn't again.

												Holy Mother of God this game is horrendous. Luckily I only bought it for $4 and was fooled into purchasing it for because I thought it would at least have something to do with the Dead Island franchise. The only thing that this game has in common with DI is that they both have zombies...This game truly is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I honestly do not know what the worst part about it is. The story line is absolute crap. The voice acting is absolute crap. The game play is also absolute crap. Finally, the checkpoints (yes you guessed right!) are ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥ING CRAP. When boss battles are coming up or tough areas, there are often unskippable cut scenes that you must watch again and again until you finally beat the ♥♥♥♥ing boss or area. Not to mention, they put you so far back that you end up playing the same area 100 ♥♥♥♥ing times before you make any progress. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and the fact that they can use Dead Island in the title is saddening because the actual DI games are good. ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the devs, and ♥♥♥♥ the stupid artists and crappy♥♥♥♥♥cut scenes. Do not buy this game, do not even play this game if you somehow get it for free. 0/10 because this game is just♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The Good: Fun Comic Book Art style, combat and stealth are fun, Sound Effect PopupsThe Bad: Short (3-4 hours without collectibles), Hidden Ending, story feels salvaged,The WTF: Shifting World that feels hindered by lack of flushing outEscape: Dead Island is an amazing game hindered by a lack of faith in it by the publisher. What results is a short hobbled version of a grander planned experience. Deep Silvers lack of faith radiates sharply with a complete lack of advertisement for the game leaving my discover of its release solely to pure luck.The game is short, roughly 3-4 hours if you don't care at all about the collectables. I do, obsessively, so with them you can grind out an additional 2-3 hours. During which you'll be treated to a 3D metroid style world with hidden weapons, collectibles, and health upgrades galore. Through the collectibles and pictures you take with the camera you'll receive the majority of the back-story, of the virus's lore, the villains motivation, essentially everything.On the other hand, the main story  is hobbled, short, and feels salvaged. It and its characters would be entirely forgettable without the flushing out the lore collectibles provides them. Without spoiling the ending, I must say it doesn't resolve anything, but there is a hidden ending. Unlocking it is as mysterious as unlocking the 4 bunkers in game, and help for doing so as of this writing is entirely none existent.Gameplay wise the game does well. There is a simple stealth system that you will rarely use, but the main combat mechanics (Melee and guns) flows fluidly, with each blow results in a reaction from any creature. Once timing is perfected for the harder enemies they're easy although time consuming to dispatch. Dodge mechanic is responsive and a pure requirement for combat. Without its use enemies will auto lock onto you, rarely missing.Stealth is deadly, especially after recovering the knife allowing for instantaneous takedowns. Sneaking up on unaware enemies allows for stealth kills, dropping the enemy instantly regardless of class. It is extremely satisfying to get a higher tier mutant this way. Unfortunately level design often hinders stealth, levels are often narrow and compact leaving little to no room to sneak behind enemies with only a few exceptions. Important linear areas typically boil down to combat only, with a few opportunities for thinning the horde.Aesthetically the games comic book, heavy black lines and pop up sound effects give the game a fantastically fun feel. Hit walls, sound effect, hit enemies, sound effect, steam coming out of a pipe, sound effect. Without a doubt the sound effect popup were my favorite feature. Details are not skimped on, characters are detailed, while mutants/infected have a few variations are largely the same class to class.I had fun with Escape Dead Island, but what stops me from recommending this game is the lack of conclusion it has. It's something that is nearly impossible explain without spoiling what happens after the end so spoiler warning : The game circles back to the beginning of its own events. There are hints that something else is going on, but answers and satisfaction are relegated to the hidden ending. Price wise I feel good about the game, but I got it last minute prepurchase while on sale, giving access to Dead Island 2 beta and a first issue of the Dead Island comic. Without these perks I'd wait till the game hits around $20 to pick it up. "

												Alright, I am very conflicted with this one.I got this game in a bundle and thought I might use it to get into the Dead Island franchise, since I had heard of it but never actually played it. Didn't need to go far into the game to realize this isn't really what I expected Dead Island to be...I could tell without ever having played Dead Island in the first place. From the beginning to the end, I really couldn't tell whether I enjoyed playing it or hated it. The story bounced back and forth between being interesting and cliche, the characters between likable and completely forgettable, even the combat was a mixed bag. Let me elaborate:Story:The story revolves around the main guy, Cliff. He is an okay dude. He sets off with his friends to investigate the quarantine of some island to write a huge story about it and get approved by his father, who recently disowned him for being a f*ckup. He is accompanied by a nerdy girl and some black dude, who really doesn't add anything o the story. The chick, Linda, however, does. At least more than the other dude does.You can pretty much guess the rest from there. They get to the island, get stranded, then try to escape. This part of the story is actually pretty stale because it is pretty linear and on the level of ""fetch me three keycards from around the island to get the master key to unlock the secret dungeon""-kind of storytelling. It felt like a chore more than anything, despite being so easy, due to all the pointless backtracking.The interesting stuff, however, happens in between all the backtracking in form of Cliff's growing lunacy.  It's the only unpredictable part of the story and is what keeps it fresh and interesting, even just because it feels so random and weird. It's also very entertaining because the voice actress for Linda who voices his mad side actually does a very good job for it, sounding so delighted, teasing and mocking whenever it is needed. I enjoyed those passages.Sadly however, and this is a spoiler, it never actually gets explained what causes this madness. The best bet I have is that hitting his head upon trying to save the boat caused Cliff to lose it, but that's really stretching it. It also never got explained why the boat's engine suddenly exploded in the first place. Feels like a plothole to me.Characters:Well, Cliff is an alright dude. He starts as a cocky jock and while his cockiness never changes, he does undergo a certain growth in my opinion. My main gripe with him as a character is less due to how he is written and more due to how it never gets explained what actually happens to him. The player's curiosity about his mental health gets piked to the max only to never get an answer to it in the end.Linda starts off as a character you would normally disregard as someone who would die first for shock value, never to be important again. Turns out she stuck around until the end, after all. And in a way I would have never expected her to. In hindsight, I would actually have to say she was probably even the most entertaining character in this whole story.Davan, the token black dude, felt like he was...just there. Sure, at one point it all began revolving around him when it came to actually escaping, but for the majority of the game he just exists as a name in the back of your head. You don't see him, you don't hear him and over all you don't really care about him anyway because you expect nothing from him. Sadly, I was right about him from the start. He seems to be a nice guy, but he adds nothing meaningful to the story.The other characters in this game are...sort of a mystery to me. They exist, but I don't really get why. Could be that they are cameos of the Dead Island franchise I don't recognize, but I somehow doubt that.There is a Chinese chick who crash lands on the island only to ever be cryptic about her goals and intentions. All she ever does is provide Cliff with weapons she just drops at his feet as if she didn't have a need for them in the first place. If I didn't know better, I would say she was a plot device to give Cliff new weapons as well as his quest to search for the key cards.Aaron the mutant and the chick that was with him...I don't get what their deal was at all. They weren't antagonists despite sometimes trying to look like ones. At least they didn't feel like ones.Well, in the end, it just boils down to Cliff and Linda who are interesting and everyone else who, sadly, isn't.Gameplay:This is where people will most likely get disappointed, for the combat itself isn't very deep. It just boils down to hitting zombies with a melee attack until they die. Aiming feels wonky and redundant when almost all enemies in this game a close combat oriented and rush you like maniacs. There is never enough time to reload, so why bother?Yet, despite this simplicity, you will likely still get the impression this game might be ""hard"", but that's not due to complex combat mechanics, but rather due to the games unforgiving checkpoints. You will find yourself getting put back to placed you had been MINUTES ago, even several fights prior to the one you died in. In the first place, you likely died because you accidentally missed one of your three combo hits on a zombie, causing him to recover and hit you back. That's actually the only reason to ever die. To mess up a combo and be out of stamina to dodge away. Needless to say, it adds to your frustration to have this annoyingly long death and revive animation upon death. While it is cool and fits the theme, I just wish it would be cancel-able.The enemy's AI is generally potato level. They just rush blindly at you and perform their single scripted attack.  Once you learn how that attack loops, you will never have trouble with them at all. You only die if your dodge gets body blocked by the environment or enemies or when a combo of your axe doesn't connect. Wouldn't be a problem if it wouldn't send your character 10 minutes back in time upon respawn...The combat CAN be fun sometimes, when there are new things to test out, such as new weapons or environmental damage like electricity or pushing enemies into rapidly moving fans. However, it gets stale really fast and you will find yourself running past most enemies if possible (most enemies will be too stupid to notice you unless it's a scripted battle)Sound:The overall quality of the VA and music is pretty good. Never found a reason to complain. There were even a few cases where I thought the Voice over was especially well done.Overall:Well, I would be lying if I said I didn't get SOME enjoyment out of this game, but most of it was experienced only during the endgame and mainly the last level. Sh*t really hits the fan then and the game becomes a madness simulator, which I enjoyed at least as much as it confused me.Unfortunately, this leaves the rest of the game, namely the beginning and middle part, to be very boring. The DLC that adds another underground level also feels very weak. While it certainly was the longest level in the game, its design was very underwhelming, consisting only of tunnels upon tunnels of grey and dark concrete or steel. There was little to see and many enemies to grind through (which, remember, is boring since the combat is stale) only to reward the player with no cutscene whatsoever. You beat the level, faint and start at the entrance of the level again as if nothing ever happened. What a huge waste of time :/Given how the most enjoyable thing about this game was Cliff's madness and Linda's role in it, you could probably do yourself the favor and save yourself the money by watching a Let's play instead. If there were an option to give neutral feedback, I would have chosen that, but since there isn't, I will have to go with a negative one, since there are less good things about this game than bad things.

												I had no expectations when I started playing this game, however I am very familiar with all of the Dead Island related titles released so far, so here are my impresions from that perspective:* the graphics are caught somewhere between ""Borderlands"" and TellTale's ""Walking Dead"" game. * the gameplay is different from the previous Dead Island titles; Jump has been removed and now you have a dodge maneuver using the space bar. Combat happens from a 3rd view perspective and attacks require more timing, however attacking is fluid enough once adapted to it. Stealth is a main component in this title and is implemented in a simple but efficient manner.* there are no RPG related elements like currency, custom weapons, item collection, leveling up, etc.* the game is more linear as in you need to get certain items and complete objectives in an order so the next area can be unlocked.""Escape"" is an entirely different game experience from the previous titles which I found quite enjoyable and welcome. The game offers a lot of background information into the epidemic and some of the characters involved thus filling in some of the gaps. I recomend this game but be aware it does not play or feels like the previous Dead Island titles so do not purchase if you are expecting something close to the earlier installments or you might be dissapointed. Edit: deleted previous ""Edit"" note.			"

												I would recommend this game if you could buy it at a significant discount, and even then it would be a tepid recommendation.This game simply tries to do to many things at once.  The stealth mechanics are a bit uninspired, and combat often gets tedious because there's too much of it.  The whole zombie apocalpyse plot is boilerplate.The second half of the game or so, on the other hand, is pretty well done because it's something of a psychological thriller and it's hard to tell what is real and what isn't.  But it takes way too long before that plot gets set up.This game is a side story to the Dead Island series so it doesn't require any knowledge of them, and the gameplay is entirely different too.

												This Game is one of the worst overtly repeating, intensley irritating badly written, poorly designed,  useless waste of money and time I have ever encountered.The people involved in the creation of this game should not only feel ashamed of themselves but should probably serve sometime of jail time for stealing money and life from people who are far more worthy then they.I understand this may seem a rant of obnoxious vitriol but in all honesty I would not invest in this game unless you feel like repetively bashing yourself in the head because that is roughly the same equivalent of enjoyment, painful and repetative.

												Genre - 3rd Person Survival Horror (Cel Shaded)I have enjoyed every single Dead Island game released on Steam thus far and this is no exception. Although it plays differently to the FPS original Dead Island games and the MOBA Epidemic. This is more centred around a story and sees you not only trying to survive the island but your own sanity with strange events being triggered, think of a cartoony Evil WIthin. I haven't completed the game yet so don't know the full story. Although this is good as stops me from spoiling it for you. You get to use melee and ranged weapons and you will find various key items that allow you travese more and more of the Island. Sometimes this will make you go back to previous visited areas that were inaccessible before, so make notes as you go. The graphics although more cartoony than the other games look nice, as a fan of Cel Shaded graphics. The story will keep you interested and a few familar faces will pop into the game as you progress. I am over half way through and don't think this is an overly long game, although the Free DLC adds significant new content. However, if you are an achievement hunter, there is always plenty to go back for. I got the game on sale and think the original asking price was way to high, but if you can get at a fair price and are a fan of Dead Island games I would recommend giving this a whirl.			"

												[Update] Having played this game for some hours into its ""New Game Plus"", I've become more and more frustrated with its clunky controls, uninterruptable animations (I was blocked from attacking for 8 seconds, while being attcked, while he took his gasmask off then equipped his melee), bad (or lack of) animation, hugely spaced checkpoints, and overpowered enemies. Play this game through once with an open mind and you might like it, but for me at this point, my review has changed from positive to negative. There are simply better, more fun to play games out there, and I'm deeply sickened at the thought of having to do the final boss again just to get 100% (two full playthroughs is an acheivement).[Original] Escape from Dead Island is not a bad game. It isn't great, it might not even be good, but it does what it set out to do competently. Do NOT get this game because you liked the main Dead Island games - this is nothing like that. I can't stress enough that this is NOT a horror game.EfDI is a metroidvania-esque character action game, having you explore an island from set A-to-B points using whatever item you just got to access new areas. There are numerous collectables, some hidden behind item-locked rooms that will require backtracking to get, and an extensive (and good) bonus mission thanks to the free DLC.Despite hitting a progression-blocking bug 15 minutes into the game (the next room simply didn't load, leaving a void, which inexplicably corrected itself after a system reboot), I have since spent a fair number of hours - dare I say it - having fun in this colourful universe of zombies and constant scouring to find goodies.The combat is basic: Fast combo; Heavy attack (and I mean heavy, it takes 3 seconds to swing); Push (I think this is overlooked by most - it stuns any enemy out of their attack pattern!); and Dodge (which requires surprisingly precise timing to actually avoid an attack). Most of the time you'll be dispatching basic zombies with two lights and a heavy or 3-4 lights, or a Run-Push, which knocks down most enemies in one hit for an instant kill. One thing this game excels is making weapons feel good - the guns sound satisfyingly hefty and the melee really feels like it has force behind it (though they all use the same animations, which is odd for the Katana).Stealth is managed quite nicely, using a large ""!"" that fills to indicate how aware enemies are of you. For basic zombies it's pretty leniant, for the advanced ones, less so, but all the more satisfying for it. The main flaw of this system is the requirement to crouch to stealth and stand to stealth kill - the game is VERY fiddly with where it will allow you to stand up. More than once I've snuck up on a zombie and mashed 'A', only to be given a ""Blocked from standing up"" prompt and for their alert meter to fill up.One thing this game does very nicely, along with its cel-shading shaders, is the inclusion of 'insanity effects'. Cliff seems to be losing his mind throughout the game, which allows for some very bizzare effects to occur and keep things interesting. That said, Cliff is a fairly unlikeable jabroni, with his chocolate ice-cream hair, 'deep' tattoo, and recurring ""I've got this"" attitude. He's certainly not the worst character I've ever seen, but the three main student/investigative reporter characters fit right in with the FarCry 3 universe of rich, entitled daddy-issue trash. I mean, Cliff steals his daddy's yacht so he can get a 'scoop' to secretly win his affection.Speaking of scoops, this game prominently features the use of a camera to take photos, which I was not at all aware of coming in to it. Now, this is entirely optional, purely for collectables, but it fits with the character and makes areas a little more interesting as you frequently flip to camera-mode to spont any new glowing objects to capture. This feature has its downsides though - for example, whenever you enter a new area, crates and beer bottles begin glowing again despite them already being captured. Cliff also includes a terrible one-liner with each, though only 10% of these are voiced.This game hasn't received any awards for writing, and for good reason. Characters are mostly one-dimensional stereotypes (""the artist"", ""the reporter"", ""the mysterious badass"") and references to other games are frequent and unfunny. Cliff is probably the worst voiced character of them all, often reading lines like he doesn't understand the context and sounding like he just solved a crossword rather than forcing a door open.The graphics are actually really good, beleive it or not. The cel-shaded filter works really well to give you that comic-book feel, along with the little sound-effect pop-ups when you do anything noisy (though ""scrounge"" as a sound-effect is one of my favourites). Animation on the other hand, is not. None of the characters facially emote during animated cutscenes and Cliff doesn't even open his mouth when talking out of one. The game also has its issues with shadows and the transition between the ambient lighting of different areas, but that's hardly uncommon. The drawn cutscenes are stunning however, acheiving a level of 3D space using drawn art I've rarely seen before - truly beautiful and nicely styalised (though the characters can look fairly different between the different cutscenes).A major weakness of this game is the lack of an inventory. There is absolutely no way for you to remind yourself what key items you have, such as keycards, without going up to a door to see whether the prompt is highlighted or not. This uselessness travels over to the map, which is by far the worst map I've ever seen in a videogame. The map is non-interactable, an abstract representation with no points of reference besides a numbered list of locations, and absolutely no help if you're trying to remember where a certain previously-locked area was.So, in summation, this is not a brilliant game. You probably won't play it again in the future, but you might have fun like me while you do. The combat is frustrating and can turn against you fairly quickly, but you are usually given all the options you need to survive one way or another (upon repeated deaths ammo spawns next to you), just make sure you scour the levels for Medkits, which permamently increase your max health (you'll need it). The nice art, Cliff's sanity and numerous collectables keep things interesting while you venture through this fairly uninspired, but serviceable game.			"

												I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale and it's been sitting in my library collecting dust. Finally I got around to give it a try and I'm really glad that I did. I'm a huge fan of the Dead Island series but this one is definetly not the same as the rest. This game isn't made by the same people who did the Dead Island series, Techland. It's made by Fatshark. So with that being said, most ppl should know it's not going to be the same exact anything from the others. Clearly if you watch the trailer or gameplays, you can see that for yourself. This is a third person action adventure game. It can be approached with a stealth style or pure hack n slash with it's variety of melee weapons you encounter through the game. You also can choose to use gunplay as well, also just about finding the different kinds of weapons throughout the game. t's a cel shaded graphics style game which I happen to be a fan of. None of the weapons are customizable as in the other DI series and I didn't mind that much, no skill trees for your character either which was fine. The plot is basically how the zombie outbreak in Banoi Islands took place, the who and the why. I know that this game has a lot of negative comments and reviews just like some of the other DI franchise did. I tend to not really believe much of the hype and find out for myself.  Sure everygame has a few glitches here and there but to be honest I only came across 1 in my whole gameplay. I had died and when I was respawning, I kept falling through the game model into a cloud of nothing, over and over. So a simple fix was to quit the game and join back in. It worked and I was in the exact same spot but this time no falling :) So the melee combat isn't superb and I found to be a tad bit clunky but a lot of that has to do with timing and knowing when to dodge and swing. Which is why I think why most ppl gave it bad reviews in this area. Which is cuz most ppl want to just go in and slaughter, fast and easy. Where in some cases especially on the special zombies, you have to know their moves and how to handle them properly. So it takes a bit of skill, smarts and ofc good hand and eye coordination (timing) So if you're one to be a bit lazy in those departments, this game may not be for you. One thing I did find extremely annoying was there were certain scenes you could skip. If you died though, the short cut scenes couldn't be skipped. And I won't lie, I died quite a few times especially in the area leading up to the final boss scene. Hearing the same short lines over and over can make you go a bit postal if you let it lol. But other than that, it's a small gripe that can be overlooked in my opinion. If you still are unsure if this game is for you, my best recommendation is to do your research. Check out gameplay videos and see for yourself, hearing other ppls opinions will only take you so far. At the end of the day, we aren't all alike so you know best & what's good for you. But I definetaly recommend this game, grab it when it's on sale and get to killing! =)			"

												Full Review: http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/79374/escape-dead-island-video-game/I wasn’t going to beat Escape Dead Island. At about the halfway point, I figured I had seen most of what the game had to offer and was ready to sign off on a score of “surprisingly decent.” But Far Cry 4 hadn’t finished downloading yet, and there are only so many times you can j*** off before it starts to hurt, so I decided to slog through the rest as an accoutrement to my nightly alcohol consumption. Thank God I did, as it turns out that sloth would have proved my folly, as the game turns out to actually be s***. Whew, good thing too; we almost had a good Dead Island game on our hands! I’m not sure how I’d be able to fit that into my fragile world view....http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DreadCentral "

												This is thoroughly underrated game, and I think a lot of the negativity spawns from the fact it's still technically a dead island game.  I suppose it needed that banner flagship to get noticed on here but the similarities to that series stops at the name, barring a brief cameo from an original character and the occasional namedropping of Banoi.  You're not even on Banoi in this game!  Instead you're on another island nearby which has suffered from a similar affliction of the walking dead.  If this had been some new zombie-flavoured IP I think it would have a positive or very positive rating on here.In a nutshell, it's a exploration-stealth-zombie-splat-adventure-a-thon.  People do rag on the combat and I can understand where they're coming from.  Sometimes, in particular, during heated close combat engagements where I'd be running away from whatever is currently trying to eat my face, all the while hurriedly reloading, I'd then spin round quickly to fire from the hip and I'd always find myself firing slightly to the right of where I intended and how the screen seemed to imply I was facing.  This led to me often missing things at point-blank-range.  Deliberate aiming as the horge descends on you works much better.  And the stealth kills I felt were a treat, having to stalk up on your prey, always on edge wondering whether I would be spotted by my target zombie or one of his buddies and turned into some prime chowder.  Not only that but shooting zombies from afar with your silent pistol as the rest looking around all confused was also very satisfying.  The melee combat was the standard quick button mashing affair and always came down to the two keystrokes of attack/dodge (don't even bother with the slow heavy attack).  By and large I think smashing away was easier than it needed to be but occasionally the close combat experience would just click and you'd find yourself swatting back zombies on all sides and finding yourself thoroughly enjoying every second!The art style really works.  The cell-shaded visuals reminded me strongly of Borderlands and everything was bright, colorful and easily identifiable.  Of particular note are the gorgeous comic-book style stills between scenes.  The cartoonish aesthetic really was a welcome change of pace from the gritty depressiveness of the original series.Stealthily exploring the island and picking up countless nuggets of backstory was where the game really shone.  Not only that but the storytelling was far more engaging than the original series.  Think spec ops/heart of darkness by way of the zombie apocalypse, drawing you ever deeper into the protagonist's madness.  Also, there was a gameplay impacting point to exploration with the inclusion of medikits scattered far and wide.  Though weirdly upon pick up the screen would flash up '+1' or '+3' health increase.  There was no indicator of health in any numeric/visual form beyond the standard blood staining around the screen border upon taking damage so what these numbers meant is anyone's guess.  You did at least notice over time that you could take an extra slash or two from the island bestiary.There were a few other niggles and oddities, like the fact your torch doesn't alert zombies at all.  Would have been nice and a bit more realistic to have to turn it off to sneak up on the undead.  Also, the number of times I wished I had a grenade...  And I thought the dialogue was a bit odd and stiff to begin with but as it went on I got used to it and began to really enjoy the character's interaction and plaintive despair from the main character as he went further round the bend.  The cartoonish style of the game also helps smooth the dialogue a good bit and makes it fit.In short, if you love zombies and want a break from standard FPS zombie blasing, and you enjoy some good old fashioned exploration and stealth killing with a swiftly ramping up in stakes story then buy this now.  And definitely pick it up if it's on sale! "

												Play as Cliff Calo, the son of powerful men who not only seeks his attention but also a story that will make him a star in his father broadcast network. The situation in Borneo is dangerous and very secretive, no one really knows what happened, but common sense still applies... No way the situation can be that bad, is not like zombies are running loose or something, right?!Join forces with Xian Mei, a very well known character and save your friends from the horrors of the island! Escape Dead Island is an innovative game among a first-person franchise, that changes to a third person camera, not only to surprise us, but also to prove that an intensive adventure can be played in any way possible. Because let's face it, the first thing you see when checking Escape Dead Island are the fantastic visuals Fatshark created. Very colorful, very shiny and vibrant to the player's eyes, just don't forget, the violence is also very intensive, and we love it even harder.An adventure game that uses a third person combat with style and stealth elements, just choose your style as they say, but I must warn you: the stealth isn't that much polished. Works, but as for the minimum, as the player will encounter great moments to stealth, but the enemies movements and positions aren't solid. This results in inaccurate movements, incorrect positions due to the enemies not being where they should, and other most common mistakes found in games not-stealth-ready. Fatshark sure did their job, but they are far from stealth pros. As for the action, you should expect the lack of combos, and just two set of movements per weapon, and by weapon I'm not mentioning guns obviously. If in previous Dead Island titles the player can customize and go insane with upgrades, in this title the options are much shorter. Weapons are just waiting to be found, as well as their upgrades. Gun variety is much more appealing, going from pistol to a shotgun and assault riffle feels great, especially when shooting zombies into a beautiful red pulp!Killing zombies is still fun, not only with weapons, but with envoryement. Sure, we miss the grenades in the island, but we can still shock them or push the ugly creatures into a gigantic fan, and stare at all the mutilated parts fly around.This is a much more linear game, you won't have character selection. The player is stuck with Cliff to link what happened in previous games through the storyline. You'll most certainly find yourself enjoying Escape Dead Island not for the story, although you might be keeping up with it and its mental delusions that presents experimental gameplay, it's for the action that you remain as addicted as I was when exploring the island. Collect pieces of information, take pictures of what might be relevant to your story, and go deeper into the deep labs to get yourself vibe from the tvshow Lost.The game tries to remain faithful to the open world habits, but it's clearly a level based game with chapters that remain partially accessible when completed. With new chapters, new zombies are presented in classes we all have seen in other games, especially for Dead Island players. In fact, if you played any previous games you are now used to the enemies respawn system as well.There is no difficulty to choose from, but after finishing the game the player is granted a New Game+, and it's a shame one can't keep the weapons, it would be a fantastic asset to the game. Nevertheless, you remain with the collected items, and that's good enough!Escape Dead Island is a perfect action-adventure game that will please anyone looking for intense moments, and perhaps zombies to headshot and try out that new axe of yours!6/10 "

												Just finished the gasme after about 8 and a half hours. Got the game while it was on sale and picked it up because it looked hella interesting. And holy hell that was a ride from beginning to end.Now I gotta say this first, there are a lot of reviews talking about how different this game is, and yeah, it different. It doesn't play like the main Dead Island games and it doesn't have quite the same atmosphere.This is essentially a classic adventure game set in Dead Island's ""Banoi Archepelago"". It touches a bit heavy on stealth, spookiness, and wiredness than the original games do. There are no rpg elements, its straight adventure, exploration, and upgrade collecting.If you're squeamish about horror games (I handle horror like a ♥♥♥♥♥) but still want a bit of a scare this is absolutely perfect. It doesn't go full bore ""Gonna♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants"" horror, but retains a fantastic thrill element.Combat is simple, very different from DI's combat, but they did keep the stamina system and I feel it is implemented very well. Weapon swapping and reloading is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and will often break, forcing you to try again. This is onlly seemed to be an issue while cornered or surrounded. (Could just be me panicking)Cutscenes and story are done very nicely, including almost MGS-esque artwork on some cutscenes. There were a few times where the voice lines or models bugged during a cutscene, and the character would awkwardly stand still while things were going on shouting randomly.A fair warning on the story. Hide the ♥♥♥♥ing peanut butter, because♥♥♥♥♥♥is about to get weird.I'd say 7/10. Definitely something for fans of both the DI franchise and older ps2 ""adventure style games""			"

												Where to start..First this is nothing at all like Dead Island or Dead Island Riptide. This is a very from point A to B type of game. With no real exploration.No leveling, skills, modding weapons. You get 2 guns and 2 melee.. atleast all I saw.The good things is there is stealth, you can sneak through most the game and collect ammo for boss fights. I also liked the art style.But that was all I could really like, the combat was more simple than megaman on the NES but so broken..melee attacks and gunfire seem to only hit when it wants even if you see it clearly hit the zombie. *You pick up medkits that say ""+1 Max Health"" yet you still die in 3 hits no matter what the entire game.*Moves like to throw a zombie down or power attacks seem to work when you didn't wanna do it, then not work when you need it.*The main character has the worst ego.. mix Logan from Dead Island with Dante from the DmC reboot.*The story feels all over the place like the threw darts at ideas and tossed it together.*And my god.. dying, dying itself isn't too terrible. You die, it teleports you back to the last save and even gives you a little free ammo to help. That I liked. But the fact you die, screen whites out then he takes like 20 seconds to stand up, look around THEN you can move.. Which really suck when you get a long unskippable cutscene.. and there are a lot..I came into this with a open mind that it won't be like the Dead Island I spent hours on ps3 and steam learning every secret and got lost exploring all day.But this was just... so poor.. I got this on a 3 dollar sale and even for what I saw, it was not worth it.This game is fairly rated a 2/10Would of been a possible 3 but that ending.. ♥♥♥♥ that ending..			"

												This game is quite enjoyable. It has its pros and cons but its nowhere near a bad game. i was a big fan of dead island and riptide so i decided to get this as well seeing it was only $5. I'm gonna start with the pros then the cons as i feel as though this game deserves a fair review.Pros- nice artwork (similar to that in the walking dead but with its own style)- good story- zombies- weapons do realistic amounts of damage - smooth combat - nice animation- runs very smoothly with very little performance drops- replayable- funCons- zombies seem a bit OP. they can finish you in 3 hits and if you're swarmed then you're ♥♥♥♥ed. especially if there's a spitter or 2 around- weapons are rare, unlike the previous games in the series- not open world. this isn't really a con but it takes away the dead island feel. the other games were so good because of the freedom to explore a tropical paradise swarmed with zombies- health gets depleted very easily which makes the game pretty hard at times (thats what she said)- lacks the dead island feel- can get quite frustrating at times and has quite a bit of backtrackingit's a pretty good game overall but if the health were a bit better, the zombies more balanced and weapons more plentiful then this game would be amazing. worth getting if on sale or if you enjoy the dead island games.

												Full disclosure, I didn't bother to finish the game on account of it being boring.

Pros: -Zombies-stealth killing zombies-cel shaded style looks not bad-taking pictures Cons: -awful dialogue-one animation for stealth kills-backtracking-an elevator wave scenario-unskippable in game cut scenes(there are some cut scenes you can skip though)-keycards, keycards, keycards-repetive boring combat-climbing ladders that go on forever -zombies respawn in areas when backtracking in the exact same locations  "

												Look, I rarely give a bad review. It's not that I didn't enjoy the game itself, but the many things that were wrong with this game. Escape Dead Island is a Third-Person open-world?, mystery?, Hack 'n Slash? I really don't know. It has nice cel-shaded visuals and all, but this game was drowning in flaws which sorta ruined the experience for me. It has a boring, confusing story. Crappy combat. A bad camera. Annoying controls. Awful voice acting. Framerate issues. Shallow and limited (supposedly) open-world areas. Useless in-game features (eg. Camera for ""supposedly grabbing"" intel). Irritating NPC's. And a crap-load of unused potential. This game isn't at all Dead Island, and although it didn't take anything away from me, it may to others. If you get this game on sale for $3 then it's okay, but I wouldn't recommend anyone get out of their way to play this. I personally didn't hate the game. It wasn't awful. It was just all the issues it had that took away from the experience. Unfortunately I can't give this game any higher than 4/10			"

												First of all I have never played any of the other Dead Island Games, but I just bought this one because I thought it looked kinda interesting and fun. Well, to put it short... It's not.I really liked the game in the beginning. I found the scenery of the island quite beautiful and while I didn't understand the story, as it is quite confusing, that kind of captivated me, as I wanted to figure out what was going on with my main character.Nearly 10 hours later I still don't know what's going on and I don't know if I ever will, because I'm not sure if I can actually force myself to finish the game. It is so incredibly frustrating. It's really just small flaws but they make the game so incredibly annoying to play. The worst one of them is definitely that the game sets its automatic checkpoints at the worst points ever, so that if you die in one of the main fights, you get put back in some stupid random ravine and spend the next minute walking back to that fight, in many cases just to sit through an unskippable cutscene again before you get a new attempt at beating the fight.Now if you kinda suck at games like I do, this can be incredibly frustrating as I often died 10s into a boss fight and then spend a minute walking back there and watching the ♥♥♥♥ing cutscene again over and over and over until I finally beat the boss. I guess you won't have that problem if you just don't die a single time, but if you do, and more than once, this becomes absolutely infuriating and frustrating.I really can't recommend this game because it brought me more frustration than entertainment. Not sure if I will even finish it.			"

												The game is in fact not THAT bad. One only needs to understand that it isn't a ""real"" Dead Island sequel nor Dying Light-type game. It is somewhat different thing and it can be enjoyable even if it lacks the complexity and depth of these titles. There is no real open world, only a feigned one. As in some older games, you cannot enter every area at first and you need to return to some places later (but I don't consider this a fault).CONS:- too expensive at 20 euros  (and it was horrendously expensive earlier), but when on a 50% sale, I think it's worth the money;- the character cannot jump nor walk over high ledges (it means you cannot fall over ledges, but hey, being not able to jump over a bench or table?);- the character cannot stand up from the crawl when too close to obstacles, and it spoils many ""silence-kill"" opportunities;- stupid old-console-like saving system;- voice acting - too exaggerate as for my taste, at least in the recordings you found during the gameplay.PROS (IMHO):- very nice, comic-style graphics (event if some textures ARE ugly);- funny ideas as visible words depicting sounds (consistent with the comic-style look);- a deeper insight into the original Dead Island incident (not too original though);- good music and sound;- nice character design;- just right difficulty (I hate games that are too hard, I don't have the time for many repeated attempts, I have my job and family to care for ;) ).

												I'm a fan of the series. Yes Dead Island typically has some issues and some annoyingly hard enemies. And Escape Dead Island continues that trend. While Escape is no where near as exploration friendly as Dead Island and Riptide, that's not really a bad thing. The story so far is good, if confusing. Combat for the most part is fun and engaging. And the stealth aspect is well done too.Graphics are a departure from previous games using a cel shading technique instead of realistic graphics. Cut scenes too are done in a different format, making them feel a bit like a comic book panel. But again this isn't really a bad thing. It's just different. Voice acting is decent. And the characters definately have more personality then in previous games. All in all I'd recommend checking it out. Or not. Games like this wont  be everyone's cup of tea.			"

												Let's get this out of the way - this is a very different game than the other Dead Island games, it is its own game that takes place in that universe.  It is a linear 3-rd person single player action adventure game that is heavy on stealth and melee combat.  You can use guns but they make noise which typically results in you getting swarmed and killed.   Taken individually, eveything here has been done better elsewhere but, taken as a whole, the result is a decent game that could have been much better with a few more months in the oven.Depending on how much time you spend searching around for hidden supplies the game is probably anywhere from 6-12 hours of game play.  In my opinion, it is not worth full price but if you can get it on sale (like I did) and you like this kind of game, you should be happy with your purchase.Score - 7/10			"

												Escape Dead Island provides the player with a sophisticated and well themed storyline. I really liked the dark themes of this game's story but there is one fatal flaw to the game as a whole. This flaw is the gameplay. The gameplay is built as a one on one and mainly stealth oriented and this is really shown when enemies come running at you automatically alerted to your presence. I really liked the story but the gameplay has many flaws. But since the gameplay is tolerable I will recommend this game.			"

The biggest problem with the game was the save points were before the uinskippable cut scenes! After 5 times seeing the same cut scene, I was ready to scream!  I did not like the side view shooting either.  Made it near impossible to shoot anything if it got to close.  With all that said, it was worth the discounted $ I spent on it.  I would not pay full price for this game.			"

												I loved this game until I got to the 'zombie' Cliff battle. I have gotten all the health upgrades, and the shotgun and 'super' axe, but I've come to the conclusion he's simply been put there to offer an 'end' to the game, but not by actually having it finished. Bummer. It was promising. I can't stand when games suddenly become unplayable due to one extremely hard 'boss.'			"

I give it a thumbs up because I liked it overall, but I wouldn't pay the full price of 19,99€ to get it.

												From my experience into this game so far, I am enjoying the overall style and gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone right now, but preferably get it during a sale when it goes cheaper. I only got mine because of the pre-purchase offer for the Dead Island 2 beta. This game really demonstrates a story quite unique in comparison to other Dead Island games. In the previous installments, the games were heavily focused around story-based RPG's, which were quite enjoyable. Escape Dead Island takes away some of those elements and leaves it down to the basic linear story, which in my opinion, is still quite enjoyable. The atmosphere in the game so far gives off a dark mood of a mystery so far in the beginning. (I can't yet explain the mood for the rest of the game yet since I have only gotten a couple of hours into it.)It may not seem or feel like a typical Dead Island game, however it is very unique in its own way. I would describe this game more as of ""Story-telling"" and ""atmospheric setting."" Honestly so far, it is an amazing game from the gameplay to its design. Again I do agree with many others that the price of this game could be seemingly overpriced and should/could be reduced, but the game can be worth the purchase depending on how you view the game personally.9/10			"

												While some might give it negative reviews because 'Escape Dead Island' isn't the COOP RPG Survival game like the other games in the series, they would be quite wrong to think it's a bad game.It's quite a great game! And easily replayable as well!Cute graphics (à la Borderlands), nice story, and quite entangling plot.The directing of the camera, and the gameplay aren't bad as well.--TLDR--Pros:- Cute graphics- Nice gameplay- Good Story- Suspense- Interesting Enemies- Interesting PlotCons:- Linear (not open-world) and backtracking- Single player (but has to be, since it's about a single character's story).- Few weapons that don't wear out- No experience for character			"

												It makes no sense why there are so many people who hate on this game. I guess its cause they were dumb enough to buy it at full price. Honestly I enjoyed this game and it was worth the few bucks I spent for it on sale. If people were smart and waited they'd enjoy the game instead of complaining about it. There is nothing wrong with this game. Its a normal 3rd person zombie game that actually has more shooting and stealth then I ever did with the other dead island games. It isn't extremely long but it isn't short either. They added a free DLC which is always a great addition. I kinda wish the main character wasn't such a jerk but I can live with that. Plus there were at least some answers to the mystery of what happaned in dead island 1. Plus I liked the whole crazy gambit, it really fit. Plus the artistic design was really well done. I kinda wish after you finished the game you could go back and finish all the collectables on the island but oh well. I'm not starting the game over from scratch to get them. The game was fun and I think everyone would enjoy this game when they buy it on sale.			"

												I waited on this title because there were so many mixed reviews. I think a lot of DI fans were upset because it doesn't play like the games have prior and I get that. This game is kinda an offshoot/prequel of the series and it really does avoid anything we may have done in previous games. Yes, there are zombies and bosses like past games but that's about where it stops. The game has a totally different art style and look, kinda shade cell like but cool enough to keep me engaged. The story is your average scavenger runs to get items that will advance the story,  provide answers or escape from your locale. The production felt a lil rushed and game is a bit buggy, lots of areas are just for looks and your character cannot go there. The controls seemed ok for what they needed to do. I did not like how when I died and came back it starts you right where you were, this totally screwed me with a boss who I died and spawned right by only to keep dying as I didn't have any time or place to go back and work up a plan of attack. A lot of the zombies were easily getting caught on trees or barriers and objects that were not even visible. Over all the game was work the $1.14 I paid for it on G@A but anymore than $5 and I would feel ripped off.			"

												I'll start off by saying that I am very glad that I did not get it for full price or preorder it (my heart goes out to all of you who did).The art style was kinda cool, but everything else was flawed. Story sucked, gameplay became tedious, characters were annoying; they couldn't even get the characters animations right with your weapons clipping through the walls when you struggle to open a door. Definitely a money grab, especially with that preorder bonus (EDIT: R.I.P. Yager ;_;).If you treat the game as not being part of the Dead Island franchise (like I did), you might enjoy the 1st half of the game. It just becomes so boring and pointless.After (regrettably) getting all the achievements, I can gladly say that I never have to see this game again (it's no wonder one of the least gotten achievements is to beat the game a second time).I'd pay an ABSOLUTE MAX of $5, otherwise pass on this.

												Unless you have played Dead Island, you haven't a hope of understanding the story in this game. Mind you, if you have played Dead Island, you still won't understand it. You spend the first part of the game trying to save a random chick, but then she dies - or does she. She then spends the last half of the game being a nagging shrew - or are you dreaming that. You try and chase down the other person you landed on the island with - a guy, only to find that he may or may not actually exist. Then your dad shows up in a helicopter, but then essentially tells you to get stuffed, and flies away without picking you up. You then have a lightning strike, and a hoard of zombies show up. Throughout the game, you continually phase in and out of - well, something. Maybe an alternate dimension? Who knows - and who cares. The developers were obviously high as balls when they made this game. Still, if you liked Dead Island (I did), then you may as well get this game, it attempts to explain how Dead Island became Dead Island.Some parts of the game force you into third person shooter mode, which is unfortunate, as the game is not setup to be a shooter. The graphics are quite nice. Characters? Well, you will either care about them or not (more likely the latter). The enemies with the long bladed hands are EXTREMELY annoying as they can (and will) deflect everything you can attack with (melee weapons and bullets). The checkpoint save system is reasonably generous though, only a few times will you curse having to re-do part of the game.			"

												Only catch this on a heavy discount, otherwise I don't recommend it. The first half of the game leads you to believe that it is a good game, then the last half is a mix of heavy backtracking over places you've been already two or three times prior, and a unbelievably long dream sequence with extremely frustrating fights. It took me no more than a few tries even on the hardest fight, but that doesn't mean they can't be horribly frustrating. When you have two spinning zombies, three spitters, 4 normal ones, and each time you kill a spinner a new one pops up, yea it gets a little frustrating lol. But the entire dream sequence at the end game as a whole is probably the biggest reason this game is a failure, that and the game has no rpg progression system and only 3 weapons in the whole game. A rpg skill gain system wouldn't have helped anyway because the game is just too linear. The last quarter or so of the game is a horribly long confusing dream sequence that is just not that fun because when it starts, you realize that from this moment on the game you were playing is gone and this dream sequence is going to lead you to the end. A huge disappointment of the last 1/4 of the game or longer. It made it all feel like everything I had accomplished, weapon upgrades and story progression, were all for naught. They copped out and threw the story in the gutter at the end into a nonsensical bunch of unentertaining crap.The sounds and music are good, the graphics are good, and the game runs very smoothly. The combat is smooth although very shallow, and as I said the story ♥♥♥♥ing sucks because of the last part completely ♥♥♥♥♥ing out.6/10 do not spend more than ten bucks on this which is what I paid.

												I bought this game at a discount of 6 bucks on a Steam sale.I don't and still don't understand all the negative feedback's on this game, this game to me is similar to dead island, and fact yes its not dead island, but I think its worth the money I spent on it, its a time killer game, it has similar missions as Dead Island, instead of crafting weapons you find Hidden Workshop Benches and on top of those you have a single weapon, from what I've seen so far, the game was better than what most people led on. if you are willing to play a unique type of game then play this, its just a game no reason to hate it anymore than what it is lol. I almost didn't buy this due to the bad feedback and I can ensure you don't listen to most of the feedback's mostly just trolls who hate anything that doesn't meet to their perspective. The game is Cartoonish, you do need a decent Rig to play this at high Graphics, The Graphics isn't bad considering its cartoonish, its like Team fortress 2 Graphics. But in a good way to me, I love the Comic like details put in place of this game, some people will love it, some people will hate it forever, similar to the Cartoonish Zelda game also. It has basic Weapon Schematics in the game, basic Shoot em up and Melee'r weapons nothing fancy, But love the Upgraded Weapons. The game isn't easy, But once you get the hang of the controls, which I customized mine, your good to go, So don't listen to all the haters if your willing to add this game to your Dead Island Franchise, To me I think its worth the add-on, and I think its a fun game.

												Amazing game! An intriguing story, good-looking graphics, nice physics and smooth gameplay. Generally, to describe this game you need imaging a cake, lets say multilayered cake: First layer is fundament and it is like The Lost (if u remember TV series about crashed airliner on the island). As a second layer add some FarCry3 with very fantastic psychedelic story about guy who's lost himself, blame himself and all around them but still keep the right way to find the truth. Third layer of our cake goes with some cartoon/comics style and on top of the cake pour zombie's cover. Done. Welcome to Escape Dead Island. P.s. I would like to notice that through all playing hours I did not have any crashes and game run very smooth on max setting despite the fact that I use my laptop with core i3, nv540gt and 4gb ddr3. Nice job devs! Looking for more interesting projects behind dead island franchise!			"

												I liked the story and the game mechanics till I got to the final chapters,  when the story lost any sense and it is easy to be killed than to kill any enemy. The ending totally disappointed me. Overall the script does not contribute to the original Dead Island serie.  First said us the epidemy started in Banoi, now resulted was Narapela. Frankly, when I saw Xian Mei, I thought that will be good connection with the events of Dead Island but not, not any really.Game looks nice and has good features of interest though. My other problem and that also made me to regret of buy it, were very annoying graphics issues: constant flashes of white light all the game, blinking screen, I got it totally white or sometimes red or green, which issues I could not solve with any driver for video card I tried or with any combinations of settings in proper game and in Nvidia control panel. Perhaps my card just does not  ""like"" the game.Do not buy it for this excessive price at least. I found it a bit cheaper but even though was too much.You see 0,1 h in 2 weeks I played this game.

												""Cliff in the Zombie Wonderland""Escape Dead Island has a strong start game but ends up with flops. I still recommend to try if it's in good discount, it's very different to Dead Island but it still has some good moments.Good:- Some brilliant prank and surprise scene like your daily nightmare rendered on the screen, it's weird level close to the famous Silent Hill (but not the monster design)- Nice island design, some environments really disturbing like the under water lab- Auto saved check point and auto regenerate health- Strong start story mystery settingsBad:- What I hate most, the Ending! Not enough explanations for what happened on all story characters, even I don't know they're real person or some kinds of ghosts.- Too few weapons variation, you won't even get the grenade, you got a screw driver from start to the end insteads- Too few zombie or monster variation. Very fixed attack pattern, you die bacause their health is much more than player only- Too many  un-necessary croaching tunnels areas and backtracking- Pathetic range weapon power, I can't accept or believe how weak is a shotgun in this game, even weaker than a fire axe! Zombie can BLOCK THE SHOTGUN SHELLS USING ARMS AND TAKES NO DAMAGE!! And fire axe actually is the strongest weapon in this game after level up- Ugly character textures, only some close up scene they make it little better for the media- Xian Mei is non playableVerdicts:After first 3 hours of game progress you can uninstall this game if you have somethings better to play, just watch other's walkthough to see the crappy ending and celebrate you didn't repeat the same mistake the uploader did.Score:6/10			"

ESCAPE DEAD ISLANDBetter than the main game series in my opinion because you are overpowered easier if detected by enemies which makes survival harder that is why i love the integration of stealth mechanics - fantastic atmosphere / eerie music / cel shaded graphics - also the underwater labs free dlc is long and creepy :) - you really feel caught in the story - like to find all the collectibles and know what's happening because the main character continues to have very weird flashbacks - to bad this spin-off will probably remain as an experiment - recommended 10/10 :)  "

												If you want to buy this, I must tell you that its nothing like the original Dead Island, but that doesnt mean its bad. Just grab it on sale. If you have an open mind you might enjoy it. This game is an adventure, stealth, fighting, shooter. It has its flaws like hitting through walls and unskippable intros every time you die at a checkpoint. Some parts are designed for stealth and sometimes you just have to run past everything. You just need to be patient and try to figure out whats the best course of action. Most of the time you can get away with melee though.Overall 7/10			"

												Half♥♥♥♥♥d story that makes no sense, with dull and lazy combat system. Entire game is basically a classic resident evil style game play but with more modern gameplay. Has same search for clues and items like resident evil which is basically the entire game is  based on. Not worth full priced.			"

												Fun game once you get use to comical graphics and werid words that show up along with any noise in the game, has a good storyline and pretty fun gameplay and combat with a little bit of a mystery, the ending sucked balls but oh well.Downside is theres lots of collectibles in the game but it gets to a certain point near the end where theres no way to turn  back and go look for them also at certain spots you cant return to certain areas so if you missed something in them then you cant collect them unless you replay the game which was very disappointing.The machine gun you get in the DLC is cool but sucks you dont find ammo for it outside of the lab. Otherwise the DLC was pretty fun.7/10 for this game even though its not really like the 2 other dead island games i still found it to be enjoyable, it definatly seemed more like the free to play dead island epidemic then the dead island games.

												I don't really understand why people have so much hate on this game. I mean, it's a third person shooter stealth survival horror game with cartoonish graphics (if you're a fan of borderlands you know what i'm talking about). It does have an enormous playtime with nice story (i haven't finished the game yet, still progressing), and also is hard as fock sometimes with some zombies.Pros:- Nice colorful design and art- Cartoonish storyline and graphics- YOU GOT A ♥♥♥♥ING KATANA M8.- Nice variety of different types of zombies- Very, very, very stealty game- I like the fact that got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of achievements :3- Voice acting not bad at all- It's a damn eye candy man.- FREE DLC's- You can customize your character and weapons (using certain dlc's in the game settings)Cons:- As a 144hz monitor user, it's capped at 60 FPS. Just why?- I would like more content for explorationEDIT: HEY CLIFF!			"

												So far from what I've played, I can say it's pretty fun although it's nothing like the original Dead island games however that doesn't make it bad, it's fresh, I like a change since Dead Island 1 and Riptide were basicly the same games. The graphics are awesome (I think it takes insparation from Borderlands just brighter) it's bright, colourful and just overall looks good, now for gameplay, I think the game play is fun as you can choose to be stealthy or just go all in hack n' slash and it's fun, however it can be slow and sluggish at times it's not all bad though.

												Game play starts off somewhat promising, but hits a downward slope pretty quickly and never recovers. At certain point later in the game, I decided it was unplayably bad for a number of reasons--glitches, lack of any sort of interesting story, zero creative aspects, tedious boss fights, etc. Frustrating and boring the player is a sure way to develop an absolute loser of a game.Let's be honest. Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide were glitch-ridden horror shows, but the design and playability outweighed those issues and made for a tremendous amount of fun. Escape Dead Island lacks the playability, the creativity (weapon crafting, anyone?) and just the downright fun of DI  and DI: Riptide. Melee combat is poor, guns are next to useless, and locked-arena boss fights (haven't games evolved beyond this primitive trap?) are needlessly tedious. In short -- this game sports all the glitch of the previous Dead Island games and none -- NONE -- of the fun. I paid $6.79 for this game, but since it's worth less than zero, I figure Deep Silver owes me a few bucks for wasting as much time as I did with it. (Then again, I'm the idiot who kept plodding through this terrible game as long as I did, so I'll let them off the hook.)We can only hope that if Dead Island 2 ever launches, it will surpass this POS.

												I feel the need to actually go ahead and post a quick review on this particular game. A quick bit of background about myself. When I originally saw Dead Island, I had absolutely 0 interest in the game. All I saw was the beach scene, over and over again, as my friends attempted to play it. I gave up on watching, but happen to run into the game again when it went free on Xbox. I decided to give it another go, and became quickly addicted. The story, weapon customization, and enemy designs were enough to keep me going. I ended up cranking out the game in 2 days and Riptide soon after that. As for Dead Island: Escape....well this is a different story. I will admit that I enjoy the art style of this game, and the combat can certainly be enjoyable at times. However, that is about where my enjoyment for the game ends. What Deep Silver had here, was an opportunity to create a short story in a fun artstyle that expanded on the Dead Island universe, so that we might be held over until Dead Island 2. What we recieved instead, was a game with unlikable characters, repetitive level designs and backtracking, rehased enemies and a dissapointing story. The last 15 minutes of the game had me so frustrated and disengaged that I considered just giving up on finishing the game. However, I pushed through and can safely say that I was extremely dissapointed in the direction that they decided to take with the story, at the end. In the end, I managed to get this game and the DLC on sale for $5 on greenmangaming this past week. However, I can't not say that I would not pay that much again for this game. It had such potential to be a short, sweet log into the Dead Island universe....If you are thinking of purchasing the game, save yourself the money and frustration and just look up any backstory from this entry online.TLDR: Pro/Con List:Pro: +Artstyle is appealing+Combat can be rewarding at timesCons: -Dissapointing story-Rehashed areas and backtracking-Unlikable characters-Repetitive enemy design-No unique weapon custimization			"

												**update** Just recently finished the first playthrough, so I've updated my review.**SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**Let me preface this with this, I love Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide. They're both just really fun games, despite any flaws. Didn't bother with the Dead Island MOBA.A lot of my time was spent inspecting almost everything, dying a lot, trying to stealth... It starts a bit slow but it's a pretty interesting game. Don't go into it thinking it will be like DI or DI:Riptide.**GRAPHICS / LOOKS**It looks like a comic book, kinda a bit like Tell Tale's TWD. I like the looks and you can certainly see why this look was chosen as the story progresses.**STORY**TL;DR + spoiler - I think the story ended up just being a bit convoluted as some things weren't really clear. Maybe because it jumps back and forth in time and is kind of a mindbender as your character deals with having been infected and losing his friends.---Takes place 6 months after the events of Dead Island. There is a brief tutorial at the beginning where you play as some agent (who appears to also be a ninja) sent to collect intel of what happened on this island and what this company Geo Pharm has to do with it.In the main storyline, you play as Cliff Calo and you're part of a 3-person group going to investigate and write a story about what happened on Banoi. You start off exploring the island, taking photos, and then things start to get weird...your boat mysteriously sinks and you think you can save it but start to drown, then you wake up in a cargo container far from the beach, friends nowhere to be found. It is now you actually run into zombies and have to make your way back to the beach. Once there, cargo containers start falling from the sky and hits you. You then wake up inside a container on the beach. You are bandaged and your friend says they saved you from the sinking boat. From here on out, it will jump back and forth in time, and you deal with different zombie types along the way. But that's only the start of the mindbending story, as your character deals with having been infected and losing his friends.**GAMEPLAY**It kinda felt like it could end up playing like the original DI, but it only kinda did. Light and Heavy melee attacks, a couple guns, explodable barrels, some of the same special infected...no weapon modding, but you can find upgraded weapons as you progress.The gameplay is linear and pretty simple but requires some good timing to quickly avoid attacks and then attack. I like the stealth aspect. It allows you to sneak up and silently kill zombies. Zombies lying on the ground will get up if you attract attention. If stealth isn't an option or you choose to attract attention, be prepared to fight off a couple zombies at a time. This is where the dodging might get tricky. But don't worry, you will regain your health. As for when you die, I think it's pretty cool how they handle that. You DO start back at the last checkpoint, but the transition seems pretty seamless. It's like you fall to the ground and then stand back up and you're back at the checkpoint. No waiting at traditional loading screens.I played with a controller and the weapon swapping is a gripe, mostly when surrounded, but it could maybe be changed in settings, but I didn't bother to check and just dealt with it.**VERDICT**All in all, my verdict is it's kinda slow to start but then the story gets very interesting and trippy and the graphics help the story. It's kind of a mindbender because of the jumping back and forward in time and how the world changes to reflect the infection.Will recommend for those who love Dead Island and those who like mindbending stories.

												First i am a huge deadisland fan i have played them all multyple times across alll the consoles and pc so my review might be biased . So first of this game is amazing i love stealth and it sure has alot of stealth game play even though it is very basic i found it fun . The graphics rock i love the vibe and words popping up when you bash a skull in at times and to my surprise i have yet to find any glitches or problems , also it feels like the first splinter cell were a lot is a straight path and then there are open areas were you have choice . There are a ton of collictables to find and the most amazing thing is the story i am bloody hyponatized and want to keep playing just to find out what happens next and it is nice for fans to see some returning members even though it is a prequel . For the price it is a amazing deal if you like stealth games , zombies or a diffrent graphic style compared to most games i would highly recomend it . I hate giving a number but it would be 8/10 and as i said it is a biased review since i love deadisland and stealth games but the story is what made the game great fun for me .

												Finished this in about 9 hours. First the bad: terrible script and voice acting, cringe worthy bad and not being able to remap the right mouse button. Why is this still a problem in games? For ♥♥♥♥ sake let me remap everything right from the get go. That’s it for the negative. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved this game, I loved the graphic style, the combat was satisfying, stealth mechanics worked well for me and it genially had some great horror atmosphere in certain parts. Even the story was interesting, weird and confusing like Silent Hill. Default FOV was fine although pushing it, any narrower and it would have been bad. I loved that your characters clothes and equipment changed visibly throughout the game (reminds me of Freedom Fighters). It even had that Metroid vibe where you go back and revisit areas once you get the right gear and never got repetitive. I really don’t understand all the negative reviews regarding this game it’s like they played 5 minutes and decided it sucked. Stick with it and it really stands out. I love finding games like this that are generally hated but I really enjoy, Trespasser, You are Empty etc. If you are a Dead Island fan or a zombie fan try this game out. You just have to get past the terrible dialog. It went on sale for dirt cheap not too long ago so just hold out for another one.			"

												God I should have listened to the reviews.  Please do not spend money on this game.   The fact is that the story is somewhat interesting.  The character development is interesting and the descent of your character into madness and beyond is interesting.   But this does NOT.  In ANY way.  Make up for the fact.  That this game is basically unplayable.   PLEASE, do not make my mistake and think that for some reason the short-comings make up for the good parts.  They don't.  Don't buy this game.  Don't play this game.			"

												You start off as a Russian Ninja called Kilo(Rob) who is a after Mole. Kilo then kills Mole and a monster kills him. Then the game starts off. You start off as Cliff on a boat to an island close to Banoi in search of a story with two other young Friends. You are the camera man. The ship you are own is destroyed after an earthquake and you are stuck on a ""dead island"" an island full of zombies.Game not Awful nor Great but Highly Priced!  (wait for a sale; only pre-ordered for the beta key)Great visuals (looks bad on youtube).Linear - no sandbox.Lots of Dialogue.Character Lips not moving when it is not a cutscene.Weak story.Still waiting for my Dead Island 2 early access Beta Key :(Bug at around 35:26.6.8/10

												Okay I read the reviews on steam and noticed it got a 2 on metacritic. I'm thinking this has to be big wheels trucking bad to warrent such a low score. I just played Dead Island 1 and 2 so i decided to give it a shot anyways.  I played it and I realised it isn't THAT bad. Curtenly not enough to give it a 2. I would say it is at least a 5 out of 10. Worth getting if its around $5. If a Zombie B-Movie was a game, this would be it.  This game is playable and it does have a plot though some things just plain didn't make sense. Like med kits increasing health by 1 but your health isn't listed.  It's more like your playing the game to fill in the plot left out of the first 2 games.  The game is a stealth collect info type of game, so the monsters are more or less trying to stop you from getting the info. This game prob won't appeal to people who have not played the whole  Dead Island series.			"

												I definitely like hte style. This cell-shading and those comic-book sound-words suit it. And I like that it is an original story with loose (at least currently) connections to original game. Adds more depth to the lore of Dead Island, IMHO. In terms of gameplay I am still on the fence at the moment: it started off, practically as a slasher, then turned into stealth. Stealth is not bad and this approach does seem a bit more realistic, that brute head-bashing of the original (although it was fun). The story also has some intriguing points. I only wish there was ana ctual health-bar and ability to jump (jsut for some extra fun), but I can live without them.			"

Borderlands meets Dead Island in this Zombie infected romp. Escape Dead Island is a Survival-Mystery game set on the enigmatic island of Narapela after the events of the zombie outbreak of the original Dead Island. The story lets players unravel the origins of the zombie virus through the eyes of the would-be documentary journalist Cliff Calo. There are no superpowers to keep Cliff alive, just a few makeshift weapons against hordes of infected zombies. It will be integral to choosing wisely between stealth and combat at certain moments in the game. - Recommended!			"

												escape dead island is a spinoff game in the dead island series. it's a hack n' slash/ steath game which is in my opinion one of this years best games. I know that's a bold statment but the game's launch was good, it has a compelling story, and still manages ti have really good psychological horror themes ( it isn't scary at all ) but in summary this is one of those over looked games that is great 8.5/10			"

												While this game does have somewhat good game play, the health system is this games biggest flaw 1-2 hits your dead thats like really unfair that makes increasing your health completely useless.  Not to mention the styled graphics are a complete disgrace to dead island that kills the horror in a way.  Spoiler alert the ending is freaking impossible! Dead island isnt about freaking psyc stuff its more or less about biological stuff. you only get 2 guns the rest are melee at least in the other DI games you get more of a selection.  And no new game plus! you dont start with your weapons!So good things........gameplay (using melee weapons n guns) 3rd person pov neat3/10 cant believe i wasted my money on this garbage!  believe me when i say the game can be unfair, the ending they spawn so many zombies you get overwelmed that its physically impossible to beat without cheating!please for the love of god stay far away from this game its just not worth it anymore			"

The balance of play is bad, lots of walking around for 10 - 15 minutes followed by killing a bunch of zombies and then repeat.  Definitely not worth full price.  The graphics and cut scenes are sub-Borderlands.  The zombies are taken from the original games, but they were not the draw.  "

												So far really good game.It´s not the traditional Dead Island we know, with co-op, first person RPG. But its great.Art is really strange but interesting, adds some freshness into the game.Controls are also pretty decent, I am using controller for playing and I am happy. Cant give any proper words about keyboard+mouse controls, but I recommend controller.There is a prologue mission that cannot be skipped where you play as an unknown character and search through an unknown place. I must say its a really good start of a story, even I wasn't expecting.Rest of the game is set on the island of Narapela in Banoi archipelago. You play as Cliff Calo, the you son of a, I think its a reporter or someone similar. He and his friends want to uncover the mystery behind the mysterious events on islands... *SPOILER AHEAD*Cliff stole his fathers boat to be able to sail to the islands. Cliff's friends thought they are going to visit Banoi, but when they reached the island Cliff says they are not going to Banoi.  It was Narapela. The island seemed pretty peaceful, but they soon found a problem, if weren't zombies, but earthquake hit them and sunk their boat. Cliff was trying to save their stuff, but he was hit by an explosion and drowned. That's where the fun begins. Cuz i don't get it myself.*END OF SPOILER*Also, fine launch, no bugs or crashes for me, runs great.			"

Wow what an unbelievable game!I want to start off by saying that some people think this game was made by the same ""guys"" who made Dead Island 1, this is wrong. That was sh*tty TechLand whom moved onto Dying Light after being shamed into the horrible coded mess we got from DI. Sure it was all published by Deep Silver but they didn't MAKE this game; that was Fatshark.Anyways, the gameplay is less open-based and more linear objective although at some points midway you can free roam and explore other parts of the island. There's lots of secret collectables and unlockable/hidden weapons you can find so exploring is a very good idea!The graphics/animations are amazing, and look a lot like BorderLands, with that sharp black outline around everything.The combat system is very fun and simple, there's even a stealth element where you can keep un-alerted from other zombies by silently killing them from behind. I can't help but notice the execution animations look A LOT like ManHunt 2, very well done and very gory!The storyline is great, you go on a so called ""restricted"" island to see what's going on and try to prove that you're more than a drunk child to your Father. The characters are memorable and everything has a lot of hidden backstory to discover.The guns are very useful, but when you have a horde circling around you it's almost impossible to aim at one since they're so sporadic.The game also gets ridiculously hard near and at the end; throwing different stronger and faster zombies at you so it's a good but get-you-really-p*ssed-off like challenge.Sometimes your character doesn't switch weapons or reload when you tell him to which is annoying, but if you happen to die more than twice in the same spot, the game is kind enough to give you free/extra ammo for all your weapons.Overall, I think this was a fantastic game. It went on a little too long I think, but it was still good.Much better than the broken mess Dead Island was so you can't complain.8/10 "

												OK, I’m done with this steaming pile of crap.  I did not and do not want to finish this colossal chunk of crap.  I must say I could not be more disappointed in a game as I am with this.  I really liked the way it looked and the trailers for it made it seem interesting, but do not let them fool you. IT IS A GIANT PILE OF CRAP.  I was lead to believe this would have some stealth where you could sneak around and/or silently take out some of your enemies.  This happens every now and then but most of the time you are overwhelmed by zombies and have almost no chance of beating them, so you must replay the same crap over and over again until you find a way around it.  This is compounded by the crap save point system that will make you walk or crawl back to the battle you just lost for up to a minute.  At one point I tried to fight off this giant zombie over and over for about 30 minutes only to find out that you must run away to get to the next cut scene.  Movement is sluggish and really sucks in a fight as you try and try to dodge but just stand there.  Sometimes it would just switch to the stupid camera in the middle of a fight.  Oh switching weapons was always a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ half the time when I tried to get the pistol I would end up with that stupid camera again.  So most of the time you just go around killing zombies but get no reward, no xp just nothing, there is no incentive to killing them other than to get by them.  I was hoping for a good story line and there may one be, but I couldn’t careless because most of the notes and tapes you gather are in the middle of battle areas so you can’t stop to read or listen to them.  I stopped caring about the store about 2 hours in and just gave up after 8 hours. It just isn’t fun to play, in fact it may be one of the most frustrating and rage inducing games I have ever played.  As I said before this is a steaming pile of crap, do not get it at any price.			"

												Escape Dead Island is one of the best Tactial shooter this game is for the fact that the look of the game is beatuiful and how the game plays some or more then the time is weapons and how great some of the weapons were in the patches but it is a real fun game of you want to get scared or killing this game is for you but. of you don't like that then leave but i leave you with this get busy killing or get busy dying.

												Just a horrible button masher that hopes it can hide in the Dead Island mythos. Do you like backtracking? Do you like stealth kills that aren't really stealth kills? Do you like games with horrible, horrible autosave points? This is the game for you! The game thinks it's being clever with it's twist, except it's been in practically every other Dead Island game. I own all the DI games, and this is the only one I'm sorry I bought.			"

												I just finished this game and came to the conclusion I just wasted 7 hours of my life.This game is a shame!No story line whatsoever, if there is any.Lineair to the highest degree and a lot of levels you have to play a least 5 times during the game so that is called a very cheap game design.How the plot was designed ... wel my quess is the game designer must have used a lot of LSD because the word psychedelic can be used as game experience, just a long road of suffering the images and boredom to get it done.Too bad this game was based on Dead Island series, quess they had to try to get some more money out of it. 2/10			"

												Not worth buying this game for the full price!This game gets verry annoying over time. And is not fitting into the Dead Island series.- Strange story mode, strange hallucinations trhough the whole game. This makes the game completely diffrent from the Dead Island series.- Strange and sometimes quite difficult ingame action controlls.- Automatic save point, which are followed up with ""ingame movies"" which can not be skipped. So when you die, you start again at this automatic save point, and you have to watch these ingame (sometimes quite boring) movies over and over until you get to the next save point. This makes the game verry annoying.			"

												Ok, this has become one of my new favorite games even though it has its share of issues. First off, if you are looking for a game that is like the other Dead Island titles, you will be disappointed. The story line follows the protagonist Cliff Calo through his exploration of Narapatela island somewhere in the vicinity of Banoi. At the beginning of the game, you see the three main characters (of which only Cliff is playble) headed for what they think it Banoi. However, Cliff informs them that they are not going for Banoi, but another island where an evil corporation called GeoPharm has been doing experiments on test subjects with the virus. First off, the game is a third person shooter/hack and slash so if you're hoping for First person, look elsewhere. Much in the tradition of games like dead rising, there is a camera aspect that will require you to take photos of items and points of interest as well as characters. Pros: The art and environment are amazing and immediate put you in the feeling of being on a deserted resort island. You feel completely immersed in the graphic novel type feel. The storyline is also excellent with enough development of Cliff's character that make you sympathize with his plight. The weapon design is excellent and each weapon feels and sounds very authentic. The Katana is my favorite weapon while the lever axe reminded my of the sledgesaw of dead rising. Collectables- there are enough collectibles to make the game interesting without it feeling like overkill as in the case of Assassin's Creed or Arkham City type games. The voice acting and sound is quite excellent and all the voice actors play their parts well.  Cons: -Some cutscenes can be skipped and some can't, this results in a lot of extra time especially annoying if you die and have to repeat a section-you never know where you are going to respawn if you die and collectibles don't carry over unless you've hit a save point (denoted by the red bloody ribbon on the right hand of the screen). -There are many glitches throughout the game even on high end hardware. On several occasions, I got stuck trying to navigate a piece of terrain and had to restart the game -The weapon switching menu is not always accurate and several times I would switch to the incorrect weapon or the camera by accident. This is especially annoying at key transition points or boss fights. -I found myself backtracking a lot in this game, which is some of the fun of it, but sometimes the map was not exactly in line with the direction or objective I was supposed to be heading towards. -The melee combat can be annoying at times because the stamina drains very quickly when sprinting and doesn't give you any chance to level that aspect up. -The weapons sometimes have aiming issues especially with the pistol and it would be good to get the silencer for the pistol earlier to allow for more judicious expending of ammo. -The butcher zombies which you will recognize from the main game are in my opinion the hardest zombie to defeat even with fully upgraded weapons. -The spitter zombies are also annoying because the take away a lot of health and can quickly kill you if your not careful. -The most annoying part of the game is the health system because the medkits you collect don't really get stored anywhere. You just add a point here and there to your max health. -That said, this game is definitely worth a playthrough and looks awesome on Console and PC. Highly recommended for an Dead Island, Dying Light, or Dead Rising fans! Will update this review soon now that I've beat the game and going to attempt a second playthrough.  "

												Mild spoilers here.The good- Initially somewhat intriguing story: unravel the mystery of dead island. Turns tedious along the way though- Voice acting is okay for the most partThe average- The controls take some time getting used to, at least using a control pad- The cel shading graphics fit the setting, nothing special here thoughThe bad- 99% linear gameplay- AI is awful; the challenge is based on confined level design w/o room to maneuver- Especially towards the end ecounters get very frustating. I guess they had to stretch the game in order to resemble the   struggle you're going through- The ending leaves to be desired: no closure. Perhaps they want to catch up on that in EDI 2...If you're bored through a free weekend it's worth a shot at 80% discount - don't bother otherwise.3/10			"

												It seems to be a mostly entertaining game. Good enough to keep me occupied and the controls arent TERRIBLE but there are certainly moments that make no bloody sense. It seems like the collision control when you are crouching is glitched because I have been crouched with NOTHING around me and it said I couldnt stand up because there was something in the way.Oh wait, a soda can...that must be the reason I cant stand up while being attacked by enemies who CAN stand up xDRandom litter is always an excuse for things not to work.But hey it kept me curious on what comes next and I kept playing despite that its an irritating bug.

												I like the game. I like cell shading. But watch out if you want a typical FPS. There is no jump move, so you are tied to the ground like a rail shooter unless the game needs you to jump or do something. The gameplay is sort of simple at first, but i have not played the entire game yet. All in all, was worth the sale price. Neat game			"

												Review: Positive almost NegativePros-The storyline is a little bit confusing but it's an okay;-The artstyle is astonishing;-long-term game not short but not long either;Cons-The Combat is horrible horrible;-Variety of weapons horrible;-Difficulty chaging trought out the game horrible;Going to explain, why did i choose positive.Besides the pro and cons are balanced on this case, this game made me felt like a kid of 7 years old playing a new game on the playstation 1, and made me play all in a single day. (I advice to buy the game only on sales) Peace!			"

												So. Before I start writing this review I must say, that I bought it for 3e even in JRC (which is really expensive shop here in my country). If I would actually bought for 15e, I would not recommend this game. Its good, but nothing blasting. Graphics are cool, gameplay too, but some cutscenes and stuff are sometimes disguting for me. Might be only in my personal opinion. So if you want to buy it - buy it cheap. Then you will not regret the ""few"" money you gave in this.			"

												I am a huge dead island fan! but this game is not that great. it is merely ok, nothing more.the story didn't make any since at all. all the teleporting from here to here, waking up here, then there....really stupid story...it was interesting at first but after completing the game and NOTHING is explained? kinda killed it. not to mention the ending was crap.PROS:fun graphicslots of weaponszombiescombat mechanics are cool and uniqueCONS:shadow zombies....nuff said...the story didn't make much sense at all.story was bad regardless if you understand it or notVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ENDING!! I mean cmon...some parts are hard enough to make you rage throw a $3000 dollar computer cross the room.I enjoyed the gameplay throughout the first 80% of the game. it was fun. all the way up til the shadow zombies kicked in. i thought this was a stupid, really bad idea, not to mention this part is so over the top difficult it's not funny. i like a challenging game but there are a couple parts in this that are way over the top.if they make an ""Escape Dead Island 2"" I doubt i will play it.overall rating 4 out of 10, doubt i will play this game again.

												This Game is so hilariously mediocre that it's bad! I am on the verge to rage quit this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥It could have been good, or at least something better. But despite that this game tries to be something which it isn't, it gives you waves of enemies of enemies of enemies and if you dont defeat them you get back to the last checkpoint and now guess where the checkpoint is.It's so frustrating.The worst thing though is, that the developers wanted to make an Alan Wake Clone and had to do something with the Dead Island Trademark. There is no other Explanation for this confusing story, crazy protagonist and this somewhat cool levels but that does not fit in the Dead Island Universe. Different Gameplay is fine, but srsly stick to the Universe. Or i will make a Star Trek Game with Lightsabers in it.			"
