												As a fan of the original Genesis/MegaDrive game, this was everything I wanted from a remake. Great gameplay and music, levels and bosses reworked enough to keep it fresh, and beautiful, fluid, cartoon-like graphics.There are, however, issues with this game being a sloppy port stuck at 720p/30fps. Luckily the resolution and framerate have been fixed/hacked by the community. It's also been updated a couple times since I last played, so the issues might have been fixed by now. Regardless, the PC Gaming Wiki page should have any info you need to get it running right and it looks incredible at 1080p/60fps. As I recall you might want to force AA and AF through your video card for optimal visuals.http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Castle_of_Illusion "

tl;drA heart-felt and beautiful remake of the 1990 SEGA classic: Mickey Mouse and the Castle of Illusion.  I had high expectations for this modern reimagining of what is ultimately my favourite game of the Fourth Generation.PROS+Every level, every detail lovingly recreated and updated+Stunning art and music design+Smooth and responsive at 1080P/60FPS+Full controller support+Brilliant take on the old Mega Drive classic+Two music schemes to choose from (original soundtrack or modern soundtrack)CONS-Does not include the original 1990 game that is included with the retail console version. It's sad to see it missing from the PC release.-Three to eight hours to complete depending on how completely you explore each levelFor Disney fans, platforming fans, and fans of whimsy, this game is a buy!(Suitable for all ages and skill levels)Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.  Thanks :D			"

												Perhaps I'm just a cynical bigot blinded by nostalgia, but in my eyes Disney has lost quite a bit of its magic in recent years. Instead of the delightfully imaginative works of their glory years, we've been ""treated"" to an abundance of derivative shovel-ware and cash grabs, all relying on their branding and marketing instead of actual quality to make them a success. A remake of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive classic, Castle of Illusion could have very well been just another mediocre licensed game, but to my absolute surprise and delight it is anything but; a whimsical joy of a platformer that pays homage to Mickey's past, while bringing him into the modern day just as enjoyable as we remember him.Opening like the typical fairy tale it is, Mickey and Minnie are just setting out for a picnic when the witch Mizrabel spies the pair and gets jealous, swooping in and kidnapping Minnie, with the goal of using the damsel's youth and beauty to rejuvenate herself from the old hag she is. Mickey will have none of this however, and thus enters the titular Castle of Illusion to obtain the seven magic gems, cross the rainbow bridge, and get his girl back!Like the 1990 original, CoI is a basic platformer whose strength lies in its imaginative levels and environments. Each stage is unique and bustling with creativity, from a giant library full of bouncing letters and slinking bookworms, to a world made entirely out of sweets that has you swimming through jello and bouncing on cookies floating in a milkshake river. There are so many charming little touches in every location you traverse that I couldn't begin to name them all (and doubt I saw even half of them). Sega perfectly captured the happy-go-lucky mannerisms of Mickey, right down to the trademark hop in his step and chip of his voice, an attention to detail which extends to every secret area and extra path, and makes for an immensely enjoyable game. I gleefully made my way through every level never once tiring of the seemingly endless stream of fantastical places I was sent to, but alas every good thing must come to an end and CoI does so all too soon.For all its wonder and the many things it gets so very right, CoI is over in a heartbeat (around 2-3 hours to be exact). This short-live adventure seems to end even more abruptly, do to how easy it is to jump from one level to the next and how quickly and seamlessly they flow together. In a sense it's about as long as the average animated movie (which almost seems intentional, opening and ending with the camera panning out to a theater), but for a $15 game it had me wanting more. I say that however with the caveat of wanting more because I loved my brief time with Mickey so much. Castle of Illusion is a pleasure and has given me hope that Disney is still capable of creating something with as much heart and wonder as what made them a household name in the first place. If Mickey Mouse has ever meant anything to you, you owe it to yourself to play this lively tribute that does as much for giving the icon a proper video game outing, as it does a starting point for what could (and hopefully does) come out in the near future. It's pure childish fun that capitalizes on its goal of being a lighthearted game that almost anyone can enjoy, recapturing the magic of yesteryear for the new and old generation alike.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Let me start by saying that the old school Castle of Illusion on Genesis / Mega Drive remains one of my favorite platformers today.Let me also say that I was hugely, hugely, hugely disappoint by DuckTales Remastered, which I found boring and lazily done.So I went into this with low expectations ... I mean, how do you live up to a classic? Not sure it's possible, but I was extremely please with the updated Castle of Illusion on Steam. Great game. It does an excellent job taking the source material as inspiration and trying to update it without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over it.StorylineSome witch kidnaps Minnie while she and Mickey are having a picnic. Typical hero save damsel in distress. It works. My only minor complaint is that the intro kind of dragged. The story is so generic that it really seemed a waste of time to draw it out.GraphicsWow. The developers did a great job with this. Whereas with DuckTales Remastered, where the characters looked great but everything else looked like crap ... I was dazzled by Castle of Illusion at ever step. In particular, the second level with the toys ... everything was beautiful.GameplayHere's where I had one of those ooh ahh moments. The old Castle of Illusion is purely a side scrolling platformer, and for the most part, so is the update. However, the developers cleverly integrated some 3D parts into the level design. Not too much. I'd compare it with a great movie director using just enough 3D elements without going overboard.Level designGood variety. There's swimming, jumping, swinging, running-to-avoid. And again, all levels are beautiful. That said, the best levels in my opinion are the first two. After that, it's okay, but not as great as the first two levels.CollectiblesIn each level you can pick up a card, model and / or chili. And these get you concept art, statutes and costumes (which you can switch into by jumping into the mirror on the third floor). I didn't bother much with completion. I'm not a collectibles or achievements ♥♥♥♥♥. But playing through once normally, I got one outfit and one statute.PlaytimeI got through this in four hours, without chasing collectibles and achievements. It was short and sweet, which is how platformers should be. The unskippable credits were annoying, especially as it's just names scrolling on a black screen, but I don't care too much about these things.Overall rating: 8/10. Probably loses a point or two for level design not being consistently great throughout.			"

												If you weren't alive or competent to enjoy the Genesis version, SEGA did you a friggin' favor here. Jump on toys, throw apples at mushrooms, and platform like its 1990. This version doesn't just take your grandma's oldsmobile, and slap a new coat of paint on it and hang a few trees from the mirror; this gem is done from the ground up and is fantastic.			"

I had a lot of fun with this game to the point that i had a big grin on my face as i was playing it.Only downside; the game is about 2 hours long and possibly less if you get as little collectibles as possible, even though you can squeeze a couple more hours off it if you aim for 100% completion, but aside from that it's an amazing game.

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- A superb re-imagining of a Sega Megadrive classic, the nostalgia is there with the same themes, characters, collectables and music but a total overhaul of the games graphics.- The new graphical style is visually beautiful with bold colours and clever themes.- As you'd expect being a Disney, and specifically Mickey Mouse title, its completely child friendly.- That said, the game is every bit as challenging as I remember it. It requires quick thinking, reflexes and a lot of patience.- Lots of various things to collect for your in game trophy room heightening replay value.- This is a platformer which can compete with all the best titles of today.- At 3 hours long…if you're skilful enough, this game is just the right length.CONS:- Despite being child friendly I think gameplay is too difficult for the younger audience, I can imagine it will be every bit as frustrating as I remember it on the Sega Megadrive and with no difficulty settings in sight, this could pose a problem.- Why you can skips animations at the start of scenes and levels after death is beyond me, the credits are also very long and cannot be skipped. This is frustrating if you died a lot, like I did on the final boss battle.VERDICT? This platformer has it all, it does everything well and is a superb re hash of a classic.			"

												I have never played the original Genesis game so I'm reviewing this remake on its own merits. Castle of Illusion is a platformer starring everyone’s favorite circular eared rodent, Mickey Mouse. The Evil Queen/Witch from Snow White (The game gives her another name but it’s totally her, right down to her saying she wants to be the fairest of them all.) kidnaps Minnie and tries to pull a page from Grunty’s book by stealing Minnie’s youth and spirit so it’s up to Mickey to venture through the Queen’s castle to save her.The game is a real solid platformer, and while it’s not hard and pretty forgiving, it’s still got a lot of charm and its fun. The game looks really nice, what with its vibrant locales and cartoony charm. The level design is quite neat and Mickey will have to traverse through a candyland, a library, an ancient underground temple, and the castle itself for example. At the end of each area is a boss fight and these tend to be fun enough, though funny enough I had much more trouble with some of the early game bosses than the later ones. One problem the game has is that it is quite short, it feels like they could have had more levels. You see Mickey has to collect seven gems to get to the Queen’s throne but there’s not an area for all the gems, so you miss out on like two whole areas. Also some of the hit detecting can feel wonky at times, but not enough to be a real problem.I bought the game recently because Sega is pulling the game from digital distribution at the end of the week. It’s a shame because this game is good, so be sure to grab it here or on Humble Bundle and Bundle Stars while its on sale for like $2 before the game is gone for good.			"

Naturally, I was excited to play this one (which I never had before.)However, after only two hours of this game it's almost ended and this is my biggest dissapointment.The graphics are awesome, and I think the game is targeting the younger audience (It can be slightly challenging sometimes though.) but to pay 12 euro's for this? I don't know.. My advice:Fun to play, but wait till it has 75% off. This makes it worth it's value. 7/10			"

												An ode to simpilier times of platforming. This is a platformer at it's heart and 3D platformer. The hero of this game is Micky Mouse. If your worried this game is too kidsy to play, it is made for young children, but there are some challenges to it too, like collecting rare items on each level.  There is not really a storyline, but it is decent for what it is. The music is great too, as it reminds me when i played simpilier games. Recommended for platforming fun with Micky Mouse.			"

												I played the original Sega Genesis version constantly when I was a kid, so I had to grab this.  The upgraded graphic style respects the original pretty well, but the controls are just too awkward to enjoy.  It feels like the controls for a test game where the developer just added a random speed and jump force and nobody ever checked it.  This essentially ruins the game, which is unfortunate because literally everything else was fairly high quality.			"

												The original Castle of Illusion is a quaint platformer that came out on the Genesis before the likes of Sonic and all the ridiculous clones that followed. It's a short but memorable journey through five unique worlds as Mickey tries to rescue Minne from a witch. Not quite a classic but thoroughly competent and entertaining.As far as remakes go this is one of the better titles I've played. Instead of going for a shot by shot remake, this edition focuses on taking the setpieces of the original and re-imagining them. Bosses have more ornate patterns, there are optional areas to explore, and fans of the original will see familiar areas filled with different challenges.Actually challenge probably isn't a word I can throw around when I talk about this game. This version is quite a bit easier than the original. The difficulty curve is more balanced, and doesn't have absolutely brutal enemies or force Mickey to survive long stretches while having only two or three hitpoints to work with. While Castle of Illusion is a short game, I actually don't mind. This is probably due to the era I grew up in but platformers with dozens upon dozens of stages tend to just wear me out. The developer behind this game took what was available in the original and stretched it out just enough. You're not going to see a bunch of stages with only slight differences or a couple gimmicks between them. The pacing is reasonable. Whenever you have an afternoon free, you can run through this game in its entirety and get the full experience.The controls and mechanics - the life-blood of any decent platformer - are very well-done. As far as complaints go I only have one, the soundtrack. The best Castle of Illusion tunes are the arranged versions of the original. There are a couple songs exclusive to this remake but they're bland and uninteresting. An option exists to use the Genesis music in the game, which is nice although it tends to clash with the voice-work(expect to hear Mickey and a narrator talk fairly often).All in all this is a solid title.

												Is the game recommendable? Yes, if you enjoy platformers and a Disney storyline. The actual story was a bit corny, but the game itself was pretty entertaining and well-made, with half a dozen semi-interesting boss-fights. The game is however only a few hours worth of gameplay (to 100% it even), so it serves as a nice game to play when you feel like playing something casual.Castle of Illusion is first and foremost a remake of the old SEGA Genesis game by the same title. The game is in essence the exact same as the original, in the sense that it features the same maps, the same boss-fights, the same enemies (mostly), but it does so in what is literally a future version of the game. Back in 1990 when the original was made, the majority of the mechanics they made use of in the remake (2013) were simply impossible to achieve, such as making use of 3D gameplay. While the 2013 remake is mostly a 2D sidescroller (staying true to the original), it does on occassion let you run freely in a 3D space, and it does so very seamlessly while entering and leaving those spaces. The remake's art is basically based on the same art that the original had, but with a major overhaul in actual graphics and style, as in, you will find the same type of forest, the same kind of castle, the same kind of various areas throughout the remake that you found in the original, just with a modernized style (aka the remake is not a 16-bit game :p)			"

												The graphics are cute, and the controls seem simple enough.  However, the physics drives me nuts.  There's no consistency with jumps- how high, how far, he moves back and forth before landing, etc.  In a platformer, moving and jumping is all you have.  This game is too frustrating for me to play.  Even on the very beginning levels, the controls are too frustrating to get basic jumping mechanisms.  It does say it's better with a game controller, so maybe my problem is I was trying to use a keyboard.  Still, that's no excuse for having a game that's so frustrating to play it isn't fun.			"

It was a pleasant surprise to find that although this is not really a remake at all, but instead was a whole new game based on the themes, enemy movements, and basic premises of the original.  Hence we have a classic based on a classic.  The game will move from 2D to 3D seamlessly, and without any controllable camera, so if you don't like this (like on Yoshi's story to some degree), you might dislike the game.  I found it to work well combined with charming graphics and fun but simple platforming.  The boss fights are interesting and unique, and the final boss fight is a satisfying challenge.  Throw unlockable costumes to the mix for collecting hidden secrets and you've got a great game. "

												This is probably going to be an unpopular review, but I was really dissapointed and as both a lover of the original and a lover of platformers in general I felt it worth to point some things out.I grew up playing Castle of Illusion on the Master System. I love platformers, and I wanted to love this game. But I can't. It could have been great but it feels unfinished. ConsMy biggest complaint is that it is not fun to play. The enemies are designed almost exclusivly as gotchas so that you have to replay the levels until you remember where they all are. The character controller (the controls) is total garbage. Virtually every other platformer you have played have better controls. Rayman, Guacameele, Mario, SMB, you name it. The controls here are floaty, the hitboxes are bad, the enemy positions deliberatly mean. There are plenty of other niggles mostly related to polish, but those are the main ones. The game is also really /really/ short. ProsWhat this game has is beautiful level design with a great atmosphere. There were hints of magic that brought me back to being a kid. There are nice voiceovers. This game should have been epic. But it has been let down by bad controls and lazy mob placement, probably done to make the game longer than it is.			"

This is a game where you sit back on your chair and relax by playing it.Pros: beautiful levels, nice music and voice acting, Disney magic, makes you feel like you play an old school platform gameCons: Short, Very easy, Price(13 euro for 2 hours game), No service, patches or updates from the developers (No game icons on steam and there are also performance issues 30 fps) Final Score: 06/10			"

												A pretty good 3D sidescrolling platformer that occasionally turns into a troublesome 3D movement platformer. It has a very nice look to it, and all of the non-gameplay stuff is pretty great. I just encountered issues with knowing where I was going to land in the non-sidescrolling bits, which lead to frustrating deaths, and just overall negative vibes. The rest is pretty awesome though. Surprisingly challenging at points, for some fun reasons, amidst the not so fun reasons. Worth picking up on a sale.			"

												The art of this game is gorgeous, obviously because it's Disney. The controls are pretty easy but some of the levels in the beginning don't seem very easy and might discourage play. But once you get past the pesky ones, it gets pretty good. Just be careful where you jump...there are tons of pitfalls that are hard for someone like me who sucks at virtual par-cor.			"

												I was a bit afraid to get this because of Ducktales: Remastered falling short. But now that I finally played Castle of Illusion I can say I really liked it. Even though I played Castle of Illusion on the Sega Mega Drive back in the days, I did not go into this game expecting it to be excactly the same experience. It had some frustrating moments like the MD version (the good kind), however it seemed a bit easier overall but not too easy.It's a good platformer, with nice levels that speaks to the imagination. Very suitable for children and adults!Playing with a  controller is highly recommended.If i'd have to give a slight negative point then it would be that the game isn't that long... BUT! there is a time attack and some collectibles to stretch it a bit if you are into that.So yup I recommend it!			"

												As a longtime fan of platformers, 2D and 3D, this was an obvious purchase.I love what they managed to do with this game. It blends 2D sidescrolling platformer, and 3D platforming into a near seamless experience that manages to incorporate elements of old and new into a wonderful experience. Now, it might seem ""easy"" at first, but let me tell you, that like any 2D platformer of the time, this is quickly thwarted once you get to the later levels. If you want to get EVERYTHING, it's going to cost you. Some of the later levels, like the library and the castle, are most definitley a test of what you've learned throughout this adventure.The boss fights are mostly just pattern memorization, as there is no randomness that would otherwise make it harder, and they're all on set patterns. As long as you memorize what order a boss does something, you should be fine.Overall, if you want a fun platforming experience, and want to just have a quick romp, give this a spin.			"

												Castle of Ilussion is a good remake from a classic plataformm game of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive where you play as Mickey Mouse who must rescue Minnie from the Evil Witch Mizrabel who keeps her hostage on the castle of ilussionThe thing that I most like about this game is that respect a lot the original source, while still including gameplay elements that couldn't be possible in the genesis/megadrive, like 3d movement.The controls are a little stiff at the beggining, but once you get the hang out of the game you will be enjoying a lot his mechanics, and ven though this game is a little short and sided to the easy side if you finish it straight away, you can still play some ""bonus stage"" if you could call it like which are not that hard but still are entertaining and give a bit of a challenge. Besides, even if the challenging aspect of this game is a little dissapointing the game is still a great experience, the graphics are gorgeous, the music is superb, and the story is entertaining and lighthearted so easy to enjoy, also the narrator does a good job on insert you into the storySadly this game will dissapear from the store on 2 more days, so if you have some bucks left, buy this game, is an good, albeit short experience which is good enough for 15 bucks			"

												On my desktop pc ( i5 , 8GB ram and gt460 ) the game doesn't want to work. I'm playing it on a laptop ( i3, 4GB ram and gt540m) and it runs so slow to be unplayable. Even without post processing and anti-aliasing, and at low resolution. It' so frustrating that a few times I almost thrown the pad against the wall.For what i saw, the game looks nice. It is not a port from the old genesis version (and I would have preferred it was ) and sometimes you have to walk around the 3d environment. It would be fun if you shouldn't have to struggle with the crappy controls. Some levels are very inspired, some not but this can be said for many other games.By now, I don't feel to reccomend this game, especially if like me You loved the original game. In hopes for patch that resolves performance problems.			"

												This reimagining of a Genesis game has beautiful artwork, music and voice acting. In addition to distinct ""themes"" on different levels, there are level design concepts that make levels less monotonous (e.g. sublevels in area that can turn upside down, switch of perspective). Having said that, it has very annoying controls, and even with the controller it's rather difficult to do precise actions due to loose movement and jumping lag. This is IMHO a very serious problem given the nature of the game. Made worse since the level and boss fight design includes many areas that require precise movements and have instant-death possibilities. I'd say that this combination of control issue and level design issue contributes to much of the ""playtime"", given that the levels themselves are actually not that long.I bought this game at 75% off, and even at this price I think there are other games that offers better value for money. Not recommended at all at full price. It's really unfortunate since given the quality of other aspects this could have been a very nice game.			"

												Castle of Illusion is a really fun platform game. It's all out running, jumping, stomping your enemies, swinging, swimming, the usual. You collect diamonds along the way to unlock the subsequent levels. You don't need anywhere near the 800 possible diamonds to proceed, however. More diamonds, chili peppers, statues, and playing cards unlock costumes and really bland concept art as paintings in the castle. The story is a traditional Disney fairy tale. Mickey and Minnie are in love. The witch captures Minnie. Mickey goes to save the day. The narration reads like it's from a child's storybook. It's nothing that will blow your mind, but if you love Disney, you'll enjoy the story. Mickey and the other characters sound great, exactly like you'd expect them to, though their dialogue is limited.The graphics update for this game is phenomenal. It's gorgeous artwork in the traditional Disney style. Level design is exceptional, reminding me of the charm of games on the original Nintendo and Genesis systems. Each level has a theme and all the obstacles fit well within the theme. At times the game makes you move quickly as platformers traditionally do and you need to make quick reactions as the floors fall out from under you. It does feel like a bit of a memorize and repeat formula at times and can be a bit frustrating if the checkpoint is a bit further back. Boss battles are unique each time, as the various monsters have different themed attack patterns. The forest tree boss rolls like a log, the toy world boss is a jack in the box that jumps around and tosses a spring-loaded boxing glove your way, etc. The controls are very simple and worked perfectly on the XBOX controller for Windows. I would have liked an option to pan the camera to look around the immediate area for hidden collectables (as that is a significant part of the game), but it's not that big of a deal. Sometimes I would just make a jump to see what I could find. A few times it paid off. Other times, I fell into the abyss. Once I couldn't see what was on a platform I needed to jump to and a bookworm bit me. I think that was just a random glitch though because that area didn't have the same problem again. I never had any other technical concerns about the game. It's a rock-solid game.Sometimes, the game switches to more of a 3D perspective instead of side-scrolling. It's rarely used. You can play an entire level with one camera style and suddenly the boss is in 3D mode, so that can be a bit counter-intuitive. It's slightly challenging to judge the depth of your jumps in this mode, but it's not that big of a deal.I would recommend this game, but not at the $15 price point. It only takes about 2 hours to complete the story. Then you can repeat the levels of your choosing any time you want as time trials. Combined with a small system of collectibles, the game does present some replay value, though the collectible rewards aren't really that exciting.			"

												That evil, no-good hag of a witch Mizrabel (HA, Miserable...get it?) is at it again—no longer content with attempting to murder Snow White for being prettier, she's kidnapped Mickey Mouse's main squeeze Minnie in an attempt to steal her youth. Armed only with his plucky attitude, dogged determination and a mean throwing arm, Mickey immediately sets out to rescue the love of his life from Mizrabel's lair, the titular Castle of Illusion.Castle of Illusion takes the 1990 Sega Genesis title and spiffs it up with some voice-acting and sharp graphics, but at its core it remains a side-scrolling, two-dimensional platformer.It looks like Sega Studios Australia enjoyed twisting the concept of ""side-scrolling"", though. The linear stages mix up the traditional ""go right"" design by taking advantage of the new three-dimensional engine. Paths weave into the background or curve along cylindrical towers in twisting, circuitous routes that double back on each other at unexpected moments. Some stages even shift to a top-down perspective, allowing Mickey free, unfettered access to all three dimensions of movement.Also new in this remake is a hub area where Mickey can roam around, viewing anything he's unlocked and can select levels to journey to, provided he has enough gems to unlock them.The levels are whimsical affairs - Mickey travels through exotic locales like haunted forests, undersea ruins, and a world of sugar and candy found within a cup of tea. Accompanied by the ever-present narrator, Mickey navigates these fantastical lands in pursuit of Mizrabel's henchmen and the seven rainbow gems they carry. These gems will open a path to the boss witch herself at the top of the Castle.Of course, with new dimensions comes a change in controls. Mickey's jumping skills are serviceable, but feel weightless. This shift makes leaping difficult to control, and the top-down segments can aggravate the problem with the lack of depth perception—it's sometimes hard to know if Mickey has jumped high enough to clear his jump.Swimming segments are where the controls suffer the most. Mickey has all the maneuverability of a steamboat, and requires constant buttonmashing to travel with any speed. Mercifully, these swimming sections are both infrequent and brief.Other than the somewhat floaty controls, there are no real flaws in Castle of Illusion. It's a short game that's easy to complete in a night or two, and it offers collectibles for those who want some replay. It's charming and well-polished, but players craving challenge might be disappointed. On the other hand, people wanting to relax with something that doesn't require a huge investment of time or effort should consider joining Mickey on his newest mousecapade.Recommended "

												Awesome! Like playing it back in the days. It feels great playing a platfomer in which the environment doesn't make sense at all. You don't feel the need to explain why there are letters ""A"" attacking you. LOL! What I like the most is that they stuck to the original game and upgraded it a notch in its Level Design. The only problem I had with it was the floaty controls and it isn't such a good idea to have that in a platformer. Especially when it switches from a 2D sidescroller  to a 3D platformer. If you can get passed that, the game is quite fun and entertaining. I hope they remake World of Illusion! *_*			"

It starts out very easy, but slowly increases in difficulty with a good pace. It has simple controls in a rather dynamic 3D platformer type of world. While it is very direct, you still feel like you're on an adventure and can find treasures along the way. I'd definitely reccomend this game to any of my friends, and everyone else for that matter. It does have a short play through time, so you might want to catch it durring a sale if that kind of thing matters to you. It does however have a little replay value for those completionists out there, and individuals who just like collecting outfits and what not in games.9.5 out of 10-short story			"

They make a really good use of a lot of various mickey's games an environement into it and it came out quiet nicely and adorable.If you want to play the original, jsut download the SEGA ROM on steam . . .Also the game look like playing a real cartoon animation when in 1800p with AA(just a little poorly optimized)The only bad pont of this game would be the length of it. . .

												If you're into 2D platformers at all, you're pretty much going to want this as soon as possible. And I'm not talking the newfangled sort of platformer that's all about being mercilessly difficult by putting spikes everywhere. This is a real, genuine classic-style platformer, and it's fantastic. If you've played the original, it's worth getting for how much they've changed from the Genesis version. There's new levels, new bosses, the old levels have been expanded upon, or even changed completely.If you haven't played the original Castle of Illusion, there's a lot here if you like 2D platformers. The platforming itself is really well done, and the game itself never gets unfairly hard. In fact, it's pretty easy up until the final stages, where you might have to spend a couple of continues. There's also a few parts where the game goes into 3D, which never last for long, but are used for a lot of interesting level setpieces. It also looks fantastic, although the new soundtrack is sadly pretty generic. Personally, I prefer the classic soundtrack, but that's just me!Basically, if you want a platformer that's made the way that platformers USED to be, go for this.			"

												From what I've played this is a simple, cute, charming game that feels polished and well-made. Great for kids or anyone who is fond of old-school or simple platforming gameplay.Not the world of depth, but it's hard not to be impressed by how clean and polished the whole experience is.			"

												This game is a great platformer, but you have to keep in mind that kids are the targeted audience here. I found myself thinkinga bit about how to get all the diamonds in an area and even going back since I missed one or two. I like how they always show you how a danger works in a safe area before making it count.I think it's going to be a short game since I've already done some good progress in less than an hour. Still, totally beatable by a kid.			"

												This is a kinda mixed review.  The game was beautiful, the gameplay was fun albeit basic, the music and sounds were awesome, but I beat the entire game in an hour.  The first time I got 2 gems in one ""world"" I was confused about how they would extend the gametime, but they never tried.  The only thing that would make me go back is to try time attack (and it gives you an achievement if you complete a single level that way, or go back trying to find the rest of the ""hidden"" items or gems.  Overall, I'm glad I got it for dirt cheap, but even on sale, it's probably not worth it :-/			"

												OK, I just finished the Castle of Illusion remake: it's a firm 10/10. I've got a little more to do before it's 100% clear, but it's yet another candidate for my Game of the Year.Castle of Illusion (the Master System version) is a game I counted as my favourite since I was around five or six years old until recently when The Binding of Isaac challenged it, but Castle of Illusion is rock-solid and Binding is buggy as heck; it's still great, but Castle pips it by virtue of being faultless, basically.So this remake was a long time coming and something I had a lot of nostalgic and, frankly, emotional stake in. The remake is actually of the Mega Drive version of the game (which I don't like as much but is still a good crack), but the principle is thus; the ""...of Illusion"" series is very dear to me, and this remake is more than worthy. It take the basic elements of both versions of the original game and expands upon them sensibly and non-intrusively. The spirit, the feel of the game is bang on. It's incredible just how charming this remake is, and how perfectly it nails the Illusion magic. It makes the recent 3DS Epic Mickey: The Power of Illusion look even more like the insult it was. Screw Dreamrift for daring to put the word ""Illusion"" on their piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game.This remake is perfect. Sure, it's taken me just shy of two hours to finish it, but those were two hours where at no point did I say ""for ♥♥♥♥'s sake"", two hours I spent grinning like a loon, completely enraptured by the sheer friendliness of the game. Ten out of ten, everyone should play this. The studio have disbanded so there will not be a sequel and if there is it's a risky proposition. This was a once-in-a-lifetime thing and Sega Studios Australia pulled it off with incredible ♥♥♥♥ing skill. Props to them and I hope their staff all find success at whatever they do.Castle of Illusion (2013) reminded me that video games can be as fun, charming and engaging as they were when I was ten, playing cartridges my uncle brought me home from the market. So, bless it for that.			"

												Ah, this is the good stuff right here: ""Castle of Illusion"".  Yeah, baby.  Hey, look buddy: I'm a grown-up.  I like bourbon after work, fixing motorcycles on the weekend, and watching my wife cook me breakfast in her bathrobe.  But dang it if I don't love me some ""Castle of Illusion"".  Nothin wrong with that.Almost every one I know who owned a Sega Genesis back in the day played this game.  Today, I have kids myself but you better believe I'm going to play this game first before I let them get their hands on it.This is a remake done right.  Not only will you enjoy this game for the nostalgia factor if you played the original back in 1990, but it's a solid ""collect-the-items platformer"" as well.  Short, yes, and nothing ""rogue-like"" about it (and that's a good thing, just like the original!),  but absolutely charming and entertaining, improving upon all the reasons why the original game was so great: pleasing soundtrack (same tunes-- thankfully, nicely re-arranged and re-done), surreal graphics, solid character control, and the newly-added option of being able to return to any level to grab up those items you might have missed on your first (or fifth) run.  Bottom line: only the most jaded hipster rogue-lover would not find this game fun.  Do yourself a favor and pick this game up before you buy ""Super Indie Hamster Runner"" or ""Sandwich Simulator 2014"".  You'll be glad you did.  And tell 'em Okihara Jones sent ya!			"

												Nice little game. This game is inspired in the original Castle of Illusion, so nostalgia plays a big role. The game has really nice graphics and sound. The environments are nice and really different. Each act is different from the last. The game runs smoothly and I didn't find any bugs. Game play wise it's a mostly 2D platformer. Nothing new or unexpected.My only complain about the game is it's length. Even going for 100% and getting all achievements, I didn't reached 7 hours of game play. And I played each stage twice. So, nice nostalgia filled game, but only get this during one of the steam sales.			"

												With its vivid visuals, tight controls, solid level design and omnipresent Disneyesque flavour - it's a perfect game for children. Veterans of platforming on the other hand may feel... disillusioned (ha!...). This is because while the game makes a good attempt at recreating the experience once offered by its Megadrive/Genesis predecessor, it's simply far too easy and short to meet the needs of an avid gamer.Overall it's a good platformer with neat presentation - thumbs up from me.

Good soundtrack and a nice narrator that adds to the atmosphere in the different stages.Cons:The game has a very short campaign and its an easy game! (took me about 2 hours and thats with hunting some hidden extras) My guess is that if you wanna go 100% it should be around 3-5 hours totalMy verdict:I think the game is well worth a look at BUT I think the price tag is abit high at 12,99 euro. But its a nice game that made me smile.So if youre intrested in the game but are unsure about spending the coins then my advice is to wait for the game to be on sale.			"

												If you are looking at this game for nostalgia reasons or a challenge, look elsewhere. A decent player will finish it in under 2 hours. 100% in 6 or less.If you have kids that are young (seven and under), then I can recommend it. My nephew has trouble playing it, but he does enjoy it. So does my niece. They die a lot though, so I hacked it to give them 99 lives.The game has issues and is at times unplayable! I don't know if these issues are system specific, but it will often stutter on certain resolutions and refresh rates. On a different system, I couldn't even launch it because the monitor didn't support the res or refresh rate that the game was defaulting in. I had to find a regedit hack on the forum to force the game to launch windowed so I got manipulate the settings. Pretty silly considering how simple it is.			"

(See my playtime: I've beaten it.)~ Bosses are rather easy.~ The game is never insultingly easy, always keeping you a bit tense, but never particularly challenging either, not even in the end.- Second half is much less polished than the first.- Difficulty curve is occasionally uneven.- There is almost no progression in the difficulty curve: last levels are only slightly harder than the early.- Unskippable cutscenes. Most importantly, there's an incredulously lengthy unskippable credits scene which you must watch in entirety before the game lets you access post-game content. What the hell?			"

And spoiler alert:  It has a happy ending.Gameplay:The 2D stages work out fairly well. You run, jump, swim and throw apples. In other words, it's pretty much the same as the original. As for the 3D stages, the controls weren't great. Sometimes it's hard to go where you want to go (using an analog stick). There are six boss fights in total. Some of them are really easy to beat while others require you to memorize their attack patterns to beat them.Graphics:The parts where you actually control Mickey look really good, but they could have put some more effort into the cutscenes. I don't know if they used the slideshow style just to make it feel more like a fairytale out of a book, but I didn't really like it.Music:The music I thought was great. Perfect Disney fairytale-style music.Overall:6/10I'm not really sure whether I should recommend this game or not. It looks good, and it is a decent platformer, but it's quite short, and the controls aren't great. I remember playing the original at my friends house and really liking it, so I wanted to like this remake as well... but it's just not that great. So in the end, I recommend this game if you can get it cheap. 50% off sounds about right.			"

												This game is amazing. I have never played the original Castle of Illusion but this game is beutiful! Like, the graphics look really good! It's a 2D platformer with Mickey Mouse! What more could you want?My only complaint is that the controls are a little sensitive. It might be because I am using a crappy Dell keyboard or I am not using an actually controler.			"

												I have no idea how I missed this gem on the store up till now. It's a fantastic remake of a Sega classic that I used to play at my neighbor back when I was a kid, and I never got to finish it back then. The graphics are crisp and packed with vivid colors, animations are great and Mickey is very agile mostly because of great responsive controls.All the classic levels are there in a brand new and shiny light, but what really makes them pop out is the added 3D depth that enables you to enter the backgrounds of the level. Boss fights are fun, and the last one is just brilliantly done.Awesome arcade, awesome game - go get it now for your quick nostalgia fix!			"

												Very good platformer with a nice difficulty curve.The collectibles are very nicely and interstingly hidden, so there's a little bit of replayability there. The addition of costuems is pretty cool, one of which you earn through collectibles.The bosses ramp up in difficulty very nicely and some of the latter bosses, are even decently challenging. If you're a platformer vet you won't necessarily die to them very often, but you'll respect the challenge they present.The whimsical animation and dialogue is very nice, very much what you should expect of a Disney title. The only downer, I would say, is the intro story and the outro story. Corny is a restrained word I'd use to describe both of them.All and all, a pretty good game for the price, do reccomend.			"

												90's nostalgia platforming all nicely wrapped up in a Disney package. It's short, surprisingly difficult, and quite campy, but it's still fun. The controls are tight and function perfectly with the precision jumping. The game looks nice and has some fantastic art design. It's just a shame it's on the short side and there aren't any additional challenges to complete once you've beaten the game, unless you're an absolute completionist.Pick it up for a cheaper price. It would be worth it within the $5-10 range if you're into Disney and 90s era platforming.

												It's a shame this game is going to be gone soon but I got my chance to try it out, it wasn't a waste of cash this was. I enjoyed the music, the classic soundtrack inside of it. The levels are simple but tricky unless you know what to expect. A simple run, but just a good like the 16 bit Sega Genesis game!			"

												I thought it was alright. The platforming was solid, but the game in general was really easy. It was also pretty short, I guess I was expected a longer experience, not entirely sure why they didn’t just have a set of levels for each gem instead of giving you two gems in the last two worlds. It was probably short for me since it is obviously meant to be a game where you go back and collect everything, but that sort of gameplay just bores me and I’m just not a completionist. Either way, the experience was enjoyable while it lasted.			"

												Not a remake, more of a re-imagining with modern graphics and 2d/3d platforming.Looks cool and runs well, Entertaining enough. I basically finished the story of it in around 2 hours, dunno how long it would take to collect everything but I am not sure you would have the patience to unless you are a child.Altough not hard or difficult, there are spots in the game where you will die and retry alot. Considering it is aimed at kids, I feel it would have been better being longer with more content rather than having so many spots you will have to repeat alot. Especially considering the $17.99 price tag I can't say it's worth it.All in all, can't recommend it if you pay full price for it, glad I got it dirt cheap.But it is okay. Would recommend if it was under $5.6.5/10			"

												This is an absolutely beautiful remake on the 1990 Sega Classic of the same name. I used to spend hours playing this game as a kid on our Sega Console and despite the fact that I found it incredibly difficult I loved it none the less. This remake fails to disappoint. They have rebuild it exactly like it's original down to the last pixel. The same music, the same enviroments, the same sound effects, with the only differences being a beautiful 3D enviroment, Mickey having a voice and having a Narrator to give you extra information along the way and when you get stuck.For anyone who used to play the original back on a Sega, this should be a must have for you. The challenge of the original is still there and you won't be sorry you have it.10/10, gorgeous!			"

(Older games can get away with this; it was a simpler time)- if you die at the final boss fight, you have to re-watch the cutscene. I hate that :lPROS:- Visually appealing- Pleasant BG music- Pleasant means to kill timeDo i recommend?Not really.

												Castle Of Illusion is one of those games you thought would never be remade or even thought of. It's an early nineties video game for the Sega Genesis. Most children that are into video games now weren't even born when it was released. I remember going into an A and Z video store and seeing the title always rented out, but they always had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy of paperboy, I digress. Castle Of Illusion Remake is a short sweet game that captures the sprite of the original. In terms of length it should take no more than one hour to complete, again, this hearkens back to the original 8bit/16bit days in terms of completion. The only thing with this port of the game, is that you cannot turn off fxaa, so the game has a slight blur to it, and it's not really optimized, I was getting slight frame drops on a 980ti. I bought this game for $4 bucks, and it was worth every penny. So if you are in the mood for a trip down memory lane, or you just want a cute platformer, I would highly recommend this game.			"

It's not all about nostalgia though, the gameplay itself is entertaining for a platformer. and for £10 or so, you can't really go wrong with this purchase. at worst.. a younger family member will enjoy it. Don't let the fact that it's a Mickey game fool you either. They've stayed true to the roots and kept the difficulty level quite high. which is nice.   The best part of hte game is no doubt the amazing soundtrack.. which again, is true to it's roots. The music has stood the test of time and is as good as it was 15 years ago.			"

												5/10I played about two thirds of the game and decided I had enough. I don't mind dying and playing the same section again and again, but I do mind that the game punishes me after I died one too many time and reverts to the begining of a level, a good 10 minutes lost (and quite a few checkpoints).Pros+ Many aspects of the game are well designed and are highly polished. Graphics, maps (excluding checkpoints / save system), music, narration - are all very professional.+ Who knew playing as Mickey Mouse can be fun for an adult? It definitely is for large parts of the game.Cons- Save system and checkpoints are very poorly done. The biggest issue is the one I described above. In addition, if you exit the game and then start it again, you can't resume from the last checkpoint. You're just dropped in the main hall of the castle and you need to figure out which room you visited last. At least the game remembers which parts were completed.- Controls. So so bad... specifically platforming on the Z-axis is very difficult with a D-pad. It would have been much easier with classic FPS-like keyboard+mouse controls.- When you die in boss fights, you have to listen to the same narration again and again, and again. Luckily it's possible to turn off narration, which I temporarily did in boss fights.If you don't mind seeing later parts of the game (spoiler alert), this is the part that I couldn't cross because of the terrible controls. And this is how far back the game decided to drop me for failing to pass.Both links are part of an edited walkthough, so are more compressed compared to how long it actually takes in practice (at least to a player of my modest skills). Just watch the section between these two links and think if it makes any sense to punish the player and force him/her to replay the whole thing instead of just starting again from the last checkpoint.Considering the poor the level design and frustrating controls are, I just cannot recommend this game, regardless of cost.

												Castle of Illusion is a remake of the classic Genesis game of the same name. When Minnie Mouse gets kidnapped by the evil Mizerabel, it's up to Mickey Mouse to venture into her Castle of Illusions, collect the Rainbow Gems to defeat Mizerabel, and save Minnie. The game is a simple platform game that combines 2D and 3D gameplay. You jump and throw objects to defend yourself against Mizerabel's minions. It's colorful graphics, wonderful music, and fun gameplay is what makes the game shine. There are a lot of secret passages and specific items to collect which will unlock artwork, statues and costumes. The only thing I don't like is that the narrator can sometimes be annoying as he narrats througout the entire game, but other than that, Castle of Illusions is a fantastic remake. Being more familer with platforming games I found this to be somewhat of a breeze, with it's share of difficulty. Course I'll be kept busy if I decide to complete the game 100%. So in conclusion, this game is wonderful. Newcomers might find the game challenging, while old school gamers will find this to be a walk in the park and relive some nostalgic memories.			"

I beat it in 2 hours so it barely was worth the $3.60 I paid for it on sale. It actually probably took me about an hour and a half not including the time it took to retry parts. The only part that was even slightly challenging was the last part of the last boss fight. It took me four or five tries to get the pattern down to beat the last boss. One thing that I really liked were the graphics which are pretty good.If you can get it even cheaper than I did, it might be worth your time. Otherwise, skip it.6/10			"

												This is a 2,5 hours game, replaying levels to get all secrets may get you some more hours but non-completionist will probably stay in those 2 hours.I would recomend the game at full price if it had BOTH Castle of Ilusion AND World of Ilusion (or even allowing to play the classic version would be nice), but as it stands I can only recomend this buy on sale and if you played the game as a kid and always wanted to finish it or want to revive the memories and see the ways the upgraded the game.

												This game needs REALLY GOOD HW (and few patches, my opinion). On default graphic setup veeery slooow movements and delays on controll input (like in sirup or jelly)...even after some performance-improving graphic tweaks (turning of vsync i.e.)  is controlling this game very painful, clumsy and imprecise. Compared to ""Duck Tales Remastered"" is this Sega port big piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥though the graphics is really gorgeous and sexy.			"

												Bad character models, might look good for kids under 10y but for me they all look like plastic toys made by Lucifer. Mickey have huge feet that make huge steps so it is very hard to stand on small surface and rotate or jump on it... also if you move with 2 arrows (up and left for example) and try to jump, you will not jump... so if you are using keyboard you must use 1 arrow than jump and than fast click other arrow in air and hope to land where you wanted to. If it was arcade without 3D moving through space and if characters had little more soul in their model than maybe i would like this.			"

												Let me first say that I never played the original Castle of Illusion, so I'm judging this game by what it is on it's own.And what it is is a rather short but all right platformer with excellent presentation.  The storytelling aspect, narrator and all, is pretty good.  The level and enemy visuals are appropriately creative and ""magical"", evoking that early ""Harry Potter"" feeling of wonder.  But the gameplay itself is ""merely ok"".Castle of Illusion is pretty easy for the most part, though the difficulty does ramp up toward the end.  I died a few times to almost every boss while figuring out the patterns (I'm a bit slow when it comes to this), and had to use a continue on the final boss.I had some strange drops in performance in most levels - strange because while my system doesn't quality as a ""modern gaming rig"", an i7-920 w/HD4850 shouldn't have had any trouble running a game with these graphics - which while rather nice looking, aren't exactly complex.   And this was with Anti-Aliasing disabled.It should also be noted that this really is a very short game - it took me just under 3 hours to beat.   It would obviously take longer to 100% it (get all the gems and other collectibles in each level) but if you're like me, you don't care about that kind of stuff.  As such, I'd recommend waiting for at least a 75% off sale.  I think I got my $3.74 playfire reward's worth out of CoL, but I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that.			"

												Personal Rating: 8 of 10A classic 2-D platformer resurrected by Sega with greater graphics, sound and levels. The game is beautifully done and it manages to capture the mood and suspense moment perfectly. Gameplay can be rather challenging at times specially boss fights. Your goal to is collect colored gems by progressing through each world and ultimately defeating the evil Mizrabel. Each stage (except boss fights) has hidden treasure such as trophy, diamonds and unique collectibles which unlocks costumes! You need to dodge, jump and land on enemies to kill them (or throw stuff at them). Overall this game is great to kill some time and great for kids. I mean its Mickey...whats not to like :)			"

												Keep remastering games like this and we'll keep buying them. When I was a kid I owned and played this game and loved every minute of it, and today that hasn't changed much. This game is still an amazing game but now it looks even better.The gameplay is the same as it was when it came out on the Genesis/Mega Drive, sometimes punishing, but as fair as all difficult games in the old days.You begin by running through a level of whackiness until you get to the castle, there you can save and start new levels of whackiness. There is something magical about this game that comes from the nostalgia factor combined with it being a really good platformer. It is a semi 3d/2d experience that reminds me a little of mario 64 at times. (a little I said.)Pros:+It may be a shorter game than you are used to, but its quite challenging at times. Because its gameplay comes from a time when games were much more difficult, there are times when you may end up repeating the same thing over and over trying to make a jump or get a crystal or apple or something. It's forgiving but not by much.+It looks quite good, remembing its based on a game that came out in 1990, that's 25 years ago at the time of writing this. They took all that gameplay and redid all the graphics creating a contemporary platformer that still feels like a classic.+ It can be hard, but not overly hard. It's not a remake of battletoads or anything, and I imagine compared to games of its time it was not considered hard, however games today are quite easy in comparison so kids playing this today may find it a little difficult.+The music and sound is really good, and they give you the option to choose the contemporary updated music or the classic stuff from the game, something they didn't have to do but is really appreciated.Cons:- The controls may take a few to get used to. Like I missed several jumps because I didn't get the timing correctly, or I thought it didn't jump when I pressed it, however after about 15 minutes it was all good for me and I corrected whatever issue I seemed to be having.And let me be clear this isn't really a problem, but I thought I'd list it to give warning if someone played and thought ""What the heck?""Originally I thought I'm not sure this game is worth $15 but having tried it I can say they put a lot of work into making this game look like a contemporary game, and its definitely worth the price tag. For kids who like everything explained or a big sign telling them where to go, they may not like some of this game. At times I wondered if I was going in the right direction, but I realized it doesn't matter, the game won't let you really make a mistake in that way, however you find yourself doing the same thing over and over until you realize, ""no I'm supposed to go down here or up there instead.""Final Verdict:7/10. It's a really nice, relaxing, fun, trip down memory lane, and for kids who have never seen it, it will surely delight. This is for all ages and don't be fooled by having Mickey, even adults will enjoy the challenge.			"

												Castle of Illusion 2013 is really more of a game inspired by the classic Sega Mega Drive/Genesis platformer rather than a remake. The themes and enemies are all the same, but the levels are completely new and it switches to a 3D platformer every so often. That said, I really dug my playthrough of it. It's a solid platformer and a fun game throughout.			"

												As a huge fan of the iconic mouse, I took a lot of pleasure in diving into to this nastaugic funhouse especially when its coming right off the heels of the moderately-well recieved Epic Micky Titles. The campaign contains just the right amount of platforming goodness that kept me entertained as the story unfolded itself. After playing the demo's on xbox360 and PS3 I notice the control skeam was a tad bit difficult to control. For the PC version on the other hand I am unhappy to say that this control issue is still problematic making the gameplay sometimes a chore to play through. It's ashame Mickey delivered another game which was hindered by a technical aspect. You would think a mascot as successful as Mickey Mouse, the controls should have been be tested more carefully especially with a corporation as wealthy is Disney.			"

A remake of the original Castle of Illusion: Starring Mickey Mouse on Sega.The game is a 2.5D side scroller, meaning you can move left and right like a regular 2D side scroller, but also able to move up and down when given the opportunity.The beginning feels like Coleco-Vision's Smurfs, and once you enter the Castle of Almighty Illusions, you can tell this game is a rip off of Super Mario 64...The castle design, unlocking new doors/rooms by collecting the right amount of ""special items"" and the fact of entering levels by going into the doors/pictures just shows how this game is a copy.Anyways, the gameplay is pretty standard. But I HATE GAMES THAT REQUIRE CONTROLLERS. I play PC not a p*ssy CONSOLE. So this is another console port that can't use MOUSE! Any game on PC (COMPUTER) should be able to: 1) USE A MOUSE 2) SAVE WHENEVER WE WANT (No Console F*g AutoSave).So besides that b*llsh*t I noticed Mickey has a huge grin on his face, even after his girlfriend got captured. Maybe he's happy to get rid of her yet he's chasing to save her? Nevermind.The game is decent and plays much like Trine. So if you like being a p*ssy that uses controllers on PC. This p*ssy a** game is for you!4/10 "

												This could be an ok game if it wasnt for the hitbox issues. Its a shame they cant even get that right with consistancy in a platform game. Its frustating to die when u should not die. If you are looking for a casual game which is fun to kill a few hours, stay AWAY from this pos. You will leave more frustrated than you started.			"

												Just bought it and ran into tons of compatibility issues.Latest drivers on a decent machine, but still, game runs like crap, trying to get it in fullscreen just crashes or breaks the font rendering (black squares instead of proper characters).It's just unplayable. You can risk your chance at it too, but don't get your hopes too high.			"

												(non-rant near the bottom)Even before actually playing the game, I was already hating Sega with my guts for this piece of crap.- ""Best played with gamepad"" shown (actually ""Am besten mit Gamepad gespielt."" - see below), and this is apparently just advertising for Microsoft input devices. It's also helped along by only giving you three keyboard control presets (and they're all sub-optimum, and it's incredibly lazy considering you have two actions plus direction keys). Yeah, you won't need analog movement controls for this game either, so the controller advertising is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (At least the few movement tests I did with keyboard felt like giving me enough control. Analog controller movement results in either run or stroll.)- Said message is part of the ♥♥♥♥ing 25 seconds of unskippable game launch intro! (More if you don't press Enter and then Esc at the right times.) And even returning from in-game to the main menu (e.g. for quitting) wastes several seconds with unnecessary transitions. You're better off just pressing Alt+F4, but hell, who knows whether that might screw up your probably only savestate in this autosaving piece of console crap.- Menu navigation is slooooow. You cannot press an arrow key and expect the menu to switch to the next point with that. No, you have to do things slowly, the way the game wants you to do it. It wants to complete its fancy text animation first before going to the next point.- Game disregards Windows version locale, general Steam language setting and game-individual Steam language setting and runs in the location set in Windows system config, which is idiotic, because what's relevant is the language the user understands, not where he is located. I tried finding config files and couldn't, except one with two useless entries. I searched the Windows registry and couldn't find settings there either. Command line parameters? Who knows? Very likely not, since this is just another piece of crap carryover from consoles. I eventually, using a frickin hex editor like a code hacker, found all the available variables and the registry key for the config, which is ""SSA\COI"", which explains why my keyword search earlier remained unsuccessful. And, well, ... there is no language setting at all in this game. It is hardcoded to take the Windows locale setting, so you'd have to change that every time you play the game if it's not the desired language. And as you can derive from the game forums on Steam (which you should always consult before buying a game, after you've read some of the negative reviews), some people have no choice, their game being in Japanese.This is the second game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in one day, the other one being Half-Life 2 with its botched update from Valve that caused a launch error for many people. I don't actually get to play games that much, because by the time I get one to run properly, the little motivation I had is gone. I feel like an IT support guy again, but in my free time, and with the difference that I'm actually paying money for the opportunity to deal with crap like this.I'd demand a refund if I didn't know how annoying THAT would be with Valve, on top of all the hassle I already had.One has to ask: Why does Valve, with a platform like Steam, even allow the games sold on it to violate its functional guidelines/principles?The only game I feel like playing right now is Sniper Elite: Corporate Business Cleanup.P.S.: Oh and the story of the game is the usual ancient-Christian-hate-propaganda-fueled evil-ugly-witch theme, but hey, this is a mickeymouse game after all, so that's to be expected.TL;DR: Dis?! ... Ney!UPDATE: Played it a bit now.Achievements are either damn easy or too difficult to be motivating, since getting 100% of some items can mean searching for hidden stuff, and in some levels you might skip items because there are multiple paths and once you take one, the other one is locked. So some achievements would require tedious repetition of content. The same type of 100%-completion-achievements in Giana Sisters - Twisted Dreams were much more motivating and fun.Difficulty is not trivial. It provides some challenge. Bosses for example might need one failed run in order to learn how the fight works. And 3D platform jumping is very error-prone unless you train your muscle memory. Can also be unprecise when you miss a ledge although it looked like you'd catch it.There are pits that look like you can jump down and nothing tells you you die when you plunge down there, so it can lead to frustrating loss of lives.Level design is done in an interesting way, with lots of variety and intermission scenes and such. Game also has a narrator.			"

												To summarize my impression of this game, I would say that it is a very, very faithful remake of a 24 year old jewel, both in its pro's and con's. At the same time being short and obviously made for kids, just like the original, the game manages to brilliantly use the now-available multimedia power of this decade to exponentialize the magical atmosphere and gameplay. The level design is overall cool. Cool as in ""above ok"". Truth be said, it could be amazing if they used the GameGear/Master System version as template, instead of the - sorry purists - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Genesis version, which at the time was a game with the only purpose of promoting the newborn Sega Genesis with its good looks. It was 1990 after all, the beginning of the legendary 16-bit generation.So anyway, they're basically a re-imagining of those levels, which thank god made them better in the end (which wasn't such a hard task after all).In the end, I have to say it's a game made for the fans of the original. There's no denying it. New players will find it, unless they are REALLY open minded, too damn short (one can finish in a little more than 2 hours) and overall too easy and simple. Like I said, made for kids. The magic is there for sure, both for new players and old onse, but to be quite honest, it's value resides more in being a piece of nostalgia from the old days than anything else. Something that only the veterans of the original (btw, we are ♥♥♥♥ing old now, I hope you realize it :) ) will have.But despite all that, I still don't think the game is worth its full price. If we assume the game is on a reasonable discount (more than 50%) I would evaluate it as a 6/10 game for new players. For veterans, 8/10.Thanks for reading.			"

												The original Castle of Illusion was an easy-going platformer with loads of character and memorable moments, and this reimagining is much the same. Game is PRETTY - it's like playing a Mickey cartoon! All the worlds are modelled beautifully, and Mickey's animations really stand out. His little ""haters gonna hate"" strut is adorable.The game is pretty laid back however, so if you've played a platformer in the past twenty years, you shouldn't have much trouble getting to the end. It's also a bit old-fashioned - it plays almost exactly like the original, with some collectibles and unlockable extras tucked away to nudge you into playing levels again to find something you might have overlooked. As a result, it might leave you wanting for more if you're too used to more feature-packed games.That being said, I do recommend CoI. It's worth playing the original game too, as it still holds up pretty well!			"

												Having played the original Castle of Illusion, I was a little skeptical.  Even with Grant Kirkhope at the helm for the music, I didn't want to have the original game ruined.  However, I wasn't disappointed.  The gameplay worked really well and was really fun to play!  I have below a link to my Castle of Illusion Let's Play, if you want to know more how I feel about it!

It's a must-have at full price for fans of the original Sega game, or gamers who have a heart-on for Mickey. Watch my full video review here:

												I loved this game on the Mega Drive when I was young and still play it today. If you've never played it before it's a linear 2.5D platformer with some 3D sections, starring Mickey Mouse in all his cartoon glory. This update sticks fairly faithfully to the original, there are a few minor additions and re-imaginings of sections which make use of the 3D environment (the final boss is a good example of this). The controls are smooth, the music is great and the graphics are beautiful - the levels look like scenes painted in a particularly well-illustrated storybook, which is very much what the game is. It's not a long or particularly difficult game, bear in mind the original can be completed in about 20 minutes and I played this to 100% completion in a few hours. The replay value is the same as the original, this is the sort of game you pull off the shelf from time to time to while away an hour or two. Definitely worth snapping up when on sale.			"

												I'm writting this soon after finishing the main plot. I was, for a while, a child all over again! This game carries with itself that magic that we only could see through child's eyes. It was like, watching a cartoon in a saturday morning while drinking hot chocolatte! I'm so amazed! The game is very beautiful, the gameplay stands for itself and it is very faithful to the original. I must confess though that i have never owned a genesis console and the original Castle of Illusion i haven't played when i was a kid, but was an adult already when i did, so the feeling i have described was for seeing Mickey in a game as good as any Disney's work!

												While this game does get a recommendation there are definitly some major faults in the level design. I will say that the game looks and sounds amazing, along with having a great feel of wimsy while playing through it. (I think the narrarator was a nice touch)But the level design is a little too easy and basic, it doesn't try anything new and seems to be a little bland in that sense. The bosses are also very basic and are all just based around memorisation. But the game is worth a buy for simply the feel of the whole expierence. I truly does feel like you're playing through a classic Mickey adventure.			"

												Beautifully designed remake of the 1990 8-bit game. Basically a sidecroller with a huge twist: Each level has its own way of switching from 2d into 3ds environments.On the downside, the game takes only about 4 to 5 hours to finish. It has a bit of replay value through collectibles in every level but still you probably won't spend more than 8 hours with it.Yet, given the great art design, sleek visuals and almost flawless gameplay, I'd definitely recommend buying the game.

												This is an excellent reimagining of the old MegaDrive classic.  The graphics are gorgeous and almost every scene is filled with nice little details that really gives it polish.  The new overworld, while small, really ties the levels together.  It is short, I finished it in under 3 hours but those where a very enjoyable 3 hours and if I didn't have a billion other games to play I would glady spend more time going back through the levels discovering all the secrets.There is one major flaw to the game which will affect you more or less depending on your skill level with these types of games.  It wasn't until the final boss I happened upon it but, the game criminally resets you back to the cutscene prior to fighting the boss.  I believe it to be the case for all the bosses.  By the time I finally beat the boss on my 5th attempt  I was incredibly frustrated at watching that cut scene over and over.  It really soured me on the game.These cutscenes are unskippable and could honestly make you give up on the game.  Why this still happens in games is just baffling and the designers on the team that fight for their work to be unskippable as they worked so hard on it need to be put to task on their awful decisions.  This hurts games so much and in this case could ruin the game competely for some people.Just something to be aware of.			"

												I had bought this game several months ago, when it was on sale and never got a chance to play it.  I'm glad I finally got to install this, it was awesome!  As a Disney fan, this was a really cool side scroller with Mickey Mouse.  The graphics were a lot better than I was expecting, I was expecting sega gensis graphics with an upgrade.  Check this out if you're into side scrollers, or just Disney characters in general.  It's been a fun game so far, and the visuals and colors are great.			"

												This game is beautiful to a fault. It's wonderful to look at, especially if you're a big Disney fan, but the slick looks can make platforming difficult. Sometimes it's hard to see what is and isn't a platform, and the controls are a little too loose for accuracy. It's also a very short game that I 100%'d in less than six hours. Get it during a sale and have a little fun, but expect to get a little frustrated along the way.			"

												My 4-year-old daughter and I have had a blast playing through this game. We've been taking our time and replaying levels a ton, which she loves to do. We just made it to the endgame today, and she's consistently amazed by how magical and exciting the world is.The only other game I have that can tear her away from this one is Rayman Origins. A great game for kids, and the later levels are challenging enough for adults to enjoy, too. Great controls, music, pacing, everything really.			"

												Two hours long. For better and worse.The game is incredibly easy (great for sub 8 year olds or inexperienced platform gamers) and the only replay factor is in collecting everything...but that's not challenging or fun. Half the time it's just trial and error and going out on a limb or jumping to your death to find the hidden nonsense. Not exactly clever or intuitive.A fun, very simple game but only get it 75% off, and even then you might feel ripped off.			"

												Castle of Illusion is a remake of the 1990 Sega Genesis classic, which was considered one of the better Mickey Mouse games in the 16-bit era. I've played the original before, but far later in life, so I probably do not have the same level of nostalgia others may have with the game. Still, seeing as there was a remake out, I was curious on how the game would be reimagined to today's standards, and tried the new one out.Story:It's a very basic ""rescue the damsel-in-distress"" kind of story, with the damsel being Minnie Mouse, and the protagonist being Mickey. The main villain is a witch named Mizrabel, who looks like the evil queen from Snow White, and who is trying to steal Minnie's beauty. So, the game's story won't blow your mind, but given that it's a remake of an old Genesis platformer, it's passable.Gameplay:Castle of Illusion plays as you'd expect a traditional 2D platformer to play, for the most part. You try to reach the end of the stage, hopping on different platforms, and defeating your enemies by jumping on or throwing projectiles at them. Mickey controls really well, and despite the simple platforming mechanics, there is enough variety in the level design to definitely keep you interested in progressing from level to level. They did remove the butt-stomp from the original game, though, which is odd to me (why make the game even simpler?).In addition to the 2D platforming from the original game are the 3D platforming sections. This is mostly seen in the hub world of the game, and in some of the boss battles. Unfortunately, the 3D platforming in this game are the parts I dislike the most, as jumps to platforms away and towards the screen are far to imprecise for me to judge. As a result, I found levels like the Dessert Factory to be far more cumbersome to play through than the rest of the game (which, admittedly, was quite easy). This game definitely could have gone without these 3D platforming sequences, as much of the game was already a 2D platformer, anyway.Music:This game, being a remake, borrows a lot of music from the original classic. The main difference in the score, however, is that it was now composed by Grant Kirkhope of Banjo-Kazooie fame. Thus, the songs from the original now have a different feel to them, being more whimsical, and more fairy-tale like (in other words, they now sound kind of like they came from Banjo Kazooie). Given that this game's story is the typical damsel-in-distress flavor, I felt this was a very fitting change. As usual, Kirkhope's compositions were very fun to listen to while playing this game, and was probably the biggest thing keeping my interest in this game.Presentation:Graphics-wise, this game does its job in showing off its colorful worlds, and definitely looks like a typical Mickey Mouse CGI cartoon would look like. Often, you'll see background events as you're playing (like an upcoming boss moving catching up to you from the background), making the game's environment look much livelier than the original game. I thought was a nice touch.In addition to all this, this game has some pretty good voice-acting. There is a narrator who will give the player some insight to the story during the beginning of levels as the game progresses, giving the game more of the storybook feel. Mickey and Minnie, as far as I know, have their original voice actors acting as them, as well.Conclusion:At its core, I only thought this game was just good, but not great. The 2D platforming was very fun, but the 3D platforming segments really miffed me. I would say this is one of the games where the the soundtrack was the best aspects of the game, so I'd say definitely give it a listen. If you do find this game on sale, though, I'd say give it a shot, especially if you were a fan of the original game.			"

												A ok game. It is a good game for a quick playthrough from the original game. You dont get the nostalgica feeling, but it is ok for a quick platformer game. Dough I must say it is not an easy game. The controls are sensitive and the jumping is a bit out of control sometimes. The main downer must be not able to skip through some points in the game. The last boss is hard and you need to know what do do in every event, meaning afew attemps of replays to get it right. And hearing the same dialoge before the battle is the one that create frustration. The seccond downer is the item detail. Finding all Crystal was hard in the original game, but here it is even harder. There are areas you cant go back, and if you miss some crystals or worse (card or throphy) you have to replay the whole map collecting all over again. And as always there are 30-40 very hidden crystals in each map making it really hard to collect all. Most of the times i ended up missing 2-3 crystals. So annoying. Should be able to play the map again with all the crystals except those missed. The pro is the gameplay really. The maps are great and it is alot of fun playing through the game 1 time. Replay value.... not so much. I recommend this game if you want to play a semi hard platformer for a few hours. But i do not recommend this game if you want to have a pressent to give to your little brother/sister or looking for a new game to play for 20-30 hours. This game is good for 5 Hours at max and you should keep that in mind if you want to play it.			"

												The Master System version of this game was one of my favourite platformers for that console. The Megadrive version was good too. As a retro fan, I'm always a bit wary of remakes, so I didn't want to take a gamble on this version at full price. However, at £2.49 in the Steam sale, I gave it a go, and it's excellent. I'm only a few levels in, but I can say that this completely captures the spirit of the original, adding a modern twist, and is one of the best platformers I've played in recent years.			"

 Castle of Illusiion Review Castle of Illusion is one of the most nostalgic platformers I have ever played. I never played the original Castle of Illusion, so my nostalgia doesn't come from that. It does come from being a fan of Disney and their cartoons for many years. I had not seen Mickey in a entertainment medium since Kingdom Hearts so it hit me in a good way. It also made me feel old. Now technically, the game has pretty good controls for a platformer. The jump is solid if a tad bit floaty. The game is kind of simple and easy, but it definetly is fun. The game is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves. It is short though, so take that for what it's worth. At regular price it does offer enough gameplay, but price and it's worth is subjective to everyone, so that is something you will have to come up with. If it's on a steam sale definetly pick it up, it's worth it! FOR: People who love Disney, platformers, or games in general. It's a good 5 hours that are ultimately pretty great. NOT FOR: People who have an extremely specifice taste in games. If you are not in to platformers, don't bother.			"

												A wonderful short and simple platformer.  The art style and music are great and perfectly mesh to form great atmospheres, and the levels are fun and diverse.  The gameplay is simple and fun with decent controls.   It does not take long to finish, but there is a good amount of secret items hidden in the levels if you care to explore.   This game is probably best for younger audiences, but I still recommend it for anyone.  Because of the short length, I would wait for the game to go on sale for less than 5 USD.Overall, Castle of Illusion is full of childlike wonder and is extremely pleasant to play.			"

												A solid platformer with nice graphics. And a solid remake of an original, though I never played the original. The controls are a bit quirky, but works well on my Logitech F310 Gamepad remote (affordable controller that I find is as good as more expensive competitors). I can understand that this game may not work well with the keyboard, but many platformers are the same way. The transition from 2D to 3D in certain parts of the game is well done. It does seem like I will probably complete this game in 4-5 hours, but we'll see.If you can get it on sale I would say buy it. I bought it on a major sale. The $14.99 it typically goes for is a bit steep I think.			"

												A blast from the past, the original on SEGA Genesis was the first video game that I ever personally owned. I spent years playing that game. This HD version is legit. It's a competely different game, apart from the basic story behind it. There are 3 different types of people that need to play this game. 1. Disney fans. I mean, how can you beat playing a Mickey Mouse game that isn't just a little kids game?2. Fans of the original. I mean, everything about it is just a better verison of the original. YOu can even change the music to the original! Plus, Jello!!3. Anybody that likes platformers. It's beautifully done. It's easy enough that kids can play it without getting super frustrated, but there's enough difficulty to keep you from getting bored super easily, and it's just fun, plus you can tell that it wasn't put together by a one man team. There's a lot of detail, and I haven't noticed any glitches thus far.			"

												When I saw that this game was being released, I wet myself with excitement. There is so much nostalgia for me with the classic Genesis version of this game that I simply had to have it. So maybe my opinions here are a little biased with nostalgia, but sod it, I loved this.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8/10Story: 10/10Mechanics: 8/10Puzzle difficulty: 6/10Total: 8/10			"

												This is a very well made remake of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game that nostalgic gamer (or any gamer) would enjoy. It has incredible console quality graphics and the controls are almost perfect. I say almost perfect because they are a little delayed, but not too noticeable to me. Overall, Castle of Illusion is a game I would reccomend to anyone regardless of controls.			"

												I loved this game on the Mega Drive when I was young and still play it today. If you've never played it before it's a linear 2.5D platformer with some 3D sections, starring Mickey Mouse in all his cartoon glory. This update sticks fairly faithfully to the original, there are a few minor additions and re-imaginings of sections which make use of the 3D environment (the final boss is a good example of this). The controls are smooth, the music is great and the graphics are beautiful - the levels look like scenes painted in a particularly well-illustrated storybook, which is very much what the game is. It's not a long or particularly difficult game, bear in mind the original can be completed in about 20 minutes and I played this to 100% completion in a few hours. The replay value is the same as the original, this is the sort of game you pull off the shelf from time to time to while away an hour or two. Definitely worth snapping up when on sale.			"

												Fantastic game with the charm of early 90s platformers.  Everything is top notch here from the graphics and animation to the narration.  The team behind this game made a real gem.  It may be short but it has its secrets to unlock as well and will put you to work claiming all the achievements.			"

												I played the original version many times when I was younger. The remake not only meet the expectations but exceeded them. If you were a fan of the Genesis version you will be happy with it. For people who have not; it is still a worthwhile side scroller with great art, mechanics, and music (there is an option to have the old soundtrack play). Yes it is short but keep in mind this is an almost replica of an old game not a new one. It would be similar to someone ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a remake of Altered Beast being only a hour or so long.			"

For better and worse.The game is incredibly easy (great for sub 8 year olds or inexperienced platform gamers) and the only replay factor is in collecting everything...but that's not challenging or fun. Half the time it's just trial and error and going out on a limb or jumping to your death to find the hidden nonsense. Not exactly clever or intuitive.A fun, very simple game but only get it 75% off, and even then you might feel ripped off.			"

												Castle of Illusion was by far one of my favorite Sega Genesis games back in the 16 bit era and its still a highly playable game these days as well.  When I heard Castle of Illusion was being remade I was scepticle, I had just hoped that they would make the old 16 bit game playable on modern machines.  After playing the new version of Castle of Illusion I was blown away!  The game is fun, it looks fantastic, controls perfect, the sounds and soundtrack are a perfect mix of new, remastered and classic sounds and it all comes together to make a very magical Disney gaming experience.  This is a game that is not to be missed.  It is pretty easy (the final boss battle is the only one that should give you a little trouble) and it's overall pretty short but its a game you'll likely want to go back and revisit once you've made it to the end.  Enjoy!			"

I play it for her but sometimes she does grab the controller and take over and is getting better at jumping (kid friendly).  It is not a difficult platformer, much better then Ducktales (we have both).  Great family game, and a no-brainer if you are a Disney fan.			"

												When I was young I played Castle of Illusion on my Sega Game Gear. I loved playing it back then and played through it countless times. This game is a remake of the classic game and it's wonderful. A fantastic omage to the classic game. Reminiscing about my childhood I've been enjoing this game. Leveldesign is very close to the original. Going throw the levels trying to remember all the details of the classic. It's been great. Furthermore there is a storyteller by your side throughout the game. The storyteller does a great job commenting on Mickeys (your) yourney to save Minnie. It's like a book comming alive. The game has replay value. You can unlock some goodies by collecting all items within levels.I recomend playing this game with a game pad. tried with keyboard, but some sequences were just too difficult beating with a keyboard. After getting my steam controller (every other controller would do a great job as well on this game) it's been a lot easier playing through the storyline. It was a lot of fun playing castle of illusion.The graphics are well designed, depicturing the comic style of Mickey Mouse. Enjoiable on old graphic cards (mine: GTX 260). Thanks to the developers of this game for paying attention to such detail and the voice actors for giving the characters original voices. It's a great game to enjoy on a free afternoon or evening and a game of value for your game collection.			"

Everything about it is filled to the brim with that Disney feel and polish. This game is both really easy and short, so don't expect to play this for a challenge.

												A blast from the past, the original on SEGA Genesis was the first video game that I ever personally owned. I spent years playing that game. This HD version is legit. It's a competely different game, apart from the basic story behind it. There are 3 different types of people that need to play this game. 1. Disney fans. I mean, how can you beat playing a Mickey Mouse game that isn't just a little kids game?2. Fans of the original. I mean, everything about it is just a better verison of the original. YOu can even change the music to the original! Plus, Jello!!3. Anybody that likes platformers. It's beautifully done. It's easy enough that kids can play it without getting super frustrated, but there's enough difficulty to keep you from getting bored super easily, and it's just fun, plus you can tell that it wasn't put together by a one man team. There's a lot of detail, and I haven't noticed any glitches thus far.			"

												The game is fairly easy but I find the platforming is enjoyable due to the creative level design. While there is generally only one path, it goes in all directions and never feels like you're just going in a straight path from left to right. I never played the original Genesis version so I don't know how closely it follows it but I understand this is more a reimagining than a remake. I know that I do like the variety of platforming and contrasting styles and designs of each level. The transitions from 2D to 3D gameplay generally flow well and it's easy to re-orient yourself to play the short 3D segments. Missing a jump usually does not lead to instant death but is often just a setback as you land in an earlier part of the level. I personally appreciate this as someone who hates bottomless pits. The bosses are also fairly fun to beat if again a bit easy. There is a bit of a challenge in getting all the gems as some are carefully hidden and require exploring off the obvious path. I generally dislike collect-a-thons but since the game is not too long and there are not too many gems, it was actually interesting to try and get all the gems without looking up a walkthrough.Graphics and music are very well done. The graphics do not obscure any platforms but give life and personality to each level. I particularly like the overall relaxing tone of the music, which gives a whimsical fairy tale feel while still being interesting to listen to. The occasional narration that occurs due to certain actions is also a nice touch.As a fan of 2D platformers, I found this to be a very enjoyable and imaginative game. Maybe it could have used another world with a few levels but what we got was high quality where replaying levels is not a chore.			"

												As a long time gamer, I had the dubious distinction of owning and completing this on both the Master System and Mega Drive versions (couldn't do it now - age gets us all!) and so was curious as to what level of remastering/reimagining this is and I was pleased to find a genuinely entertaining new game heavily inspired by the old.  Everything that was great about the original, the locations, the sense of whimsy had been successfully carried across to this new version along with a fully orchestral soundtrack and a friendly sounding narrator adding the level of Disney gloss that just wasn't possible in the cartridge era.  As much as I enjoyed this game however, there is a feeling of sadness when you realise that the developers where planning to do similar remakes of a lot of Sega properties from that era including Streets of Rage and Golden Axe which will alas never be as Sega shuttered ther studio.  Still, if your looking for a pleasantly challenging old-school platformer with a modern look, this could be ideal.			"

												Not bad if you didn't pay too much for it. Took me 5 hrs to complete the lot, including all collectibles and achievements, and I am certainly no speed demon with games. Those 5 hours were fun though, which is what counts surely.The platforming works, the graphics are nice enough, and the whole thing feels like a trip down memory lane with natty 3D thrown in. The bosses are the only real (fairly light) challenge, but each are defeatable with a little memorising (hey, this is old school remember). Despite the easiness, the repetition of redoing levels to find the collectibles is what evokes feelings of days gone by. Sail through without a care for those and it'll be over sooner, and with less of the impact. You make your own choice.			"

Good music too, most of them arrangements from the MegaDrive classic. There's some replay value in trying to get all the collectibles and messing with the time attack mode, but I don't care much for that myself.Be warned, this game features some very corny voices.

												Good game for both adults and kids. Controls were easy to use both on keyboard and gamepad. Short but can easily entertain for a few hours.			"

												I beat the game from start to finish in 94 mins.  I haven't found all of the collectibles yet, so am sure that will double my played time.  So, if you want to pay for 3-5 hours of game play; pick it up.  It is one of the better Mickey Mouse games I've ever played, so it has that going for it.			"

												I had the original on my Sega Genesis way back when. I know I don't really have enough time on the Steam version, but I finished it on my PS3, and I just want to say that this game is great. If you liked the original play this great re-imagining. :3			"

												Only 2.3 hours of play to beat. Maybe more if you're a completionist. Nice remake of a classic. Visuals look great. A plus for environment, graphics, and nostalgia. Some challenging moments, but mostly fairly easy. Similar to Mario64, but only by a little. If it's heavily discounted or you played this when you were younger (like I did), I'd pick it up.			"

												This is an excellent reimagining of the old MegaDrive classic.  The graphics are gorgeous and almost every scene is filled with nice little details that really gives it polish.  The new overworld, while small, really ties the levels together.  It is short, I finished it in under 3 hours but those where a very enjoyable 3 hours and if I didn't have a billion other games to play I would glady spend more time going back through the levels discovering all the secrets.There is one major flaw to the game which will affect you more or less depending on your skill level with these types of games.  It wasn't until the final boss I happened upon it but, the game criminally resets you back to the cutscene prior to fighting the boss.  I believe it to be the case for all the bosses.  By the time I finally beat the boss on my 5th attempt  I was incredibly frustrated at watching that cut scene over and over.  It really soured me on the game.These cutscenes are unskippable and could honestly make you give up on the game.  Why this still happens in games is just baffling and the designers on the team that fight for their work to be unskippable as they worked so hard on it need to be put to task on their awful decisions.  This hurts games so much and in this case could ruin the game competely for some people.Just something to be aware of.			"

												Another game that is woeful on mobile but truly awesome on a big screen with a gamepad. Beautifully made platformer which gives Super Mario 64 a run for its money even though its only really 2 1/2 D. Each level is new and engaging and the difficulty is spot on. Only gripe would be that there doesn't seem to be an exit game option in the menus, I always have to force close it in Big Picture.			"

												Castle of Illusion is a very simple game, yet is super grand.  If you like 2/3D scrollers and Disney and don't mind the juvenile appeal of it all then get this game.  Very well rounded...akin to Duck Tales.			"

												While having never played the original, I can definitely find enjoyment in the simplistic controls of Castle of Illusion. There's very little to do rather than move a left analog stick and press a button or two. Yet, the ""Disney-ness"" of Disney's graphics - especially Mickey Mouse himself, who has lost none of his charm over the years - as well as the story of the game told through a magical bodiless narrator really add to the whole storybook feel of this game. And it truly does feel like a storybook at times. The voice actor for Mizrabel definitely played her part very well. I do wish there was a tad bit more replayability rather than having the existing levels simply timed, or collecting all of the gems. Additionally, I dislike how third parties have to solve the game's issues concerning 30fps and failure to fully support high resolutions, but these are more minor complaints that far too many people have brought up.  All in all, Castle of Illusion was a nice return to classical gameplay of olden years that I never enjoyed as a kid. I would suggest this to any child gamer, as well as any adult who enjoys games with charm like this every once in a while.			"

												This is a very well made remake of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game that nostalgic gamer (or any gamer) would enjoy. It has incredible console quality graphics and the controls are almost perfect. I say almost perfect because they are a little delayed, but not too noticeable to me. Overall, Castle of Illusion is a game I would reccomend to anyone regardless of controls.			"

												Beautiful game, and both the music and voice acting are great. Boss fights were fun and varied. Having said that, it's extremely short, they could easily have done a few more levels. I don't see this taking more than 5-6 hours to 100%, and that may be being generous. I got this on sale at 75% off, and because of the length I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. It was fun while is lasted though, so if you spot it on sale it's worth giving it a chance.			"

												Truely one of the best platformers of this generation,the game only lasted me about 4 hours but despite the super short lenght, the game still managed to amaze me, the visuals were beautiful, the music was amazing and the levels were extremely creative and full of chaotic plot-twists, it really felt like you were playing a Disney cartoon! The game had that Disney feel and it was a great re-imagining of the Sega Genesis classic! SO FUN!			"

												I had bought this game several months ago, when it was on sale and never got a chance to play it.  I'm glad I finally got to install this, it was awesome!  As a Disney fan, this was a really cool side scroller with Mickey Mouse.  The graphics were a lot better than I was expecting, I was expecting sega gensis graphics with an upgrade.  Check this out if you're into side scrollers, or just Disney characters in general.  It's been a fun game so far, and the visuals and colors are great.			"

												This game is beautiful to a fault. It's wonderful to look at, especially if you're a big Disney fan, but the slick looks can make platforming difficult. Sometimes it's hard to see what is and isn't a platform, and the controls are a little too loose for accuracy. It's also a very short game that I 100%'d in less than six hours. Get it during a sale and have a little fun, but expect to get a little frustrated along the way.			"

												I used to play this game on the Sega Genesis. Such a throw back. Wether you played the original or just looking for a fun adventure game, Castle of Illusion is worth a buy. Quite cool to see all the themed stages from the orignal, in HD format.			"

												I'm already a quarter of the way through so....if you're looking for a game that's monumentous in area of time it takes to complete...look elsewhere. However, Castle of Illusion is tons of fun to play! If you're a Disney fan like I am, then you'll love controlling Mickey through this little adventure. What a fantastic remake! For fifteen bucks? Not a dissappointment and I know that I'll be playing this over and over again :) Time Trial is a nice little touch as well!!			"

												A game of Micky rescuing his beloved, Minnie. who is taken by the evil witch, Mizrabel.This kind of story is familiar and well known if you have seen these Disney cartoons during childhood.There are five worlds, and each has three stages with the last one being a stage boss fight. Plus the final confrontation with Mizrabel. So, the whole is not so long. playtime to finish is within three, more or less than an hour, without trying to grab all collectibles. Despite its shortness. every world is quite well designed no matter the foreground and the background, with the fantastic orchestra music playing.As a platform game, it is mild, but because of its variety of design and settings, you won't feel much tedious, only becoming a bit difficult and challenging after entering the fourth world. Beware when Micky jumps and lands. Though the control is not complicated with basic movements, jumping and throwing consumable weapons, still it is better to use controllers to play. if not  supported, you can have some app like Joytokey to make your controller available.In short, the whole game is enjoyable and relaxing. Playing as Micky, hearing Micky's and Minnie's hilarious voice and Mizrabel's witchlike evilish laughing, definitely recommend it.			"
