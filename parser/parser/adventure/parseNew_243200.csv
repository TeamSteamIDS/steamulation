												Memoria is a point and click adventure, and in many ways sticks to the medium the way you would expect. Fill your inventory, combine items, rub them against things in the hope for progress. Unlike normal point and click adventures, most combinations and applications are fairly common sense. There are some places where you need to do things in an odd order, but for the most part the puzzles make sense – you use daggers to cut things open, or poke holes in small places, while sticks and ropes can be fashioned into animal traps.However, Memoria adds an extra element in the way of spells. Each main character gains access to different spells – Geron can destroy or repair things, while Sadja gains a spell that can create visions to force NPCs to act in certain ways. These spells add an extra dimension to the typical point and click approach – it makes things a bit more tedious as it adds to the things you must rub together to try to make progress, but it also adds something other than inventory management to the experience.What impressed me the most about Memoria was the aesthetic. Sure, the story was interesting and by the end I was pretty sucked in. However, the sound and art design was what truly held Memoria together.First, there was the art direction. Each scene was beautifully drawn and created. The clickable elements blend naturally into the environment – no change in pigment or design. If players struggle to determine what can be clicked, they can simply press space and it will highlight the interactive points. In this way, the scenes are able to maintain artistic integrity without sacrificing ease of gameplay.Next is the music and sound design. These are so important to creating a mood during point and click adventures. I still remember how the music in Myst shaped that game for me. Memoria is excellent in this regard – subtly crafting an ambiance without being overbearing. I particularly liked the sound effects as you would move or interact with different items. The voice acting was generally fantastic, although one or two characters were shockingly bad. Unfortunately, one of those characters is at the start of the game, which made me worry for the rest – that said, the majority of voice acting is well performed and suited to each character.Finally, I was most impressed with the animation. Movements were fluid and natural, and the environment reacted to a wide range of influences. I particularly enjoyed the attention to water effects in various scenes – the game could have worked around any need for them, but instead revelled in the animations. Birds and animals were portrayed realistically, and the movements of characters and scenery were organic. I must say that this added to the immersion in a game that would otherwise be quite straight forward.+music, and sound design+voice acting+dialogues+landscapes, and different places+animation+art designOne of the best point and click adventure games I've ever playedGood job Daedalic!Curator PageCommunity Group "

“There are many kinds of joy, but they all lead to one: the joy to be loved.” ― Michael Ende, The Neverending StoryThis game is a must for anyone and everyone! It is not only a game; it is an experience, a tale to be told over and over again! I strongly recommend playing the prequel, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which explains the events a year before Memoria, revealing the background story for Geron and Nuri for you to be able to grasp all heartwarming references of this game.After the tragic, yet beautiful ending of the previous game, we meet Geron again in Andergast. A travelling caravan is visiting the silent medieval town, hailing from Far East. Driven by the possibility that there may still be a way to turn Nuri back into a fairy, Geron visits the residing site of the caravan to ask for their wisdom. Fahi, the travelling riddler and storyteller welcomes Geron, and challenges him to solve a riddle that resides in a long forgotten tale: the tale of princess Sadja.I personally think that Memoria is Daedalic Entertaintment’s best work yet. Characters are so deep and alive, you keep carrying them with you long after you finish the series, as if you've just finished reading a good book, and wonder what to do with your life now. Aside from Geron and Nuri, our newly met characters - Sadja and the mysterious magical staff - are remarkable. The story is built so masterfully, you keep playing for hours, anticipating what shall happen next.The gameplay is easy to grasp, hints and interactions are curiously enjoyable, puzzles are nearly always challenging. The art work is breathtaking just like the prequel, depicting different fantastic environments in a fashion that you'd wish that you are there. There are lots to discover in this game!I consider myself a hardcore adventure gamer, and I haven't been seeing a game that I can compare to old classics like Grim Fandango, The Longest Journey, Syberia or Monkey Island Series. Memoria, is no less than a modern competitor. I thought Chains of Satinav to be a glorious fairytale that should be considered a classic. In this case, Memoria is a masterpiece!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Don't start this game if you haven't finished The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav yet !This sequel is really worth being played : same gameplay and characters (and some more of course), indispensable if you want to know what happens to Geron and Nuri. Few more hours in this fantastic universe and the same emotion at the end of the game ! DO play it !			"

												Absolutely stellar game with amazing detail and story. Very very few games have made me care so much about the characters within the story and Memoria hooked me in with ease. As the sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, it greatly improves upon the animations and the thought process of puzzles. However, there might be a few puzzles that will seem like complete BS to you and you wouldnt be wrong. It might require you to think outside of the box and have some determination. If you can i would recommend playing Chains of Satinav before this so you can know the background of everything. Pros:Great Artwork and detailsBeautiful and unpredictable story about love and adventuringCons:Some puzzles may take some time and frustration			"

												OK so lemme get  something out of the way before we being, I played this game without playing any of the previous games. It was discribed to me as a game that didn't require having played the other games to appreciate this one.  To an extent, that is true, but the game feels a bit overwhelming when you havent played the other games. The game has some expectations, espectially in regards to it's puzzles. They are logic puzzles, and they are a bit outside of normal adventure game logic of one item for one interaction. Other traits common to adventure games, such as randomly rubbing everything against everything else is still in-tact. I would recommend playing the other games before jumping into this one, but if you can't be asked, then jumping into this game alone is possible. Half of the story is underwhelming (i.e the part where you play as garron). it has a few moments, some tense, some funny, some that are actually a bit scary, but not enough to say it's anything other than passable. The other half (where you play as Sadja) are a real treat. Sadja is a female heroine who is actually a well -rounded, well-developed character. For me, the game was worth it for her involvement alone, it was that good. The normal tedium of adventure games, the obtuse puzzling, the sometimes uncooperative interface, and the weird logic, were worth it just for Sadja's story. Adventure games don't do gameplay well, and this one really isn't different in that regard, but it tells a fantastic story with a damn good ending. I had goosebumbs at the end, despite the fact that i was a bit frustrated with the game at that point. It really mad the game worth it, rapped everything up nicely and made me happy that I owned the game.The art in this game is fantastic. It has a Pastel feel to it. Lots of softer colors, blurred lines, and a really earthy beauty to it. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The sound design wasn't bad, nothing offensive, but no tunes i find myself whistling. And the voice acting is hit and miss. Sadja's voice acting is usually very good, Garons is passible, and everyone else is up for grabs (some good, some Laughably bad). The dialogue and writing are better then most, and the world being build is actually an interesting one, which makes me interested in the other games or possible sequals. The game definitly has some negative points, such as towards the end. i won't spoil, but a character's personality change will leave some with a feeling of whiplash. It wasn't bad, just unexpected and definitly a bit sad. It felt a little forced, and didn't compare well to the rest of the character development that had happened thus far.All in all, the game is good. It's an adventure game in an older style. Still has some of the same niggles as older adventure titles, but still tells its story well enough. It's beautiful, has some wonderful characters, and a deep enough world to make it something people can dive into if it's their thing. If you liked older adventure titles like Monkey island, and want something a bit more centered around drama as opposed to comedy, then this game is worth a look-see. If your more into The Walking Dead style of adventure games, you may feel a bit disappointed. If adventure games arn't your thing, skip it or get it on sale.			"

“As the stone over the scarab, so rules the scarab over the stone” – The riddle from the Ancient VaultAfter finishing Memoria’s prequel „The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav”  I was anxiously waiting for this game, wanting to know how exactly would Geron’s and Nuri’s tale end. Sitting to the game I had some expectations about the overall course of it, and involved mechanics. I was somewhat uneasy about announced introduction of another main character – Princess Sadja, but overall I did not expected any drastic changes between “Memoria” and its predecessor.To my surprise however, after just a couple of minutes I had to completely abandon all these previous assumptions, and for the benefit of the game that is ! Not only all the strong points of  “Chains of Satinav” were still present – with its stunning music, beautifully hand-painted backgrounds and complete, detailed voice-over, but also, to my content “Memoria” introduced a handful of new ideas making the game even better !In ‘Memoria’, contrary to the previous game, we follow two seemingly separate stories. One starts right after the events of the previous game, which left Nuri, a former fairy and Geron’s girlfriend, turned into a Raven, and the featuring Princess Sadja, a heroine from over 450 years ago, whose footsteps we’ll have to follow. The narrative is written perfectly, telling us the truly moving story, full of surprising events, magic and sacrifice. The characters are likeable, interesting, and their motivations are truly believable.The main flaw of “TDE: Chains of Satinav’s” gameplay were its puzzles, which although solid and logical, turned out to be quite simple, and after a while may have felt a bit repetitive. In “Memoria” this problem is nonexistent, ‘cause almost each of game’s many brilliant puzzles feels unique. All that thanks to an improved magic mechanic, greatly augmented in comparison to “Chains of Satinav”, with both spells variety increasing, and their impact on puzzle solving changing dramatically. Now we are allowed to choose from much larger diversity of powers than before, each coming with a distinct applications.Summing up, I have to admit that “Memoria” has left me speechless, and after finishing it, I won’t hesitate saying that this jewel should be counted among best adventure games of the last decade. Both plotline and the puzzle design in this game are as close to perfection as I’d dare to ask, and above that we are once again pleased with astonishing aesthetics known from the previous game in the series.I’d strongly recommend this game not only to those who enjoy this particular genere, but also to anyone who has even the slightest liking to a top grade fantasy tales !Pros:-	Deep and intriguing plotline with two entangled keynotes.-	Huge amount of witty puzzles.-	Unique magic mechanics.-	Beautiful soundtrack perfectly fitting the story !-	Sequel to “Chains of Satinav”-	Set in a vast fantasy setting of ‘Dark Eye’Cons:-	Boxed “Collectors Edition” available only in Germany			"

It has good riddles, a brilliant story, interesting characters, very nice voice-actors - for me it's one of the best adventures of the last 10 years.

												This game excels in two fields: Story and World Setting.Story:If you care about story in games, than you must play this game.I played many point and click adventures in my life, so I can compare to a lot of them, and I truly can't think of one that had a more sophisicated story. When I sat through the ending credits of this one, I was just blown away by the cleverness of the plot and particularly its ending.World Setting:I guess that most gamers know all the ""usual"" fantasy elements well - magic, dragons etc. but the world of this game presents such original ideas that it really feels special and more deep than other fantasy worlds.I won't spoil it, I'll just say that in this game artifacts and spells do original and interesting things, that we just don't see in other games.As for the quality of other elements of the game:- Graphics and Soundtrack: Beautiful as you would expect from Daedalic Entertainment.- Puzzles: I think that most of the puzzles were great and fun. There were only a few that I found to be awkward, but still most are great.- Voice Acting: Good but certainly not the strong side of this game, although it shouldn't drive you away from it.And lastly, just note that this game is a sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which is also a great game. You can't just play Memoria without playing Chains of Satinav first.Luckily, it's another great game, and playing through both of them will give you a great journey.			"

												10/10 Sooooo much improvement from the first game, Chains of Satinav! I absolutely loved it, and got so into the game, I wound up playing it much, much later than I intended because I just had to know what happened next.Pros:- great music, which had me searching for a download after I finished the game. ""Nothing is ever Lost"" actually made me well up. Epically beautiful music for an epic game.- as in CoS, Memoria is full of even more beautiful art. The city of Drakonia is especially a standout, looking like something that even Tolkien would find enchanting. It seems more polished and detailed than CoS was as well-- with fog and lighting and shadows. - The story, writing, and dialogue are all much better! The story was so engaging I lost track of time, especially when playing as Sadja and her staff. In fact, I found the two of them to be much more interesting and fun to play as than Geron and Nuri. The dialogue felt more natural to the characters as well. I actually teared up a few times during the story and would occasionally find myself gasping in shock or giggling at a joke. Again, the detail to the rules and background of the game universe is absolutely wonderful. While this is a relatively new world in comparison to The Lord of the Rings and The Elder Scrolls, I still feel that a comparison is deserved. The universe feels real and complete and it's obvious the developers put a lot of thought into it (I only wish we learn more-- they should add ""books"" like in TES, so we can read more if we like).- The voice acting! In my review for CoS, I mentioned this a con, with Geron and Nuri using inappropriate intonations or coming off monotone, or strangely whispering at times it wasn't appropriate (such as when yelling... yeah). Those problems are no longer present in Memoria. This may be because the story switches between Geron and Nuri to Sadja and the staff, meaning less of a chance for me to be annoying with Geron and Nuri. The addition of Bryda was welcome as well. The stand out, however, is the staff. I was wanting to play more often as Sadja and the staff primarily because of him-- excellent VA work there.- The puzzles were a lot more fun this time. It's very similar to CoS, but it felt more intuitive, even during those times I would get a bit lost. Speaking to everyone as much as you can is a must, as it'll only help you to put the puzzles together. I didn't find myself ""pixel hunting"" so much, as it seemed more obvious what could/couldn't be clicked. The best part though was the increased use of magic in puzzle-solving. With both Geron and Sadja, you get the use of more (and fun) spells. Sadja's especially were a joy to play with :)Cons:- Performance issues AGAIN. My computer far exceeds the recommended requirements and yet, when I play for more than an hour, noticeable lag and long loading times start to appear. Play for more than several hours and the game becomes near unplayable and requires being restarted. - Animations are poor and poorly synced. For such a beautiful game, the animations are embarassing. Sometimes the characters mouths don't move, sometimes their mouths don't start moving until they've been talking for a while. Most of the quality animation seems to have gone into Sadja's glorious ponytail. It's very strange and a bit jarring once you get into the game. Tips:- make at least 2-3 saves per chapter, as there are different ways to complete quests and different choices to make, not to mention some fun/silly random achievements (the very first silly achievement, which can be had in the 2nd chapter when Geron first meets Fahi, actually made me laugh out loud). It'll be easier to experience all of this with several saves per chapter, and there are more than enough save slots for it. - Really, talk to absolutely everybody you can, exhaust all their dialogue options. Some puzzles will leave you completely lost if you don't! In all, I can't recommend this game enough. It's earn a spot on my list of best, and favorite, point-and-click games. I bought it while it was on sale for ~$5 and got more than my monies worth for sure.			"

												The story continues from the first game before it, to get a full picture and emotional ties of what is going on your going to want to play and should play The Dark Eye Chains of Satinav,  as it relates to the story and without playing it you will have no meaning to what the person is talking about. Both games are worth it. The artwrok is fantastic,  water colour paint drawn in detail out of a fairy tale, with every detail and item done with detail like the game before it, even conversations with NPCS, are done in detail with moving characters that come to life and shown in first person, I bring up fairy tale because that is what comes to mind, those wonderous books you read as a child come to life in this game.Gameplay is point and click with inventory system and magic use, puzzles and events and conversations are logical and won't have you doing some abstract picaso or infinate staircase riddle that has you smaking heads and every thing mostly fits.Voice and sound are great, coming from a european maker, you actually get the feel of medievil europe and fairy tale setting then you would from a western game,I can find no fault in the game and everyone should own it, it reminds me of the games of old, like Syberia were story and art fuse to create something you have not played before, honestly it did what few games could do, allow me to feel like I was playing a fairy tale or reading one, something I have not felt since I was a kid. 5/5			"

												This is one of the best point and click adventure games of all time. It is set in a sort of medieval fantasy setting that is precariously balanced between darkly goofy and quite serious. The preceding game The Dark Eye: the Chains of Satinav, while not as good, should be played first to get the background of some of the characters.The first game had great art, and decent voiceovers, with some nonsensical puzzles, and some good ones, and a relatively generic story.Memoria however has an amazing story. It focuses on new characters, while still developing the characters from the previous game. You learn a lot about the gods and magical nature of the series' universe. The ending blew my mind. It's like Primer meets Lord of the Rings.I could go into greater detail about the story but there really isn't any point. If you are a fan of point and clicks, and that sort of old fantasy style, like King's Quest or something, then play this series, even if you have to push through the first one, it will be worth it. The puzzles are slightly above average. But the story is really the highlight. The art is great too. The voiceovers are fine, some lines had stale delivery, but you definitely become acustomed to the voices by the end of it. It's probably the best adventure game of the past decade.			"

												The most engaging story I've encountered in an indie game in a really long time, and that despite me not having played Chains of Satinav first (which I think would have made me more invested in Geron's story). Sadja is a fascinating character, her traveling companion is complicated in the best way, and the exploration of the importance of storytelling just pleases me to no end. Recommended to anyone who likes epic fantasy with compelling female leads.If you're achievement hunting (or just get frustrated easily by point-and-click puzzles), you'll want to use a guide; there are a number of spots where you can get one of two different achievements depending on your approach to a situation, and there are a few others that are easily missable. If you know what to expect and save/reload in all the right places you can get 100% in one playthrough.			"

												What a brilliant sequel to Chains of Satinav. While it started a bit slow and seemingly about two separate groups of individuals from different times, but it didn't take long to get me engrossed in the story and characters. I played the whole thing in one sitting - I just had to know what happened next.This is a tragic love story at it's heart, and yes, I cried. You should probably play Chains of Satinav first for the backstory of Geron the bird catcher and Nuri the fairy, but you won't miss anything in terms of plot if you were to start with this one as it tells a separate story.If you like point & click adventure games and are after something a bit serious I highly recommend this and Chains of Satinav, and I hold these in much higher regard than some of Daedalic's other works (perhaps it's just me, but I couldn't stand the protagonist in Deponia and I felt that the characters in The Whispered World just fell flat).These games have also got me interested in exploring The Dark Eye universe further, which is a role-playing game from Germany along the lines of Dungeons and Dragons.

												I normally don't write reviews for games I haven't finished or am done playing with, but I have to make an exception here. Memoria is just SO DAMN GOOD!If you've played and enjoyed The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav (and you should have) than you HAVE to play Memoria. It's not often that a sequel to a good game is even better than the original, but it is certainly the case here. The story is just as intriguing as the first game's, if not more so. The protagonists' (yes, plural) magical powers play a bigger role now and don't feel as  gimmicky as Geron's Break/Repair powers in Chains of Satinav. Some puzzles also require a more creative solution that you might be used to from the previous game, like choosing 3 abnormalities out of a dozen  in the  environment to combine into a fake vision that you can  implement in someone's brain.So, if you've played Chains of Satinav, GET MEMORIA. You will not regret it!If you've never played Chains of Satinav but think you might enjoy it, DO NOT PLAY MEMORIA just yet. Play Chains of Satinav first or you won't get most of what's going on in Memoria.			"

												Just a short recommendation: a fun adventure with a great storyline, nice graphics and enjoyable voice acting for the most part. I now want to play the prequel to this :) I really like the feature that allows skipping pixel-hunting by pressing space to show indicators for the items you can interact with.The situations/puzzles are of the right difficulty level and quite logical. Only one really stalled me while I needed to figure it out because the solution was a bit more ambiguous. 8/10. "

												Sadja al-Kedir is magnificent.Seriously, I really love how it all ties together, and how the resolution throws a different light on everything that has happened.The characters are varied and diverse, with their own different traits, backgrounds, goals and motivations.  Sadja is a princess, fiercely ambitious and bold, calculating yet terribly reckless - you just really have to play her story to get the full experience of this amazing lady; Geron is literally an unsung hero, he is underestimated (somewhat justifiably), has a selfish streak and can be dense, but he has his extremely lucky moments of ingenuity and resourcefulness, few though they may be;Bryda is the perfect mage student, top in all forms and classes, anticipated by senior academics for great things - but she is so very dissatisfied by the current state of magic - obscure, mundane and highly unexciting; Yet, ultimately, they share a few common themes: desperate determination and loss.  And that really shines through, by the end of the story.Not to mention, it's really super to have characters who have their non-white cultural roots clear to be seen in their personalities and actions, while not falling into roles reflecting exoticism.  Characters that stand out from the cast, nonetheless!  And are not all-good nor all-evil!  Huzzah!!I really hope there will be more games with such good writing!! I hope daedalic will produce more games featuring characters of Sadja's ilk!!Please playyyyyyyyy			"

												Great game.Great story, great art, great characters, great voice acting. I was sad to see the game end. It's of proper length and it has a satisfying ending and I hope it will get a sequel because I got attached to the main characters and would love to see (and hear) them again.It has varying forms of puzzling which never bored or frustrated me. I glanced at a walkthrough a few times to hasten a few things up which I didn't get right too soon, but I believe everything is solveable perfectly fine if one isn't in a hurry and maybe uses a pen and paper to sort some stuff.´A good thing: Throughout most parts of the game you can press a button to have things you can interact with in the world get highlighted. It helps those who don't want to look for ""hidden items"". It's not mandatory so those who love getting their full classic adventuring way can have it just as well. There is also a ""combination helper"" that, when enabled, puts a glow on your cursor when you hover with one item over another or over a spot in the world which it interacts with (though it seems towards the end it is sometimes isn't working fully either, intentionally or by accident).The story could have some logic loopholes, but I need to think some details over because things can get convoluted with various characters looking differently at events throughout different timelines and sharing their (un)knowing amongst each other.A downer: The English text and English voice acting aren't always aligning. Sometimes something is said but something else is written. In a few instances I had text or voice lines appear from previous scenes that made absolutely no sense in the scenes I was in at the time. One line (well, it was just one word, but still) was skipped away quickly even though I didn't press any button at all. There is a background journey ""log"" of sort you can look up and I noticed one text part not existing at all in the English version (it isn't just lacking translation - it's really simply missing, you get an empty subwindow when you try to read it in English language). These things don't happen too often, but they aren't exactly rare either.However it's possible the English voice acting is better than than the native one. I played the game in English because I'm used to that but glanced at the German version because the developers are from Germany: It's by no length bad but in direct, short comparison I liked some important characters better English voiced. But I could be biased because, as I said, I played it mostly in English.I noticed a specific scene that has significantly deviating English lines. The basic idea is still there, but there are some implications which are more direct in the German version. Could be that it's different in English because these are sexual implications. I hope the English version didn't shy away from the German original too often like this because as much as I like this game I don't think I'm gonna replay it in German anytime soon.Also, that journey log - it looks kinda nice, but it's not very handy to use. It's a wall of images that get added over the course of your journey with some logical lines connecting to the images back and forth. You click on these images and lines and get some info on what happened (which is appreciated because the story can be confusing at times). However some parts of this image wall one may look over accidently because there aren't always clear cuts between the images and connecting lines.It won't hurt to know the prequel ""Chains of Satinav"". The title ""Memoria"" is unfortunate as it should be ""The Dark Eye 2: Memoria"" to make clear that things happened before. This is an independent story, but one of the main characters and his female companion clearly had a long journey of their own before this, there are some references to events that happened back then one may understand and relate to better when having played the prequel first. I can't tell right now because I haven't played Chains of Satinav yet. The English voice acting is very great at showing that these two feel a lot for each other and went through a lot together, though, so it could be very well a positive aspect because it wants me to play Chains of Satinav soon.

OverviewA classic point-n-click adventure game where you alternate between 2 characters: Geron - a lowly peasant-mage who can do a wee bit of magic, and Sadja - a princess who lived in ancient times. Geron's story is told in present day, while Sadja's is recounted through flashbacks. Aside from solving puzzles the usual way by using objects with one another, you also sometimes have various magic skills at your disposal. This game is supposed to be a prequel/sequel to another earlier game, but I didn't play that one and found no problems at all following this one, nor did it affect my enjoyment/appreciation of the story.The Good- Very long game (took me several days to complete, including the time taken to deliberate over puzzles)- Super value for money (cost ~$1+ as part of a Daedalic game bundle offer)- Gorgeous, breathtaking painted graphics- Lots of different worlds/environments to explore- Fully voiced + good voice acting- Pleasant music + ambient sound- High quality game + solid production values- Fantastic, meaty, epic story- Some choice (in how the story branches) towards the end of the game- Interesting, well-developed characters- Many well done puzzles (logical yet required some thinking and not so straightforward)- Animated cutscenes at certain points in the game- Tons of achievements- Proper ending + makes you thinkThe Bad- Subtitles sometimes buggy (voice says something completely different from text)- A few buggy areas (e.g. you can click on something that technically isn't there in the ore adept's room)- Complete guesswork needed on some puzzles, especially those that required the use of visions- ""Save game"" feature needs a bit of refinement (the procedure is rather counter-intuitive)VerdictA truly epic game in terms of story and delivery. The many subplots and story branches kept things fresh and engaging. Puzzles were also quite ingenious for the most part. There were a few bugs but none affected gameplay. A must-play if you love point-n-click adventure games with a hint of romance and fantasy. "

												While there were some parts that I enjoyed, overall, I was really disappointed with this game for 3 main reasons:1. The story was contrived, convoluted, and uninteresting. This is the sequel to ""The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav"", a game that I liked so much, I started a new playthrough immedately after finishing it. Where ""Chains of Satinav"" has charm, a smooth-flowing story, and characters that are fleshed out and relateable, ""Memoria"" feels bloated and tedious. There are so many plot points pulled out of nowhere, I was constantly struggling to follow along and keep track of what the Hell was actually happening. This game expects you to have a photographic memory and miniscule, forgettable details often turn out to be crucial plot points.As an embarrasing example, towards the end of the game, an NPC solves a riddle that's been present the whole game and proclaims ""It's so obvious!"" - in that coversation you are TWICE given the option of saying ""I still don't get it"".2. The puzzles were crap.  Full disclaimer, I usually hate these kinds of point-and-click puzzle games, I just don't have the patience. BUT as I mentioned before, I thought ""Chains of Satinav"" was great.  ""Memoria"" has some of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, unintuitive, just-gonna-start-randomly-combining♥♥♥♥♥♥and-see-what-happens puzzles I've seen. About halfway through chapter 2, I said screw it and opened a walkthrough on my phone, because the solutions are just so nonsensical, and I didn't want to waste time faffing about.Another embarrasing example is when the game puts you in a foggy forrest maze, and after 5 minutes, a ""Click Here To Skip This Maze"" button appears in the upper-right corner.There's one puzzle where the solution is to COMBINE a SWORD with a SHURIKEN.And then you STICK A MACE INTO THE SWORD'S SCABBARD.WHAT3. Performance is terrible.  This game should be running at 1000 FPS, every scene is a static backdrop with maybe 1 or two moving characters.AND YETA N D   Y E TThe amount of stuttering and FPS drops (down to 15 sometimes!!!) was just totally absurd, there is no excuse for such a straight-forward game to be so poorly optimized. On a better game this would be a minor gripe, but because of how tedious the story and puzzles are already, the technical problems become much more noticeable and irritating.  ""Chains of Satinav"" had the same problem, but NOWHERE near this bad.As I said, I really liked the prequel game, ""Chains of Satinav"", and was ready to love this one too, but I'm probably never installing it again.

												The human mind has an innate ability to organize memories into stories... and then ask if someone else is authoring the story instead. Stories within stories and their authors inside them are common themes in various metafictional novels and films but have not appeared very often in games. Memoria builds an interesting, labyrinthian tale from themes of imagination, memory and myth that pleases the senses as well as the mind.Memoria picks up where Chains of Satinav left off, with the bird-catcher Geron once again leading the cast. Since playing the previous title is all but necessary I will not discuss any plot details from either. As a general description it can be said that the story takes place in two completely different times and places and accordingly on two different levels which mix in various interesting ways as events unfold. Unfortunately the story inside the main story, the one detailing Sadja, a princess in an Arabian-like kingdom, begins on the wrong foot. I have rarely seen a more cold-blooded and merciless exposition beginning to a story as the one for Sadja. To make things even worse her quest is a rather abstract one making it difficult to become immediately involved. Sadja herself is odd company: ambitious to the brink of ruthlessness with an odd sense of a grand fate awaiting her. As such she is as unusual creative choice but in the end does fit into the overall themes and design.The writing in general is more concerned with the whole than the parts which I found pleasing. There are no quotable one-liners nor amusing banter but given the fairytale surroundings this austerity may indeed be better than any rhetorical flower arrangements. The somewhat weak beginning is the only major flaw and offset by the very impressive ending. The many layers of mythology logic seen throughout the story are also unusual and take the place of any everyday realism. In this case the high fantasy works since the whole is kept to an economical length are there are no larger-than-life emotional outbursts. While the writing takes some time to draw the player in this cannot be said from the sensory stimulation. The hand-drawn environments are both lucid and vivid and could not have been done better. One of the key strengths with Chains of Satinav was the bittersweet orchestral soundtrack and while Memoria does not reach the same heights it does an admirable job of setting the mood. A true weakness in the presentation are once again the animations. Slight ruggedness during adventures is somewhat easy to ignore but becomes difficult indeed during moments of dialogue. When the only part of the face moving is the mouth the effect is jarring to say the least. As the puzzles require fantasy logic to solve some of them may be problematic but I did not see any insurmountable ones. The number of items, hotspots and screens needed for a major puzzle are kept to reasonable limits. The game also has a questlog to remind you of the current task as well as lore reminders of the things you have learned. Should you lose hope on a puzzle there is even a hint system for the desperate. Chains of Satinav introduced limited spellcasting into the otherwise traditional pointing-and-clicking. Geron only had one ability at his disposal in that game but now he has two in addition to Sadja's three. Not all of these are used very much so some editing could have been useful but on the other hand this system lessens the clunky ""bottomless pockets"" inventory-based problems of many other adventure games.Memoria's ultimate strength is perhaps a strong sense of identity. The developers did their very best with the indie resources available and cleary love the genre and the game as much as the adventure game audience does. Memoria will not conquer the world any more than any other contemporary adventure will but for those willing to appreciate its quiet appeal there is much pleasure to be discovered within these ten hours.

												Developed by: Daedalic EntertainmentPublished by: Deep Silver / Daedalic EntertainmentGenre: Adventure, Point & ClickMemoria tells you a story of princess Sadja; the one who traveled from faraway land called Fasar to Drakonia- to fight demons in Gorian desert. Her own journey to reach the fortress was not easy, determined by her ambitions- she struggled to reach her own goals, but something happened, she disappeared, and her tale was forgotten.Control & GameplayIn this game, you will play through two different time periods as two main characters; Geron the bird catcher and Sadja the princess. Both characters have each unique stories and plots, Sadja as we know, she- pursuing her goal to be a hero, meanwhile in the present, Geron, wants to lift a curse from Nuri, her girlfriend. I expected I would not be confused with control, and I was right! It's so responsive and easy to recognize (as there are some tutorials at beginning), especially when you are familiar with Daedalic games, they have similarity of controls. The best part, Memoria has a feature to show POIs (Point of interests) which helps you to see some unnoticable items or POI, so you will be able to solve the puzzle in no time (well, some puzzles need more efforts, but they're not too difficult). There are also objectives and notes which can be handy especially when you accidentally skip a scene or dialogue. For both characters, inventories and magics are different, for example Geron has an ability to repair/destroy with magic, and he has Nuri's Necklace, while Sadja's ability to petrify, which make players have to remember a bit, but it's not that hard for there are just several items and magic.GraphicsFor the most part, truly magnificent. The attention to detail is lovable, the tomb of Malakkar for example, has nice detail of art, unique drawing, and beautiful lighting. They are seemed to be magically drawn and -- I can say it's beautiful, every detail really caught my attention. Every part of location has unusual look, and Yap! Memoria visually connects me to the game, which makes the game itself more enjoyable.AudioThe other part that I love from this game is the audio, like it's promised, Memoria has a subtle soundtrack and high-quality voiceovers. It was honestly fantastic, atmospheric; you can feel the relaxed, gripping, and quaint ambience. What I love the most is the voiceovers, their voices and accents actually fit to the characters and the game, and the dialogues aren't boring (as if it is a movie). Although the audio is almost perfect, I still encounter bugs where voices are missing.ConclusionMemoria is one of the best point-n-click adventure games I've ever played, sadly I avoid telling many good things here-- in case of spoilers. Even though there's still a little bug lives in the game, it doesn't really annoy you, but what I can say, the game is highly recommended for those who love puzzles, solving riddles, and artworks. It's so inspiring, really worth buying because of its features, and it's so enjoyable (YES, it's incredibly fun).Overall score: 4.8/5

												A point-and-click adventure game, Memoria tells the story of two people 450 years apart: Geron, an amateur mage attempting to find a way to restore the original form of his girlfriend, trapped in the form of a raven; and Sadja, a princess determined to carve her name into history's list of heroes.For those of us used to modern, more interactive games, Memoria may seem a little slow-paced and tedious, and at times, the puzzles seem to be of questionable quality, involving trial-and-error more than anything else (the forest is a good example). However, as a story, the game is a great way to spend a few hours, and despite its short length and simplicity, the gradual developments and revelations are well done, and should keep you wanting to find out more.Certainly this is not a game I would recommend for the general audience, but if a good short story is your thing, then I would say this is worth its cost, and in any case will hopefully encourage Daedalic and other game developers to create more games like these.

												This game is a direct sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, so playing that one first is a must. Stellar writing and soundtrack; improves upon the weaknesses of the first game, better animation and puzzle design. As well as continuing Geron's story, this time you follow another main playable character: Sadja. I found hers to be the strongest storyline, although Geron and Nuri's is quite good with a lot of interconnection between the two playable characters. The artwork is absolutely beautiful, even better than tough-act-to-follow Chains of Satinav. A few of the puzzles might seem illogical, but...as to not spoil anything, I'll just say think outside the box :DWith The Whispered World sequel announced, I'm hoping something similar will follow for Memoria. Great game, try if you like point and click adventure games or if curious about the genre, start with this series.			"

												Really great game that was sitting half finished in my steam library way to long. Once I got into it again after a long pause I could not help myself but finish it within a few sessions. I am regretting that I had a long pause between the first and second half of the game. Really recommend this game to be played in a few long sessions for maximum immersion into the story.Of course you should play the prequel first as the story is heavily based on chains of satinav (which is also very good).The game has a nice scenerie, a good soundtraick, fair voice acting and a fantastic story. So if you fancy a good fantasy adventure I really recommend playing this game (and the prequel).I hope there will be a third entry of the series.			"

												After being absolutely blown away by The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, I was very excited to continue the journey into Memoria. This game is fantastic; it retains that epic, big quality that Chains of Satinav had. While I do love this game, I have one personal nitpick...Lets get it out of the way before I gush my love.In the prequel, we follow Geron and Nuri. I fell in love with these characters, and although the ending was bittersweet, I would have been content had it ended there. However, we see them in Memoria, as Geron is hoping to change Nuri back to her original form. This goal leads him to learn about Sadja, who is the heroine that Memoria centers around. Sadja is an amazing heroine and her story is incredible. The more I learned about Sadja and her quest, Geron and Nuri's quest seemed less significant, so by the time it was time to settle the ending for Geron and Nuri, I wasn't as enthused as I knew I should be. I quickly resolved their story, just so I could see what happened to Sadja, because that was who I really cared about in THIS game. Now all the good stuff, and there's alot.Just like Chains of Satinav, it is gorgeous. It's more of the beautifully hand-drawn backgrounds and characters that we love. The cutscenes are also breathtaking. The look of this game gives it that epic feel. The voice acting is superb. The soundtrack blends itself perfectly to the look of the game, bringing tears to my eyes in places.The characters are well done, but the ones that stick out are Sadja and her magical staff. These two make the game. Sadja is everything one would want in a good heroine. She is strong, resolved, caring, feisty, and dramatic. Her magical staff is a perfect balance for her: witty, supportive, concerned, and loyal. I have never rooted so hard for a princess to end up with an enchanted object. They are a perfect team, and the love and loyalty they share is felt and is truly the heart of this game. Seriously, the ending had me in tears.As far as mechanics go, it is a standard P&C, with some interesting twists. Like in Chains of Satinav, you can perform magic. There are 4 spells you learn and will use throughout the game. The puzzles are fairly standard. Some are a tad difficult, but the game gives all the facts you need in order to solve them.I am so glad that I played this game. I know there will be another play through in the future. The story, the look, and above all, Sadja and her magical staff are the reasons this will become a classic.			"

												In my opinion this was a really enjoyable and great point and click adventure game, and I fully recommend it to anyone that likes the genre.Following two storylines, with Geron and Nuri's tale working as a framing device for Sadja's adventure, which is the real focus of the story. You might get a bit more out of the game if you have played The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, since then you have played out the background story between the bird catcher and his love, but I wouldn't say it is required to understand what is happening at all.The new character Sadja was much more interesting to me than Geron. And I greatly enjoyed each and every part with her. Driven and ambitious, but still with a softer side that she usually kept hidden. Her character and story is a mystery that is slowly uncovered through the journey. Geron has a simple and clear goal, that makes it easy to sympathize and understand him. Which also means we don't have to explore his character so much to understand his actions and motivations.The story had several turns that I didn't see coming, and I was engaged through the entire experience. Because Geron isn't the brightest kid on the block, you might figure something out a bit before him in the story and dialogue, but not so early that you end up facepalming. There are also a few funny moments in this otherwise slightly dark tale, some of my favorite being dialogue between Sadja and her companion through most of her story.The puzzles were good, and for the most part not too difficult. I got through a lot more of the game without needing a guide than I did in Chains of Satinav. And there are a lot of magical spells to add an additional element to puzzle solving. With Geron and Sadja gaining access to different forms of magic through their journey.			"

With one or two exceptions, well designed puzzles that don't require using everything on everything Much better character animation than in satinav, where characters resembled animated wooden dolls.Wonderfully painted backgroundsBAD:Lipsinc animation is as bad as in most daedalic games, but not used too abundantlyMade in visionaire studio, so screen transitions can be slow and sometimes the game can become unresponsive when game details are set too high even on high end machines.

												So my 2nd game of the Dark Eye Universe. You should really play first The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav.The sequel gives new hope that i lost after the ending of TDE:CoS bad ending/ outro. So burdensome the first part story ends, so happy i am about this 2nd part. The story has many great parts (ending is better then part 1, but still with a little sad factor), the graphics are still unique and the style work good with all other parts together. The sound is most time plain and appropriate. So you can focus on the main point of the game (riddles, art of design and the tale).I give this game 92 % for point and click fans. Other people should test it somehow. The price for 7-12 hours is high even for this quality. So wait for a discount and then i hope you enjoy your buy with many funny hours of playing.

Short version: 88%If the puzzles wouldn’t turn into a long series of guesswork, Memoria could be, with little doubt, one of the greatest point ‘n’ click adventure games: it will be difficult to find a story that is even on par with this one.Long version:Memoria is a direct sequel of Chains of Satinav, and as such it is also set in the world of Dark Eye, Germany’s most popular high fantasy table-top RPG setting.I cannot express how good the story of Memoria is. It is divided into two timelines: in one Geron (the protagonist from the previous game) is trying to change back his love to the way she used to be; and in the other we follow Sadja, a young woman who lived 450 years ago and tried to make her name immortal. They share a common mystery that is built with excellent pace, making you involved in the story more and more. And the solution/resolution is just perfect. It is not a happy ending, nor a sad one. It is bittersweet… it is surprising; it is everything a story needs.It also helps that the voice acting is significantly better than previously. All actors (but one) had great investment in their characters and gave a new emotional layer to the story.Sadly, the gameplay doesn’t reflect the greatness of the writing. The puzzles start mild, just the usual nonsensical adventure game logic. Then they threw in a forest maze (Broken Sword 2 style). After that, a long series of multi-guess combination puzzles, where figuring out the exact order of the right answers can take forever.Therefore, Memoria can be either a short 4-5 hour adventure or a 30+ hour one if you are unlucky with your guesses. And this can kill the mood really fast… even though this game could have been Daedelic Entertainment’s greatest masterpiece otherwise.			"

												Great game from Daedalic! I still didn't play Chains of Satinav, the previous game, so I assure you this is not a requirement to fully enjoy Memoria. I couldn't stop playing it (and you know, getting achievements and stuff).The artwork and scenery made it visually wonderful, the music worked beautifully, and the story was quite compelling, considering this is a fantasy point and click game. It even brought me close to tears at the end. Oh, Sharisad...The puzzles......... most were rather logical, but some were eye-rollingly silly, designed only to have you trying random stuff. Well, this is something most point and click games suffer from, and Memoria is no exception.All in all, totally recommended!			"

												Well, just finished the game and I was totally blown away by the ending. Or maybe it was all the accumulated feels I had between the princess and her companion. I found this game on reccomendations when I tried to locate a game similar to syberia. Of course, it was no where as beautiful and free but it was enchanting to venture around such carefully crafted sites.The Pros- Beautiful story. It carried out really well- Narratives were entertaining. I love how each voice actor represented their characters so well,- Puzzles are straightforward but you might need a walkthrough for certain ones.- The atmosphere of the whole game is just A+The Cons- Maybe it's just my computer but sometimes the games lags- Too much commentary. You can skip it if you wish but I always like to know more. - She doesn't run, she walks. And he does too. Hahaha- I need a sequel. This is just too amazing. "

												Incredible is really the only word I can use to describe this game. The animations are so smooth and I love the little details Daedalic added in, such as each character breathing which was a nice tweak over the prequel, and how the arrows and inventory change for both Geron and Sadja. The characters are diverse, well written and easily likable, and the voice acting is top notch. Once again Daedalic has produced an extremely beautiful, immersive point and click adventure with a wonderful new help system which is neither too vague, nor too obvious. It explores the themes of both an established relationship and a growing one, and the building of trust between two souls. The writing of the story and the characters is so incredible that you end up finding a magical staff endearing, and there are amusing little quips and innuendos that had me in laughter. The feeling of different cultures and traditions is a really nice touch and it's a breath of fresh air to see that not every character is white. It's lovely to see a female protaginist willful and sure of herself and her beliefs, yet with a tender and forgiving side which allows Daedalic's ability to present incredible character depth to shine through. It's honestly impressive that a game made by indie developers can be as complex and beautiful as Memoria is, and at times I have to remind myself that it was made my such a company. Daedalic is one of my favourite game companies and this game is exceptional proof as to why. At its current discount, it's more than worth buying.			"

												Hands down one of the best games I've ever played. Amazing story, artwork and music, I played it in one setting and forgot to save in between so I have all the cutscenes and no savefiles haha. I've never been more enchanted, more captivated by an animated story than this one, I was so intensely drawn to everything that happened that I couldn't help physically reacting to it haha. I wish I could forget it all and play it all over again. I don't know what I expected when I bought it but it wasn't this. The story is intruiging, the mysteries are actually puzzling and captivating, the sound (music and voice acting) is breathtaking and the characterization is stunning. The switching perspectives between Geron and Sadja as Geron tries to uncover her story really add to the mystery and to the player's curiosity. The staff has an enarmoring personality of its own and its interactions with Sadja throughout the story are original, believable and really touching. I don't know what else I can say to make you play this without giving the story away (I went into it completely unspoiled and due to the 'riddle' status of the story I would recommend you not to spoil anything for yourself, there will be so many reveals throughout the story and you want to experience them all truthfully). I would recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate a beautiful story, even if you just use a guide and cheat your way through all the puzzles, it's worth it for the story, please consider playing it!

												I purchased this game on a whim and it turned out to be amazing.  What a fantastic story.  I hope there will be another after this one! A few of the puzzles were a tad clunky and there were a few things that just didn't make sense but overall the flow was great.  I fell in love with the characters and would absolutely recomend this game.  One of the best stories I've seen in a game for quite some time!My only regret is not playing the Memoria games in order.  I guess I'll play the first one second.			"

												From start to finish, the most solid story I've seen in an adventure game from recent memory.  The art is gorgeous and gives the impression of living inside a painting of a beautiful world.  The puzzles make sense and don't detract from the story.  Memoria accomplishes a really satisfying ending in a way that few adventure games achieve, tying together loose threads while leaving just enough room to wonder how life might go on in the world the game authors created.

												I bought this during a sale, so I definitely can't say I was against the price. I was very happy to catch it on sale. What I would say though is that I sincerely wish that it had clearer display towards the top of the store page that told how the game was a Sequal. With the title what it is there's no easy way to tell it is a sequel as there is no number,  nor is there a specific statement in the trailer that says it is the sequel. It mentions the first game in the trailer but it lists it as another game the creators made not specifically that it was connected to this one. It definitely is something that is going to have me triple checking games to see if they are the first game or not now.Aside from this I am genuinely pretty happy about the game. The art, the way the story is told, the music. They all come together beautifully in a way that has me wanting more. I had to look up how many chapters there were within game so to try to keep myself from finishing it too fast. There were several times here and there I was stuck in ways I didn't feel I should have been however. I could tell generally what the overall goal was of what I needed to do even when there wasn't too clear of instruction, but because of how items and surroundings lacked sufficient information I was unable to easily decipher what to link together. Without, as the character would say, 'Random Guess Work.' One place in particular in game was irritating to no bounds for the way one would be constantly reprimanded for making a tiny mistake in a way that made it feel as though there was absolutely nothing one could do. Three characters in the same area, two shouting the third's name so repeatedly that I sincerely think I will never be happy to hear it ever again despite it originally being what I thought was a great name choice.Overall I'd say it's worth it on sale or not on sale if you like a colorful tale told in a way that makes you feel thoroughly immersed for the way you help to forge the story itself. I would also add despite being disappointed I accidentally played a sequal game before the prequel, this game could be played without the other for how it is an amazing story all on it's own.			"

												This is an absolutely beautiful game, both graphically and in terms of story.  I would highly recommend to any fans of the point & click genre of adventure games.Sound, music, and voice acting are all top-notch.  Voice acting is especially good compared to many games where the actors substitute hamminess and melodrama for a true-sounding, emotional dialogue.The art is very nicely done, with some really breathtaking backdrops and good character design.The plot weaves together two separate stories into a really compelling narrative that is very original.  With so many games, books, and movies out there, it's hard to find a story that's truly unique, but Memoria does a very good job, especially with Sadja's story.  There are two possible endings to Garon and Nuri's story, and at least for me, having finished both endings, it was a VERY difficult choice to make between the two.  Although I admit that I'm a sap at the best of times, it's unusual for a game to make me feel so much of an emotional investment in every main character.So all in all, this game is well worth it.  I do recommend playing the first game, Chains of Satinav, before this one, else you lose an important part of Garon and Nuri's backstory.  It's not required to play Chains first, but it will enhance the experient (and Chains of Satinav is quite a good game as well, if not as intricate as Memoria).  Give them both a try!			"

												MUCH better than the first game, which left me somewhat disappointed by the shortness and the ending. I loved Sadja and the staff, so much more than Geron and Bryda. And from the ending, I want an entire game all about Sadja now. Geron and Nuri's story is done, and Sadja is the most fantastic character Daedalic has made to date. There are still issues... some dialogue doesn't match the subtitles, as if read in the wrong order, or pieces of other dialogues got thrown in accidentally in place of what was supposed to be there; and some of the time, it's read in entire different languages. The glitches are few enough that I don't mind them. I know most people might not think so, but I was amused when the characters suddenly spoke an unfamiliar, harsh language in place of what I was expecting. Also, as an Arab, I'm a little annoyed at how Arab culture is portrayed. Sadja's clearly meant to be Arab, with names like Halef Bin Jalef and all, but they're mangled. Marhaba is pronounced and spelled wrong, as are most things. This won't matter to most players, whose experience in the Arabic language and culture will be minimal at best, but it bothers me. It's rare to see Arab characters, so I treasure the ones who aren't meant to be stereotypes and terrorists, but seeing so much going wrong seems like the creators only cared about the mystical oriental angle, and not an actual culture that still lives and breathes to this day. Despite that, and the fact that Sadja was clearly designed with Western beauty standards in mind (there aren't many noses like what she's designed with in any Arabs I know, and my circle is great), I love Sadja's character and personality, and would pay out the nose for a game focused just on her and the staff's magic.

Whoa there!I didn't know Memoria was a continuation of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav  and went in totally blind. I would recommend playing Part 1 First before playing Memoria!! OK, that being said I love adventure games and have played several classics.StorySInce this was part 2 of ""The Dark Eye"" Series - and I didn't know that when I started - the beginning was a little confusing as there is little to no explanation/backstory as you begin. A basic cut-scene would have been VERY HELPFUL but isn't a deal-breaker - I found myself easily immersed after a few minutes.  The story is a wonderful blend of danger, magic, adventure and love.  With a dual-character storyline that is interwoven, you switch back-and-forth between the two storylines as you progress further into the game. This helped to keep things interesting, and you just want to keep going!GraphicsI was originally hoping for something more adult, less cartoonish and more ""rendered"". But after playing just an hour or two Memoria had stolen my heart.  The art direction was executed well - the scenes look detailed and immersive. The speech animation during cut-scenes could have been a lot better though, It looks kind of ""choppy"" and I orginally  thought my computer was stuttering but later found out that's just how the game is.  GameplayIt's your standard point-and-click with a floating item/magic area that auto-hides itself when you hover off. (nice touch) Overall I enjoyed the gameplay very much, the use of the hotspot indicator and double-click shortcut helped in those times when you just wanted to get where you were going or needed a little push in the right direction. The hint system is also nice so you don't have to go running to a walkthrough when you're really stuck (I admit using it a couple times when I was REALLY REALY Stumped).Puzzles, Items and Spells The puzzles were challenging and enjoyable, there's a good mix of items and combinations to try when solving them so that's fun. In most cases it's not immediately obvious what to do which I like because it shouldn't be too easy!  I loved the addition of spells which added a completely new dimension to experimenting and solving. MusicLovely and atmospheric, but just slightly repetitive in some areas.   Final AnswerIf you like point and click adventures I would highly recommend this game!			"

												A masterpiece. This game is amazing. I just finished it a couple days ago and my mind it still blown. The game-play is excellant and really makes you think. Sometimes you think you've tried everything. But every puzzle is always solvable, and usually in the simplest of fassions. Helps you to think outside the box, too. The characters are wonderful as well. Most are very likable and the creators did a good job in making even the characters you don't expect to like likeable. I would totally recomend!			"

												Outstanding story. It follows right after the end of Chain of Satinav. Graphic is similar to the previous game, but the puzzles, imo has been improved a little. I had fps drops everytime I go to another screen from 60 to 1. But its not that serious, the fps goes up again in seconds. If you have played the first one, definitely get this one. It has two endings, but there is not any big differences between the two.			"

												I really enjoyed Memoria but I have to admit I enjoyed Chains of Satinav more. Chains of Satinav was one of the first point and click games I played and I felt a lot more connected to it than Memoria. I also thought the puzzles in Memoria were a lot more obscure and required more guesswork even though I have played a lot more point and click games since chains of satinav and am therefor better at them than I used to be. Nonetheless I have to give Memoria a thumbs up because it is still a very good adventure game and if you like this type of game you'll love Memoria. Just be sure to play chains of satinav first it's a must.			"

												Memoria is an interesting conclusion to the first game Chains of Satinav. I found it to be more enjoyable than the first game as well. Thus, it has become my favorite point-and-click adventure game now. The game sort of has two main characters. Geron is definitely the primary main character, as he was in the first game. However, for practically half of the game, another character is in control. The player goes through the dream memories about a woman named Sadja. I'm glad that the developers made those dreams playable, instead of cutscenes. The story of Sadja definitely makes the game more interesting, and can keep the player wondering about how she is connected to the events of the present. Spoiler comment: I'm really glad that it didn't have a happily ever after ending (again). I guess one could imagine that Geron and Nuri could have that if she was changed back and  eventually remembered who she is, but it seems unlikely.The graphics improved from the first game. I didn't encounter any glitches with this one either. No typos. Good job on the technical stuff.			"

												One of the best modern point and clicks that I've had the pleasure of playing. Interesting characters/setting and the puzzles are all solvable without too much trouble while still providing a challenge. The ending lets it down a little and unfortunately that seems to be a problem with a lot of the Daedalic developed/produced adventure games! Don't let that put you off if you are interested in playing it though as overall the game experience is a good one.7/10Full review here: http://thereticule.com/memoria-the-verdict/ "

												Memoria is a sequel to Chains of Satinav.  In my opinion, I would highly recommend playing CoS first.  While most of the story in Memoria is new, it is framed by the story/characters coming from CoS.  In the least, you will feel more invested in those characters while playing Memoria, which enhances the experience.I don't discuss plots in reviews much, but will say that Memoria is two stories in one. The first being a continuation of CoS that frames the story within the story.  The second story is a tale of a young princess who lived 400 or so years in the past.  The dual story device here is both a blesssing and a burden in an otherwise very good game.  You get to continue to play with characters from CoS that you care about and are invested in, while learning their fates.   Yet, that part of the story feels a bit short and unsatisfying as probably most fans of the first game would like.  The other tale though is very good with some very solid adventure type gameplay.Again, following from my CoS review, the art style, voice acting and music are all excellent.  The art style here seems a bit more refined/modern than the more painted feel of CoS, but is no less great.  I found the puzzles in the game to be generally harder than CoS, with a good many being quite unintuitive.  There are some real stretches here.  I have to admit that my lack of patience caused me to peak in at a walkthrough at least 2 or 3 times to get moving.  But overall still very enjoyable.The story and adventures of Sadja - in the inner tale from the past - is really very nice and satifying from begining to end.   The framing tale of Geron and Nuri, while solid, felt a bit less so, but it is still very good and marries nicely with the other tale.  If you've played CoS I think you will understand what I mean, but just don't want to comment on that directly in the review so as not to impact the objectively of a new player experiencing the game.A very solid companion piece to Chains of Satinav,  with the combined two games providing plenty of hours of strong adventure type gameplay and story telling.  Certianly a must for fans of the genre.  I hope we one day see more games to continue the main characters stories.			"

Still, memoria was far above being casual. Nice Soundtrack btw. So, if its not too expansive,i'd recommend you to have a try. Check my screens, if You don't mind some spoilers. Well, no spoilers, unless you speak german. 9/10

												Memoria is a fantastic game, well written with an in depth narrative not often achieved. It abounds in interesting characters, beautifully executed art style and a gameplay system that is surprisingly non frustrating for a genre known to be experimental.As with it's predecessor The Chains of Satinav, the first thing that will strike you about Memoria is the gorgeously rendered art. The illustrative style is beautiful to behold and every bit as suited to the narrative, as it is to the concept of traditional fantasy. The animations are smoother and more realistic than in Chains of Satinav, which was rather welcome as the transitions are more realistic. The characters appear natural when speaking and this adds to the overall immersion. The sound is again wonderful, the orchestral soundtrack, is neither overpowering nor dominant and does not detract attention from the gameplay or environmental sounds. The voice-acting is particularly pleasant and the actors they have chosen are very good, (in English, I'm not sure of other language localizations) carrying across their characters emotions in a sincere and convincing way.The narrative and characterization is supreme. In other titles, Daedalic have hinted at their capacity to tell stories well, and here in Memoria, they have reached a pinnacle. Each character is distinctly realized, and stay true to their motivations. The narrative itself is both an interesting interpretation of the quest story, whilst simultaneously introducing the Dark Eye setting. Less lore is revealed in this game than in Chains of Satinav, but what is revealed is done so in small sections that are quick and easy to assimilate letting the player continue with the story without getting bogged down by too many details (you'll spend enough time exploring the world visually as it is). It is the story that sells this game, it has a depth of maturity to it, unusual for this sort of narrative, whilst still being easy enough to interpret for younger audiences and it has an astonishingly beautiful message about the strength and endurance of love.In addition the intertwining narratives are skillfully executed, both Geron's and Sadja's quests mesh well together and the juxtaposition and movement between the two is fascinatingly done, without becoming dull or uninteresting.The gameplay is amazingly logical. There are a few moments where you will be surprised at the combination of items, but on the whole, the interaction between objects+objects+world is surprisingly easy and consistent. Where the game does throw a curveball though is in the environmental puzzles, as these may become quite tricky to resolve, especially if you haven't paid attention to the clues from dialogue and scattered about the environment. This is most definitely a game that encourages observation. Memoria is a supreme example of its type, with logical puzzles, beautiful atmosphere and art, and a story that should linger in your memory, Memoria is highly recommended!			"

												The characters in the game are unexpectedly diverse and nuanced. When I picked it up on sale I had not realized it was a sequel, but after the initial few moments in the game that did not matter much. The voice acting was good, as was the writing and characterizations, the environments pleasant, and the puzzles not-annoying. I have subsequently gone out and bought all of Daedelic's games on Steam because of my experience with Memoria - so when I say that this game is a new favourite adventure of game, I really do mean it. I would NOT recommend this game for dudebro's or someone trying to satisfy twitchy trigger fingers. It's a story-driven point-and-click adventure game.			"

												A truly remarkable game! You must place chains of Satinav before this title, its a must. This is a beautiful and almost perfect sequal to chains. I really liked how they did it. It wasn't exactly as insane a story as chains but the story is beautiful. This one is much linear then chains with much simpler puzzles. The cutscenes are what are improved from the first game. What makes this a great game is the wonderful story with an ending that blew me away. I kinda wish they'd make a sequel to this one too. Daedalic is great at making these kinds of games. I'm so glad I played these games, I just wish it wasnt' so short.			"

												This game has the most amazing storyline i've read in a long time, if you're into magic tales and artefacts and princesses and wars between supernatural creatures, superpowers, forgotten traditions. Only following the story was enough to catch my interest so much that i couldn't let the game aside until i finished. The gameplay on the other hand has the interesant twist of switching between the 2 times of the story, current and the past that Geron dreams about, which makes you cut off any bordom of the same play throughout the game. The puzzles are interesting and rather intuitive, so you don't get lost and miss the story. And it adds quite a bonus if you played before the Chains of Satinav (first part of the) game.Totally recommend it, it fascinated me!			"

												It tells a really magical storyIt is one of those titles that exemplifies games as a medium for literature(sadly, a lot of wonderful stories are hidden from the public eye beneath the shroud of the label ""games"")i will give this title my honest opinion.If i am to review it as a ""GAME"" where you have to run here and there and kill a bunch of demons, taking serious consideration of its combat system and combat mechanics...2/10it is thanks to its thought provoking puzzles that it manages to even earn a score on this departmentBUT in my opinion, its gameplay aspects isn't what this title is selling.THE STORY and the MAGICAL EXPERIENCE brought out by its art are what this title is all about.The Art has its charm and really well-done. It fleshes out the wonderful story it is trying to tell.The story is a bit on the ""common"" side, BUT the way it was told was brilliant.Being on the ""common"" side is not all that bad because the way the plot was executed.

It was a bit short.OVERALLI can really consider this as a piece of literature.thus i give it a score of 7.5/10and a thumbs up(P.S. finishing chains of Satinav first brings more magic to the experience)			"

												If there was a poll for most Original Story for 2013, this will be my pick! (Not even the Last of Us: a little too predictable)You will not see the twists coming until it is told to you, the audience.The characters especially Princess Sadja would grow on anyone, in fact one can't help but wonder that Geron's story is a side story and the main character is Princess Sadja but it works well and every major character (save for Nuri) has a chance to shine. My only regrets are that the game is too short and I wish to explore the world of The Dark Eye. Which I can't help but wonder...if Daedalic would ever make a different game (like RPG) for this universe because this universe begs to be explored.  Otherwise, it is a beautiful game and a creative storyline.As for the puzzles, a few parts did not make sense but for most of it, it does...mostly because the structure was simple and some repetition going on. I would say I had a much harder time in the previous game.			"

												This was an incredibly beautiful game that packed a real emotional punch (moreso even than the first game). The characters are engaging and I was wrapped up in their tale so much that I basically played this straight through in one sitting. I strongly recommend playing Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav first to understand the backstory for several cast members. Most of my reactions are wrapped up in spoilers so I don't want to wander too far in depth. But in short:Positives+Intriguing story - with something of a framed narrative to it+Beautiful art+Engaging characters who you'll care about+Overall good voiceactingNegatives-Some weird dialogue/subtitle glitches. There were major mis-matches at a couple (non plot crucial) points. Also there was suddenly German or Dutch audio during one of the search the wood scenes.That's genuinely my only complaint in this otherwise solid game.			"

												Memoria is a fantastic game, well written with an in depth narrative not often achieved. It abounds in interesting characters, beautifully executed art style and a gameplay system that is surprisingly non frustrating for a genre known to be experimental.As with it's predecessor The Chains of Satinav, the first thing that will strike you about Memoria is the gorgeously rendered art. The illustrative style is beautiful to behold and every bit as suited to the narrative, as it is to the concept of traditional fantasy. The animations are smoother and more realistic than in Chains of Satinav, which was rather welcome as the transitions are more realistic. The characters appear natural when speaking and this adds to the overall immersion. The sound is again wonderful, the orchestral soundtrack, is neither overpowering nor dominant and does not detract attention from the gameplay or environmental sounds. The voice-acting is particularly pleasant and the actors they have chosen are very good, (in English, I'm not sure of other language localizations) carrying across their characters emotions in a sincere and convincing way.The narrative and characterization is supreme. In other titles, Daedalic have hinted at their capacity to tell stories well, and here in Memoria, they have reached a pinnacle. Each character is distinctly realized, and stay true to their motivations. The narrative itself is both an interesting interpretation of the quest story, whilst simultaneously introducing the Dark Eye setting. Less lore is revealed in this game than in Chains of Satinav, but what is revealed is done so in small sections that are quick and easy to assimilate letting the player continue with the story without getting bogged down by too many details (you'll spend enough time exploring the world visually as it is). It is the story that sells this game, it has a depth of maturity to it, unusual for this sort of narrative, whilst still being easy enough to interpret for younger audiences and it has an astonishingly beautiful message about the strength and endurance of love.In addition the intertwining narratives are skillfully executed, both Geron's and Sadja's quests mesh well together and the juxtaposition and movement between the two is fascinatingly done, without becoming dull or uninteresting.The gameplay is amazingly logical. There are a few moments where you will be surprised at the combination of items, but on the whole, the interaction between objects+objects+world is surprisingly easy and consistent. Where the game does throw a curveball though is in the environmental puzzles, as these may become quite tricky to resolve, especially if you haven't paid attention to the clues from dialogue and scattered about the environment. This is most definitely a game that encourages observation. Memoria is a supreme example of its type, with logical puzzles, beautiful atmosphere and art, and a story that should linger in your memory, Memoria is highly recommended!			"

												The characters in the game are unexpectedly diverse and nuanced. When I picked it up on sale I had not realized it was a sequel, but after the initial few moments in the game that did not matter much. The voice acting was good, as was the writing and characterizations, the environments pleasant, and the puzzles not-annoying. I have subsequently gone out and bought all of Daedelic's games on Steam because of my experience with Memoria - so when I say that this game is a new favourite adventure of game, I really do mean it. I would NOT recommend this game for dudebro's or someone trying to satisfy twitchy trigger fingers. It's a story-driven point-and-click adventure game.			"

												I did not realize until after I started the game that it was a sequel to ""The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav"", which I have not yet played, all bad research by me. I feel like I missed out on some backstory, but I did get a good grasp of the story in Memoria without having played Chains. I expect though, that for a fuller experience it should be played after the prequel.Anyway, still a very nice game. I really liked the painted look artstyle, the characters and landscapes all look good. The voiceacting is pretty good; but it annoyed me that several characters sounded so similar; I assume its by the same voice actor, but he could at least tried some variations. At one point the colour of the text in the subtitle is the only way I exstinguished two of the characters. It's not a huge problem though, as these same voice characters almost never appear at the same time. I really liked the story, playing one character who has dreams and visions about another character, each with same style point&click world to go through. The game is mostly playable without a guide, I only had to check a couple of things for achievements iirc. Some achievements are obtained through just plying through the story, some are harder to find. If you mess around with the puzzles too much you get the filthy-casual-option of skipping it. I enjoyed the puzzles and spell usage throughout the game and look forward to the sale of the prequel. Memoria is worth buying, especially on sale, for anyone who like fantasy-world p&c games.			"

Still, memoria was far above being casual. Nice Soundtrack btw. So, if its not too expansive,i'd recommend you to have a try. Check my screens, if You don't mind some spoilers.

												I'll begin by saying that Playing Chains of Satinav is really recomended before playing this game. Memoria has its flaws, you'll probably encounter them as you play: a few bugs or nonsense item descriptions then and there, art quality dropping suddenly in certain scenes, etc... But there's a lot of good in this game to be discovered. Expect a good game, not the best adventure game you ever played, not  a ground-breaking one, but still one that has the power to surprise you.First of all, I found the story different, interesting, and well driven. You play as two different characters, and the way the story connects both parts is pretty cool. I also had a few ""aha"" moments with this game, and that's really welcome :DOn the other hand, the game features weird puzzles, not specially challenging, but interesting. Some of them are unlike any other I've encounter in similar games before, and they felt really refreshing.The art is pretty similar to Chains of Satinav: some of the backgrounds look great, characters are mostly 2D but Geron and Sadja are actually 3D models. The style is good, some of the illustrations are gorgeous, most of them are really great, but it can feel inconsistent at moments (specially with characters, as they are somewhat animated even if they are part of an illustration, which feels weird).So, if you like The Dark Eye, this is a no-brainer. If you liked Chains of Satinav, you will probably enjoy this one even more. And if you enjoy twisting stories and non-conventional puzzles, give it a try.  You'll like it for sure.			"

												The story and the way it's been told exeeds even the games predecessor. Especially the first time you play with Sadja was just awesome. After that, it loses a bit of it's atmosphere but still remains exiting.Most of the puzzles were clearer than in Chains of Satinav, but you'll stumble about some puzzle designs that render brute forcing quite useless. That's good if you like these kind of puzzles, but else won't be happy without a walkthrough at hand.Highly recommended for the story and the way it's told!			"

												Ok so hopefully if you're considering playing this it's because you've played through and enjoyed the wonderful Chains of Satinav and want more of Geron and Nuri. Well personally I felt that the Chains of Satinav was a better game because of it's story and characters, and although we are reintroduced to some old characters, a lot of the story takes place in the past with new characters. I say this not to put you off but just to let you know. The game itself is still great, and I would recomend it certainly. However the puzzles are a little less intuitive and often less rewarding than it's predecessor, the multiple screens and short animations make trial and error methods a little tedious, and more often than I'd like I found myself reaching out for an online guide.The animation has been greatly improved, those fantastic backdrops in CoS are even more beautiful in this game. Also the characters have been given a breath of fresh air in the form of a breathing animation that brings them to life and takes away that wooden feeling they gave you before. But the music in Memoria seems to have slipped in quality and doesn't quite have that melancholy atmosphere CoS had.In short although I do recommend this title and enjoyed playing it I felt it wasn't quite up to the standard of its predecessor. But don't let that put you off, they really caught lightning in a bottle with CoS in my opinion so it was pretty high standard to meet.			"

I think for the most part the puzzles in this one were a little more intuative, although sometimes I did find the puzzles a little more guessy.  Simialr to the first one, he is doing all his thing for Nuri, but again, like I felt in the first one, Hilda seemed like a better choice for a partner, Nuri is just plain annoying, whingy and dopey. I guess that's the story of life these days, there are better, safer options, but we always go for the troublesome flighty fairy because it makes our magic pop just that little bit better.8/10			"

												One of the best adventure games I've played since The Longest Journey. Wonderful story, great puzzles, beautiful art and music, and voice acting that didn't make me claw my ears out (I'm looking at you, Whispered World).Besides a few instances of obtuse puzzle logic, it has a good level of challenge. The option to highlight interactive objects at the press of a key removed pixel hunting problems entirely and kept the focus on problem solving.The story is really good and engaging. Cared about the characters a lot. It builds somewhat on a previous game (""Chains of Satinov,"" I think) which I hadn't played, but I don't feel like i lost much context because it re-lays the foundations pretty quickly. I felt like there was some depth to the relationships between some existing characters that i missed out on, but I picked up on it in time. "

But in the end, it was that, exactly, and the beautiful drawn environment that made the game worthwhile.Handy enough, the user Interface didn't change all too much to it's prequel and this was perfect for me. Besides, the UI disappeared, unless I needed it. Which supports immersion quite nicely.Tip: As mentioned already a few times, it really adds to immersion and understanding of Memoria, if you played first The Dark Eye.			"

After playing Chains of Satinav, I still enjoyed this one more, but I can understand if others would disagree. So, the bottomline is; if you don't feel like playing the first game just to get to this one: don't. If you are unsure and wouldn't mind, then go ahead and play both . they are both good games.			"

The best part is how every important character seems to have an important goal which allows us to identify with them.Visually appealing, Memoria has rather uninspired soundtrack and some of the voice acting (especially this of children in English version) is somewhat wooden - thankfully the main actors were rather nice. As most adventure point&click games, some of the puzzles are just absurd and require clicking on everything and combining every item with everything else just to find a ""right"" (what is not the same as ""logical"") path. If you like high fantasy and adventure games, you will like this one as well as it is definitely above average. If you don't - this one will not change your mind.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played and one of the most beautiful stories!I love that ""just a shady magical staff"". I would like to have one for my own. Really, if only that could be true... I love Sadja and her never-giving-up will and humour. She knows how to deal with over-bored magical staffs, lacking self-confidence due to the lack of memory, with over-excited too self-confident princes, and with too great powers of so great Ruler of Time, that it would be envied and betrayed by its servant.Geron is kind. But honest. If we can say here ""but"".Brida was interesting, but... boring as a common human being.Fahi... Riddle-passionated man with castle-passionated daughter, he was a riddle himself.My brain was strained to solve the riddles, however, not the riddles of the game, but those of the story! Deep story of Time and Destiny, Life and Death, Faithfulness and Betrayal, Truth and Lie, Love - and Dreams that come true.It was a good idea with torches moving the forest, and the only thing that irritated me was a couple of kids keeping washing themselves whenever I came to the location. But the only minus it is!To the glory of Sadja and her Staff!			"

												This is actually a sequel of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, something that I didn't know from the beginning. It's about two different stories that are related to each other. The first story is about Sadja, a princess that wants to fight in the war and become famous, with the help of a magical staff. The second story is about Geron, the ""unknown"" hero from The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav game, who is trying to find a way to transform his girlfriend, called Nuri, into a fairy again. Geron will have to learn about the heroic deeds of Sadja and finish her story, in order to achieve his goal and help Nuri before it's too late. In Daedalic we trust! Buy this game. It's a masterpiece.			"

												It isn't obvious from the title, but this is actually a sequel to the Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, so if you haven't played that, go play it. Otherwise, you might be confused about much of the story, which is never re-explained for new players. That being said, this is an EXCELLENT adventure game, even better than the original in my opinion. Good puzzles, GREAT characters, excellent voice acting, AMAZING story...yeah. Just awesome. It strays from the original in that there are actually two main plots: 1) the framing story, which takes place with Geron and Nuri after the events of the first game and 2) an entirely new story and characters set some 400 years before, during a time of epic war. In many ways, this backstory is actually WAY better than the framing story, although they do come together in the end to make it one cohesive game. They could just as easily have made this flashback its own game set in the same universe. It's that good. I had two glitches while playing, one near the beginning that required a complete restart. It happens if you do things out of the ""intended"" order. The other, one of the characters' words switched suddenly to some other language for a line or two. I didn't miss out on anything due to subtitles, but it was jarring.Overall, a sequel that's as good or better than the original. A fascinating adventure game. 10/10			"

The storyline and art are really good and interesting to follow, while the puzzles are interesting and original.

												It has a really interesting storyline, and the puzzles were challenging.  Could be a little difficult to figure out what to do next, at times, but clicking on the objective in the quest log gives you hints (which took me about halfway through the game to figure out). Definitely save (not overwriting) often, since several achievements are mutually exclusive. Overall, it's a fun game with a good story, and now that I know it's a sequel, I look forward to playing the first one!			"

												Memoria, the sequel of The Dark Eye : Chains of Satinav. You follow once again Geron in his new point'n'click adventure. But this time you'll play 2 stories separated by hundred of years which will end up connected. Geron will try to give back Nuri's human appearance promised by an old man if he finds the solution to a riddle.Princess Sadja will try to fight dark forces that has destroyed her civilization with the help of a magic staff so that she can be remembered.The game appears to have 2 different stories but will end up connected with eachother as you progress in the game and unravell the riddle. The end signs the most beautiful and interesting game of The Dark Eye serie and Daedalic point and click games from my point of view.The rest is about all the same, you'll need to get stuff, talk and combine them to progress in a ""logical"" way but unlike Deponia, it seems less goofy and easier to find the solution. The drawings are the same as the previous game so an amazing piece of work, trully. The animations are not excellent, just like the prequel the characters are strangely moving but it's acceptable. The replay value is close to none, only missed achievements can make you relaunch the game but all the enigmas will be pointless.All in all you'll end up satisfied by this game, if you're an old John Stobart fan you'll surely like it.

												I LOVED this game! The story was really interesting and I was sucked into it immediately. You have Geron, trying to find a way to turn his love Nuri back into a fairy (she was turned into a bird before the story begins). Geron is trying to solve a riddle involving the other major storyline of the game: Sadja's journey, a princess who longs to be a legendary warrior. The dialogue between Sadja and the magical staff she picks up is funny and oftentimes snarky in a way I love. There were a few really great twists in the plot, too. The art and music of the game was really beautiful, which altogether made playing the game a real delight. I was sad when it ended.If you like point-and-clicks, puzzles, and good stories, you'll like Memoria.			"

												Very interesting storyline, just like the majority of Daedalic Entertainment titles. There are 2 different storylines that intertwine. One is of Geron and his plan to change his love, Nuri back into a human from a crow. The other is an overarching story Sharisad, a princess wannabe who finds an air elemental and gets involved with of a God of Time, Satinav and his Djinn of Time, Menmoremnon.Edit: The air elemental is just the bird. Read the comments for who actually is the staff.PROS1. Mnemoremnon; the Djinn of TimeSuch a cool character.2. SharisadIt's interesting to know that there will be another expansion with Sharisad3. StorylineVery interesting. The way Daedalic melds the story of a magical Djinn of Time, God of Time, a princess and an air elemental, together with the story of Geron and Nuri.CONS1. Too DifficultI dislike getting stucked for too long.SUGGESTIONS1. Hint BarI would suggest a hint bar for players who can't solve the riddles. At least with a hint, you feel that you can solve the puzzle instead of getting a full answer from Gameboomers.			"

												First of all, no this game does not take 100+ hours to complete, I just left the game running by accident. X) Playing Chains of Satinav is critical if you would like to get the most out of this game. It tells of Geron and Nuri's treacherous journey that eventually led to the circumstances that start off Memoria. Honestly, I think I would not be giving Memoria such a strong review if I hadn't played the prequel. The game frequently references its predecessor (inside jokes), and Geron/ Nuri's entire half of the game seems out of place and confusing without proper context. Not to mention, most of Geron/Nuri's characterization is done in Chains of Satinav, and players can have a deeper understanding of their actions in Memoria if they know their personalities. Even so, and I do acknowledge that this is one of the biggest flaws of the game for me plotwise, is that while one enriches their experience through enlightening themselves with Geron/Nuri's past, Geron's role in the game is largely overshadowed by Sadja's intense story, and he seems more like a narrator or a bystander in this game as opposed to his central role in Chains of Satinav. Sadja's story on the other hand, is incredible. The story is far from conventional, a true masterpiece that is told in a very unique way. Most plot ends tie up nicely (I watched an interview and the writer said he did leave enough room for a sequel), and I enjoyed the witty remarks of not only Sadja but her staff as well. Another strong point of this game is the beautiful artwork. Games are rarely done in the painted style of Memoria, but the artwork really adds to the folklorish mood of the game. I have a bias towards aesthetically beautiful games, so both Chains of Satinav and Memoria get brownie points. The voice acting of Memoria is THOUSANDS of times better than Chains of Satinav. However, it still isn't perfectly polished, with lines playing too close after each other at some points, ruining the natural flow of conversation. The staff, Sadja, and Nuri are amazing, whereas Geron is still weak. Overall, I really enjoyed Memoria. Although I had to look at walkthroughs because some puzzles were bizarre, and there are some technical issues that bog down the game, Sadja's storyline in particular is captivating and thrilling. Kudos to Daedalic for creating such an amazing point and click adventure.			"

At several points in the story, I spent quite some time pondering on what I was supposed to do in order to progress, but then, that might be because I hadn't played any point&click game in quite a while.I enjoyed the game overall, though the new screens were slow to load, but then, that might just be because of my computer and not because of the game.

The Short:2D Graphics - A3D Graphics - CMusic / Sound - AStory - CPuzzles - BStability / Bugs - B (Some people have reported crashes, I only encountered minor performance hits in some scenes)Overall: BThe Long:A short but decent graphic adventure which reminded me a lot of the old adventure games from the 90s.  Overall, I'd recommend purchasing the game on sale if you enjoy adventure games (especially if you want some nostalgia from games of old).  It is not worth its full price.  I beat the game in roughly 9 hours (with pauses due to real life where the game was left running).  If you marathoned it without getting up and are good at puzzles, you could finish it much faster.The ending was probably the least interesting part of the adventure since your final choices are much more limited than I would have preferred.  Unlike some people, I did not encounter any crashes or stability issues.  The only problem was occassional lag in certain cutscenes and animations (which I am shocked about considering its a mostly 2D game and my computer is a monster).  Anyways, my overall verdict would be to purchase it on sale if you want to experience a more old-school style adventure game with pretty background visuals, just don't expect the story to blow your mind.

												This is a pretty good game, I haven't played the first one because I thought THIS was the first one so I was pretty confused at some parts but you really don't need to play the other one first to understand most of this game. If you love point and click adventures, especially challenging ones, this is right up your alley you WILL enjoy it.My one minor insignificant negative comment / rant is that the story kinda goes crazy towards the end, almost as if they had most of the story thought up then when they tried to make an ending they ran out of ideas and cobbled together a bunch of ridiculous nonsense like (SPOILER ALERT!) The staff turning into a weird creepy staff person? O_o And Bryda suddenly hating her life so much and deciding to basically commit suicide and destroy the world or something? I mean what the fudge was that? Where did that come from? And Sharisad's end? Beyond depressing! I know she comes back to life after ""turning herself into a ruby"" according to the staff anyway, in reality she probably died alone in that garden (hope that time guy isn't reading this *wink wink*) and I really think they focused too much on Sharisad and not enough on the main guy character (already forgot his name). Even the whole war thing didn't seem to be explained enough, I really had no idea what was going on with that or with the prince... still enjoyed the game but I feel like I need closure and they didn't provide it.

												Rating 9/10Overview: Point and Click Adventure GameThe Good:+ Memoria is the sequel to Dark Eye: The Chains of Satinav, so you need to play that game first to truly appreciate the story and characters in this game. The story in Memoria is fantastic and one of the more creative and interesting stories in an adventure game to date.+ Beautiful background scenery+ Puzzles are well thought out and integrated nicely with the story. I found the puzzles to be easier than the last game but they also seems more 'focused' this time around. + Hotspot indicator and the ability to scroll through your inventory with the mouse wheel + Great Soundtrack and voice acting+ Easy achievementsThe Bad:- You have the option to toggle 'item combination' which allows you to see when an item is able to interact with an object in the world. The problem is, this doesn't always work giving you the impression that none of your items can be used appropriately. My advice, play with this option turned off so you don't get confused when it stops working. ConclusionThis is a fantastic point and click adventure game in a great series. If you love the genre then this is a game definitely worth checking out. "

												One of the best fantasy stories I've experienced in video games. It's so awesome I wish it was a graphic novel, and the puzzles actually felt a bit distracting as I just wanted to know what happened to the characters. Not that the puzzles were bad though--not perfect, but pretty solid. I have nothing to complain about.9/10, -1 only because I'm not comfortable giving perfect ratings.			"

												Rating 9/10Overview: Point and Click Adventure GameThe Good:+ Memoria is the sequel to Dark Eye: The Chains of Satinav, so you need to play that game first to truly appreciate the story and characters in this game. The story in Memoria is fantastic and one of the more creative and interesting stories in an adventure game to date.+ Beautiful background scenery+ Puzzles are well thought out and integrated nicely with the story. I found the puzzles to be easier than the last game but they also seems more 'focused' this time around. + Hotspot indicator and the ability to scroll through your inventory with the mouse wheel + Great Soundtrack and voice acting+ Easy achievementsThe Bad:- You have the option to toggle 'item combination' which allows you to see when an item is able to interact with an object in the world. The problem is, this doesn't always work giving you the impression that none of your items can be used appropriately. My advice, play with this option turned off so you don't get confused when it stops working. ConclusionThis is a fantastic point and click adventure game in a great series. If you love the genre then this is a game definitely worth checking out. "

												Memoria is one of those third-person adventures I was thinking of playig long time ago, but the graphics put me off. It's not Syberia, you know?Well, I was wrong. The story was such a cute fantasy adventure I was into it within the first ten minutes. I wouldn't let go, although I did for work. The game had a great advneture and a nice story. The graphics were what made it special. There are different achievements across the game, making replaying it even better. The only negativity I could find is that the story has a few lame-spots, as I like to call them. It just doesn't make sense, but hell - it's a fantasy world, who knows how people should react if they were born and raised in it?			"

												This is a pretty good game, I haven't played the first one because I thought THIS was the first one so I was pretty confused at some parts but you really don't need to play the other one first to understand most of this game. If you love point and click adventures, especially challenging ones, this is right up your alley you WILL enjoy it.My one minor insignificant negative comment / rant is that the story kinda goes crazy towards the end, almost as if they had most of the story thought up then when they tried to make an ending they ran out of ideas and cobbled together a bunch of ridiculous nonsense like (SPOILER ALERT!) The staff turning into a weird creepy staff person? O_o And Bryda suddenly hating her life so much and deciding to basically commit suicide and destroy the world or something? I mean what the fudge was that? Where did that come from? And Sharisad's end? Beyond depressing! I know she comes back to life after ""turning herself into a ruby"" according to the staff anyway, in reality she probably died alone in that garden (hope that time guy isn't reading this *wink wink*) and I really think they focused too much on Sharisad and not enough on the main guy character (already forgot his name). Even the whole war thing didn't seem to be explained enough, I really had no idea what was going on with that or with the prince... still enjoyed the game but I feel like I need closure and they didn't provide it.

												The story in the game was extremely immersive and well designed, I devoured it whole during three very long gaming sessions where I simply could not just stop. Another shining star of this game was beautiful hand drawn graphics and interesting characters. That is the strong part of the game and I will definitely reccommend it to everyone.However it is also important to mention some of the drawbacks I encountered. Puzzles were okay, but I found them too obvious or plain ridiculous, only a few were somewhere in between that left me with a warm feeling of accomplishment. The game also glitched a lot on my few months old high-end PC. And for the last thing, I don't understand in general achievements in a point-and-click adventure game. Seriously, why ? Such games don't have a replay value ... or at least not right after I finished it. Okay, I can forgive that, but at least after finishing the game I would like to go and get those achievements. Unfortunately, no. I can only start all over or use only my own saves (which I dont have many since it is an adventure game). And yeah no jumping to chapters. Nevermind, the negatives of this game are more or less insignificant, so do yourself a favor and go dive into the Memoria story !			"

												This is a difficult one.My impresion is that this is a bipolar game. Either that or two teams/people have designed this game independently. At the begining and end of the game, puzzles do not really make sense, whereas there is a period in mid game that this does not happen. This lack of logic leads to an unvelivable amount of frustration. When the puzzles have some logic, the game is frankly quite enjoyable. The story line and the way it is presented and develops through the chapters is nice and inviting.At the end, the frustration overweights the positive aspects.I cannot recoment this game.			"

												What a wonderful story, art, music, script and story again for good measure. I couldn't stop once I started playing, so I was glued to the computer for over 12 hours right until I got to the ending(s). That's about the best endorsement you can give.I have played other Daedalic games on and off Steam, and even though they were great, none of them came even close to this. It's truly a masterpiece on every level. Note: I had NOT played Chains of Satinav before this, and I didn't feel lost but there are many references that you will miss, and if you plan on playing CoS in the future, you should keep in mind THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SPOILERS IN THIS SEQUEL. So I advise you to get your hands on the former first!...Sharisad. <3			"

												This game is a sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav... sort of.  It more uses the previous game as a backdrop to space out the telling of a different story in the same universe, while resolving some hanging threads from the last game.  More on that later.  Just like the last game, the artwork is gorgeous, music is pleasant but more theatrical than catchy.  Voice acting feels more robust this time around too.  Thankfully many of the puzzles are more interesting than the last game, with fewer obnoxious red herrings or arbitrary conditions for progression.  Its not to say that its a vast improvement as there are still numerous obtuse moments, and there is at least one absolutely stupid puzzle in the game (shadow wall / mirage memory recall) where the game suggests memorizing a pattern that as far as I, four other people, and a few guides I had to peruse, absolutely could not identify and may as well have not existed.  Some of the functionality for viewing possible interactions is polished a bit better, and for a few sections the game even offers to let you skip a portion where you have to navigate a fairly mundane maze.The story in this game is actually REALLY good compared to the original.  The story of the previous game with Geron and Nuri is a backdrop for a retelling of a story of a woman named Sadja from a time long before, and the premise of that story and the cosmology around it was very compelling to me.  The weight of Sadja's story and the twists and revelations were very enjoyable and compelling.  Additionally, there's a genuinely depressing feeling and heart wrenching response from me over Nuri's and Geron's plight in a few scenes.  With the strength of both scenarios in this game, its kind of disappointing when the actual impact of Geron's scenario ends up as more or less tertiary.  Its resolution leaves me wholly unsatisfied because of how much it takes backseat to the other, despite being the hook of why you should care about this other story with Sadja in the first place.  I wonder if the dev's just didn't think Sadja's story could have stood out well on its own, and maybe it might not have, but as it is the rest of the game more or less exists to give Sadja's story one more twist to it at the end before saying 'Oh, and that stuff from Chains of Satinav, lets resolve that in just a few seconds and move on to the credits.'  That being said, the twist in Sadja's story that wrapped everything up near the end was for me on par with the oft-touted 'Would you kindly' of Bioshock.Overall... I'd still reccomend it.  Like the previous game, it clocks in at about 10 hours.  Its beautiful, its got a good setting and premise, just expect that you'd have to look up a guide for a section or two.  You play these sorts of games for the story and the characters, and its got some good ones.			"

												Not Daedelics finest hour...  I grew up playing games like Space Quest, Monkey Island and other Lucasarts click adventures.   I've even played some of Daedelics games more recently, such as Night of the Rabbit, Deponia etc.  This game falls far short of those.  Firstly, it lacks the humour that the other games had.  Secondly, I felt the voice acting was pretty poor (especially how he says ""Says"" wrong).  Finally, the 'puzzles' were more frustrating than in any previous game, and for a good chunk of the game didn't make any sense.  What is worse however is that the story makes virtually NO sense if you haven't played the previous game(s).  There's constant references to things that I had no idea about.  I'd say don't waste your time with this unless you're really into adventure games.			"

I haven't seen such cheap ending since mass effect 3. *Spoiler: Also, zero reason for us, and main character to care about what happens to staff and wannabe princess when story concludes. It's so apart from what you do AND want from the beginning of the first game*			"

												Blah. Love the graphics. This game reminds me of why I stopped playing these  adventure games. Tedious and to  my way of thinking not very  intuitive. Just one example the start of the game. Your required to fix a stick house. Now this is the tutorial of all things. I had to go online to find out the solution of all things. Really? Turns out you find a glass turn it into shards and then  place the shards on the house of sticks and then you use magic to put it into a bottle? Yes thats the solution. Did it make a lick of sense to me?? Not really. It was just the solution. Also just another nit pick. Their is a cave with a ?? on it. When I touched it the game claimed it was probably Poison and sticky. Yet you need to use this exact thing to make glue with a dagger? Ugh. Who did the proofreading for this game? I feel like this is one of these games that you could get the exact same joy of watching someone else play the walkthru without needing to look thru a walkthru to figure out what to do. I suppose someone might get a thrill out of the guesse what the developer had in mind. Sometimes I am on the same wave length and it makes it fun. This is not of these games. Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes was one these type of games I really enjoyed. I could see what the developer was going for and it made sense. This game just seems to have solutions that I dont really get or understand or for that matter enjoy solving. Unlike Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes.  So my personal opinon I am going to watch the youtube walkthru for the game and enjoy it that way. I got this game in a very cheap bundle and I spent 5 hours on Edna & Harvey: Harvey's New Eyes and I only paid $5 dollars for 4 of these game so I got a great bargain even though this game I found tedious and not very well thought out. Time to try out the other 2 games. No I dont recommend this game. A tedious affair.			"

												I bought this as part of the Daedalic Adventure Bundle. Only then did I discover that this and other titles included in the bundle are sequels to other games that were not included. I'm sure others have been tricked into this (and then felt the need to buy the bigger bundle that includes the first games of the series) because there is no indication of the games being sequels in the titles (Memoria should be The Dead Eye 2: Memoria).

												Memoria is neither good nor bad. The art and voice acting are adequate. There is nothing that offends me but it has little redeeming qualities. The talking staff is quite fun, though. It's just so bland and unmemorable - pun intended.I would only recommend it if it's really cheap and if you're bored out of your mind.			"

												I tried to like this game but it suffers from a lack of audio hints,  weird solutions and poor design, in that, you can’t adequately see key objects in the game to tell what is supposed to be done. I don't mind if some of the solutions are a little weird (or a lot in some cases) but at least put some thought into the comments the characters make (even if it's in the form of a pun or something). It would be great if you could build into this game a counter for monitoring progression, that, if it senses the player is stuck, it could have the main character think out loud and say something like …""I wonder if that chain will reach the hole in the door... "" etc.   Especially when the puzzles are on the weird side (which a fair share seem to be).Also, have the ability to take a closer look (zoom in) at certain objects and provide visual clues to help with the puzzles.  (A simple hint button at the bottom would also serve to significantly increase the fun)It’s pretty enough to look at and the voice acting holds up.   The trailer made it look so good, but in a word... frustrating.And unfortunately for me, just not worth the effort.  Sadly I fear this is an vastly overrated steam game  :  (			"

												You find yourself exerting more effort breathingthan on most other days during the class onthe Human Brain. The studies of the differentregions, particularly the sections relating to thememory and the Amygdala- the section whichpertains to fear and negative thoughts- findsyour own focus on the subject difficult.You get a text from Summer-Rain, telling youto ditch class for a minute or two so she cangive you a quick kiss. You ask how she knewthe events with Mrs. Novocaine still weigh onyour mind from earlier in the day. Summer-Rainsimply texts back that it's obvious, that she'syour girlfriend, and that she loves you, endingwith an ':P' emoji.You think of how right she was, and how, in aneerie sense, that every single one of the wordsshe said was also the same words that Ms.Novocaine told you, once upon a time. Steamhappens to be open behind the layers of openonline-learning apps and windows, and youreyes catch something that takes you back toa time of Novocaine yet again.MEMORIA.You remember the game being an excellent story-driven, well-written point-and-click adventure game which closed out the story begun in Dark Eye:Chains of Satinav.Picking up from a new character, the strongand beautiful Princess Sadja, before returningto the story of Geron and his erstwhile loveNuri, Memoria picks up lingering threads fromthe previous tale, while weaving and telling asolid, captivating, and ultimately heartbreakingtale that has come to dominate the gamesfrom Daedelic.Although the same 'problems' remain, suchas the lack of replayability and an easy wayto 100% a game, Memoria has enough twists,red herrings and unexpected turns in its storythat one could almost be forgiven for thinkingit was a fantasy television series.The parallels between Geron's willingness todo everything to restore Nuri, when one of theendings involves 'letting go' strikes a chord inyou. You remember how willing you were toregain what you thought was love for Ms.Novocaine, and what you were willing to do,but ultimately, everything was exercised andlet out on the plains of New Vegas.Sadja's story is full of twists and turns, goingto dizzying emotional highs before the finalrevelation that brought you to your lowest, tothe point that Ms. Novocaine even asked what had made you so upset. Memoria wasshort, and expensive from its asking price,but the game made you despondent overeach character's possible fate.You find yourself snapped out of your dazewhen someone's hand lays itself on yourshoulder. You turn round, only to be greetedwith two lips planting themselves firmly onyour own. Summer-Rain has arrived, andyou feel your spirits soar ever so slightly.""You looked... lost."" She smiles to you,having sneaked into your class. You giveher a terse smile, as you feel a pang of regret from feeling a sense of longing forMs. Novocaine, based on your memories.""I was."" You start, whispering so thelecturer won't take notice of either of you.""I was thinking of... old memories.""Summer-Rain puts her hand on yours.""Starboy... it's okay. You believe me,don't you?"" You nod, this time sure ofboth yourself and the future with thegirl before you, your Summer-Rain.""I do.""MEMORIA. "

												The sequel to the Dark Eye: the Chains of Satinav, Memoria is a dual narrative set right after its predecessor. You play as Geron, the bird-catcher from the Chains of Satinav as well as Sadja, a mysterious woman from an earlier era and the player alternates between these two characters as the storyline progresses. The game features some of the familiar characters and places from the first instalment, which may make it useful to play Chains of Satinav to set the tone and give the player a sense of purpose about the sequel. The story is remarkably well-written in its progression and plotting. In this aspect, Memoria (and Chains of Satinav too, for that matter) make a huge improvement on Daedalic's other titles, such as Deponia, whose writing (and voice acting) are exhausting to endure to say the least.As far as the visual aspect goes, Memoria offers little above the average in video game market but overall, the game is visually pleasant. That being said, the game consists of a considerable amount of expansive scenery on the background and these images are actually worth looking at. In the voice acting department, Memoria maintains the quality of its predecessor. Characters are well-portrayed and thus compensate for the lack of visual representation of their behaviour, emotions in the cutscenes or in the game itselfAs I mentioned above, the story is partially the continuation of the plot in Chains of Satinav. However, connected to this plotline, there is now another protagonist named Sadja. She appears in a series of flashback sequences, where the player needs to thread her plotline for it to mesh and an make sense of Geron's part of the story. When considered (and played) with Chains of Satinav, Memoria offers an impressive couple of days in old-fashioned point and click adventure gaming. Decent artwork, great writing and voice-acting deserve a playthrough.			"

												I've played a few games by this company and I am never let down. This one was absolutely amazing. I found the puzzles not too difficult to understand. And the charecters were so interesting, I can't say I prefered one of the two main characters over the other. There was enough mystery to keep me interested and the backgrounds and soundtrack were wonderful! The ending made me tear up actually. This is one of my favourite games so far. I would recommend it.Okay and whoever voices the staff is one of my favourite voice actors that Daedalic uses. So expressive and filled with emotion!			"

												Okay so I beat the game. Took my 10 hours (because I got stuck a few times. I enjoyed it a lot! Time for a short review.What's the best thing about the game? Well it would have to be, obviously, the art. All the areas areas to explore are simply gorgeous to look at, and most of it is interactive (main character will at least comment on things you look at).What's the worst thing about the game? The puzzles are VERY contrived. So many times I got stuck simply because the answer to a puzzle is so difficult to figure out. I had to use a walkthrough after hitting brick walls, but I don't regret it as it allowed me to delve further into the interesting story and awesome visuals.Example of contrived puzzle : to find a gem, one has to pour wine into a mold, do a service for a mage hidden in a library (seriously, you only see his shadow), find out he can solidify things, then have him solidify the wine. I had no clue that I could use the wine for that. There's also a maze (I HATE MAZES) but THANKFULLY you can skip it after enough time has elapsed (after getting lost). And the end is, to not spoil anything, just strange.What's okay? The voice acting is well done, ESPECIALLY the talking staff. Music is... forgettable but it fits, controls work very well and the magic spells gives a nice twist to gameplay, though it is underused in my opinion. Is it worth it? Yeah! Absolutely. If you can forgive yourself for using a walkthrough and just enjoy the story. Seriously, the puzzles are just a headache otherwise. Some parts can be done without one though.However, I recommend playing the first game first, as it is a direct sequel and many things in this game will be unclear otherwise (why is the fairy turned into a raven?). I didn't play the first game, but I regret it. Chains of Satinav, get that one first. "

												This was such a charming game! I liked the fantasy setting, but most of all, I loved all the Arabic and Middle Eastern influences. Visually, this game is stunning! The art design and style of the game is beautiful and a pleasure to look at it. Other than a couple of puzzles, the game was pretty straightfoward and was not as frustrating as some other point and click games. I played this without realizing there was a first one, but I don't think it matters. Honestly, I might not play the first one because I was not that big of a fan of Geron and Nuri, but I loved Sadja's story. I really hope there is a sequal continuing Sadja's story because she was the best part about this game.Either way, I recommend this game just for Sadja and all the subtle Arabic influences.			"

Despite being a sequel, I was able to play Memoria without ever being lost, and what details I did need to know from the previous game were provided very succintly and seamlessly.The puzzles are challenging and creative, but rarely did I find myself doing the 'try to combine every possible item and hope one of them is the correct solution because the correct answer is of a leap of logic' routine.The visuals are both lush and fit well with the style of '90s point and click adventure' genre. I will also say that the voice acting is TOP NOTCH, especially the Staff, I often found myself clicking on him just to hear him speak.The only bugs I noticed were occasionally the audio files and the subtitles wouldn't match up, but this wasn't very common at all. I can definitely see myself playing this game again and again.			"

												The game is awesome. STORY is great, one of the best I've had in any point n' click adventure game and you'll love it. Art and voices make you feel like you're in another world (and you are!). Riddles have the difficulty just in the spot, where you need to think, but you won't (usually) pick you hair off. I recommend.			"

												Another amazing point and click adventure by Daedalic. Still, I didn’t love it as much as its predecessor, since it lacks that great “road trip” feel, and the pacing and puzzles aren’t as good. But the great graphics and plot make up for it. It’s still fantastic and a worthwhile successor to one of the most underrated adventures ever.			"

It provides a story with extreme depth and completely captivates the mind to the story. The game also offers many reasonably challengling environmental puzzles to solve so that you can progressively earn more of the story with each puzzle solved - It is very fun and well worth it!This game stands alone and distinct from other point and click adventure games simply for its depth and originality.10/10			"

												""As the stone rules over the scarab, so rules the scarab over the stone. Enter if to you the answer is known. If not, then forever your life I'll own.""Search for the answer to this deceptive riddle in this incredibly well written game by Daedalic Entertainment.  Memoria has one of the best narratives in a video game that I have played.  The forshadowing and intrigue and absolutely astounding.  I love it so much, I would reccomend playing this game even to people if they don't normaly like inventory puzzle games, as long as they love a good Narrative.  The only real question is if you play the still good, but less-amazing prequel, Chains of Satinav before you play this one.  It is definitely enjoyable without playing it, but it gives away the ending to Chains.  Either way, this is definitely the strongest game to come out of Daedalic Entertainment, and one of the best video game narrative in general.			"

												Finished Memora on 28th March 2015. This is a sequel to the Chains of Satinav.Memoria tells two concurrent tales placed within the mythology and history of the world of The Dark Eye. As Geron you want to find a way to lift the spell from you faerie Nuri which has turned into a raven at the end of the last adventure. As such you encounter a gypsie which could help you out… if you help him out solving a riddle. Time is running short since Nuri seems to forget her origins and becomes more and more “raven” by time.On the other side you play Sadja, a princess 450 years before. She is on the way to find a magic mask, of which is said it could decide the faith and outcoming of any battle.As both plots overlap from time to time, you switch between Geron and Sadja. As Geron is reluctant and shy, Sadja is cheeky and defiant. Geron’s world is colorful and bright whereas Sadja’s world is dark with a looming total destruction by hordes of daemons due to mage wars.The connection between both story lines is not obvious but develops from chapter to chapter. And soon you discover that Sadja is not the “princess” at all. At the end you face again, as in the Chains of Satinav, a bittersweet love story.The riddles are fair, sometimes a bit trial and error. The environment is beautiful drawn and one can see that the developers really had a caring hand when crafting the scenery along with the dialogues and audio and lots of details and charm. The interface is beyond any doubt.A nice adventure!8/10			"

												This game, I like it (smashes hand on computer desk) Another!A true sequel in my opinion should always strive to be better than it's predecessor, while at the same time keeping true to the essence of what made the original great.  Memoria does this, with it's improved performance, smoother animations, larger scope and vision of narrative, and willingness to try new things. As in my review of the prequel, ""Chains of Satinav"", I would almost say that I recommend playing this game simply if you are a fan of finely crafted Fantasy-  regardless of liking for point-and-clicks.  Geron the Bird Catcher's tale continues in this stunningly executed chapter in the Dark Eye universe, and it is here we are also introduced to the mysterious bits and pieces of a story set in the long forgotten past...  of a young woman seeking to overcome Time itself, and an ensorcelled staff willing to help her achieve this goal.  In summary:Pros:+ Fun and creative puzzle solving mechanics in place that require you to consider all aspects of an environment, and think outside the box+ Top notch voice acting-  perhaps even improved from before. Fitting to each of the characters, with a wide variety and personality for even background/minor individuals+ Fantastic digital painting style of art+ The soundtrack! Adventurous and moving in it's execution, which sets a different tone for the setting of the narrative vs. the prequel. Play both to see what I mean+ Conclusion felt completely satisfying, yet still left me ready for more, should Daedalic offer it+ Sadja as a secondary protagonist felt well developed as a character...  and her companion the Staff was just great to listen to. The relationship they develop is a fascinating one, and the more I discovered about his origins, the more I felt myself caring about the fate of both him and his Princess+ Limited dialogue choices included to immerse the player in the scenarioNeutrals/Cons:- Lip synching was still kind of off in places, and left something to be desired- A ""certain character's"" actions at a ""certain point"" seemed somewhat out of the blue, but may have been allowed to take place in order to highlight the corrupting influence of selfish want and desire- A guide or at least a few hints may be required at some point to proceed. Just as solving a tricky puzzle can make you feel good about yourself, clicking that hint button one or a dozen times, only to see something so obvious that you missed out of impatience/lack of observation can make you feel really dumb hahaOverall:9 out of 10Memoria is a wonderful, quality adventure game with a storyline that kept me enthralled throughout.  I enjoyed playing as Sadja, and though the dynamic set in motion between the first game's protags was indeed touching, I kind of wished we had gotten to directly engage a bit more with her painful history in the same capacity as Geron's, with perhaps just a bit more epilogue. That's really just nit-picking though. Seriously, check out both this AND Chains of Satinav-  a pair of gems just waiting to be picked up.			"

												Good game. Fair gameplay, good puzzles, great story.The program did get slightly laggy towards the end, but by then the story had involved you enough that it didn't really matter. A couple of glitched comments were found as well, but nothing that disturbed the story.The puzzles were straighforward, as in all the information needed to solve them was available within a limited number of scenes, so just walking around, poking into things and paying attention to what is said gives enough information to solve them.The story - that's where the twists and turns are. Job well done. :)			"

												This was such a charming game! I liked the fantasy setting, but most of all, I loved all the Arabic and Middle Eastern influences. Visually, this game is stunning! The art design and style of the game is beautiful and a pleasure to look at it. Other than a couple of puzzles, the game was pretty straightfoward and was not as frustrating as some other point and click games. I played this without realizing there was a first one, but I don't think it matters. Honestly, I might not play the first one because I was not that big of a fan of Geron and Nuri, but I loved Sadja's story. I really hope there is a sequal continuing Sadja's story because she was the best part about this game.Either way, I recommend this game just for Sadja and all the subtle Arabic influences.			"

												I've personally always had a thing for the ""Dark Eyes"" Universe,  as such I am bias towards any game played in it.This game directly follows ""The Chains of Satinav"" and it's story continues on from there. At around 10 hours in length it's respectable for an P&C adventure. The Story is good, if a little predictable.Graphics are good,Sound is good.Game play is decent.If your a Fan of the Setting, or of P&C in general this is a good addition to any collection. At $20 I feel it's a little much, I tend to want around $1 per/hour for adventure games, however if you can find it on sale, you won't be disappointed. "

												I loved the game, a bit less than the first one (The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav) though.If you like classic point and click adventures, with excelent voice acting and artistic develop this game is a MUST have. The technical problems I had with the first game of the series were gone here... And I'm hoping they will release a new chapter on the series continuing the story about Geron and Nuri. That's the main reason I liked the first chapter more. The story about that couple was the main reason I was waiting to play this title... A bit disappointed about it, because here the main story is about Sadja and her quest and the relationship between Geron and Nuri stays as a secondary story. For all those you don't know, both games are based on the German Role-Playing Game created by Ulrich Kiesow in 1984, very famous in Germany but not so much in the rest of Europe.			"

												Absolutely astounding. My opinion of this developer was already high after Night of the Rabbit, which was itself a masterpiece (and you should absolutely go play if you like this title) and this title has raised my opinion only higher. My only complaint would be some minor strange logic with the puzzles.  Aditionaly, at first there was some mild estrangement with the first protagonist, having picked up this title not realising it was a second story in a series, and I Initially found the a plot oddly disjointed from the second (which I found to be the greatly superior of the two), but my doubts were quickly put to rest by the stunning visuals and an intriguing and deepening mystery. The excellence of the writing however is not fully appreciable until the two separate tales finally collide together in a finale that was not only carefully seeded from the beginning but maintains a familiar grimms fairytale/1001 nights motif while still managing to be unique and surprising. If you absolutely despise p&c adventures then it is possible this wont be for you, but to absolutely everyone else I can not recommend this more highly. This is a masterful fairytale I will remember fondly for the years to come.			"

												I recommend this game to people who really need to know what will happen after its predecessor. It's no MUST for everyone else.The art, voice-acting, and music are really beautiful as expected. The puzzles are good but tend to become confusing and complicated towards the end. The story's barely about Geron and Nuri; it feels as if we spend at least 70% of the game following a newly introduced and, unfortunately, rather annoying flashback character on her quest to a war we'll never see.Luckily, the ending bears a clever twist, ties up the storylines and has potential for a second sequel but may leave a bitter-sweet aftertaste, especially for our bird-catcher.Memoria is a very pretty game with a nice story but it's not as great as ""Chains of Satinav"".

Amazing story! Very clever, with an unsuspected, jaw-dropping ending. It never gets boring during the game, and gets addictive in the end. Easily one of the best stories I ever encountered! You must buy it for the story!Riddles were quite good. Better than some other good adventure games, but easier than in the ""The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav"".			"

												Very unique, engaging story with some cool ideas. Excellent presentation and atmosphere supported by great soundtrack and voice acting. Puzzles are mostly on the easy side, with one or two more involved ones. The length is about right for the story it needs to tell.I recommend it mostly for the story and atmosphere.			"

												This game captured my eye becauce of the same things as it´s succesor, it´s genre and for it´s beautiful graphics! ( I also just had to play it since "" Chains of Satinav"" was one of the best games I´ve ever played within this genre. I think that the two are good in different ways but I warmly reccomend both of them. Play Chains of satinav first, since this one follows up right where the first one ends up.I really liked that you can play as two characters in this game! And the puzzles are really great too. The story I will not say a word about, becauce it must be ""lived"" ;)			"

												Storyline was excellent as per usual from Daedalic, and I enjoyed the voice acting. Animations were pretty choppy, but not terribly so. I liked the game, but I found some of the puzzles to be rather unintuitive - I'd occasionally get confused about what to do next, spend half an hour meandering about aimlessly, then give up and check a walkthrough - only to find that the solution bears little to no logical connection to the situation given. (Also, I wish the characters would MOVE FASTER. Jesus.) Overall decent game though, and I'd recommend it purely because I loved the story!			"

												An absolutely fantastic adventure game with good puzzle design, pacing, and flow. The story was exceptional - particularly the ending - easily the favorite story I've ever played. The voice acting is fantastic - much better than Chains of Satinav. Aside from a frustrating item selection user interface and a few segments hinging on memorization and maze work, this is an extremely good game. Playing through Chains of Satinav first is recommended for the story to have the proper emotional impact, but not required. Definitely my favorite new adventure game since Resonance.			"

												Absolutely astounding. My opinion of this developer was already high after Night of the Rabbit, which was itself a masterpiece (and you should absolutely go play if you like this title) and this title has raised my opinion only higher. My only complaint would be some minor strange logic with the puzzles.  Aditionaly, at first there was some mild estrangement with the first protagonist, having picked up this title not realising it was a second story in a series, and I Initially found the a plot oddly disjointed from the second (which I found to be the greatly superior of the two), but my doubts were quickly put to rest by the stunning visuals and an intriguing and deepening mystery. The excellence of the writing however is not fully appreciable until the two separate tales finally collide together in a finale that was not only carefully seeded from the beginning but maintains a familiar grimms fairytale/1001 nights motif while still managing to be unique and surprising. If you absolutely despise p&c adventures then it is possible this wont be for you, but to absolutely everyone else I can not recommend this more highly. This is a masterful fairytale I will remember fondly for the years to come.			"

												I've personally always had a thing for the ""Dark Eyes"" Universe,  as such I am bias towards any game played in it.This game directly follows ""The Chains of Satinav"" and it's story continues on from there. At around 10 hours in length it's respectable for an P&C adventure. The Story is good, if a little predictable.Graphics are good,Sound is good.Game play is decent.If your a Fan of the Setting, or of P&C in general this is a good addition to any collection. At $20 I feel it's a little much, I tend to want around $1 per/hour for adventure games, however if you can find it on sale, you won't be disappointed. "

												I recommend this game to people who really need to know what will happen after its predecessor. It's no MUST for everyone else.The art, voice-acting, and music are really beautiful as expected. The puzzles are good but tend to become confusing and complicated towards the end. The story's barely about Geron and Nuri; it feels as if we spend at least 70% of the game following a newly introduced and, unfortunately, rather annoying flashback character on her quest to a war we'll never see.Luckily, the ending bears a clever twist, ties up the storylines and has potential for a second sequel but may leave a bitter-sweet aftertaste, especially for our bird-catcher.Memoria is a very pretty game with a nice story but it's not as great as ""Chains of Satinav"".

												Another really lovely adventure game from Daedalic. This is the sequel to Chains of Satinav and I recommend playing that one first - it will give you background on Geron and Nuri's story (and it's a really good story). The music, voice acting, and art are all wonderfully done and the only thing I noticed were a few typos here and there but nothing too bad, and certainly nothing that affected gameplay.Some of the puzzles were frustrating to figure out but a good walkthrough can get you past those if you don't like guesswork. Generally, though, the puzzles were good - challenging but not annoying.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game if you enjoy point & click adventures. Sadja & the staff's story is one of my favorites now :)			"

												Writing this review after finishing the game. The game is generally quite good, but has a couple of weaknesses. These are personal opinions, of course.Art:    8/10. Quite nice and atmospheric.Puzzles:    8.5/10. In general, I found the puzzles quite engrossing, even if sometimes contrived. Good puzzles are a strength of this game.Voice acting:    7.5/10 Nice voice acting, but some male characters sound similar sometimes, and this can be a bit confusingPerformance:    6/10. A game this simple shouldn't be stuttering or maxing out my graphics card memory. Encountered the same annoyance with Daedelic's Deponia game too.Story:    7/10. Unfortunately, the story is both a strength and a weakness of this game. The script/ dialogues aren't always crystal clear. The plot promises a lot initially, but felt somewhat convoluted towards the end. The explanations offered didn't quite leave me convinced.Overall:    8/10. Good puzzles and art. A plot that promises much, but falls a little short in delivering.			"

												This game is amazing. The story is great, and the puzzles are just perfect - they're logical, and not too abstract or obtuse they're frustrating, but not so easy they're boring. The only negative thing I can say is that you really should play the prevvious game, Chain of Satinav (which I didn't much care for), first. Without that background, you won't know and have no reason to care about a certain character.			"

												I was blown away by how rich the story and characters were. I cried during the ending cutscene. The female lead was incredible and badass and I loved her voice actress. I fully recommend the game, and among point-and-click adventures, it's one of the meatier and more rewarding storylines I've run across.If story and characters are mainly what you care about,play it with a guide open in another window, if you're into having those around. It's a bit tricky to know what to do sometimes, but then that's the genre. The artwork is all digital painting and sometimes it's a little stiff, but does as good a job at telling a story as any videogame ever did.			"

												First of all i havent played it that long and i havent finished the game yet, but that doesnt mean i cannot give my opinion on this.This story is done really well, it doesnt throw too much at you right away and you uncover more and more the further you progress within the puzzles of this game. It gives me a sense of adventure wich dont generally feel in a type of game like this, yet the best thing of this entire game is the characters. The way they talk to eachother the way they act and do things and how they respond to what you do is both funny and serious. Hearing the sarcastic voice of the main character telling you ""no thats not going to help."" when you press 20 times on the wrong thing is epic. I really love how they did this and i will be playing this to completion.If annyone is interested to see me play this to form an opinion of the gameplay through my experiences feel free to look me up on youtube: spelliusthemadhatter.I hope this will give you a good understanding of the game and maybe you will be playing it too.

												This is a Dark Eye puzzle game that I can with confidence recommend to other people! I tried this game because I like Blackguards and its settings. Clearly this game doesn't dissapoint even without playing the first installment beforehand (The Dark Eye: Chain of Satinav). And now after playing the first game, I can say that it doesn't matter if play that first (or not at all) because the stories are hardly connected.THE GOODNow what I like about this game. It has an amazing drawing, decent voice acting, smooth gameplay, interesting puzzle and immersive sound effect and BGM. The story is overall better with more interesting concept. Most of the characters (even the side ones) now have meaningful existence in the story and have reasons in what they do. The animation and cutscene has also dramatically improved from The Dark Eye: Chain of Satinav. It has also useful hints and summary of event and characters, which also are presented meaningfully and beautifully.THE BADThe game still suffers from minor translation problem. But most troubling one is the characters development. I feel the relationship between Sadja and the staff progresses too abruptly within the middle chapter, when Sadja tries to rescue the staff from the researchers.THE VERDICTPick this game. Forget the first one.  "

												Finished Memora on 28th March 2015. This is a sequel to the Chains of Satinav.Memoria tells two concurrent tales placed within the mythology and history of the world of The Dark Eye. As Geron you want to find a way to lift the spell from you faerie Nuri which has turned into a raven at the end of the last adventure. As such you encounter a gypsie which could help you out… if you help him out solving a riddle. Time is running short since Nuri seems to forget her origins and becomes more and more “raven” by time.On the other side you play Sadja, a princess 450 years before. She is on the way to find a magic mask, of which is said it could decide the faith and outcoming of any battle.As both plots overlap from time to time, you switch between Geron and Sadja. As Geron is reluctant and shy, Sadja is cheeky and defiant. Geron’s world is colorful and bright whereas Sadja’s world is dark with a looming total destruction by hordes of daemons due to mage wars.The connection between both story lines is not obvious but develops from chapter to chapter. And soon you discover that Sadja is not the “princess” at all. At the end you face again, as in the Chains of Satinav, a bittersweet love story.The riddles are fair, sometimes a bit trial and error. The environment is beautiful drawn and one can see that the developers really had a caring hand when crafting the scenery along with the dialogues and audio and lots of details and charm. The interface is beyond any doubt.A nice adventure!8/10			"

Memoria tells the distant stories of two characters living centuries apart – one on a glorious quest to ennoble her name in history, the other on a more personal pursuit to restore a friend's lost humanity. An ancient artifact with mysterious powers links the two adventurers, past and present.Sadja and Geron provide two wildly different but equally remarkable leads. Their increasingly wonderful and captivating tale, set in a most intriguing yet believable magical world, ultimately comes together in a highly satisfying conclusion. Their distinctive journeys are never boring and in fact cost me several hours of lost sleep once I got hooked.The game perfectly stays true to the classic point-and-click adventure formula, with a quickly accessible inventory and very clean interface. The context of the player's actions is always clear, with perhaps the most creative addition being the small array of simple spells to solve the more distinctive puzzles.The excellent art direction showcases compelling and evocative hand-drawn environments throughout. Engaging voice acting solidifies intriguing characters and excellent writing, with concise and enjoyable dialogues.The game does a good job of making the story easily accessible to newcomers of the series, although it insists on making references to the preceding episode, especially early on, which initially made me question whether I missed an important part of the tale.

												This is a Dark Eye puzzle game that I can with confidence recommend to other people! I tried this game because I like Blackguards and its settings. Clearly this game doesn't dissapoint even without playing the first installment beforehand (The Dark Eye: Chain of Satinav). And now after playing the first game, I can say that it doesn't matter if play that first (or not at all) because the stories are hardly connected.THE GOODNow what I like about this game. It has an amazing drawing, decent voice acting, smooth gameplay, interesting puzzle and immersive sound effect and BGM. The story is overall better with more interesting concept. Most of the characters (even the side ones) now have meaningful existence in the story and have reasons in what they do. The animation and cutscene has also dramatically improved from The Dark Eye: Chain of Satinav. It has also useful hints and summary of event and characters, which also are presented meaningfully and beautifully.THE BADThe game still suffers from minor translation problem. But most troubling one is the characters development. I feel the relationship between Sadja and the staff progresses too abruptly within the middle chapter, when Sadja tries to rescue the staff from the researchers.THE VERDICTPick this game. Forget the first one.  "

												I played the original game, Chains of Satinav, and LOVED it, and this game is definitely just as good. I would recommend playing Chains first to set up the story of Geron and Nuri. You might feel kind of lost without it, but it's not totally required. Actually, while I like Geron and Nuri, the real star of this game is Sadja al-Kebîr, the ancient princess of Fasar who dreams of immortalizing her name throughout history by heroically destroying a demon army. As her story happens 450 years before Geron's time, and he has no idea who she is, we know that it doesn't go as she planned, but we have to find out as the story develops. Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but I just love the characters from this fairy tale world. If there was a book of this series, I would read it over and over. When I finally got to the ending, I cried so hard that I was literally trembling.			"

												Writing this review after finishing the game. The game is generally quite good, but has a couple of weaknesses. These are personal opinions, of course.Art:    8/10. Quite nice and atmospheric.Puzzles:    8.5/10. In general, I found the puzzles quite engrossing, even if sometimes contrived. Good puzzles are a strength of this game.Voice acting:    7.5/10 Nice voice acting, but some male characters sound similar sometimes, and this can be a bit confusingPerformance:    6/10. A game this simple shouldn't be stuttering or maxing out my graphics card memory. Encountered the same annoyance with Daedelic's Deponia game too.Story:    7/10. Unfortunately, the story is both a strength and a weakness of this game. The script/ dialogues aren't always crystal clear. The plot promises a lot initially, but felt somewhat convoluted towards the end. The explanations offered didn't quite leave me convinced.Overall:    8/10. Good puzzles and art. A plot that promises much, but falls a little short in delivering.			"

												The artwork, story, music, etc are decent.  It's a good sequel to the Chains Of Satinav.My only major complaint was the tower puzzle at the end, it was pretty annoying to deal with.Other than that it is a solid adventure game, with a minor amount of obtuse puzzles.Only minor complain was the reused/changed voice actors.  I don't mind them reusing voice actors for different characters, but they didn't do much to alter their voices such that they were not recognizable.			"

												I have played many point and click games, from the original Kings Quest series, Siberia, and on to Nancy Drew. I can honestly say this is one of the best. The music is beautiful, totally pulls you into the scene. The art work is great not too much 3D, and not too much cartoon.  The gameplay itself is very easy and the puzzles are just the right amount of challenge and make sense. I don't want to be lookin up answers because a way to solve the puzzle no normal person would have ever known. The voice acting I think is really good except for the main guy Geron.  I really don't think he knows how to convey emotion very well. Other than that, this is such a great game. It's one of those stories you think about for days after,wishing you had the next part. One hint for y'all, save often, in order to get all the achievements you might need to restart a section after you made a certain choice.			"

												Having played most of Daedalic's point-and-click adventure catalogue, I can say that this one is easily my favourite, and quite possibly their best. A direct sequel to The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, a previous adventure game by the same developers set in a high fantasy world of faeries and magic, Memoria outshines its predecessor in every possible way. Perhaps the best addition are the new characters told as part of an ancient mystery and riddle the contemporary characters are trying to solve: the adventures of Sadja and her magical staff. The puzzles are excellent, the voice acting great. The world-building is phenomenal and imaginative, the ending is emotionally resonant on multiple fronts. For fans of the adventure genre, this is up there with the best I've played (a list which includes The Longest Journey series, The Dream Machine, Superbrothers, and the Blackwell series). But without spoiling anything, I'd say the major strength writing and the storyline, with some great twists on the Satinav mythology and the central mystery surrounding a cryptic riddle. You'll have to play to find out more. I highly recommend playing the first game, Chains of Satinav, first. It's a good point-and-click game with the same quality of writing, and will help set the groundwork for this great story. I can only hope they plan on making a third game in this series.			"

												If you like solving puzzles and mysteries, and you enjoy games for their story, this is a must buy!!!Fantastic story (I didnt play the first one, but I will now!).

By the end of the game, I felt really attached to Sadja and the other characters, and was quite moved by the ending (I wont spoil whether it is happy or sad).I really enjoyed the voice acting, especially of the talking staff. I mean, its literally just a staff, no face, and becasue of the his voice actor, he is easily one of my fave characters.Had to use a walkthrough at times, but I didnt mind because I really just loved listening to the story too. If you are the kind of person who always skips dialogue and stories, this game is not for you, because you won't get the full experience if you skip the story!UPDATE/EDIT: Just finished playing the first one, The Dark Eye: Chains Of Satinav, and while that one was good, this one is a ton better.

												I was blown away by how rich the story and characters were. I cried during the ending cutscene. The female lead was incredible and badass and I loved her voice actress. I fully recommend the game, and among point-and-click adventures, it's one of the meatier and more rewarding storylines I've run across.If story and characters are mainly what you care about,play it with a guide open in another window, if you're into having those around. It's a bit tricky to know what to do sometimes, but then that's the genre. The artwork is all digital painting and sometimes it's a little stiff, but does as good a job at telling a story as any videogame ever did.			"

Memoria tells the distant stories of two characters living centuries apart – one on a glorious quest to ennoble her name in history, the other on a more personal pursuit to restore a friend's lost humanity. An ancient artifact with mysterious powers links the two adventurers, past and present.Sadja and Geron provide two wildly different but equally remarkable leads. Their increasingly wonderful and captivating tale, set in a most intriguing yet believable magical world, ultimately comes together in a highly satisfying conclusion. Their distinctive journeys are never boring and in fact cost me several hours of lost sleep once I got hooked.The game perfectly stays true to the classic point-and-click adventure formula, with a quickly accessible inventory and very clean interface. The context of the player's actions is always clear, with perhaps the most creative addition being the small array of simple spells to solve the more distinctive puzzles.The excellent art direction showcases compelling and evocative hand-drawn environments throughout. Engaging voice acting solidifies intriguing characters and excellent writing, with concise and enjoyable dialogues.The game does a good job of making the story easily accessible to newcomers of the series, although it insists on making references to the preceding episode, especially early on, which initially made me question whether I missed an important part of the tale. In the end, however, the game was so good it only made me want to play its prequel more.The vast majority of puzzles use comfortable logic and are rather pleasantly straightforward, with a few exceptions where the designers seem to have lost their focus. Two particularly obtuse and disheartening segments come to mind; one early on when we first unlock the Send Vision spell and need to make seemingly random connections, and another towards the end where a confusing sequence of elevator rides and gem swapping forced me to look up the solution online.

												Another really lovely adventure game from Daedalic. This is the sequel to Chains of Satinav and I recommend playing that one first - it will give you background on Geron and Nuri's story (and it's a really good story). The music, voice acting, and art are all wonderfully done and the only thing I noticed were a few typos here and there but nothing too bad, and certainly nothing that affected gameplay.Some of the puzzles were frustrating to figure out but a good walkthrough can get you past those if you don't like guesswork. Generally, though, the puzzles were good - challenging but not annoying.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game if you enjoy point & click adventures. Sadja & the staff's story is one of my favorites now :)			"

												A great sequel to Chains of Satinav. Despite an iffy start, the story really picks up and goes in interesting directions. Changing the focus from themes of destiny and fate to historical recount and legends was an inspired idea. It makes great use of the fantasy lore at hand, gives a satisfying ending to Geron and Nuri's story, and has some pretty clever puzzles. It also runs a bit smoother and has better characteer animations.Just be warned there's a glitch wwhere the game will crash after the first cutscene before the proper introduction to chapter one, but it's not a game breaker. If it happens to you, just quickly get through the prologue again and press the escapee key to skip the cutscene to the chapter one transition cutscene, and it will run fine from there. Minor annoyance that never pops up again.			"

												Loved the game.  The story was awsome and well written.  I must say I guest the ending or rather some of the key points of it right off the get go but even still it was, if it were a boork, a real page turner.Some of the puzzles didn't make sence i must say but I did like that most of them challaged you to think out side the box.  Like ""i'm stuck in side crypt with some alchohal and a rag.  Ok I got this.""  Wow, and some how I was able to figure out how to get out.  That was a real mind bender.Some of the puzzles were a little blaw.  Like ""I can't just pick up the sheild I got to use the staff to prire it off the warrior.""  That was a bit rediculous.  But all in all I got to give this one 4 1/2 out of 5.  :)  I'm looking forward to getting the other games that came before this one.Great work Daedalic.			"

												Like its predecessor (The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav), Memoria has good puzzles and stunningly beautiful graphics. I'd say both are improved from the previous game, with the animations being less clunky and with the addition of new spells that provide more options with the puzzles. Geron hasn't become any more likeable, though, and I can't say the new protagonist is any more sympathetic. Once again, the world-building was nice but a little sparse for someone not familiar with Das Schwarze Auge and its settings. At least I didn't have to play it through all the way twice to get all of the achievements. 6.5/10			"

												TDE Memoria is a great point-and-click game from daedalic.It has a great story, with a nice way of telling it [a story within a story]. Something nice about this game is that it works pretty well as a standalone (i.e. you don't need to have played the original). Plus, unlike some other daedalic games, I didn't spot any glaringly obvious spelling/translation errors.The game mechanics are good too, with a mix of puzzles and magic spells that can interact with the environment, with the odd find-and-collect the items thrown in for good measure.The art in this game is very nice, from the painted backgrounds to the character models.gDefinitely a Great game.

												This was a fantastic, story-rich, beautiful game. I highly recommend it. It has tricky puzzles that can be solved with interacting with all objects and carefully listening to what is said by the characters. It's really fun to get lost into this game. After every chapter, make sure to SAve the game as a copy on the main menu so you can go back to a certain section instead of replaying the whole game again to finish up some achievements. There are tons of PROS when you get into it, but I have only 1 CON to this: The only problem I had was that the game glitched from being so high-detailed. Do not make it ""windowed"". Keep it full-screen, but change how high the graphics are. The game should run more smoothly, if you had troubles before like I did.			"

												A very satisfying game/story!The atmosphere feels very much like a cross between Simon the sorceror and Loom.I actually found this game is actually better than the first game and the voice acting is much much better. Sadja actually feels like the main character rather than geron.  In the first game the story is a straight forward romance plot but it does gives you alot of backstory to the world and Satinav himself. One oddity is why did fahi and the staff wait until geron solved the riddle, their riddle didn't actually have a time limit but turning nuri back did as she lost more and more memories than if they had just turned her back at the beginning :S Geron would have been very angry with them once he makes that realization  "

												Kept me intrested enough but ""Chains of Satinav"" was a much better game with lots of good characters,dialogues and a better plot in general.I play these games for the story part only and prefer when puzzles are obvious.And this game has some of the worst puzzles i've seen especially the one where you have to walk around 3 towers activating and deactivating crystals,moving them up and down and all that while haveing absolutely no clue what im doing.Voice acting is still terrible (at least the english version).Especially the children,they are beyond bad.Hoping for another sequel where they can finally make better graphics and hire some prefessional voice actors.

To be honest the game is quite glitchy and freezes often on my computer even though my computer is a better than the minimum system requirements.However the gorgeous and detailed hand-drawn graphic combined with fascinating story and insanely hard puzzles has made me overlook all the annoying glitch and continue playing to the very end. In overall, to me it's a very good game and I'm happy that I decided to buy it. The story between the Sadja and the Staff is really touching and will remain in my heart forever. I hope you Daedalic will make sequel game about Sadja (and the Staff), because if you do, I WILL DEFINITELY AND IMMEDIATELY BUY IT! "

												So i copied this review from my review of Satinav, since the same things apply here, and removed/editted anything that doesn't:This game should be bought immediately by all who enjoy a good fantasy adventure. It reminded me a lot of all-time-classics like ""legend of kyrandia"" , ""simon the sorcerer"" or ""monkey island"", even ""gobliiins"" at times, borrowing some mechanics and/or aspects of such games. I thought it was marvellous, and so was its prequel, ""satinav"".Pros:Amazing storylineGood puzzles, not impossible, not simpleSurreal locations at times, with surreal beingsFeels as if you're reading (and participating in) a fairytaleKeeps you hooked with its graphics (which i thought were designed to resemble old classics)Keeps you hooked with its storyline (I said it twice, i loved the story)Completely voice-acted. Everything has dialogue, everything makes a sound.Really immersive.Pressing the space-bar reveals all interactive spots mechanic.The game is longer than i thought it would be.Neither pro nor con:Music- there's nothing really bad nor good about it. It's just ok. It suits the ""fairytale"" theme, but there's no real ""hook"" there. I've forgotten it already.Cons:There still are some bugs, although they are not game-breaking, they do sometimes ruin immersion. I just never minded them tbh.The animation is sometimes laggy.In my OS it lagged every time i got to a new location. I suspect that was because of auto-saving which you cannot turn off.To sum up, i would suggest you buy both games and play them together. It doesn't matter which one you play first, but i personally enjoyed playing them in the correct timeline (Satinav first).			"

												Characters, plot, art, music, puzzles - you name it, Memoria does it, and does it well. A truly outstanding modern point-and-click adventure. Fortunately, you won't be missing much in terms of story if you forgo the previous game, The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which is a somewhat lesser experience.			"

												This game has a really beautiful art work and the story is oveall interesting. It's fun that you follow through the game two characters so the game develops in different paths. Although the voice acting are very poor in this game. Almost annoying to my taste. Some achievements are humoristics and they are missible, giving the game a fun challenge.			"

												A classic point-and-click adventure game that is entertaining with a captivating story.  I have developed a soft spot for this game developer after playing a few of their other games but this game is very enjoyable and fun to play in a casual pace and setting.  The characters are funny and likable and the dialogues are pretty enjoyable.  It is a bit confusing to follow the storyline in the beginning just because the story hops around between two main protagonists from different time periods but you will soon catch up.  The puzzles and missions are relatively straightforward, but one might fine a few not too intuitive, such as casting vision spell in the correct order so that you can give a ""push"" to have someone do something, which might be frustrating at times, but all in all, very fun.  I also like the fact that this game is not abhorrently long - in fact, it is on the shorter side when it comes to game-length, even though I was a bit sad to see the game ending.I would recommend this game, but probably not at its full price.  Would highly recommend that you grab this jewel when it goes on sale :)			"
