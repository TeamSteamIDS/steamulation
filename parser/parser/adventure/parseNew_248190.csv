												I've been a big fan of platformers since my family got a NES in the late 80s. I've played a sizeable number of them since, but the ones that made the biggest impression on me were the ones where it's not all about the platforming, but really exploring the game and trying to figure out every single secret hidden in it. And secrets have become such a de facto standard of the mainstream 2D platformers to the point where the secrets and locations of them have become rather formulaic. The wonder of finding them has all but disappeared.That's one of the reasons I love Knytt Underground so much. The fact that the world is so huge makes just getting around it a great endeavour in itself, but there's also so much stuff hidden under the surface if you care to dig into it. And it's mostly not about finding an equivalent to a star coin or a 1-Up, but rather about getting intimate with a game world that's so carefully and lovingly crafted. It's about talking to an NPC that isn't a step towards beating the game, but piecing together another part of the lore of the people of the underground. And it's about exploring amazing locations just for the sake of exploration; not because there's a carrot dangling at the end of your journey.In short, this is probably my game of the year.			"

												I can't believe how much fun I've had playing this title. There so much to explore, and so many secrets to find, it's unbelievable. The story might seem a bit strange to begin with, but while you explore the giant world you'll find various pieces of lore that helps with the bigger picture.The game builds around a very simple puzzle mechanic: you can switch between a girl that can jump and climb, and a ball that can bounce higher and move faster. This works very well, and you'll meet some smart puzzles throughout the game where this comes in good use.Even the art style is beautiful. Almost every single room has some uniqueness to it, and there's so many crazy creatures (knytts) you'll meet. Also, the music is very fitting.I can only give this game a high recommendation.			"

												Knytt Underground gets the my highest personal reccommendation. I've Put almost 100 hours into the PSN and DRM-Free releases, and I know I'll be playing through a fifth time with the Steam release. The reason I can return to this game so frequently without getting bored is the world. It's the biggest game of its kind, and every single area has recieved a genuinely impressive amount of care. The story might seem inconsequential at first, but it explores some very sensitive topics with sincerity and handles its subject matter well. After you've finished the story, there's piles of ultra-challenging bonus areas and secrets to explore, too. The whole package is finished off with one of the best soundtracks in video game history, period. You can find it free on the developer's website, and I suggest you do. It's five and a half hours of outright brilliance.  If exploring is your cup of tea, you should've picked it up when it first released last year.Just a side note. It might not seem like it, but the game really does deserve that M rating. It has some serious subject matter in it that I wouldn't reccommend for kids (or for that matter, some adults).			"

												Knytt Underground is a 2D platform game of exploration with a quirky story. You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.The first two ""Chapters"" of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power. The second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.This will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore. There are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite ""religions"" having to do with technology. The environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say ""No way"" can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.There have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, ""A"" to use the special power, and ""S"" to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.I would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter. All I can say is I had a lot of fun exploring this game and having the story unfold.			"

												I don’t know about you, but I sure love it when the game tricks me into believing that it’s something else. Knytt Underground looks like a small and cute trifle with nothing but a cool photo-collage backgrounds paired with primitive art-style and rather abstract jokes. And it ends with explosions, quite literally. Well, at least the author inserts himself into the game to tell you this in person. First two short chapters (out of three, mind you) don’t look like much. The player is introduced to the base mechanics, of which there aren't really a lot of: you can jump, climb any vertical wall, transform yourself into a big rubber ball (this particular one can be seen only in demo-level, which is included along first two chapters and has its complete separate level) and gain access to higher jumps. Occasionally you can collect a one-time-use-power-up which looks like glowing flower bud; and most of the time this “special ability” is nothing more than some fancy high jump or short free-fly-mode for getting where you couldn’t just climb up, because the wall isn’t completely even.So I was ready to write it off with I a notion “I certainly understand why it’s so highly praised on indie scene, but…”. But then the third chapter happened. Forty minutes later, when I was realising in panic that I haven’t seen even 10% of the map and found a single save point, I realised I got into the rabbit hole; what I didn’t know is, that it would turn out to be a truly amazing adventure. The seem-to-be-obvious primary purpose of “just following the story” is being crushed by the enormous world size. You don’t really know the right path, there’s a lot of obstacles and, finally, the path to the story points is blocked by some treasure-hungry NPCs; so you have to wander off. And that’s where it becomes firstly mysterious, then great, and finally, near the end, obvious. You didn’t come here to just play it through. You’ve come here as a discoverer of sorts. The one that boldly steps into the unknown and makes a map of the journey; all this quite literally: the world is divided into a familiar grid of separate screens and there’s no telling what will you see in the next one for most of the time. The game also acknowledges this fact without a single doubt: formal purpose is what it is — formality, cause for an adventure.So what did I discover here? I found a whole surrealistic underground world inhabited by sprites and fairies, who barely remember the history of this world, but call themselves strange names, like “The Internet”. They remember though the catastrophic events of war waged by humans, that ended with the world being reduced to these scattered survivors, living in ruins, holding mystic beliefs and treating leftover household items from pre-war times as magical powerful artefacts. And yet these folks have enough in them to give you a good reason for watching them in natural habitat, exploring their lives and getting from them pieces of history. It will never, though, become clear what really happened. You didn’t really expect that from a game, which literally is dedicated to uncertainty and meaning of seeming obscure final goal? Yep, that’s it, fourth wall is a regular punchbag here.Aside from the cryptic story and chilling ambience of the scenery, there’s more too. The gameplay makes a sudden skyrocketing, shifting from “mindless jumping” to “carefully solving puzzles with jumps”; and not only with jumps. Rubber ball form now becomes useful not only for jumping higher, but for doing all kinds of tricks. Those simple power-ups now require planning before their usage. One wrong move — and at best you’ll have to try again, sometimes dying from contact with molten lava or not-so-friendly-robot laser beam. And that’s not worst that could happen, sometime you’ll fail so bad, you’ll fall to the other screen; getting back up isn’t an easy task for most of the time. But with enough focus and thinking you’ll get all those coins, and flowers, and keyboard keys, and maybe even some secret symbols. Even if you don’t it won’t change much; a game that is filled with secrets won’t hide that much if you won’t find all of them. After all, that was the message of it. If the goal isn’t clear, or doesn’t really make sense, it will be the false one.			"

												Knytt Underground follows the sprite Mi on a mission to ward off the apocalypse. At least, that's what she's doing if you listen to the angel on her shoulder; her shoulder devil is of another mind.It's also about life after us. The little buggers who built their civilization on whatever garbage we left behind seem to be doing just fine, impending doom notwithstanding. Vexing, but hardly surprising.But, at its heart, what Knytt Underground is really about is an impossibly large map.Man, that thing is big. There's about 1,500 screens in the main world, and there is even a little extra hidden beyond the boundaries.This is not quite a metroidvania -- your ""verbs"" are limited to jumping, bouncing and the occasional single-use power-up used for the trickier platforming puzzles (firing one shot, double jump, limited flight ability). A lot of the Nifflas experience is going through vast areas with no real challenges, taking the scenery in. All the same, it's not just a stroll in the park: there are also tricky jumps, shortcuts and hidden passages galore. While your palette of actions is limited, the controls are tight enough that this is all doable on a keyboard.The backgrounds in this game are pretty, even if they're mostly saturated pictures of nature. Character portraits are kind of goofy. As for the writing, it can be grating in an indie games kind of way, but it's just self-aware enough to land on the ""charmingly quirky"" end of the spectrum.But again, this is a game about a map. A huge map. It beckons.It's calling out to you.""... Heeeeey"", it says. ""Do you like exploring?""Well, do you?			"

												Nifflas very well could very well title this ""Yet Another Knytt Game"" and I would have still bought it and would have still loved it. The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.That is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not. The second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.That's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.(Also, he's make a lot of other games with Knytt and Ball. Go play them. They're free.)			"

												This game is very immersive. It's a world that I love to explore, and it feels very fun to explore too. This unqiue ambient relaxation between the art and the gameplay fit so well in something beautiful that I really have never seen so well done. Definitely a game to pick up. It's a very cheap price and I can definitely see myself playing this game for hours and hours and hours. Something I cannot find the words to explain, only the words to implore you to take a step into. I guarantee you will enjoy the experience.Edit: Just noticed my hours played count is bugged. I've played through the whole thing - definitely took more than three hours, haha. Sorry about that.			"

												Puzzle platformers rarely get as good as this. The storytelling is lovely, the soundtrack is immersive and the art is beautiful. Only negative point goes for the lack of native controller support, although I've played it first on a playstation and find the pc+keyboard  version to be much more responsive. Some puzzles are quite frustrating, but what's the fun otherwise? I've recommended this to every single person I love.			"

tl;dr: Knytt Underground is a 10/10, it's amazingly detailed and has so much charm that it's practically oozing out. Brilliant Sound design, fitting music, intelligent dialogue, addictive gameplay, and a massive world to explore that's handled expertedly.I'm in love with this game, when I first got it I knew that I was going to love it. The sounds, the music, the backgrounds, the art, the gameplay, the characters, everything! It just feels so thought out like a giant complete puzzle. As such, I'll be going into detail about things that make this game great, and also replying to the most Popular Negative Reviews here on Steam. Gameplay -- The most important thing in any game is of course how it plays. And Knytt Underground plays execellently. It's an entirely physics based platformer with neat power-ups that don't make you stronger, but instead allows you to navigate in different ways to get past obstacles. There's also a transformation that turns Mii Sprocket (The muted character you play as) to become a bouncey ball, where you can bounce up to high places. This transformation is entirely physics based, and it's damn accurate! It's very addictive. Exploration -- Chapter 1 and 2 of the game are basically Introductions to the World, Tutorials, and the primary characters. Chapter 3 is where the training wheels are removed and you're allowed to freely explore an underground world of massive size with varying environments and hundreds, thousands of secrets to discover. There's even secrets in the main menu! Themes -- Probably the second most important thing in games, at least in my opinion. Here in Knytt Underground you have some pretty serious themes that you have to stop and think about, they also reflect the Modern World in a way or too. Religion, Atheism, Emotional trauma and finding happiness in the little things play a major key in the story and even gameplay in the form of quests. ""Hey! You're that Sprocket Explorer kid, right? I don't suppose you could help me by going up into some dangerous caves to fetch me my dead Brother's skull? I need to complete his grave. He blew up, you see. In a nasty dangerous awful accident-- blah blah blah blah~"" Dialogue is usually like that, except that you can reply, in an interesting way... Artistic Themes -- The literal themes of the game are very pretty, sometimes dark, and othertimes just bizarre. There's some characters who look like a Child drew them, othertimes there's characters who look batshote crazy, but each is charming in their own way. I love how there's basically zero limitations to the amount of characters you'll find. A weird monkey creature and can speak fluent English? Yup. A 6-inch high Ninja Warrior who wishes to kill you? Yup. A literal blob that's just chillin' around toxins? You bet'cha!Dialogue -- There's hundreds of different and unique characters in Knytt with who you can interact with and even alter their futures, past sometimes as well! However, being the Mute Video-Game-Protagonist, you can't talk, you can certainly think, but never talk except for dreams. Instead you have to find two Fairies, a Moon Fairy called Cillia and a Sun Fairy called Dora. Their elements reflect their personalities. Cillia is dark, sarcastic, and down-to-earth, emotionally limited on the outside. Dora is the opposite, a bright optimist who's willing to give everyone a chance, but has a very dark past, and most likely a dark future. The dialogue for every character is usually really well written and is light-hearted at times, and dead-serious at other times. There's a secret where you find a Dead Body and you have to learn about the Dead Body's past, pretty grim stuff. Interactivity -- To interact with this world's characters, you must send out two of your fairies; Cilia and Dora. Black and White. Moon and Sun. Negative and Positive. So you're limited between being Negative and Positive with your response, very black and white. There's no middle line, no silver lining, no inbetween that you can pick. Instead the characters of the world which you interact with are the Grey between these two choices. There's no perfect person in the world of Knytt Underground, they are realistic with the fact that they have problems and personality traits unique to them. So it's up to you to decide how to deal with them. Your choice will affect other outcomes and Cilia and Dora themselves. Pick Dora too much and Cilia will feel like she's a third-wheel. Pick Cilia too much, and Dora won't think that you're too good of a person. Not even Cilia and Dora are perfect at what they represent, Dora can be mean, while Cilia can sometimes be nice. Very realistic and solid. Sound Design and Design in general -- I'll start off with Design in general. There's no Main Menu, instead you play through the menu and enter different path ways, it can take up a little too much time, but it's very pretty to look at and is always a good way to prepare you for your saved game. Sound Design is brilliant! It's super crisp quality that's authentc from the sounds of waterfalls, to mechanical robots, to the sounds of magical chimes. Story -- I won't give away any spoilers, but you're an Explorer called Mi Sprocket of the Sprocket Family. You have been chosen to save the world by serving a Religion called Myriadism, where they believe in a God and have no respect for technology that was left over by Humans. Also forgot to mention that it's set after Humanity has killed itself, so the surface is a no-go, thus Knytt UNDERGROUND. Then there's the Internet, where they believe that the Human's technology is God-Like in design and activation, they value technology, but don't care too much about life of others. The Story is often interrupted and recapped to you by Nicklas, the developer and creator of the Knytt Series where he breaks the fourth-wall quite often. He's a really chill and cool guy in real life, and his personality and wall-breaking comments don't ruin the flow of the game. Music -- The Musical Musicsky Musics of Knytt Underground are really relaxed and really fit well. There's a few songs which I dislike, but they did fit their environment. Some of the secret musical pieces are pretty repetitive since in their context they were just 10-second loops and entirely optional and don't impact the game in any big way. Difficulty -- Chapter's 1 and 2 are very easy as they're tutorials. But some of the puzzles and platforming in Chapter 3 are really frocking tough, and sometimes will take at least an hour to nail down. But being such a large world, you can usually always skip through the platforming and puzzles via a secret path or completing certain quests. Replayability -- I've never really heard of a replayable 2D Platformer before, except for maybe Mario Maker, but that's not really a game. But I've replayed Knytt Underground a few times now. A typical playthrough, focusing just on story takes roughly 5 hours. Filling up the map of each chapter, roughly 15 hours. 100 percenting that playthrough takes around 50 hours. Modability and Community -- Since Knytt Underground is such an underrated and hidden gem in Steam, the community is small and inactive, likewise is the modding community. Infact, there's little to no mods, nothing major at least. TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!-- ""The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art""This is to avoid distracting the tight platforming. --Nitpicks -- I always go against Nitpicking, but for a masterpiece which is claimed by many or myself, I will point out issues. There's very little impactful nitpicks in Knytt, thankfully, but there is some. When you transform into the ball, you can sometimes bounce at the very top of slanted edges, but this can be dismissed as being on purpose. Realistically, the same thing would happen.			"

												The name of the game is secrets. Secrets Underground. That's what this is.Nifflas, creator of the Knytt series, is a whimsical developer who just up and makes whatever he feels like making, usually a whimsical game about whimsical creatures going on whimsical adventures, and while Knytt Underground draws on that in its story and its visual and audio design, the characterization is a drastic change in tone. It handles serious and sensitive issues, and there's plenty of heavy language to go with that. Maybe it's the sheer unexpectedness of it that contributes to the M rating, whereas plenty of games with way more ""questionable content"" keep their T rating because their general tone is darker. But that's not what the game is about. The game is about secrets. The game has way more secrets than achievements. There are often secrets within the secrets. Sometimes there are even secrets in THOSE secrets. How about a 4-layer secret? Don't put it past Nifflas; he'd do it. Nothing is too obscure. Very few players get the achievements in this game, and it's for a reason. Even if you find them all, you could still be missing a lot. Fact: Nifflas hates progress bars.The Knytt series is a bit of a Metroid ""lite"" with the emphasis on exploration and platforming challenges scattered throughout. Enemy encounters are infrequent, and they are not very aggressive, letting you take in the atmosphere even when they're around. Even more rarely will you actually have to confront the enemies, as most of the enemy-based challenges are about avoiding enemies or using them to your advantage. The biggest obstacles in the game are the NPCs, who are more than happy to make their living by setting up doors in the way of your goals and charging you in rare artifacts to open them. If you take this gameplay mechanic at face value, it can seem like the biggest gameplay element in Knytt Underground is a bunch of annoying fetch quests, but this is not necessarily true. Yes, if you've been staring at the map the whole time and heading straight toward your target destinations with no effort to explore on your own, you will be sent on fetch quests, but if you've been exploring adequately throughout your experience, very rarely will the NPCs actually succeed in making you turn around. The quests are also pretty lenient, as you don't have to find every item in the game to pay the tolls, and, in fact, you don't have to pay the tolls at all. If you're very skilled at navigating the world, you can find shortcuts around these annoying characters. The fetch quests aren't here to draw out the game length, they're there to offer a loosely guiding sense of purpose as you whimsically (there's that word again) explore the world and enjoy its atmosphere--just as how in Minecraft, the ""goal"" of taking out the Ender Dragon is not the main appeal of the game, and if that were all you ever set out to do, you'd be missing the point. This isn't the kind of game you want to try and plow through quickly. If you do, you're seriously missing out, and probably not having a very good time.The information in the above paragraph does not mean that Knytt Underground is braindead easy, however. There are plenty of hidden challenges that will test your platforming mettle, no matter what your background is. The key word here, though, is ""hidden."" They are far from mandatory to advance the story, and not necessary to complete in order to enjoy the game. They are there because Nifflas gets bored and makes them, and hides them in the game so there's something for everyone.			"

												Let me say this right away, I've not finished Knytt Underground nor do I plan to. Yet, I can safely say it's an amazing platformer and very well put together. I got until the last chapter by myself but after exploring most of the rooms I just couldn't bother to exploring every single one of them so I just went on Youtube and saw a walkthrough from where I was until the end and I loved it. While at first glance Knytt Underground may look like just another puzzle platformer amongst the many others that have came out on recent years, it's not. Knytt Underground tells a story, a very strange story that will only make sense by the end of the game. The story is told in a hidden way, just like an hidden message and there are places online where you can see peoples explanations of the story in case that's the only thing that interests you. Besides that, Knytt Underground is a very well made platformer, very fluid, responsive controls, possibly Super Meat Boy level of controls along with some minor teleport and flying mechanics. The soundtrack on this game is nothing short of amazing, very calm and charming along with the brilliant visuals that decorate the background and they vary alot from level to level. Overall, it's pretty safe to say that you can't go wrong with Knytt Underground, either if you're looking for a great platformer or for a great story, it is an incredibly well made game.			"

												Beautiful arts together with amazing soundtrack make this game an unique journey to the Knytt world. Huge amount of rooms to explore, secrets everywhere and many enjoyable challenges - this indie platformer has it all. The story keeps you immersed into mystery and ""gloomy"" atmosphere. This game does not hold your hand all the time as you will need to figure out most of the things on your own (especially secrets, challenges).Too bad this game does not have controller support but still it is not that bad to play it with keyboard. Despite few minor cons it is definitely worth to buy - If you like this type of games of course. It is not a typical and easy platform. You will spend more time here and enjoy the story with visual and audio effects.			"

												Knytt is a good platform, with lots to explore in wonderful colours and some puzzles that require skills, some of them so rogue and challenging to stress out asking for a break,  but overall ends up being a joyful experience; soundtrack is appealing to the game as well.			"

												I think Knytt Underground is excellent. A simple way to decide if you will like Knytt Underground is to go play Nifflas' other free games (available online).There is a lot of exploring and wandering about, and there a lot of unique-looking locations that make the large amounts of traveling worth it. The puzzles are stimulating and a few a quite tricky. Chapters 1 & 2 are a bit boring, but they are essentially tutorials (that can also be skipped).			"

												If you've never played a Knytt game before, stop reading right now, head over here[nifflas.ni2.se], and play Knytt and/or Knytt Stories for free. These games, created by a lone developer called Nifflas (also of NightSky and Saira fame), are some of the finest exploration-based platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Knytt Underground is the most recent in the series, and while it might be the most ambitious, it makes some unexpected departures from the previous games.You know you're in for something special when the game loads straight to a tutorial that turns out to be the main menu. There are three chapters in Knytt Underground, though the first two are essentially introductions to the massive third. You play both as Mi Sprocket, a mute little sprite, and Bob, a sentient bouncing ball from another early Nifflas game, Within a Deep Forest. Together they embark on a grand journey through the underground of a post-apocalyptic Earth far more mysterious and colorful than anything you've seen in Fallout. The surfaces you traverse are all shown in silhouette but the backgrounds are vibrant, animated collages of Photoshopped worlds. Every alien landscape you can imagine is represented here, with enormous gardens, crystal caves, blasted deserts, crumbling temples, ominous graveyards, and sinister machinery among them.While you have a massive, massive map to explore, don't confuse this with a metroidvania. Mi and Bob never gain new abilities to navigate with, though their own basic skills provide a wealth of options. Mi can climb walls and Bob can bounce, and switching freely between the two allow you to pull of some surprising maneuvers. There are also colored seeds that grant Mi a one-time power like flying in a straight line, and robots that Bob can tether to. Creative use of these resources can indeed get you anywhere you need to go, no matter how impossible the passage seems. The result is almost like a puzzle game, where you'll find rooms that look like they need special powers to traverse, but eventually you'll have that eureka moment and puzzle it out yourself.You'll have tons of items to find as well, and the denizens of the underground give quests that'll reward you with what you need or point you in the right direction. These items are used to pass the gates barring your ultimate objective, but there's some welcome flexibility to the collecting. One gate might require 5 items out of a possible set of 8, and if you find some of the game's well-hidden coins you can substitute them as well. This means you'll never get stuck on a particular puzzle for a single item, and exploration will always reward you with something you can use.Previous Knytt games had stark pixel graphics and a distinct sense of isolation to them. Nifflas often populates his strange and alien worlds with little harmless critters but not sentient creatures, usually leaving you alone to explore the vast spaces in solitude. Knytt Underground is a sharp departure here, adding not only loads of characters to talk and deal with, but also giving them incredibly unexpected personalities. Everyone speaks with modern sensibilities, almost like irreverent sitcom characters. They'll call out their own foibles and contrivances, and denigrate a lot of your quests as pointless busywork. One of your two pixie companions is also as foul-mouthed as you can imagine, frequently telling people to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves and eat glass and such. It's such a weird departure in tone from the previous games, even moreso in how their hideous, blobby portraits clash with the clean lines of the rest of the game.The NPCs are the only major knock against an otherwise atmospheric experience, and to be fair, seeing their character arcs through redeems the worst offenders. Even on top of the 10+ hours of exploration the game offers, there are a host of secrets to find. Some are tied up in the game's unique and challenging fast travel system which I won't spoil, but be aware there's no easy teleporting around the enormous map until you master it. Just like the rest of the game, though, it's worth putting the time into to experience. Knytt Underground is a marvelous journey from start to finish, one that's easy to immerse in and immensely rewarding to play.			"

												*I've finished this game on PSN. This is one of the most underrated platformers. I'm never a big platformer fan, even Mario and Rayman can't attract me much. But this one, you should never miss it.Bad platformers give you tons of challenges and a tutorial that comes from nowhere, then they call it a ""game"".But in Knytt Underground, you put yourself in this eerie but beautiful world, granted with strange power and start your journey. Challenges in this game are not that difficult, but you still need to analyse and prepare your steps. If you fail the jump, you will immediately go back to a check-point in this small room, so the jumping is challenging but never annoying. Control is easy and precise, but you may need some other software (like joy2key) to support your controller.If you just want to read the main story, the game is not difficult and short. But there are much more things to explore. And you could find many interesting items, side-quests and more challenges.The story is well written, full of imagination. Dialogues are humorous so you never get bored.The world, the atmosphere, the story and those challenges, all make this game so engaging. It's a wonderful experience, worth your time and money.			"

TL;DR -Do you like platformers? If so, buy this game. If not, buy this game anyways.Knytt Underground is, by and large, one of the best 2D platformers available on the PC. The game has beautiful environments, an excellent soundtrack and level ambience that can put sites like asoftmurmur.com to shame. Simply put, it's therapeutic to the nth degree. The platforming is simply top notch with (no exaggeration) perfect, 1:1 controls and level design that can get pretty nintendo hard at times. The 'overworld' itself is freaking massive - and like any other Nifflas game, it's packed to the brim with secrets. You will miss secrets on your first playthrough, guaranteed.However, KU is not without its faults. One terribly massive con - no native controller support. It's very easy to work around this, (try ControllerToKeyboard for Windows, Enjoyable for OSX, or qJoyPad for Linux) but you'd think for a PC platformer it would come with partial support at the very least. There is also a surprising amount of dialogue for such a game, but you're really not missing much if you skip through all of it. If you're capable of reading a minimap, you can skip through all the dialogue you want.			"

												Firstly, I must admit that I am a huge fan of Nifflas' (the game's developer) work. Ever since I first played Within A Deep Forest I knew I wanted to play more of his games. Getting this one on Steam was great and he's still doing great games. All the mechanics are solid and really fit well in the game. Controls are surprisingly working exactly like you'd think and the physics are something I really love. The story is rather confusing but I didn't really mind that. The characters are really well done, even though I'm sure some people will definitely disagree with me. All in all, it was a great experience and I recommend it if these kinds of games interest you.			"

												I haven't felt this about a game in some time. Very charming, I simply love all the little locations and pieces of dialouge. Simply getting around the world is fun, and I believe exploring the fairly large map to be another brilliant part of Knytt Underground. I want more games to be so fundementally fun and intresting. Highly reccomended.			"

Posted: April 13, 2015
												This is my first review on steam. I'll try to make it simple.Knytt Underground is a platformer with puzzle mechanic. Most of the time these puzzles are simple.  switch between 2 forms (human for climbing, and ball for bouncing) and  use ""right one-use-power"" at the right time to get to hard to reach places. The thing is some solutions are not so simple and not very obvious on first sight so you might end up trying to go around some areas ... often leaving you in this ""what the fudge"" state. That made me use a uncovered map i found on google :P.  And made me revisit most of the areas and try to ""re-reach"" areas if there was some hidden passage. And belive me there are lots of them. But there are also areas only accessible if you uncover lore about characters. Just do every quest you find(or events marked as ""?""), so dont get frustrated if you cant reach something now.First two chapters are more of a tutorial short and simple. Real challange is chapter 3 wich is HUGE, map covers WHOLE SCREEN. played almost 20 hours of it to reach to the end (i started to use uncovered map after having about half of the map reveald and it had lots of uncovered holes).There is this teleporting mechanic wich lets you teleport across the map but i havent use it ... cause i didnt know how so i ignored it.In overal the game is challenging. ESPECIALLY if you plan to unlock all steam achevements. so if you are aiming for that i suggest reading steam community walkthroughs cause there is one achevement you get for ""not paying bell guards for entrence"" wich i did unfortunately.  Other reviews state that dialogues are bad ... well maybe because this world is confusing, maybe that was the aim for the creators to make strange relations between races while engaging in some dificult topics about main characters. Depends on personal tastes . I didnt find them that bad. Some funny more or less. (there is even one adult joke but i wont spoil it :P)Background pictures are amazing. Music is calm and pleasing. For adventurer LOTS of secrets to uncover. In overall its a average game, good choice if you have nothing to play, Would be nice addicion for a mobile game.(there would be problem with implementing chapter 3 world map).I ""kind of"" liked it.EDIT: This game seems complex but there is no wiki focused on this game unfortunately, wich would be usefull since there are lots of secrets, world lore, and interactions with NPCs in it.

												I so very much love this game. I've spent most of my day today playing it because it's just that engaging.It's a beautiful combination of exploration-based gameplay and 2D platforming. The game map is huuuuuge. And that could be a bad thing, but exploring it is a joy because of the diverse atmospheres and all the little bits of story scattered throughout. I filled out the map simply because it was fun to explore. There's hundreds of puzzles and plenty of hidden objects to find, and the map's nice enough to mark mostly everything for you. The only thing you have to find on your own are the hidden passages (which on a few occasions are really difficult to find and figuring out how to reach hidden rooms is quite the epiphany~)That's not to say the game is easy, though. There's plenty of difficult action sequences, and if you plan to get all the achievements you really need to master the controls and the game's physics, because it can be HARD. Not quite as difficult as some precision platformers get, but you can spend a lot of time on the same screen or two.I really can't properly describe how this game pulls you in. Personally, I'd sit down, boot it up, and start filling in more of the map, only to discover that two or more hours had vanished while I was making progress. It's a game that demands your attention and doesn't easily let it go. And I'm quite glad I played it~			"

												An unique, atmospheric platformer that begs to be exploredThe controls feel responsive and smooth. The gameplay was entertaining and not overly difficult. The artwork is truly impressive because every room carries its own distinctive visual theme. The plot might not be the deepest but it still offers humorous and sometimes thought inducing insight into the world created. What makes it enjoyable for me is the exploration itself. Because each room is different, it had its own secrets to uncover and story to tell. Overall, an enjoyable game to play.			"

												Played the freeware game released by the dev some time ago and liked the game style. So buying this one was no real brainer. This version is entirely different compared to the freeware games. Much more polished look. The game itself is '2D hardcore platform parkour goes Super Meat Boy' -type of endurance fest sometimes - sometimes it's quite a casual stroll around nice enviroments. No really, no saw blades here but the platforming challenges can sometimes be very punishing - and the game map is huge - enormous - way way large in Chapter 3 (first two are basicaly tutorials). Also lots of hidden tunnels and lots of weird characters. Recommended to people who want a real platforming challenge.			"

												A platformer-puzzle game with a huge map, and I mean really REALLY HUGE. I'm almost 20 hours into the game and I explored like 60% of the map. Take Metroid with less pew pew and mix it with dozens of secret rooms. Add funny dialog (beware adult language) puzzles (some of them are challenging but not infuriating) and nature backgrounds.Don't let the 1st (here you learn the game basic mechanics) and 2nd (here you learn how to play as a ball, another form you can transform into) missions fool you. They're short and easy, but they're just a training for the extremely long 3rd mission.The downside for me is the music. I don't mind relaxing music, in fact I like it. But this game is just ambiental noises: birds chirping, wind blowing, etc. It's calm but sometimes you'd prefer more elaborated tunes.			"

												This is a good game if you're in the mood for exploration, and there is a lot of exploration. The big game mechanic here is that your character can switch between being a girl and being a ball at will. Yep, it sounds ridiculous, nobody in the story seems to care that this happens, but it's a fun mechanic. The girl can climb up walls, and the ball can jump high and gain some serious horizontal uncontrollable speed, which is fun, until you hit a ledge or something. You can climb to a high distance with the girl, then change to the ball and gain some extra jump height, or you can jump high with the ball and get to a climbing spot the girl couldn't get to before. Cool little mechanic with momentum. Exploration is the main part of the game. There's little mini stories scattered all over for you to find. It's a big map, so there's quite a few of them. Fortunately, if they ask you to get something, it's usually nearby, so you don't have to take 30 minutes traveling across a 2d maze to get a McGuffin, just a few minutes at most. The world is a maze; nothing is straight forward. So have fun traveling as a ball one direction and ending up somewhere on the map you didn't expect.			"

												As a huge fan of Knytt Stories, I was looking forward to the release of this game. However, the result is not something which I can call worthwhile.Graphics:Unfortunately, the transition to higher res graphics is not flattering at all. While Stories used simple sprites, the low res meant that this could pass for a purposeful aesthetic and it worked. Underground, by contrast, looks generally incoherent. The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art - they are impossible to take seriously.Audio:The music and sound effects are consistently fitting, minimal and and atmospheric so a good job on this count.Gameplay:The platforming mechanics here are fairly good, the level layouts are smart and there are a good number of save points along the way. The chaper two mechanics are pretty neat. However, progression through the game is not rewarding in the same way that a good Metroidvania should be. A lack of character upgrades and variety makes progression feel less like purposeful exploration and more like aimless stumbling around and backtracking. On a technical note, there is no controller support. The creator suggests using joy2key or xpadder but having tried this, it is clear that design choices in the keyboard conrtrols make this impractical.Dialog:This is one of the more frustrating parts of the whole experience. It is clear that there was an attempt to be whimsical here but in reality, the dialog just serves to pull you right out of the game; creating a feeling that neither the characters or the writer are invested at all. Rather than being charming, it just kills the neat atmospheric mood that the game partway manages to establish.Overall:Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Play Knytt Stories instead. It is free and feels much more complete and satisfying than Underground in every way. If you like Stories, then maybe consider buying this to support Nifflas almost as a donation for that game.			"

												Knytt Underground is a almost funny game about a girl that is about to visit some fairies. A solid design that invites you to explore the well told story. A nice sequel.ReviewDesign: The graphics in this game are extremely cleverly made. The highlighting of important things are a good guide through the game, while the real setting is rather introvert but very beautiful. The athmosphere of the game is keeping up the whole time from the very first until the last second of the game. Even though it kind of remings me of Braid, it is still it's own in a kinda way. 8/10Music & Audio: While the audio is deeply integrated to the game, the music is kind of lost. Long phases without music playing in the background are taking the fun of the game, but when the music plays, it is very breathtaking and keeps up the morale. 8/10Gameplay & Addiction: Besides that forced humor that is kind of annoying, the story of this game is told very great and is worth as much as the original Knytt. The gameplay is familiar and very clear, even though the level designs feel like labyrinths sometimes, but that's good. The long and sometime difficult levels are very fine and provide a lot of gamefun and playing hours. 7/10Cost-Benefit Equation & resumé: This is truely a great sequel to the platformer that will take your breath. A kind of funny told story that is worth it's money. The gaming duration is worth it, if you like to play interactive stories. Who cares about books? Play Knytt. 7/10For the cheap price of 6.99€ (1.99€ in sale at the moment!) you get more than you can ask. Sell some of your useless DotA2/TF2/CS:GO stuff and buy this game.Thank you!

												First of all, although I haven't played much of this on PC I have completed the game on Vita and from what brief playtime I had on the PC version there doesn't seem to be any differences. One thing I would recommend is playing in windowed mode as the graphics appear stretched in fullscreen.Knytt Underground is one of my favourite games that I have played this year, totally unexpectedly. I came into this thinking I'd mess around on it for half an hour but what I found is one of the most deep and immensely enjoyable puzzle exploration 'complete the map' games I have ever played. I can't really explain it, but I found the mechanics really fun and easy to get the hang of yet difficult to master and the game has an unexplainable charm to it that I haven't found in many other games this year. Initially in the first two chapters the game seems small and limited, but this is simply a tutorial or prologue if you will to the massive chapter 3 which is when the whole game's map opens up. It's addictive to try and discover and explore each of the grids in the game's map system and to discover the secret and story behind each area. Many areas involve puzzles which make use of enemies and hazards and the game's climbing and jumping mechanics to solve, and the ability to *SPOILER* transform into a ball and use momentum to bounce and reach previously unreachable areas *SPOILER* which is fun in itself.It's one of the games that looks simple and low-budget and to an extent it is, but it also has this deceptively deep story and an incredible atmosphere and soundtrack which to me at least is one of the hardest but most important elements of a game to get right. To say go play this game and see for yourself isn't very helpful I know, but it really is something that you need to play to understand the points I'm making. If you're feeling hesitant, buy it on sale, but keep it on your wishlist because this is a game that you need to play.			"

												If you've ever played or enjoyed any of Nifflas's other games, you will probably both enjoy and feel familiar in this one. (And if you haven't, Within A Deep Forest and Knytt Stories are both freeware, so go play them). And I don't just say that because your characters control like the two from those games. However, this is not just ""more of the same"", and does see him treading new ground.Gameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.Yes, the story. And that's the new ground: The story here is very good. You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to ""save the world"" is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.The game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can ""beat"" the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.Overall, I'd highly recommend trying this game. Just don't expect any aspect of it to be fast paced.			"

												I have been a fan of Nicklas's games since I first played ""Within A Deep Forest"" so many years ago. While most of his games tend to have a similar gameplay style, they are always enjoyable and have an amazing aesthetic.Knytt Underground is one part ""Within A Deep Forest"", one part ""Saira"", and one part ""Knytt"". The simple platforming and exploration gameplay of Knytt is merged with the harder, physics-based platforming from WADF and is then set in a world using surreal photo-realistic environments akin to Saira.This all produces a massive, metroid-vania-like, ambient, exploration platformer that is easy to get lost in. It is not afraid to crank up the difficulty in a few areas to keep you on your toes, but the whole map is incredibly non-linear so you are rarely forced to go through a section when you first come to it. This game is essentially one huge scavenger hunt, but it never feels like a chore, even when you are backtracking through areas you have already been to. There are quite a lot of secrets as well, many of which provide the hardest sections of the game and are completely optional.I honestly cannot remember much from the plot apart from having to ring 4 bells, but this game left a lasting impression in the memories of simply exploring the beautiful and serene world along to the ambient, relaxing soundtrack. To me, this is the mark of a good game, and I eagerly look forward to all of Nicklas's future games.			"

												Following in the footsteps of Nifflas' other memorable creations, Knytt Underground is a beautiful platformer you can play for literally hours and not get tired of.  One thing I've always appreciated in Nifflas' games is control responsiveness.  This game has *very* responsive controls.  With a large number of rooms to explore (not including secret areas, mind you), amusing character dialogs... there's hours of entertainment here.  Almost 40 hours in and I still haven't done everything there is to do.			"

												16 hours this was a hella fun platformer with a lot of secrets and a cool plot, it can be easy to lose the save points in the last chapter through unfortunate exploration but persist you'll find one. Definitely worth the purchase cost.			"

												I want to start the review of Knytt Underground with one statement up front: I do not believe it to be a bad game, exactly. It does what it sets out to do, and does it well. The problem is that Knytt Undeground intends from a game design standpoint is not what I enjoy from games of its genre. I knew from the outset that the game is somewhat unconventional, but hoped I would enjoy it regardless. I did, for a time.What the game does right:Despite taking place underground, the game has a wide variety of backgrounds to its locations that can be quite beautiful.The game prepares you relatively well for its platforming mechanics, which effectively make a great deal of its rooms into puzzles.The feeling of finally making the tricky series of jumps required for some of the exploration/puzzles is satisfying.The setting, if not the plot, is intriguing.Why I lost interest regardless:The first two chapters of the game are brief and relatively linear, and basically tutorials for the extremely non-linear chapter 3. The lack of any sense of focus in chapter 3 felt more to its detriment than benefit.After the beginning of chapter 3, the player receives no new abilities that change the gameplay in any significant way. Powerups are instead temporary, scattered through the map for the specific purpose of navigating one or a few rooms.Because of the temporary nature of powerups and unchanging nature of the player's capabilities, the game lost all sense of progression. I could explore the third chapter's map to its loosely defined goals, but never felt rewarded for doing so outside satisfying my own curiosity. I did just that for a few hours, before the lack of perceived advancement made Knytt Underground more boring than entertaining.So, do I recommend Knytt Undeground? Yes and no.Do you feel that exploration is its own reward? Then by all means, play it.Is curiosity alone enough for you to play a game for hours on end? If so, you'll probably have a good time.Do you need greater motivation in gameplay terms than either of those things, as I did? Then, unfortunately, Knytt Underground probably won't be very satisfying. I genuinely wanted to like the game, and I hope others do, but it was not for me.			"

												The whole Knytt series is worth playing, but this one (as far as I know) is the only one on Steam. Luckily for you, it's also the best. Knytt games are all about exploration, puzzles, and platforming, in that order. They're very engrossing and it's fun to run, jump, climb, and bounce over the strange and beautiful world. The movement in this game feels great - once you hear your little feet scamper up a wall as you climb it you'll fall in love.This series of games proves that indie games don't have to hide behind quirky graphics and a ""message"" (*cough* LIMBO *cough*) to be worth playing. Knytt Underground is fun, it's interesting, and it's definitely worth your time. Pick it up today.			"

												Knytt Underground is easily one of the best indie games I've ever played. Perhaps one of the best, period. The world of Knytt is so brilliantly atmospheric and immersive. I found myself more drawn into the world, the story and the characters in this game than in any other game I've ever played. The platforming and puzzle elements are generally quite fun and  challenging. Challenging, but never to the point that I lost my♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is partly due to the fact that I spent much of my time simply exploring it's brilliant world and talking to the interesting, amusing, and complex characters. The art style is absolutely brilliant, and mostly consists of black sillhouette foregrounds, cartooney characters and backgrouns made of photos of various things like rocks and flowers, and such, pieced together in interesting ways. The music is often times quite trippy and kind of melancholy, which really adds to the lonely atmosphere of the game. It's surprising that a game about sprites and fairies in a post-apocalyptic world, could have some of the most realistic, and  deep characters of any game I've ever played.Bottom line, this is a game that has so much fun platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, atmosphere, and heart that...just buy it already! You won't regret it!			"

												Aside of♥♥♥♥♥♥poor controller support (which is no support at all, thanks to the Devs choosing wrong SDK), the game's pretty neat one. As it stands, the game does better with controller enabled, but since it's lacking support.. you can use workaround like Joy2Key to have controller support. For the game itself, It's an exploration platformer, meaning you won't find many enemies to pawn like in Giana Sister or Mark of the Ninja. What you need is to move around, get past puzzle and do some tricks to advance. There are some annoying puzzles though that require you to be precise with the jump timing, or backtracking quite a bit when you fail. I guess it's part of the game.The OST is a complete opposite of Electronic Super Joy with its hard punk - or whatever it's called - OST genre. The OST is pretty bland and unnoticed at times, well I don't think about it too much, the game's pretty slow paced as well.All in all, a quite unique game. Recommended.			"

												An exploration platformer where you can switch between the tight wall-climbing controls of Knytt and the fast bouncy-ball controls of Within a Deep Forest.The game mainly provides an excuse to explore a huge, beautiful world. Some of the game's areas are easy to traverse and mainly exist to be looked at, but there is also plenty of tough platforming for those who seek it out. The control-switching feature makes for interesting challenges and feels well-suited to smooth, efficient movement when exploring (although you might prefer to slow down and admire the backgrounds). Furthermore, the game is overflowing with secrets, to the point of having secrets nested within secrets.The game stars a mute sprite named ""Mi"" and later a pair of fairies that speak for her - your interactions with other NPCs serve to characterize the trio. The game is sometimes silly, but it also sometimes touches on weighty issues. The world's inhabitants, despite being mythical creatures, are relatable and act very human.An excellent game, well worth your time.			"

												This is one great indie platform game, made in variety of metroidvania style, a little bit challenging at some points, for those who aim for achievements it sure is bigger chalenge. Music is very atmosferic and good, there are a lot of relaxing tunes, and some creepy, if you don't wanna spend money on this i would recommend at least listening game soundtrack. There is very little combat in this game, main focus is puzzle solving and questing, what can be big downside at first look but it isn't, this is not game's aim so that doesn't really matter. In total there are three chapters, first two as some kind of introduction and third one as the main game where whole game world can be explored, as in first two it can be done only small part of it because you control different characters at that chapters, and at third you can switch between those two whenever you want.I'm sure one day i will be back to play Knytt Underground again, make sure you do it too!

												If you like anything Nifflas has ever done or if you like everything he's ever done, you will like this game. This like the original Knytt + Stories + Saira all rolled into one with extra on top. If you play the demo don't think that this game is as short as the first two chapers. The world starts for real in chapter 3 and is 49x49 screen with tons of secrets. You will also see lots of things from previous games (locations, items, references). The world building here is amazing, Nifflas uses everything available to create a real sense of a different but real place.You are Mi Sprocket, a sprite who cannot talk. But the game has conversations, how does this work? Soon you will get two companions and you can choose who should have the conversation each time. Your companions have quite different world views. The story is not a fixed story but creates an incredible sense of a journey and you feel your companions have real growth. The graphics are beautiful. Coming from previous Nifflas games I didn't like the silhouettes at first but once you see how it is used in combination with the backgrounds it becomes apparent it is his best style yet. It manages to be so atmospheric. Especially in combination with the sound and music. There are over 100 tracks (which you can download for free on his site).My game of 2013. PS: My playtime is low because I played the non steam version back in March. The game is 20+ hours easily.			"

												If you've played Knytt Stories and Within a deep forest, you know how the mechanics for Knytt Underground work. (If you haven't played them, go and do so. They're free, and give a good grasp of the feel of Nifflas' games)What really differentiates Knytt Underground from Nifflas' prior work is the story. I've seen all too many reviews disregard the story, saying it's weak. An awful lot of reviewers have evidently missed what the story is. The central plot is not the story. It's little more than a framing work, something to give you a reason to go and explore the hauntingly beautiful landscape.The real story is on the side-lines. It's about religion, and whether it matters if there's a god, and WHY it matters to people whether or not there is. It's about the good, the bad and the ugly of faith and belief and all the little insecurities of life. It's supported in this by a very human cast. (Which is vaguely amusing given the lack of humans present.) I actually cared about Dora, and Cilia, and even the little side characters who did little but add flavour to the world, building it up to something that feels real.My love of this game can only be aptly compared to my love of the works of Tove Jansson, whose Moomin series holds a strong resemblance to the work.Let this vaguely aimed and rambling essay tell you: This game is worth it.

												I like this game a lot, for a few reasons.Gameplay consists of platforming, exploration, and item collection.  The enjoyment of this game for me comes in with the characters, the atmosphere, and the setting.  While there is no combat or complex puzzles and a lot of quests dead end and have no rewards, what you are left with is a game you play for the story.  If the story isn't to your liking here then you probably wont like the game, but it worked out pretty well for me.  I liked the interaction and development between the characters, and the game doesn't feel held back when it comes to discussing a few unpleasant topics or having characters act vulgar or make violent expressions when it fits (hence the game's Mature ESRB rating).  The game's art-style for character portraits was initially a turn-off for me but I found myself not really minding it later into the game.  The game also has good sound and art design for its environments, and can be very nicely ambient in atmosphere.  The setting and lore of the game was very appealing to me too, and gives the player a few humorous moments thanks to meta-knowledge that the characters in the story dont posess. Performance - No issues, runs fine, rebindable controls, graphics options are satisfactory.  Controls are fairly tight and platforming is not very problematic.  Some puzzles are hard, but not excessively so, and the game is very much non-punishing for failure-retry in its puzzles.  There are optional parts with quite difficult puzzles, but those are presented completely aside from the main setting of the game.Its a very good game, and quite long too for an indie game.  I spent a lot of time enjoying myself and exploring things, and seeking out a few optional achievements, and put in about 20 hours into the game.  I know this sort of enjoyment that is more story than gameplay driven is not for everyone, so a lot of people might find the game boring or lose interest, but I would definately reccommend it. "

												Knytt Underground is a sequel to an indie platform game that was making waves online. Now available on Steam, the game has you playing the role of a little girl who looks like some kind of evil doll. Look at her run, that’s evil. Freaky little legs swinging around like sticks. But either way this little girl goes on a metroid style quest to explore temples and dungeons. While the game may look like a first grader’s attempt at drawing, the level design is pretty solid. The dialog is a bit strange, and for some reason the game got an M rating because somehow characters get into sexual conversations and curse a lot. There’s something a little… special? about this game. If you can get past that, you will find some fun platforming and metroidvania style platforming. Plus now I’m going to beat it just to find out what that M rating was for.Watch the full review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP124			"

It’s the third game in the series though you won’t likely have heard of the previous two games as they never made it to Steam. You follow the adventures of Mi, a mute sprite who must ring six special bells in this underground world in order to save it. She is joined by a sentient, yet also mute, bouncing ball and two fairies. So, with this quirky cast of characters, you are tasked to save the world….and fetch every single item in this vast world of sprites. You begin with a couple of short tutorial chapters to get you familiar with the game mechanics that Knytt has. After that, the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you in chapter three. The game world is huge and there is a lot to see. Much of the game is focused around exploring every nook and cranny while listening to a pretty darn good soundtrack. There's also a story involving your two companion fairies that gets fleshed out during your adventures though I found the writing to be wonky. Basically, there's a science VS religion theme going throughout the story and I'm not convinced that it pulls it off that well. The two fairies themselves are also a bit two dimensional and predictable to how they'll treat each situation. It's not well written. Level DesignWhile the game has over 1,800 rooms to explore, a lot of them are empty corridors and dead-ends. A very large majority of the quests in this game are fetch quests and the rest are finding somebody. (So, just ½ of the fetch quest). Most items are obtained after solving physics-based puzzles that get continually harder as the game progresses. Getting around the world is a chore as the fast-travel system is very gimmicky and tricky to get to the area that you really want to be. The whole shadow world that has you rushing in a netherworld to get to the exit but if you don't get there in time, you'll be thrown into a random room that doesn't help you progress forward. It can get extremely tiresome to deal with. The Game's ContentI will say that I enjoyed the exploration...for a while. I enjoyed the puzzles...for a while. I enjoyed the fetch quests...for a while. It’s really a testament to the game that I tolerated 14 hours of fetch quests. But towards the end of the game, I just wanted it to end. The game’s content is bloated, repetitive and lacking in interesting new mechanics to explore after a while. While being able to transform into a ball is a little different on the platforming genre, I think its the worst part of the game as some areas and puzzles require extremely precise jumping in order to pass. RagequitThe game ended for me when I got to the 5th major locked door in the game. Each bell that has to be rung is locked by a jerkface sprite that demands you hand over items for varying reasons ranging from “I’m just like this because reasons” to “You need to PROVE yourself”. (This goes back to my complaint that the story isn't well written). When I was told, at the 5th door, that I still needed more items in order to pass, (and hence complete the game) I pretty much said this: NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE. I’M DONE, I’M FINISHED. I’VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. And promptly quit the game. I do understand that there are ways to get around the bell without paying but it requires trial and error to get around him through the other world system. I can only tolerate so much of the same repetitive activity. The enemy variety is lacking and many of the >physics< puzzles consist of a lot of trial and error. An absurd amount of trial and error dependent on nailing skillshots at the right time in the midst of bouncing around the room. It can get very quickly frustrating after dealing with it for 10+ hours. There's nothing there to really vary it up. PC SettingsKnytt has rebindable keys and audio sliders. Graphics settings are extremely basic, allowing for changing full screen and some enabling/disabling minor effects. That's all. It's a stunningly basic settings menu. While 2D games don't necessarily need a lot of settings, not even having the basic such as V-Sync or Resolution is not ok. One last note: the character running around in the chapter-select screen is cute but please don’t add it to future games. Adding time to entering the game (especially when its the longest path of all the three chapters) gets very old. Using a regular menu UI is much more preferable to getting us into the actual game. No need to make a repetitive game out of entering the actual game.Final ThoughtsI can’t recommend Knytt Underground. The game is unique with a great soundtrack and solid enough presentation for sure but the repetitive gameplay and frustrating trial-and-error puzzles drove me insane. It’s a large ocean of a world with the depth of a puddle. Adding different kinds of quests and less item questing would have made the experience more enjoyable in my mind. The game is far too long considering its story and mechanical depth. You'll realistically see most of the game's mechanics in the first two tutorial levels before moving onto the main world. Said world will only slightly change things up, but depend far too much on what it first designed to create challenges. The story itself takes too long (mostly due to the game's pacing issues) and has a central, if uninteresting, conflict between religion and science that has been done better elsewhere. This is, bemusingly, too much content for this game's concept and execution. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												It feels somewhat like a free roam Oddworld game, with unbelievable amount of secrets scattered all across the huge map; if the story seems boring for someone- he can skip first 2 short chapters and head to the chapter three, with the map that feels just overwelming in size as you explore it; I can wander for hours, use characters abilities to reach diffirent places, while still experiencing that quite fun feeling that with enough skill and time- you can access just any place you want, you explore as you like, listening to chilling music with backgrounds that only add to the sleepy and mysterious atmosphere. One who finds the plot interesting may also face handful of diffirent creatures, each with their own stories and/or optional tasks that may make traveling through the world easier. I would also note the great fairy companion Cilia, her intelligence and cynicism really brought a few smiles for me.If you like slower platforming games and exploration, pick it up, it can come with some pretty big discounts during sales, there should be a demo somewhere on the internet, not much of a free roam but shows some of the gameplay to test.Edit: Actually I think it's one of my favourite games ever, while Knytt Stories are endless, Underground is huge and complete, and I'm happy to have 100% completed it. If Nifflas decides to make the same type of game, but expand it to the point where I could zoom and scroll through the map, and it would stretch so far that it would require me to plan entire travels, because of how ""open-world-rpgy"" long they would take- then that's the game that I could take on a deserted island. It's just that entrancing to play it for me.			"

												Knytt Underground is a truly wonderful platformer.It has some really nice and smartly designed platforming mechanics. For most of the game you can switch to a ball at will, which has its own style of gameplay seperate from your normal self. And this interaction between the two generates some truly fun, if at times frustrating, platforming challenges.There are 3 main chapters to the game, there are also side areas, which are even more challenging however all of them are hidden and you have to discover them for yourself. The first two chapters are more like introductions to the gameplay and the story. The third chapter is where everything takes off and you find a truly massive game underneath (for a platformer).It's just a shame that it's so badly let down by its last third (not the third chapter itself, only the last part of it), the platforming becomes a chore, and the pay off in the end, storywise, is virtually non existant.In the end speaking as someone who doesn't really enjoy platformers, especially sidescrolling ones, all that much I'd take this as a glowing endorsment to anyone who is into platformers.7 ½ / 10			"

												Great at first, then pointless, then just plain terrible!This game was great throughout the entire game, only having a downside of too many ""pointeless"" quests. But once you reach the ending? WOW! What a piece of crap it turns out to be! It has one of the WORST endings I have EVER witnessed for a video game! And it was done delibirately by the developer! (as there is tons of extra ""secret"" stuff that could have been cut out FOR A PROPER ENDING!). And the many secrets of this game are so utterly pointless, there is really no reward for suffering trying to find/complete them.But hey, if you are one of those people who like to play games just for the arcade aspect of them, and not for the plot, then you'll enjoy this game! I felt totally dissappointed after having spent over 30 hours to get through it!			"

Knytt Underground is a puzzle-Metroidvania with lovely scenery and plenty of secrets to find.  You play as a sprite who turns into a bouncy ball.  Some of the bouncing puzzles are a bit frustrating, but you usually won't get sent too far back if you mess up.  Your sprite form can climb walls and has better control than the ball, but can't jump as high.Controls are rebindable.  It uses an ""up to jump"" control scheme, which might take some getting used to, but it actually works to the game's benefit, as you can jump to a wall and immediately start climbing.The main menu is a playable area.  To pick a chapter, move onto it and press the action button.  Look closely and you can also find easter eggs and bonus levels.  Even outside of the main game there is much to explore.If an exploration focused puzzle-platformer sounds like your kind of game, Knytt Underground will make a fine addition to your library.  Absolutely worth considering.			"

												Good platforming, and the game runs very smoothly. But the story serves no purpose besides trying to be humerous, which in turn ruins the atmosphere.  NPCs are also useless, would have been more apropriate to add deposits or holders for items in the world (i.e. making 2 holders for the candelabras, and the door would open after they were placed.) All in all fun to play, but would have been better served with a few design changes.			"

												My feelings on this one are a bit mixed, and in general I will give a recommendation to an indie game I have mixed feelings about. There are a lot of ideas here, but I think the story-telling in particular didn't work out.  The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up.  Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.  The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones.  The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all.  So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space.  This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated.  Because one of the characters is a lesbian?  I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive.			"

												Knytt Underground absorbs you into a beautiful world. The music is atmospheric and changes according to your location. There's striking and interesting scenery wherever you go, and the intricate maze of platforming puzzles fits naturally in these mysterious and serene environments.This game would be much better if there was no dialog. With rare exception, the humor is uncomfortable and embarrassing and the dramatic parts are offensive somehow. However, the often-preachy and confused writing can be ignored for the most part, as this is predominantly an excellent exploration puzzle platformer with only a nod to story.I'd recommend a gamepad. Some parts expect quick reactions and precise timing where activating abilities mid-air is vital. There are a few puzzles involving the somewhat erratic bouncing physics which are frustrating, but when your character dies, you just restart at the last safe spot you were standing, so there's not much tedious repetition.

												I've played all of Niffas' games. Within a Deep Forest, Knytt, Knytt Stories, a bunch of Knytt stories community modules, Saira, and Nightsky. This...this is not a fun game. I wanted to like it, but frankly it's just as disappointing as I found Nightsky.There are two main problems. First, the -mood- of the game is terrible. Yes, it's called ""Underground"", but the art style and background style is far far too gloomy. The aesthetics are just a huge turn-off. The background images tend to be real images or 3d rendered images that seem completely out of place. The terrain is simply all black. The color palette for the entire game is a poorly chosen collection of neons and gray hues, clashing with the cartoonish style. It's just all terrible.Second, the gameplay isn't any good. The dev has had 5 games to polish it up, but the new mechanics introduced like switches and really inaccurate swinging are more annoying than fun. Add to that the focus on 'new things' means there's little focus on making good classic Knytt platforming and the game suffers for it. All in all, a big fat Do Not Recommend.			"

												Although I have appreciated many of Nifflas' previous games, including the previous game in this series, Knytt Stories, I cannot recommend this game because it lacks one thing: heart. While retaining similar mechanics to previous games (running, jumping, exploration and fetch quests), the games adds in a lot more characters and dialogue making it a somewhat ""chatty"" experience. But the dialogue is tacky. It feels like something I would think was cool in middle school, and if I was trying to write something in a second language. The scenery consists of photoshopped fruits and hardware that feels tacked on, like early 90's CG in action movies. The story is juvenile and plodding. The game forces is episodic, and each episode ends up with you retracing places you've been before, but rather than being part of the exploration or platforming it's just something that makes you run back and forth.These games are all about the atmosphere and solid mechanics as you explore an otherwise featureless world for vaguely defined reasons. The formula didn't work so well in this incarnation. To sum up: cringe-worthy characters and dialogue, passionless art, less-interesting level design than previous fare. Only for hardcore Nifflas fans, or if you're really bored, I guess.			"

												Bought this game on the humble store, plugged in my controller, but it did not work in this game to my surprise. Looked on the forums, the developer suggests joy2key. Took me about an hour to configure this program, since he provided no tutorial or profile. Turns out you have to set the threshold for analog input to about 50% in joy2key and you have to show all axes otherwise your triggers won't work. Way too difficult and cumbersome for an average consumer.So now, if I want to play this game with a controller, I first have to start joy2key, then the game and afterwards, don't forget to quit joy2key otherwise it will mess with other games.The developer says that it was too difficult to implement controller support or something like that. But then I found out that this game is available for the PS3 as well.			"

												Knytt Underground is a more evolved amped up edition of the classic Knytt gameplay. Playing the original Knytt felt like a sweet regular nintendo game with way better sound.Knytt Underground feels like if the franchise just came to Super Nintendo as it significantly sets the bar higher than the previous game. Everything is improved and worth paying for. Years ago, I played Knytt which was a free platformer game from some guy i never heard of. He or someone provided a level editor and pretty soon, I was playing dozens and dozens of fan mods (essentially the same game concept but with different locations, music, puzzles and enemies and some pretty infuriating gameplay mechanics)What drew me into Knytt and kept me coming back was the great feeling of size and scope. The sound design was always brilliant. Wonderful ambient music (which is some of my favorite kind of music) no voice acting (good thing) , satisfying sounds of scuttling along, jumping, crawling up walls, splashing into water, ect. You feel like a little beetle bug just trying to get somewhere. Generally Knytt games revolved around a very bare bones narrative story, just simply enforcing the idea you had to get somewhere. Sometimes the motive was silly, sometimes it was supposed to be serious. Depending on which map you got, you might have a giant maze world full of keys you have to collect to advance, like a typical metroidvania, and/or was simply set up in a way that required abilities to be found and progress. Sometimes it was both.never did the game hold your hand. It generally pointed you to go ""left"" and that's all the instructions you usually got. Figure it out on your own. Knytt Underground is all of this, still. But its better. the new gameplay mechanics immediately feel welcome and a great add on to an already winning formula ! The only criticism I have for Knytt Underground is the art style of the ""sprites"" (as in, the characters who identify as sprites, little magical beings). I don't mean the pixelated sprite that represents a game character in a 2D pixelated game. In action, the sprites look fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing.however, the points where the game pauses for dialog with a NPC are where I have issues. The original Knytt, if I recall correctly, didn't do this. Character's 1 line or so of dialog would simply display as you walked near them and the dialog disappeared when you got a certain distance away. Now the dialog is initiated by pressing a button, which is fine ! No problem with this. The problem is the hideous enlarged profile portrait of a sprite when you are talking to it (or when your sprite character is talking).Suddenly all that beautiful art style you were enjoying gets shattered by the worst looking MS PAINT quality blotches of color I've ever seen in a game. (ok, i've probably seen worse but the point is these are completely out of place).I wish they either re-did these to look smaller (as the larger presentation is what reveals how crappy they look) or simply use their head instead of the whole body. Because they simply look awful. I do not like.Other than that, I pretty much covered it all ! Watch some gameplay vids of the original Knytt to see what i'm talking about.  A great experience. I recommend.			"

												The controls are very loose, its pretty diffcult to control. I constantly feel like my charcter is on an ice slick. Mix this with virtually no hook and no explnation of where you are and why you are doing anything, it's a pretty frustrating start. Very diffcult to get in to.			"

												A fun game for a while but loses it's flair after the second chapter. It's pretty much a constant back and forth through the map quest. Irritating platforming that just did hold my interest. The story was not interesting to me and got to were I was just skipping through dialog cause I didn't care anymore.The game can be beat in a good amount of time as the first two levels are short. The third is the lengthy one and is were I decided to just give up. My interest in games has changed over the years I tend to find some games I would have loved before boring and not worth finishing,In my opinion I wouldn't recommend this to any friends. Some may love it as the reviews show but for me it's a no.			"

												I bought this game figuring it would be a sequel or some game similiar to the original Knytt, which is a game I love dearly for it's minimalist exploring nature. The original is a game I use as a golden standard for what I am looking for in an exploration/adventure game. This is nothing like that. Sure there is sidescrolling. But so much is different I'd almost wager this game wasn't even made by the same person(s) as the original.			"

												Pretty backgrounds, terrible animations and simple gameplay. That's what Knytt Underground is all about. As far as I can tell, at least. Thank God I got this game in a bundle because it simply isn't worth €9. It's cute, in a way, but running around collecting useless stuff for NPCs so that I can enter new areas feels like a chore. Other games manage to pull it off in a way that it somehow can still be enjoyed. I'm sorry to say that Knytt just isn't one of those games.I'm not saying you should avoid it, but at least wait for a sale before getting this.[Rating: 69/100]			"

												When you do get to the end, you're probably going to want to come back to the beginning - or at least the beginning of third chapter. Knytt Underground is a more conspicuously narrative-driven sequel to Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, and puts the platforming mechanics of each (climbing and bouncing, respectively) to good use. Those two mechanics are most of what you'll be doing in this game - besides gawking, since the art and soundtrack are absolutely lovely - and honestly it's a lot of fun just to get around. The game world's vast, once you get into it, and if you want to take it all in, you can easily spend upwards of twenty hours just exploring its labyrinthine and visually stunning caves, tunnels, and underwater labs. It's paced a bit slow for a metroidvania adventure - Knytt Underground is about exploration, with very few enemies and a lot of map. But it's the world design, not the enemies, that make this game what it is, and the environments will make you work out how to get from A to B in some very clever ways. There are caverns and side challenges that require you to string together perfectly timed mid-air button presses, secret rooms (over 500 of them in addition to the 1,440 that appear on the map) and a huge variety to the places you'll visit that makes discovering a new area feel exciting. What a game! Knytt Underground brings together the knuckle-biting platforming challenges with an endearing and memorable landscape, introspective dialogue, really genuinely fantastic sound design, and over three and a half hours of gorgeous background music. Don't miss the music, it's really great.			"

												+ Tons of exploration, I loved exploring each and every little corner of this world. Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map. + Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots. + Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design. + Very simple but fun, tight mechanics. ~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.- Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27"" monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history. Get this game, especially when it's on sale.!			"

												This game took me very much by surprise. It's a treat. There is so much to explore, so many secrets to uncover! And it really is fun to explore the entire world. I never got bored with the wide variety of different environments there are. The ambience, visuals, jumps, secret finding, avoiding laser beams, and such combine for a very memorable experience.My only complaint is that the story is rather pretentious at times and somewhat unsatisfying in the end.But I still had a blast and was not ready for it to be over when I finished.

												My first introduction to Nifflas' games was 'Within a Deep Forest' followed shortly by 'Knytt.' Both titles provided fantastic exploration, with a stunning sense of place delivered by a low key asthetic. Platforming was thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, without ever being unfair, although that is not to say it wasn't occasionally frustrating.Knytt Underground continues the pattern set in these earlier games. In my mind its the first of Nifflas' premium games to recapture the charm of the simple graphics of the earlier games, while maintaining the visual richness of more recent titles. The metroidvania style progression has been tuned back, in favour of a couple of tutorial chapters and a few obviously gated sections. Initially I was  a bit disapointed by the change, but the satisfaction of returning to a challenge and beating it at a later date, because you were better, not your character, is immensely satisfying.I was a bit concerned after finishing the first couple of chapters so quicky, but the third chapter is sprawling, with tucked away non-critical path challenges to keep even the hardcore happy. There's a bit more written narrative going on here than in other Nifflas games, but it's pleasingly well written, and primarily acts to frame the fetch-quests, while fleshing out your fairy companions.

												Gameplay: Atmospheric exploration combined with clever-feeling, hard but not frustrating platformingContent: A game world spreading over more than 1500 screens, with beautiful background art and wonderful music. A few hidden easter eggs as achievements.Interface Design: This very simple game doesn't need a lot. Controls are arrow keys and A/S, you also have a map and item screen for informational purposes.Sounds: Nice, relaxing but upbeat, atmospheric music. Especially of note in this game are the very carefully designed and excellent foot step and ball bouncing sound effects.Visuals: Very small characters give a lot of importance to the surrounding environment. The walls are simple black blocks so it's easy to tell foreground from background.Style: Quirky dialogue with some tongue-in-cheek humor. Moments of discovery and sometimes being creeped out.Annoyances: Towards the end game, walking through a lot of already-explored areas becomes tedious and time-consuming.Value: The game is already fairly priced at 7$, and a complete no-brainer when it goes on even a mild discount sale, if you like the genre that is.Replayability: You'll get more or less 25 hours of exploration out of this game, after that, not much more.

												Fantastic platform-action-adventure game, one of the best in its genre. Despite Knytt's apparent simplicity and narrow gameplay possibilities (well, you're bouncing ball or girl who is fantastic climber), game brings lots of fun. What is more, gameplay isn't the most amazing part of this game. Actually, I wasn't expecting such good plot in this game at the beginning, but Dora and Cillia talk about really important things in life of every one of us, also society of Knytt shows some real world problems. Another good thing is that there are TONS of hidden places, which contain items and sometimes Steam achievements. In fact, to unlock any achievement you have to be extremely lucky or find a good achievement guide, as I did.Anyway, this game is really awesome and anyone who likes platform games will love this one too.

												Barring the fact that this game cemented the style that Nifflas apparently refuses to stop using, I was pretty enamored with Knytt Underground. With past experience playing both Knytt and NightSky, you could be forgiven for saying that KU is something of a midway point between the two, with the sprite design of the former and background and atmosphere of the latter.The controls take a bit of getting used to, but are eventually smooth and fluid and make for a lot of moments that make the player feel like a badass. There is a bit of flab in the plot, and I eventually defaulted to skipping the majority of the dialogue, but there's something innately satisfying about exploring, pulling off jumping puzzles, and finding all the little nooks and crannies in the map that would otherwise go unexplored. The tone isn't too light-hearted but also(thankfully) doesn't feel the need to take itself seriously, and the background design has this amazing, almost Pikmin-esque quality to it that looks incredible.EDIT: I wrote this review right as I was beginning to explore the full map that's revealed to the player a fair bit into the game. I will say that the map is kind of ridiculously huge, and the fetchquests get way, way too numerous to care about or keep track of. Also, something I failed to mention in the beginning is that the sprites look pretty odd, and it doesn't seem to be a stylistic choice. In-game character sprites all have this very weird look to them that makes it hard to take any serious moments seriously.HOWEVER. Everything I already said still stays true. Satisfying mechanics, beautiful backgrounds and atmosphere. Buy it anyway despite its occasional flabbiness.			"

												This is easily my favorite video game (I'm a casual gamer). I am most impressed by the unification of the narrative, graphic design, and soundtrack--it all meshes as a Gesammtkunstwerk. I highly recommend downloading the free soundtrack (approx. 4 hours of music) if you like glitchy, atmospheric electronica (this has become my go-to work soundtrack; I do a lot of writing, and it's a great, unobtrusive soundtrack). The Knytt world is pretty vast with tons of caverns to explore. Even though I've completed the game (by paying the gatekeepers before the bells--I'm working on doing it by circumventing them), I continue to play for a bit in the evening simply because I find the combination of the visuals and the music so relaxing. If you enjoy puzzle/platformers, and you appreciate artistry in your games, this is most highly recommended.			"

												This is no Knytt Stories. If you haven't played Knytt Stories play that for sure (it's free). At first I thought this was going to be short and pretty boring. It turns out Chapter 1 and 2 might as well be tutorial levels. The game opens up on Chapter 3 and will take you quite a while to play through. It's essentially a game of exploration. You never unlock new abilities or powers, and mostly you will be collecting items to open doors (although you can get around many of them if you are clever).The game has a huge world so expect a lot of backtracking. There is a fast travel system if you want but it also involves exploring. Expect lots of secrets and to be rewarded for exploring. A lot of people have complained about the ending and I understand. It's pretty anti-climactic, so don't expect some incredible revelation.All in all, a definitely good game worthy of your time. Nifflas, if you are reading this, I love your games. One gripe, up should not be jump! Have a dedicated jump key distinct from up please!			"

												I love this game.  It is the sort of thing that you can play for ten or fifteen minutes and feel like you accomplished something, or intend to play for an hour and find yourself still playing after four.The ball mechanics are as close to perfect as you can find in a game.  Importantly, there is some ability for course correction mid-air, so you are not bound to just ricocheting around based only on your bounce.  And the transformation mechanic lets you move in ways that neither the sprite nor the ball could alone.The core of the game is exploration.  Puzzles are usually “how do I get there from here?” and typically aren’t more than four or six rooms.  They are spread about often enough to be interesting, yet sparse enough that at no time does it feel like you just completed a difficult challenge only to be rewarded with a harder one, and in fact almost always do reward you.  The rewards vary from inventory items (which may be quest related) to story exposition, and sometimes earthquakes that open up new paths elsewhere.Death is mostly non-punishing, typically at most it resets you to the last safe position you were in, which is usually in the room you are currently in.  If you collected an item just before dying, it does not reset the item.  That said, you do have to then make it to a save point to keep the progress after leaving the game.Mi, the character, is mute.  When you have a conversation with an NPC, you can choose if you want your friends Dora or Cilla to answer for you.  Dora is generally going to give an optimistic or positive answer, while Cilla tends to be cynical if not mean.  But they can and will also surprise you.While I very much enjoyed this game, the experience was certainly heightened by having played the developer’s previous games, which are not currently available on Steam.  I think it stands alone well, however there are many references to several other games (including ones for both Knytts and the Ball) that were very cool for those in the know.As much as a third of the game’s rooms are hidden off-map.  Some are short or long challenges or even just “easter eggs” accessible from secret paths accessible from the chapter select area - hidden in secret tunnels.Also please note the rating!  Cila in particular can be quite vulgar, and both of the fairies have histories that might be surprising and a bit colorful.  I do recomend this game! "

												I already was a fan of Nifflas' knytt games, so I purchased this one. It's definitely worth the money.The game is first of all visually impressive - just as expected. Sometimes I wonder a bit if the experience wouldn't have been even better if the ground wasn't all black, throughout the whole world. One gets used to it, but the other knytt games had colored background, which looked a bit more friendly. However, it may be that black is a good choice to clearly differentiate between the background scenery and the ground you're walking on.Storywise, well, forget the story. It is really not necessary. Surprisingly, this game is much more about characters than about story - something I didn't expect. There are *lots* of NPCs to talk to, and almost every one of them has an own story and personality. What impressed me most is that once you reach the third chapter, you don't have any red line to follow, so you get the dialogues between the two main (talking) characters in some random order depending on which places you visit in which order. But although there are some main themes repeatedly exploited in the dialogue, it never gets messed up if you change the order. As for the dialogue itself, it's really excellently crafted and highly intelligent.While you're exploring the - really vast - world, you'll also explore the protagonists and the history of this world. Most games are about story advancement (and sometimes character advancement), but this one is purely about exploration. There's so much to discover you'll hardly remember an area you already visited. The game also features quite some subtle humor if you pay attention.And did I mention the soundtrack yet? It's awesome.Now, nothing is perfect. I'll flag the following comments as spoiler although it really is just a very mild one.One thing I don't like about this game is that it's breaking the forth wall. Having the protagonists talk to the author talking steals away some of the atmosphere. But this only happens rarely, so it's forgivable. Another thing is that one does not get to know the main protagonist much. We do get to know something about her family, but almost nothing about herself. I know that this is a usual technique to make the player identify himself with the protagonist, but in this world where everyone else has a story, it's really strange that the protagonist lacks one. We don't even know whether she actually cannot speak or just doesn't want to.Oh, and the super secret challenges section is really, really, really nasty.<rant>Just one last side note: I really cannot understand why this game got an M rating by the ESRB. Is critical thinking forbidden for teens in the USA? Yeah, it may be offensive if you're some fundamentalist, but seriously, why should such people dictate which games are appropriate for teens? Here in Germany, it's approved for age 12 and up.</rant>			"

Actually, I wasn't expecting such good plot in this game at the beginning, but Dora and Cillia talk about really important things in life of every one of us, also society of Knytt shows some real world problems. Another good thing is that there are TONS of hidden places, which contain items and sometimes Steam achievements. In fact, to unlock any achievement you have to be extremely lucky or find a good achievement guide, as I did.Anyway, this game is really awesome and anyone who likes platform games will love this one too.

												This game is one of the best 2D platformers that has ever existed. It's got great mechanics and clever puzzle design. Moving around has this unique fluidity to it. The levels are made so the player has a lot of freedom to explore but there are enough obstacles to challenge them. Also the world building in this game is so great I actually want to live in this game. Hooray for not-cardboard-cutout NPCs and gorgeous graphics!			"

												I just came over this little gem of a game. The graphics and sounds are good, and the platforming feels amazingly fluid, there's a lot of it there too, after 4 hours now, I probably have explored less than 2/3 of the map. The story is good, and brings a smile on my face, a really good game for unwinding. I'm also happy that it's a game where it's mostly you as a player against the environment, and not so much monster, a really solid game, and well worth getting.			"

												When you do get to the end, you're probably going to want to come back to the beginning - or at least the beginning of third chapter. Knytt Underground is a more conspicuously narrative-driven sequel to Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, and puts the platforming mechanics of each (climbing and bouncing, respectively) to good use. Those two mechanics are most of what you'll be doing in this game - besides gawking, since the art and soundtrack are absolutely lovely - and honestly it's a lot of fun just to get around. The game world's vast, once you get into it, and if you want to take it all in, you can easily spend upwards of twenty hours just exploring its labyrinthine and visually stunning caves, tunnels, and underwater labs. It's paced a bit slow for a metroidvania adventure - Knytt Underground is about exploration, with very few enemies and a lot of map. But it's the world design, not the enemies, that make this game what it is, and the environments will make you work out how to get from A to B in some very clever ways. There are caverns and side challenges that require you to string together perfectly timed mid-air button presses, secret rooms (over 500 of them in addition to the 1,440 that appear on the map) and a huge variety to the places you'll visit that makes discovering a new area feel exciting. What a game! Knytt Underground brings together the knuckle-biting platforming challenges with an endearing and memorable landscape, introspective dialogue, really genuinely fantastic sound design, and over three and a half hours of gorgeous background music. Don't miss the music, it's really great.			"

												My first introduction to Nifflas' games was 'Within a Deep Forest' followed shortly by 'Knytt.' Both titles provided fantastic exploration, with a stunning sense of place delivered by a low key asthetic. Platforming was thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, without ever being unfair, although that is not to say it wasn't occasionally frustrating.Knytt Underground continues the pattern set in these earlier games. In my mind its the first of Nifflas' premium games to recapture the charm of the simple graphics of the earlier games, while maintaining the visual richness of more recent titles. The metroidvania style progression has been tuned back, in favour of a couple of tutorial chapters and a few obviously gated sections. Initially I was  a bit disapointed by the change, but the satisfaction of returning to a challenge and beating it at a later date, because you were better, not your character, is immensely satisfying.I was a bit concerned after finishing the first couple of chapters so quicky, but the third chapter is sprawling, with tucked away non-critical path challenges to keep even the hardcore happy. There's a bit more written narrative going on here than in other Nifflas games, but it's pleasingly well written, and primarily acts to frame the fetch-quests, while fleshing out your fairy companions.

												A really unique platformer. I love to just run around exploring in beautiful and fascinating environments without any hectic. It´s perfect as a stress reliever but it´s not unchallenging, so it doesn´t get boring. Also it´s really great to know that there are optional secrets everywhere, so if you feel like exploring a bit more than usual, there is always something to find.The story is rather lush, but it´s much more about the people you meet, rather than saving the world. All of them have their own little story and it´s refreshing to get to know their world view instead of just saving their day and be done with it. To round it up it has a nice soundtrack.I recommend this game for everyone who likes platformers and for hard working casuals, because it´s great to come back to this game every now and then, explore some more and relax.

												+ Tons of exploration, I loved exploring each and every little corner of this world. Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map. + Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots. + Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design. + Very simple but fun, tight mechanics. ~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.- Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27"" monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history. Get this game, especially when it's on sale.!			"

												A great exploration game. The OST is fantastic, the best ambient soundtrack for a game I can think of. The map is huge and waiting to be explored, but not to the point of being impossible or overwhelming. The scenic visuals are beautiful silhouettes with colored backgrounds.The characters leave a lot to be desired. Their artstyles are very unflattering, and the dialogue in the game feels very low quality. If it wasn't for them, this game would be perfect.The game combines the Knytt series with Within a Deep Forest, while at the same time changing the upgrade-based gameplay of each. Instead, it begins as linear, having you learn both forms of basic gameplay, then combines them into one for the bulk of the game. The only powerups are area-specific, which is both good and bad.

												in many ways, for me, a therapeutic, spiritual - i think the word ""zenlike"" is used in the description and it's apt. gorgeous, soothing visuals and soundtrack; tight controls; puzzle platforming ranging from easily doable to devastatingly brutal, but always cleverly and fairly designed; a story that's partly just a bunch of tropes and jokes but sneakily filled with subtle moments of heart and bittersweet character development. the open world is massive (beyond the first two chapters, which function as tutorials) and a pleasure to explore, full of small side quests, collectibles, and secrets beyond the main quest, all of which you can finish at your leisure and as quickly or methodically as you like. very little content is gated once you enter the true game in the third chapter; you're free to take off in any direction you see fit and are really only held back by how well you understand the game's physics and control of your character.it's not for everyone - some would call it empty, but i would say it's anything but... look, i know it makes me pretentiously indie, but it's one of my favorite games. there's something simultaneously ethereal and human about it that i've never felt in a game before or since. if that makes sense and appeals to you, this is a game for you.

												Knytt Underground is an atmospheric exploration platformer with a huge world, great soundtrack and fun mechanics. However its story and characters have their unexpected quirks which may put you off, while late-game can get tedious with lengthy backtracking.This game has left me with very mixed feelings, but my overall enjoyment still outweighs the frustrations and disappointments. For the measely $5 there's plenty of quality content even if you ignore the main story.THE GOOD: FANTASTIC PLATFORMING.If there's something Nifflas is good at - it's creating fun, responsive and challenging platforming with great stage design and interesting mechanics to go with it. HUGE WORLD.1440 unique rooms in the main story alone, not even including indoor areas or any of the extra content. That's impressive. Admittedly, many of them offer nothing beyond a pretty scenery, but plenty of others provide fun challenges and secrets to spice up your quest. ATMOSPHERE.Game's massive world is filled with distinct areas and landmarks, surrounded in pretty glowing colors and over 100 tracks of fitting music. All this combines into an overall serene, beautiful and mysterious feeling. Just getting from point A to point B can be a very zen experience. EXTRA CONTENT.Main story is actually only about two-thirds of the content. Another big chunk is stashed inside all sorts of hidden areas, even in the main menu and credits. Extra content includes short story levels, silly stuff, rhythm-platforming, easter eggs, and pure rock-hard challenges.THE BAD:  HUGE WORLD.The world is perhaps too big for its own good. Backtracking gets dull after a while and game's ""fast travel"" system is so contrived and inconvenient that it's often easier to just walk. Many areas are there just for the scenery, which some of you will find atmospheric while others will see it as boring filler. CHARACTERS & WRITING.The biggest shocker for me. I was expecting a weird fairy tale, akin to Nifflas' other games. Instead I got angsty teen drama complete with swearing, daddy issues, ""it's complicated"" relationships and more. While there is some interesting character development, the characters themselves act like they're from a completely different game.This and this screenshot sum it up (spoiler free). STORY & QUESTS.The game pushes the idea that ""it's not about the destination - it's about the journey"", and it shows. Story and quests are simplistic and not really something to get excited about. The real ""story"" is exploring the world and learning about its inhabitants by completing their little errands, and just enjoying the exploration. Don't get your hopes up for the big reveal - that's not what the ""journey"" is about and the game will make sure to remind you. (tip: if you're underwhelmed by the ending - one of the bonus levels does offer some closure).Also the game never explains where the ball character came from, what it is, or what's its purpose. Even other characters don't seem to notice its presense. If you played Nifflas' other game - ""Within a Deep Forest"" - you'll know a bit about the ball's past, but present and future still remain a mystery. "

												I feel conflicted about this game - I wish there was a ""neutral"" feedback option. I certainly enjoyed many aspects of the game, such as most of the design elements, as well as the soundtrack. However, I feel that there are also some issues that need to be pointed out here. First, the game is too long for what it is. While I do appreciate the designer’s efforts to create the large and diverse map, the gameplay does not really benefit from it. By the time I was about 75% through the game, I was already bored with it, to the extent that I almost didn't even have the motivation to finish the game. Second, the ball physics are rather frustrating. The ball is difficult to control with any degree of accuracy, and in many tasks that involve using the ball you basically have to rely on a serious dose of luck in order to get through. Which brings me to the third, and most important point. In many of game's puzzles, the solution can be fairly obvious. However, you then have to spend a significant amount of time repeating the same action numerous times, until you get everything lined up to the millimetre and the timing to the second, exactly as the developer intended - or else it won’t work, and you'd have to try again. This type of challenges is just not particularly interesting to me, as they are in no way intellectually stimulating. In fact, they are not fun or entertaining, but rather frustrating and annoying. Also worth mentioning is that in some areas of the map the soundtrack is bugged by various crackling and popping noises - I guess some of the soundtrack files might be corrupted.  The ending is also kind of a letdown, to the extent that the developer himself admits it. Personally I expected that there might be another puzzle after the last bell, possibly involving the giant clock in the area right above it. But no - the ending is kind of abrupt, and basically  it leaves you with the sensation that something is missing - some kind of definitive conclusion, one way or the other. It is obvious that the dev left it that way on purpose, but what can I say - philosophy and entertainment don't mix particularly well. Anyway, the game is not perfect, but despite its flaws it would be difficult not to recommend it. Most of the artwork in the game is beautiful, and creates a special atmosphere that is worth experiencing. Chances are, you will enjoy it, at least up to a point. Pick it up when on sale, and you won't regret it.			"
