												TLR is well known as Core Design's swansong. That one last good title they made before releasing the godawful Chronicles and Angel of Darkness. Tomb Raider the Last Revelation takes place in one singular location rather than different parts of the world. While that might seem like a downside, the design team actually implemented it very well. The game gradually branches out and becomes heavily non-linear. With the player returning to prior maps to solve newly found puzzles. They also added a map editor, and since the 90s hundreds of maps have been published onlineAdd to that a great story that keeps your attention and genuinely challenging puzzles. Delight yourself to the Last Revelation, ultimately the last great Tomb Raider game.			"

												There aren't many adults that don't know about Tomb Raider. TRIV (when compared to TRIII) has advanced lighting effects (volumetric FX, bump mapping), better texture filtration and a new UI. The game is slightly less linear, since at some points you can travel between the levels (almost like open world, eh?) back and forth, the game has 70 secrets (there's no reward for getting all of them, but you get good rewards for each one of them). This time the story focuses on Egypt, where Lara unwillingly sets god Set free. Will you help her to save the world? Also the game has a standalone bonus level called ""Times exlusive"" which you can download for free. There's also a widescreen patch that allows you to play in 16:9 and other aspect ratios. You can get it at http://agent077.ho.ua/In a perfect world this should be played after finishing:- Tomb Raider (I)- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business- Tomb Raider II- Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask- Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft- Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artifact			"

												Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation continues the adventures of Lara Croft. After a tutorial with young Ms. Croft, we find Lara and a guide exploring the Tomb of Seth in Egypt, looking for the Amulet of Horus. The plot revolves around Egyptian Gods, Pyramids, ancient artifacts of power, and actual tomb raiding! The previous 2 sequels to TR1 WERE enjoyable but TR IV is the one that really gets back to its roots. This game is all about exploring Egypt's tombs and ruins. Lara visits the Temple of Karnak, the Tomb of Semerkhet, the Temple of Isis, and Cleopatra's Palaces - to name a few places. And don't think she's just raiding. The Last Revelation has a very interesting and intense story.Controls: Same as TR 1-3Graphics: Definite improvement over 3Music: All new Egyptian-themed music for IVDifferences from TR 1-3: There is a LOT to explore. Instead of completing an area and moving onto the next, you'll often have to revisit areas - moving back and forth to complete puzzles and solve Egypt's mysteries.     I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan so it goes without saying that I'm recommending this. However, even if you're not familiar with any of the older TRs, if you're an action/adventure fan or interested in exploring ancient Egypt, I believe you'll really enjoy this.			"

												If there's one thing I can say about The Last Revelation, it's that it surprised me greatly. I'd be lying if I said that my expectations weren't low for the fourth entry into the immortal Tomb Raider series. No Croft Manor? No Judith Gibbins as the voice actress for Lara? No inventory ring? No musical score by the awesome Nathan McCree? No locking Winston in the freezer? All these charming little things from the previous games that up and left with The Last Revelation had me thinking that I would be quite disappointed with Core Design's next foray into the adventures of Indiana Jane and the Breasts of Enormity. It's not often that I like being proven wrong, but I can happily say that The Last Revelation surpassed my expectations and proved why I can't keep myself away from this excellent series.While it is sad to see the previously mentioned elements missing from this installment, the gameplay itself is still the stellar, straight-forward and damn fun formula players have grown accustomed to in the last three games. Lara returns with all her previous manouvres, and a few new ones to boot, including rope-swinging, shimmying around corners and pole-climbing. Nothing groundbreaking, but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Last Revelation has seemingly taken a few pages from Resident Evil's book. There's a largely increased emphasis on puzzles and riddles, some of which are quite complex. This is a well thought out departure from Tomb Raiders 1-3, in which pretty much every puzzle boiled down to ""find keys to open this door so you can open that door to get that key to pull this switch"". You can also now combine certain items and vision-based items such as binoculars and scopes are frequently used. Some weapons also have multiple ammo types which is a lovely added touch.The Last Revelation is also the most accessible game in the series since the first. I loved the slow but steady learning curve of the original release, and I found it irritating that in the second and third games, Core went kind of ballistic with the difficulty, throwing all kinds of cheap deaths here and there and ruining the pace accordingly. The Last Revelation is quite easy compared to its predecessors, but thankfully the challenge once again builds up as you get used to controlling Lara once again. Later on in the game, you gain access to hub-like levels and backtracking between areas adding some welcome open-world and exploration elements. Fans may be disappointed with the reduced difficulty though, and I find this understandable. Secrets are a cinch to find, and there's so many items jam-packed into Lara's tiny backback, I'm surprised she can even stand up, let alone monkey swing, drop-hang onto a crevice, crawl, 180, backflip mid-air, catch a rope, swing back and forth, jump pistols akimbo slaying infernal bats, sprint and dive-roll inbetween rotating circular blades.The game is also fantastically long. The earlier entires opted for a smaller amount of levels, but these levels were insanely large and sometimes overly complex. This time, due to their reduced size and the addition of backtracking, combined with the ever-changing environments leads to a far less boring and cumbersome experience.Apart from the first two levels in Cambodia, which serve as a tutorial, the entire game takes place in Egypt. The Tomb Raider series is well known for its varied locations, with Lara often globetrotting to retrieve her beloved artifacts, but even with only one major set-piece, the game never gets boring. The choice to have a single primary location for the setting helps keep the game more cohesive, and it makes the plot flow together much easier. Yes, the story is still not Pulitzer Prize worthy, but it's entertaining and far more involving than the previous games. It's great to have an antagonist who has some sort of depth and character.Peter Connelly is no Nathan McCree, but he does a pretty swell job on the soundtrack. As long as we still have some form of the original theme, I'm content. Jonell Elliott also provides a great voice for Lara, although I did prefer her more mature tone that Judith Gibbins provided in previous installments. The Tomb Raider engine is showing its age at this point, but Core continues with its stellar level design and intelligent workarounds to ensure that levels remain unblocky, despite the engine's limitations. FMV sequences are heavily improved from past entires, but the animations are still kind of robotic.What else can I say? I was so pleasantly surprised with The Last Revelation, and I think you will be too. Tomb Raider 2 and 3 felt more like expansion packs, but The Last Revelation is truly the sequel to the original masterpiece. Core has basically perfected their formula at this point, and I can only hope that Tomb Raider: Chronicles follows suit. It's definitely the best since the original, and I would even go as far to say that it surpasses it.4.5/5			"

												Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation was the best TR game in my opinion. Why? Because it was a Tomb Raider game since the first one that was actuall about exploring tombs and fighting monsters (With a little appearence of bad guys). That said, let's go to the topics:Graphics: Pretty good for a 1999 game, actually. Texture variation is not so present because ambient is also not. That's because you will be put in on closed spaces more than open ones. Pyramids, temples and hidden tombs will be more seen than anything else. But the presentation of these places are actually nice, it doesn't get repetitive and you always know when a place is new or not.Gameplay: Picking up the style from the other TR games, it remained the same with a few additions. Lara can now jump into ropes, walk in them and best of all: DRIVE VEHICLES! That was a nice little adition, tough i din't find the vehicles gameplay so pleasurable for me. At least at a long time ago. For me, now isn't that bad. It's pretty ok.Gunplay feels the same from other games and doging from enemies still feels impossible, tough, as in other games, exploring is the key too fill up with medkits and ammo. Not much problem here.Puzzles are back and were the main focus of the game. You will waste more time on puzzles than killing enemies. They are complex, but not hard to do.Remember when i said i couldn't remember if the secrets followed the same pattern as TR 5? Yeah, it follows. Global statistics for secrets, no statistics per stage. And this game is HUGE, it is a big flaw to make harder to find the secrets in this game. At least, you don't win anything by finding it all, besides new weapons/items on your gameplay. Exploration is the key, once again.Soundtrack: More or less. Most of the time you will only hear ambient sounds. But when music plays, it always match with what's happening and feels like an epic adventure. Voice acting is quite decent and Lara's voice is sweet.Story: Here was the big point of this game. The plot tried to explore a bit of Lara's past at the beggining and tried to connect to the actual story that was happening. It went pretty well and many things have been done. A lot of effort was put in the Seth and Horus backstory and as more as you explore, more content is revealed. The game goes roughly for a lot of time because of this. It all went you...Until the ending. The boss battle felt so empty for me and the ending itself was quite sad and a cliffhanger.TR 4 was the best game of the franchishe for me and it was pleasurable to play. The focus on the adventure more than action served this game well for me and it made an unique experience.If devs that are doing the new Tomb Raider were to see a game where they could see what they SHOULD do with the series style of play, it should be this one.

												10 out of 10Tomb Raider The Last Revelation is my favourite Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider 4 like the others has slightly enhanced graphics and sounds, but Lara’s mansion is not in TR4 instead you have a slight boring and non-skippable tutorial level. Lara doesn’t change her outfit this time around, but it does make TR4 feel like a complete game. The whole game is Set in Egypt she is on another gun blazing adventure.When Lara is exploring Egypt she discovers a lost temple and unwittingly unleashes an evil and power full curse across the land. Lara is going to need all her skills to stop Set and save to world from certain doom, do you have what it takes.			"

												First think that this game is 17 years old. Then play. This game is one of the best games ever made. It has a great story, good graphics & gameplay for that time and awesome levels. The reason I give this a 10/10 is because that game changed my life, I play this when I was very young, and now still like it. I keep thinking about the long great levels, the complicated story with names I couldn't announce then,... it's one of the best Tomb Raider game ever made.			"

												This is definitely my favourite Tomb Raider game to date - it's classic Lara, with some of the most fiendish puzzles in the series and an awesome storyline to bring it all together. The introduction of linked levels that you can travel back and forth through at your leisure brings a totally new dimension to the game, and although it can start to feel a little long-winded towards the end, it's entirely worth it to be able to see all the gorgeous levels and experience the story. As long as you're prepared for a little frustration when it comes to a few puzzles, this game is Lara's best.			"

												First of all this game is good. You get everything you'd expect from Tomb Raider game (unless you're looking for next-gen graphics).I loved some of the new mechanics and new puzzles.By the way puzzles are even more complex sometimes (at least for me) and I could not figure out how to solve some of them so I resorted to some walkthroughs. And what makes it even more time consuming is that the game lets you to 2-3 levels and you can go back. And sometimes you will need to go back because you didn't find some item. Which can be frustrating sometimes. And some puzzle elements are not as apparent as in previous games.Other than that I really enjoyed the game but I would have liked it more if there was more shooting in the game.So if you are a fan of Tomb Raider pick this one up and have a good time.

												Can you put the controls under the ""Oh my god. I want to die!"" category? Sure. But after a while you kinda get the hang of it, especially if you change the controls a little bit (Just press P and enter the ""config controls"", press Enter to reset the action you want, then press the new key to that command). It won't be perfect, but will be good enough. Sure, there will be times when you'll want to pull your hair out of rage, but since those also happened when I played on the Playstation, then perhaps it's just my inability to be a good gamer after all these years. Oh, also, the graphics are not as good as in the platform. So why do I still recommend this game? Because is f*ing Tomb Raider and since I don't plan on buying a Playstation anytime soon, this is will do. Especially since I payed really cheap for them, don't pay full price, you'll feel cheated. But still, it was really nice to meet trusted Lara Croft after all these years.			"

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider IV had the best story comparin to the previous I, II, III ones. It had improvements, more items added to the puzzles such as corner climbing, doors, boxes, smaller size moving objects, trapdoors, scope aiming and so on and on. It does sound good but in a way it ruined the gameplay for me a little. I had to run over and over  and over again the same places (maps were bigger than in previous games), which left me so lost on what am I supposed to do. I had to use the walkthrough so many times and after finding out that I did try doing that and it did not work out for me (little wrong aiming or standing did not trigger it) I just lost the mood to play it. Sometimes where were some small unnoticiable target you had to aim and shoot, that was pretty much blendining in with the surroundings or had no glue where I have to go do get more progress, which stole so much time and ruined the gameplay. So I played the game on and off for a month while other ones I played through within few days. Graphics did improve, I guess... but not so impressively. But yeah, the story was really really good, it was well built up. It kept me intrested in what was going to happen next. So they nailed that. Plus ended with a scene that left me with questions and it seems the next game is going to continue from it. At least I hope so.Cutscenes were great. There was no house, which was sad. Item menu, or just the menu got worse... In my opinion. The idea of putting everything together made it so time consuming looking for med kit and then save, load or what ever I was looking for. Had to spin through the whole circle to get to the item I was looking for. I prefered the previous one more with up and down options.Tomb Raider IV did not have steam overlay either, no screenshots option to share in Steam. *sadface*I mostly recommend it to old school gamers and to the newest Tomb Raiders fans(to experience where it all got started from).My total gameplay took 37 hours! Like I said had to run back and forward. Because I had no idea what I had to do. At least  8 hours went for just running around like a headless chicken. :DOtherwize game was good, worth the buy.xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												When it comes to the exciting outings of Lara, Core Design's 'The Last Revelation' is, for me, the pinnacle of the Tomb Raider series.As a fresh return to the series' roots, the fourth game focuses more on high adventure and exciting exploration, sending the player on an epic journey across ancient locations in Egypt to resolve a prophecy that spans millennia. Gone are gloomy London skylines and secret military installations of the previous two games. Instead of diving into underwater bases, Lara will delve into ancient tombs and mysterious ruins. You'll search for archaic artifacts instead of keycards, dodging devious traps and whirling blades, instead of laser wires and auto-turrets. The game still has plenty of frenetic gunplay, with new weapons, ammo choices and smarter enemies. But exploration and puzzles take centre stage here.The atmosphere is fantastic. You'll feel isolated as you tiptoe through dark corridors, treading where no foot as stepped for centuries. The graphics are a step up, but the sound makes the most impact. Musical cues still feature, but for the most part you'll hear nothing but your own footsteps, the wind rolling through passageways, and the occasional crumble of stones somewhere in the distance. Exploration has never been so exciting or tense!The game is well balanced. Tomb Raider 3 often had me wandering aimlessly around, not  sure where to go; Levels were completed almost by accident. Here, everything makes sense: You'll always know the item you need to proceed - even if you don't know where it is. The puzzles are challenging, but never tedious trial and error. A great feat, considering puzzles can span multiple levels and require multiple items. You'll rarely find yourself backtracking simply to see if you missed a hidden switch or obscure item.Overall, the game provides the series' best adventure. It gets the important parts right, and brings enough fresh features to keep the series interesting. Highly recommended. "

												20 years ago, Core Design presented us with Tomb Raider for the PC, Playstation and SEGA Saturn, featuring Lara Croft who become a very iconic character in the gaming community. In the following two years, Tomb Raider II: Starring Lara Croft and Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft for the PC and Playstation. The PC also had expansions for these three games, which were released the same time each game was released. Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business, Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask and Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artifact. Which unfortunately aren't on Steam.  sad face :'c Anyway. In 1999, Core Design presented us this time with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, the 4th installment in the series. Which for many, felt like a whole new adventure back to what Tomb Raider is all about.Now for starters with this game, the first thing we can see is that even the menus were changed. Instead of that sort of item wheel we had in the first trilogy, we have something more simple. Which actually, I don't think it's really something that should be talked about like with too much detail. Except that probably for some, it makes the navigation simpler. But anyway, let's talk about the actual game.Now Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is set before and at the same time, after Tomb Raider III. The game starts with a young Lara tagging along with Werner Von Croy, an archeologist she admired a lot when she was young and requested to tag along with him in an expedition to Cambodia. And this is pretty much the tutorial for the game. Unfortunately here, you don't get to visit Lara's huge mansion and stuff. And I have no idea if Core Design ever planned on including her home as a tutorial level or not. But anyway. Unfortunately, this expedition doesn't end well and Lara's the only one to make it out of the Angkor Wat ruins.A few years later, she decides to locate and enter the tomb of the egyptian god Set, to recover an artifact from there. However, she ends up releasing the evil god accidentally the moment she takes the artifact from Set's tomb. And it's up to Lara to undo this mistake in a race against time, in order to prevent Set from returning and spreading chaos and destruction through the world.Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation returned with new and smoother graphics, which can be noticed if you have played the previous three games. The objects and evironments now look less blocky.As for the gameplay, it hasn't changed much. You are now able to shimmy around corners, which you couldn't do in Tomb Raider III. The sprinting ability is back and this time you don't need to wait until the sprint gauge is fully refilled to use it. Something that is new to the game for example is that you can now do rope swinging, in order to reach a few areas in some levels.Some levels in the game also require backtracking in order to complete particular parts of the game. Which sort of gives some areas of the game the feeling that you're exploring one huge place with all sorts of tombs and other areas connected to each other. The game introduces new weapons and brings back a few old ones. Aside from the good old pistols, shotgun and uzis, the game brings back the grenade gun and introduces two new guns. The revolver and the crossbow. And these two weapons have something new to them, which is an attachable/detachable lasersight. Some weapons in the game this time like the shotgun, the grenade launcher and the crossbow have different types of ammunition, too. And the inventory also has a new system which allows you to combine items to make new ones, which is very important for a few puzzles in the game.The game of course, has its down sides. Although I've never encountered anything major, there are glitches that can be exploited for shortcuts. The game, like previous titles, also has secrets but this time, they don't really reward you with anything. They are useful pickups but you don't really unlock a bonus level nor you'll start the game with all weapons and infinite ammo, like how it used to be with previous games. So going after the game's 70 secrets is completely up to you. I personally think it's not worth it. I only find those I come across. And as for Windows 10 users, you'll probably have a little issue with the game's window. As it won't start in fullscreen, no matter what screen resolution you choose. But luckily there's a post on the Steam forums about a patch to fix that. I don't have the link at the moment, but you can find it easily. And it definitely fixes the issue, running the game in fullscreen.But even so, it's time for the final score. And honestly... I personally give this game a 9/10. I think it's well deserved. It's a great return to the series's roots and it's some darn good 30 hours, cuz the game REALLY IS that long. This is so far one of the longest games in the franchise. At least the classic franchise.Like how I did with Tomb Raider III, I highly recommend you getting this game. It's worth your money and worth your time! Whether you're new to the series or have been around since the classic titles were released. If you're looking for a good old game with good puzzles and some good action, this is a game you'll want to try. :D			"

												Tomb Raider IV expands mostly on the exploration and puzzle solving elements of the previous games without much of a focus on combat. many of the gameplay elements of the community didn’t like with the previous instalments were changed or removed making tomb raider IV the best instalment in the series as the next two instalments, Chronicles and Angel Of Darkness were substantially worse.ExplorationUnlike the previous games tomb raider IV takes place in a singular location, primarily set in Egypt with the two tutorial levels being set in Cambodia years prior to the events of Lara’s adventures in Egypt.The game forces players to explore in a nonlinear approach as the map and puzzles will involve traveling back and forth through different load zones; the game executes this well as it rarely becomes monotonous to traverse the game world.PuzzlesThe puzzles in this instalment are more complex with some puzzles taking place over multiple game load zones. In addition the game puzzles require much more thought to complete than the previous games find key to lock approach to puzzle solving.In addition to solving the puzzle on of the large puzzle rooms, the game will also require the player to explore the game world to find parts in order to complete the puzzle giving the player a break from trying to solve a puzzle section of the game. Tomb raider 4 manages all its gameplay well as the mix between exploration, puzzle solving and combat.CombatCombat in this game is good with vastly different enemies types kitted with different weapons and with different weaknesses which makes the combat fresh and exciting throughout the game, unlike previous games the game does not have as much of a focus on combat as the previous games with exploration not being constantly interrupted with combat. The games difficulty is very balanced by providing a slow and steady difficulty curve throughout the game.Core design perfected their formula for the tomb raider series for this instalment making this my favourite game in one of my favourite gaming franchises. Tomb raider IV Is without a shadow of a doubt the best video game I have ever played, after returning to it many years later the game still holds up.			"

												I didn't enjoy my time with this one as much as the first three in the series. There's no big reason for that really, just a lot of little ones. If I had to pick the main thing I didn't like about The Last Revelation it would have to be that the puzzles are extremely difficult because of the backtracking you have to do through multiple levels. Since they're all connected now and not sectioned off it makes the levels incredibly huge. If you miss something and you don't know what it is you could be stuck for hours going through the level trying to figure out what it is. I just wasn't having fun when I was playing and it made me frustrated. And not in a ""This puzzle sure is hard, I'm gonna have fun trying to figure it out""-kind of way. But in the ""How was I supposed to know to do that?""-way. I had to use a walkthrough more times than I'd care to mention in this game in order to complete it.Other than that the lack of Lara's Home, unskippable (and sometimes unnecessary, like the ones showing you the level when you walk into it) cutscenes and an unusually gloomy mood in the final half of the game all came together to create an experience I didn't quite enjoy. You also can't press the view button when the camera shows you a cinematic angle in order to get the normal view back and that bothered me more than I thought it would. And who exactly had the bright idea to get rid of the item wheels and pool them all together into one large one with the health items and save icons as far away from each other as possible?But as a whole I think the game deserves a recommendation and the first half was quite enjoyable.

												This was by far one of my greatest memories on the Playstation. The atmosphere, the level design, and the overall feel of this game and all the secret tomb raiding really opened up my favorite part about gaming, the exploration. I played this pc version briefly for some nostalgia and it's all there. This game really had an amazing color palette that brought ancient tombs to life. Easily a top ten title for me when it came out back in the day.			"

												This game takes the series back to its roots. You're no longer traveling to all kinds of varied locations. You spend the entire game exploring Egyptian tombs.

												This is excellent. I'm a massive fan of Tomb Raider, I played every game in the series with my dad on the PS1 as they came out when I was a kid. I love them, they're my favourite games.The Last Revelation is easily the best in the series. However, this is a trainwreck of a port. It took me hours and hours of fiddling with it to get it working, not to mention the aspect ratio isn't designed for widescreen monitors and required me to download a fan-made patch to make it. Accordingly, I cannot reccommend this versionYou'd be better off just getting it on GOG or even the Playstation Store.			"

												Last Revelation is a sequal to the previous three Tomb Raider games which were the ""Classic Trilogy"", this one is known as the first part of the ""Von Croy Trilogy"" because they all have Werner Von Croy playing a part in each installment. Von Croy was Lara's mentor who taught her the methods of exploring ruins and tombs. This game excludes Croft manor as a visitable location for training. Instead the game offers a flashback of a teen Lara in a training level, exploring the roots of how she became the adventurer we know. This flashback also serves an importance to her present day adventure which takes place entirely in Egypt. In what is the longest Tomb Raider game play experience to go through. The game like the previous games has it's share of challenges, but still a worthy experience to go through. Lara Croft is more detailed in character design along with slight improvements in the details of the locations. With the variety of puzzles and a large number of enemies to deal with, will make this yet another good addition to any Tomb Raider fan.			"

Its a little confusing to fingure out the controls on a keyboard for me; however, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. I'm not sure if I can change the controls or not, but when I figure it out, I'm sure it would make it easier to play.			"

The events that lead up to the key and cliffhanger ending are among the most engaging of all the Tomb Raider games.

												Arguably the most confusing Tomb Raider game next to Angel of Darkness and I would argue that this is most likely correct. I've beaten the game in around 13 hours total according to save record. though I know the time same says 33 hours. Though I've been inactive on the game and been goofing around I would say at least 40% of the time but this is one of the games where you would definitely not regret having a walkthrough since the things to get can be missable and confusing. Plus a lot of backtracking is involved in this after midway into the game so you got to really be thorough and some controls are hard to aim with and time; and you'd be glad that you got unlimited saves to use. I beaten the previous three more faster than this. I saved at least 140 times in this while the previous games is mostly around 70 or lessIs the game worth it for any Tomb Raider fan?I definitely would say yes; This is possibly one of the dark tomb raiders where pretty scary parts or disturbing whenever it comes to certain parts and if you want a tomb raider that's: Puzzling, dark, lots of things to solve and collect then this game is fairly challenging in that respect. I'd give this game a 9/10. It has little bugs but they are not exactly that much noticeable so making spare saves might be a good idea.			"

												I may only have 7 hours in this game in Steam, but when I was a kid up until being about 15, I'd play this game on my wrecked PS2 every day when I came home. I think I must have completed it about 30 times.This game is my favourite game of all time. From the title screen music to the final boss fight, there isn't a moment that isn't amazing, challenging or just lovably goofy (read: The Guardian). The story is meh, but the level design and locations are just so, so great.I'm not sure if it's just childhood nostalgia, but I'd recommend this game to anyone anywhere. It's what got me into gaming, and years later I'm still enjoying it even though I know it back to front.Do yourself a favour and try this out. It's pretty cheap, so you're really getting your worth and then some.			"

												To all the Tomb Raider fans out there, I must apologise for my crass words, but to sum up this game as succinctly as possible: This Game is a Turd.Starting off very well, going back to the adventure roots of the original Tomb Raider, I was pleasantly delighted. Ok, other than Lara having a Makeover and some swanky new lighting affects, the graphics haven't changed much at all over the last four games, the Gameplay is still more or less the same use of awkward controls, but there is still a diamond in the rough here. I was having fun!And then came levels like Alexandria.Whoever says Tomb Raider has good level design is lying or mad... or likely both. It consists of the most random level plans, unexplained puzzles (that even after reading Tutorials make absolutely no sense whatsoever in the context of the time, the language, the culture).Sorting out the random hieroglyphics into the English alphabet, and then putting it into alphabetical order. But Why? Why in alphabetical order to start with? There is no hint given as to why, it just is... but even worse... our Alphabet came into being a couple of thousand years after this tomb was built! So these great people of Egypt, with their time travel machines, glimpsed into the future, saw our Alphabet, then amazingly decided to change all of their language and hieroglyphics to be matching one of our letters (which essentially means that the Egyptians wrote in English, but used pictures as representation for each letter... no Core, that is not how it is. That is truly terrible puzzle design.Ah hell, why bother trying to even explain it.This game feels like something a 11 year old would make today in his lunch break at school. It feels like one persons over exited child was in charge of building levels, while the entire rest of the staff worked on the CGI films, that for it's time were pretty steller, to tie in some nonsensical plot that is very much from a time where games were not story tellers... ah hell, but they tried.So the levels are random, convoluted, blocky horribleness that have actually gotten worse with every single iteration of the series. I can hear the games director's demands:""New engine? NAH! new gameplay ideas? NAH! what we need is, LONGER, MORE COMPLICATED BUG RIDDEN LEVELS THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH."" ... Genius.Talking of which, to all the fans who will  undoubtedly vote me down, how many of you completed this game without a walk-through? Yeah, I can hear the tumble weeds bouncing down the street too.The only person who ever completed this without help, was the person who wrote the official walkthrough... but even that's not true, as he had help from Core. If the standard user can not finish your game without a walkthrough, no matter how smart you are (as these puzzles have absolutely NOTHING to do with intelligence) then you game is broken. There is no arguing around that.There is a reason that the beloved Tomb Raider, PSX's best original series died (as it was) along with Core. Good riddance! 2/10 (and it only get's above a 1 because, well you know, Tomb Raider!)			"

												I reccomend this game to be torrented (along with tomb raider 1-5.. The original first five worth playing) because edios don't deserve pricing games that aren't optimized on a Pc system like the original was optimzed for old windows operating systems.♥♥♥♥ you edios i remember playing this one on my windows 98 and it ran smooth as butter no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t configuration window before i play.The cons of your configuration window is if someone launches this game in 32 bit texture mode (optimum res), the enemies can't be homed in on by lara to shoot at you have to manually shoot at everything which is frustrating as hell when your playing The lake level only to find you can't even shoot a croc crouching.Problem is i spent half the game playing it with no issues then all of a sudden i can't home in on enemies becausei tried a different res setting. Seriously WTF?Worst 8 bucks Us i ever spent. utter rip off. First thing im gonna do is pirate a version that doesen't make me have the 32/16 bit options for textures. get with the times edios no ones gonna run this on a windows 98 system anymore so make 32 bit 1980 x 1020 res default with 32 bit textures... get rid of that dreaded options menu that just creates so many ♥♥♥♥ing bugs and problems.

												This is the worst game I have ever played.  The controls are so bad.  Not worth a dollar.  If you do decide to play this game game anyways just remember to get across the vine you have to hold the sprint button when you jump on it.  Gives momentum to the vine.  Don't get this game get anything else!!!!  I was hoping this would be fun because i am a huge tomb raider fan but this disappointed.			"

												Tomb Raider is without a doubt brilliant, but I found it hard to figure out which keys would control my actions. I still cant figure out how to jump, in this game. Tomb Raider is not a good game, for the PC because its not meant for the PC! Don't waste your precious time and money buying this worthless game.			"

												This game is just as great as I remembered it to be. It's long, difficult, and there's pack tons of fun. I couldn't beat this as a kid, even with the walkthrough, so playing it this time around and beating the game for the first time was extremely rewarding. I did have to use the walkthrough sometimes during the game, there's a lot of hidden things you need to progress forward and even spending tons of time in one room I still couldn't find them, it even got ridiculous at some points! The game also was extremely glitchy every once in awhile which caused Laura to do some crazy things or even accidental death,. Personally I loved it and was incredibly amusing. I could have sworn there used to be more levels though, maybe they're extras or I'm thinking of a different TR.I give this game 10/10.			"

												Tomb Raider The Last Revelation one of the best games ever made back then, till this day, and will always be!!I enjoyed the long journey of this game, and I had so much fun with the puzzles and finding secrets.This is definitely the scariest Tomb Raider in the series, actually! I would consider it one of the scariest games ever, and by ''scary'' I dont mean the jump scare type of games. this is true horror where you can feel the solitude and the atmosphere in the tombs and the creepy sounds.I feel like this game didnt get the much attention it really deserved despite the fact of its big success...thats how good it is!!Yet, this isnt a perfect game, of course! there are bugs and some nonesense stuff, and there is the damn annoying tutorial, but without a doubt this is a unique game (sorry my english isnt perfect or good)  "

												Some of the most consistently well-designed levels in the series, taking a break from the ridiculously contrived settings in Tomb Raider III and II, and a more well-connected world map which changes the structure of the game make Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation a real treat to play. Pretty much all of the levels are connected, now, and with the addition of the need to backtrack, this game is structured quite differently, almost a bit like a metroidvania, albeit without the vertical elements. Add to that several good additions like shattering pots with your gun, or aiming down a gun's sights, and this game's probably, nostalgia aside, the best entry in the first 6 Tomb Raider games.			"

												I used to play this with my sister in the early 2000s. We never finished it back then, not until last year when I completed the Steam version - which is by far the best looking one. The atmosphere, the Egypt story and the old school platformer gameplay makes this arguably the best TR ever made. In some ways it's a scary game, you're alone and the focus is on exploring the environment, avoiding deadly traps while solving puzzles. If you thought the new TR was easy and too action oriented, I recommend playing this game. To put it another way; TR4 demonstrates an era of gaming when game developers made their games very challenging, a level of challenge that would trouble today's casual gamers, but definitely a very fun experience especially if you're a gamer from that era. 9/10			"

												I believe In hindsight that Tomb Raider II and III were missteps for the franchise. Eidos basically forced Core design to crank these games out on an annual basis and it shows.The first two sequels strayed too far from what made the original great. Tombs were replaced with modern architecture and wild animals with an over abundance of gun toting muscle men. Thankfully The Last Revelation gets the series back on track and feels to me like it should have been the second game rather than the fourth.Every ounce of the original Playstation's power was wrung in order to improve the graphics. If you compare the character model of Lara from the 1996 original to the one in Tomb Raider IV you will see a marked improvement. Modern locations like opera houses and submarine bases have been replaced for pyramids and tombs.The entire story takes place in one location this time (Egypt) and the experience feels all the batter for it.I'm quite disappointed that controlling Lara often feels like driving a bus still. The controls and lack of a free camera are infuriating. Nintendo cracked the basic formula for free camera with Super Mario 64 three years earlier, perhaps if Eidos had allowed Core more time between releases they could have created a new engine or at least improved upon the clunky fixed camera mechanisms for the original.I don't know who is leaving gun ammo and health packs in ancient tombs and vases  but it's a little rediculous. Couldn't a more realistic system have been designed at this point; it breaks the fantasy. Finally, this game's tutorial section fails to explain all of the new gameplay mechanisms so players may find themselves scratching their heads later on. For example, how was I supposed to know that binoculars have an infrared feature that when used can highlight hidden writing at certain points in the game when the tutorial never explained it to me and none of the previous games had this feature?Tomb Raider IV also allows the player to revisit previous levels. Great, but it also allows the player to leave a section without an item they will need to complete the game later on and then prevents them from returning. There is no warning, so make sure you have plenty of save files just in case!In conclusion, a good game, better than Tomb Raider II and III, but let down by, ironically, a lack of necessary handholding. 8/10 "

												I grew up playing Tomb Raider games, with Lara Croft being an awesome main character. However, after picking this title back up again, I'm left slightly disappointed.Without giving too much away, the story progresses wonderfully. I was expecting the same for the finale, but was given a lackluster conclusion.What this game does offer are unique puzzles that challenge even modern video games with their difficulty. If you've played the more recent Tomb Raiders, playing this will likely feel very different.Despite me being left sour with the ending, I still recommend this game. Beating it is an accomplishment (without a walkthrough!) I estime my actual play time being closer to 30 hours. I have a bad habit of leaving my games running.			"

												Tomb Raider IV The Last Revelation originally released 17 years ago, still an excellent game, except the old mode of operation and the keyboard settings which cannot be customized. So, please make sure to use a standard keyboard (laptop keyboards often do not have a numpad), otherwise you will lose a very important function -  ""Perspective (numpad 0)"" and almost impossible to finish the game. I bought it from Steam again after so many years, just because I miss its Egyptian scenes, puzzles, and tense story. Best game in 1999, my childhood memory.			"

Mean Mr. Mustard's short Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation review 1) Essential - buy it NOW 2) Recommended - buy it on sale 3) AvoidTime to complete – 23 hours to 100% (used a guide for some of the secrets as the game no longer tells you on a level-by-level basis how many you have)Played multiplayer? N/AWorth revisiting? Yes, I enjoy replaying the entire original TR series once every few years or soBest part – More classic TR gameplay, although with this entry the signs are starting to appear that the developers were starting to feel burnt out. Still, well worth playing.Worst part – Needs some tweaking on modern systems to get it working properly (for all required patches see: http://tombraiders.net/stella/downloads/TR4files.html)			"

												I have mixed feelings about TR4, but overall I think its an improvement on the earlier games.In this there is a very marked improvement in the graphics, most noticeably on Lara, who is no longer a series of disjointed cubes and polygons. On top of this there are more varied environemtns, with less of a 'blocky' feel to them. Also, playing these games on a modern computer, TR4 is the first one where there haven't been any major problems while playing the FMV cutscenes. The game still has some issues playing at higher resolutions, but that is only to be expected.In addition to this, there is an improvement in the storytelling, I find. This game is the first where everything seems to follow a logical storyline, and the use of fmv and in-level cutscenes does a good job of telling this. Rather than jumping everywhere around the world, you stay in Egypt, which I feel gives the game more of a chance to build up the story than the previosu ones, which jumped about a lot.One down side to this game is that it has a lot fo the two things which I like the least about tomb raider games: Vehicles and Backtracking. If you've played a TR game before, you know how bad the vehicles are. Clunky and terrible, but you need to them to progress the level. The back tracking isn't too bad in this game, so I guess that's more a matter of personal preference.The controls are not said to support xbox controllers, but it actually is possible to use one without resorting to a third-party tool, although you need to manually configure it, and it only seems to support one analog stick.All in all, if you are new to TR and want to play one of the earlier TR games, I think this would be a good one to play.

												Now this game feels more like a sequel than an expansion. At it's core, Tomb Raider 4 it's still the same game as the first three, but the additions are enough to call it a sequel. The graphics are greatly improved. The level design created both huge and small, contained levels. And while there's still plenty of tombs and exploration, this game has actual puzzles to solve. It is definitely for me the best of the classic Tomb Raider games. If you could only pick one, this is it.			"

Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation is one of the small handful of games that I grew up with. It's one of my favourite titles to this day, and I'm glad that the Steam version is exactly how I remember.It's a fantastic little game, packed with secrets and puzzles. CORE added a bunch of neat new mechanics since Tomb Raider III, like the ability to climb around corners and combine certain items into something better. There are very few bad things I have to say about TR:TLR - my biggest complaint is that sometimes, the voice-acting is a little stiff and strange. But, it's not horrendous. I like the general feel and atmosphere of the game, the exploration and interlinked levels.Overall, I enjoy this game very much.			"

												The 4th game in the Tomb Raider series.First of all: This game is gigantic! It took me  over around 20 hours to complete the game, and that was without counting in the many times I died. So a big game is a plus, but it is not a very easy game to complete.The graphics of Lara Croft / Tomb Raider is now starting to look much better than in the previous game. She got the right curves, and she actually looks more sexy than the previosu game. Dat♥♥♥♥♥ If you have played through the 3 previous games you have seen Lara having a kinda square body.Graphically the game is alot better looking than the previous ones. It doesn't look ugly anymore, and the sound/music is as good as you can get it aswell!The progression in the game is something I felt was really slow at some point. You sit there thinking how in the hell are you gonna get past that place, even if you know where you are going. At some point in the game it was just pure dumb luck that got me past one of the REALLY weird ways to get further. I was like ""WTF! How are people gonna guess that?""Some things were also really hard, when I ran out of med kits, and I had to load multiple times to getting past a point with like 1-2% hp left! Also I realized later some weird bugs, where the small medkits didn't go into my bags, so I had to use the big ones in emergencies!Anyway! Game was pretty good, but really long and sometimes really hard! Graphically looks better than the 3 first, and the developers have created really interesting and variated levels.Go play it! You will like it...if you got the patience :P!I tried my best to not use a walkthrough, and I did that all through the game until I realised I missed an item. This was around one of the very last levels, and I realised that to get that item was too hard to guess. So that is litterary the only time I used help, and I am proud to have made it so far without any help (2nd last level)!			"
