												One of my absolute favorite games. It's quite a challenging game, especially until you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where pretty much everything is trying to kill you. You've got to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself, all while trying to pay attention to the environment (weather) and the fullness of your stomach. The developers also seem to be constantly updating the game and adding huge amounts of awesome content for free. It just keeps expanding and you just keep wanting to play again and again. Highly recommended!October 2014 Edit: Multiplayer is coming to Don't Starve! It's currently in closed beta at the moment, but should be coming along eventually!			"

												Don't Starve is one of the games I will never forget!I'm sure you ask yourself why? Let me explain:When I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like ,,Why?I should have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on. Pretty fast updates with new content to explore and even merchandise. It's a tip for everyone who like survival games. You will love it.Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 10/10I hope you enjoyed my review.If yes press the like button :§D			"

												Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. Every single time you start a new game file, it's an entirely random generated world where nothing is the same as the last. You can play this game for weeks and still not discover all its secrets. It's a sandbox strategy game that keeps you on your toes for anything and everything that's trying to kill you. And believe me, there's a hundred and one monsters who all want your face on a platter. GAME TIPS:1. Always have a means to make fire. Always.2. Pigs are your friends. Build your base near them.3. Spiders are not.4. BEWARE THE BEES. 5. Beefalo herds are awesome. Fill your pockets with their endless poo. Great fire fuel.6. Prepare for periodic hound attacks. Make spears and tooth traps.7. Pick flowers. 8. Not starving is the LEAST of your worries.			"

												This survival rougelike is excellent. You are trapped in a cruel, randomly-generated world where everything wants to kill you, and left to fend for yourself in the wilderness. You will start off with nothing, collecting supplies to make a fire and survive your first night. The goal is simple -- survive for as long as possible.The randomness of the world generation keeps it fresh for every playthrough. There are countless ways to die, ranging from freezing to death to getting mauled by a tentacle. Once you die, you will be forced to start anew, which can be frustrating.I seriously love this game, and it really is worth picking up. You should also pick up the DLC which adds a lot more challenge to the game. This game is EXTREMELY addicting.			"

												You desperately fend off Eldritch horrors manifested by your own insanity while you turn your fallen friends' remains into a colossal bat made out of ham and run from a giant badger who shares a fondness for your dead compatriots. The sun begins to set, counting down the seconds before you are struck blind, tethered to a flickering light with the terrors of the night. Forests are mowed down behind you as the beast pursues.You dive into a sinkhole that dumps you into a pitch black cavern where you are promptly mauled by a horde of spiders and rabbit-people. You scream in terror as the light from above grows fainter, the rabid shrieking of gigantic insects growing louder and louder.10/10, extremely relaxing game.			"

												Don’t Starve starts off slow and punishing and continues to get even harder as you play. Its merciless difficulty coupled with its monotonous gameplay can leave some players feeling frustrated and bored. Those who enjoy a good challenge, however, will relish in the satisfaction they’ll get when they manage to outlive their previous record or clear the game’s evil Adventure mode. It may not be for everyone, but if you’re looking for a roguelike game filled with charm and challenge, be sure not to miss Don’t Starve.			"

												This game is fantastic.It combines roguelike and survival gameplay, dumping you in a strange territory to explore, forage, learn, craft and progress on your own terms. For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.The game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.Don't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)If you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.There are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.A warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this. So, yeah. Irony.			"

												Boy Scouts should be required to play Don't Starve before going on any camping trips – they could even get a badge for it, in the form of a gaping, pointy-toothed wormhole. Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look.

												Don’t Starve tries its best to be a haunting challenge, with a Tim Burton art style. It does a good job. The core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms. As far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete. Don't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive. Don’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle. The in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.Don't starve does lots of things right. The art style and sound design is amazing for this gameThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.The clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses. The Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.The many varieties of food make the game more interestingThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it. The antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a whileThe different playable characters are fantastic The game has a customizable world setting.The game has playing cardsDon't starve does a few thing wrong.The cave mechanic is hardly explored until late gameThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixedThe follower mechanic should be touched upThe vanilla game can be a tad boringThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.The game lacks achievementsThe game lacks vanilla co-opDon’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it. "

												Updated now to include the massive lot of new content and Klei's commitment to the game -So. Tim Burton designs minecraft, this is what it would look like. That's the quick version. The not so quick version involves you attempting to survive in a world which is pretty much entirely out to kill you (even the trees will try to kill you...), having been dumped there by a mysterious character called Maxwell. It is down to you to, as with many Minecraft games, start from the ground up by collecting flint and twigs, and putting together rudimentary tools, before hacking down trees and mining rocks for the more advanced stuff. As your toolset grows, so do your options, and thankfully, so does your diet choices (berries work for a while, but there's nothing like cooked rabbit).The game now has a fair bit of lore and background to it, and with the addition of caves, and sub areas, now has a more ""exploratory"" feel on top. Combined with the Steam Workshop, a slew of unlockable characters, and a soundtrack which I seriously suggest everyone who picks up the game -also- collects, results in an outstanding offering that will appeal to survivalists and minecrafters alike.

												It’s a pity that Tim Burton hasn’t been involved in video games: both his visual style and his storytelling abilities would be welcome additions to our industry. Thankfully, niche approaches to style can find a welcome home in today’s indie market, and the folks down at Klei entertainment have turned that particular style onto the video game scene in their new 2-D open world survival title Don’t Starve. It’s a refreshing and unique entry into the genre, one that puts extra emphasis on the ‘surviving’, and that’s sure to give players a welcome challenge.The goal in Don’t Starve is simple and straightforward (hint: read the title). The player takes control of a forlorn, classically British-looking protagonist, and although there is only one default starter character, other playable characters with potentially useful abilities unlock as the game progresses. When you start in the world, you’ve got only your bare hands to work with. There’s no tree-punching, thank goodness, but you’ll need to start off by hunting down some flint and sticks so you can fashion yourself an axe. Your first priorities are simply to acquire fire (which you must have to survive a night) and food (which, as it turns out, delays starvation). As luck would have it, it’s not enough to simply peg down a steady source of calories; if you’re not careful, you can also be killed in the conventional manner, in other words, by being ravenously eaten, poisoned, or pecked to death by some of Mother Nature’s wonders. There are also some native inhabitants, better armed and armored than you, who are probably best avoided. As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more danger that feels just a tad artificial: your character starts to go insane without having new things to think about (aka, crafting new items or gathering pleasant items). This provides an impetus to keep you gathering harder-to-find materials, and although this seems like a bit of a poor man’s way of encouraging you to explore and ‘techify’, the crafting is fun enough that it stands on its own two feet. Generally you’ll be quite happy to spend time gathering special items just because you want to, say, build yourself a suit of armor, or a new kind of animal trap. There are even cute hats to make that have the added bonus of keeping your sanity up.If all of this sounds like an open-world creativity journey, think again. Don’t Starve does give you several nice options for survival. For example, your food sources can come from scavenging, farming, hunting, or even cultivating your own bees. However, in the harsh climates that you’ll be fighting through, your options are usually so limited that you’ll need to focus all your efforts on whatever strategy is most likely to let you live another day. It’s not a game of fun and frolicking: you’ve got to fix your problems now, before they grow to big and doom you by your own stupidity.That’s all well and good for the basic ‘survive-and-thrive’ aspect of Don’t Starve, but there’s also a form of campaign in the guise of the Adventure Mode. Here, the player is placed into specially created worlds with particularly difficult settings: it might be extra cold, or extra dark, or the food might be extra hard to come by. Surviving in each world long enough to collect pieces of a McGuffin allow the player to progress to the next challenge, slowly uncovering a thin story as the adventure continues. It’s not a strong enough narrative to be an independent draw for most players, but gives a nice added challenge to the standard gameplay.From its title to its music, Don’t Starve does an excellent job of perfectly nailing a unique tone: it’s always a little dark, a little humorous, and a little self-conscious. The soundtrack is mostly made to mimic small-ensemble Victorian era motifs, the sort of thing that you would expect to hear in a haunted mansion movie. That said, it feels like there’s not enough of this high quality music to go around. The light-hearted morbidity of the game is even reflected in what characters you can play with: it’d be so easy to simply make the player a terribly frightened little girl or boy, crying for his or her mommy. Instead, the characters in the game gleefully watch trees burn and take pleasure in slaughtering whatever cute furry animals they can find. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world, and your character loves every minute of it. But the best part about the game is that the environment itself practically has a character. Nature isn’t just a harsh environment: it’s out to get you. Chop up too many trees, or wring the necks of too many fluffy bunnies, and you might find yourself facing some particularly vengeful avatars of the outdoors.The worldbuilding in Don’t Starve is a special treat, and is quite possibly the most enjoyable aspect of the game. The scenery and enemies are given a dark, edgy sketch style that looks a bit like a flannelgraph or felt puppet show. Birds and critters all have their distinctive hoots and whistles, and even the trees quiver when they grow new leaves (which, appropriately, happens in a sudden ‘pop’). Genre-wise, Don’t Starve sits nicely in that sweet spot of gothic aesthetics, partway between simple turn-of-the-century technology and homespun magic.Comparisons between Don’t Starve and Minecraft are inevitable, but unfair. Don’t Starve isn’t nearly as open-ended: it’s more focused on the challenge of survival, and there’s very little call for customization at all in the game. All recipes are technically given to you in advance, although you may need to traverse a tech tree in order to gain access to them. The crafting in Don’t Starve is also more focused on utility - generally speaking you’ll be so busy trying desperately to build the weapons or shelter that you require, you won’t ever find yourself making something just for the fun of it. Instead of offering limitless exploration, Don’t Starve offers a particular feeling; that of being in a creepy, kooky horror story.With only a few biomes and enemy types currently implemented, the game as it is only carries a decent amount of material, and replay value is sadly limited. The sticking point here is that, like Minecraft, Don’t Starve promises continual updates (and cleverly posts the date of the next game addition on its main menu). This makes the purchase of Don’t Starve something of a gamble: maybe it will fill up to the brim with new content, maybe it won’t, and only time will tell.More so than in other genres of games, world building in survival games is important, because the world is your enemy. Just like every good heroic RPG needs a delicious villain to focus your conflict against, a good survival game needs to give the environment itself a personality. While most outdoor survival games do this by making the environment be something like an inviting, friendly host, Don’t Starve goes in the opposite direction by making the Mother Nature seem more like that weird cat lady who lives in the boarded-up house. It’s not so much an invitation to explore and enjoy yourself as it is a long list of dangers to avoid. Don’t pick fights with the locals. Don’t stay in one place for too long. Don’t ignore that growl you hear in the night. Oh, and just in case you forget... try not to starve.Highly Recommended "

												This game is so addictive, while trying not to starve on the game you may starve in real life, you won't sleep and you will go insane keeping your charactor alive. This should come with a health warning but the games name should be a reminder in itself, maybe add an ingame timer that saves the game and tells the player 'eat and go to bed' after they've been playing 20 hours.If you have lots of spare time this game is definitly worth it's money.

												Best. Game. Ever.I seriously cannot express how awesome this game is. Whether it be the overall gameplay, the lore, the deaths, the nomming, the insanity, or having your base burnt down because of one lightning strike in Spring, the game delivers on all of what it promises and more.Buy this game and you will not be disappointed.

												What is Don't Starve all about?Don't Starve is a survival horror game that drops the character in an open and fully explorable world filled with numerous monsters and many interactive objects. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game. J20Hawkz Personal OpinionI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve. Seasons, Days, InteractionsAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it. Weapons, Traps, Armour, FoodCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items. Explore a living worldNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish. Minor IssuesThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind. DeathDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost. Play alone or togetherDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow. FinallyAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.  I give this game a solid 85/100.Here is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve.

												Aside from ridiculously fun gameplay, Don't Starve's art style is eye-candy, reminiscing the feel of a Tim Burton movie adapted into a video game.Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand at the start. You pretty much figure out what to do by yourself. Oh look, that looks edible. And just like that, you could be dead.It's a trial and error game with a flair of adventure. You could stumble upon something very interesting or dangerous. You may have met your potential pigman allies. Tread carefully as the world of Don't Starve is perilous and unfriendly. Most importantly, don't starve!			"

Charmingly addictive // Recommended for survival gamers who don't want their hands held+ The longer one lives, the more XP is accumulated; characters are unlocked via XP, so unlocks can be obtained by those struggling to acclimate to the game, albeit not as quickly+ Boasts myriad environments and biomes, all of them offering a unique pallet of items and consumables+ Camera rotation is a godsend, and makes camp construction much less frustrating+ Permadeath offers a rousing incentive to succeed, particularly due to nighttime being so fatal+ Absolutely fantastic art style and animations+ Has an intricate, yet fairly intuitive, crafting system; this is greatly complemented by the mechanics of magic and scientific advancement+ Controls are practical and responsive; works very well with mouse and keyboard+ In addition to the hunger and health meters, the player must also consider the needs of the 'sanity' meter, adding further to the logistical challenge; sanity requirements can be satiated differently between the unlockable characters+ Worlds are all procedurally generated, making each experience into something refreshing and unique+ Sound design is nothing less than superb- Game can often lend itself to tedious frustrations, in large part due to the unforgiving environment and the fragile nature of the player's character- Crippling lack of a tutorial or beginner's handicaps; this will not appear as a negative to most enthusiasts of the genre, but less experienced survival gamers may find it off-puttingLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

The silent whisper of your demons, as you slowly go insane.The witty analysis of each character on their environment, showing how unique they are.The breathing you hear in your left ear, but cant see beyond the piercing dark.Dont Starve is a great game, with devs that listen to their players. Open mod support encourage the community to build the game they want to play. The addition of Dont Starve Together adds an almost primal need. Survive with your pack, feed them and fight with them - Survive. A hidden gem, a beautiful game.			"

												At around day 100+ I feel obligated to review this masterpiece of a game.Imagine you're stranded in a world which his only point is defeating you.Now imagine it's a video game. that's Don't Starve.You start in a world without any prior knowledge to what it contains, no idea on what to do, how to craft, how to eat food, how to survive.You roam around and pick up grass, saplings and flint without any target on your mind, doing it like you feel obligated toAfter a while of doing so, you hear a wild *DING* and a flashing bulb captures ontop of the crafting tab captures your eye.What could that be you possibly ask, as that is the tools tab.You continue your pointless journey by crafting your self a pickaxe and an axe, respectively.You start by getting some wood, maybe some stone if you're lucky and it's already night.Luckliy, another light bulb ontop of a campfire logo has captured your eye and you've got a campfire, just in time for the night.After the night has fallen, a new day had began. You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.After a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.After almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?And, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.You make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.After more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?Hounds.As you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.You started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.You craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.After roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.They work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.After looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.You have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.Now, there are two scenarios which can happen:1. Summer starts.You have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.Your house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.Okay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.Guess what?Dragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.Scenario 2:Winter starts.Great, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).A saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, ""That sounded big"".I'll let you guess what's going to happen next.Ofcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.You die.Again.And again.And again.And again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.You come across a sinkhole.I'll let you find out what's going to happen next.All in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.If you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.This game will always have a special place for me.

												EDIT: Well looks like wherever I got the multiplayer information from is wrong(?). I have to say the mutliplayer is very fun, however can get tedious with long sessions.Action packed adventure game. This is probably a more realistic approach to what surviving is really like but with an obvious cartoony visual. This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time. It has an absoultely huge variety of gameplay and things to do and explore.I would have to say the only two cons there are with this game are there is absolutely no chance of multiplayer (apparently something with the scripting idk) and that if you get ambushed by monsters, all your hard work will literally just disappear, aka sometimes its just too easy to die.9.2/10 definently my favourite indie game at the moment			"

												Don't starve is a game that really grew on me.It seemed very unforgiving at first, but when i learned my way around it, it felt very rewarding. Then, just then i realized how challenging this game really is. I felt like i really had accomplished something.It wasn't just delivered to me with flashy signs or arrows that indicated what i should do or when.And this is without saying how beautiful the art and the music are in this game, which is only a plus side to the amazing gameplay that was carefully crafted.Is it worth buying? Yeah, i don't know, can you handle being challenged to a frustration point? Because unless you took a look into the game's code, getting around the situations you will be put in, on the first attempt, will be extremely hard.And if you care so much about beating a game like i do, you will get mad.Personally, i feel like this game changed the way i see things, that the weird and bitter sometimes can become your biggest passion.

												Since I have no idea how to review this game, I am just going to tell a tale of one of my adventures.Please note, this was played on Reign of Giants 1st update.Day 1 through 7. Getting Started.I pick Wilson as my character and start my game. It dumps me in a birch tree biome full of Twigs, Grass, Berries, Carrots and Flint. So I walk around gather all that crap, cut down some trees gathered wood and acorns and made a fire and waited through the night. The next day comes and I start exploring. I come across a biome full of Boulders and Gold nuggets. So I make a Pickaxe and just start going through every Boulder getting Stone, Flint and Gold Nuggets. I did that all day. The next day comes and I went to search for Beefalo. Within the first 2 minutes I find beefalo. My reaction was “Yes! I can now get their poo and start a farm!” I then realise I got excited over poo... So I got a bunch of poo and found a decent spot to make my camp. The next day I cut down a ton of trees and made a lot of stone walls and marked my base. Once I had set my walls, I replaced the floor with wooden flooring. Then I placed my Science Machine, Alchemist Machine, Crock Pot, Drying rack, Lightning rod and made 3 improved farms. Everything was going great!. That was all in the first 7 days. A great start for me.Day 8 through 12. The Rise and Fall of Friendship.I go exploring looking for spider nests for webs and the Pig King for Gold Nuggets and Pig men to recruit for help. I take 4 steps up and boom! Forrest Biome full of spider nests! And right next to biome was the Pig village with the pig king. Having killed a few spiders on the way to finding the Pig king I had some monster meat. So I recruited 2 Pig men called (And I am not kidding you) Nacho and Libre. They helped me out killing spiders and getting webs and they also helped with cutting down trees. The next 4 days pretty much went like this. I got my webs, made the Bug Net, Bird Trap and Tent and then…something I was not expecting happened. You need to keep giving the Pigs meat for them to keep following you and I have been giving them Monster Meat that the Spiders dropped. Day 12 I give the Pig men Monster Meat for the fourth day and…they turned in to Werepigs… I had to kill them both. So at this point I go on the Don’t Starve Wiki to find out why this had happened. Turns out giving them 4 Monster Meat turns them in to Werepigs… R.I.P Nacho and Libre. Day 8-12. Day 13 through 21. Preparing for Winter.Sad. Having killed my fellow Pig friends, I continued on. I go to an unexplored area and I find something surprising! A skeleton with an Ice Box next to him. I smash the Ice Box, take the items and ran back to my camp and made an Ice Box. This made me very happy. Now I can now store food without them going bad in 3 days. This also gave me a purpose to go mine the Ice blocks since Ice never melts in an Ice Box. For pretty much day 14 to 21 I stocked right the up on food. Making several meals from the crock pot and stocking up on Berries and Carrots that I could find. Just before day 21 hits, while just looking around in a forest I find yet another skeleton and this time he had a Winter hat and a Breezy Vest. I had loads of food in the Ice Box I had the perfect clothes and a fully heated Thermal Stone and my beard was fully ready. Bring on winter!Day 21 through 31. Spelunking and Giant encounter.Winter arrives! Snow everywhere! PENGUINS! And trying not to freeze to death! Winter was a pretty slow and boring time. Can’t really go out much without freezing so I thought to myself “I’m going to go explore the caves!” Expecting it to be dark and full of bats, I prepared myself. As soon as I go down the cave there was yet another skeleton! This time he had a lantern and a chest full of this green slime. I thought “Great! This is will get me around the cave without using 50 torches” It didn’t stop the fact that the caves are terrifying! At first it was just a marsh biome with GIANT TENTICLES! trying to kill you. As soon as am out of that biome I enter this new looking place I haven’t seen before…and I encounter something that made me ♥♥♥♥ myself! Now keep this in mind, the cave is pitch black and you can only see with a lit source. In this case the lantern I found. The lantern does not light the entire screen. You can only see like 3 feet around you. I encounter ROCK LOBSTERS! Which are (As I find out later) these terrifying yet harmless mob. My first reaction was to turn around and run the ♥♥♥♥ out of the cave but I noticed they didn’t follow me. So I approached one and it did not attack me. I learn that you can befriend them by giving them stone. I befriended 1 and continuted. Then I encounter the 2nd most terrifying thing…GIANT BUNNYS! These big furry bunnies are also Harmless and you can befriend them by giving them…Carrots…I also continued on without them. From then on it was just Cave Spiders and Bats. Having explored most of the cave I decide to finally leave it. I resurface only to be attacked by 5 hounds. I don’t attack them. Instead I lure them all the way to the Pig Village and got the pigs to help me out! The hounds died with the cost of 1 Pig man….So I took the meat he dropped and dried it and made Jerky!Having not died in the cave and surviving the hounds I decide to just take these next few day’s slowly. Having planted a load of acorns outside my camp I cut down all the trees and made 3 pig houses just outside my camp. Just in case anything comes to attack me (Like a Giant perhaps). I decide to venture out to more unknown area and I encounter a strange bug, I encounter the Goose Moose in winter. It left me confused considering it is a spring giant. So what did I do? Recruited a bunch Pig men and killed it! And it was successful! I gathered the Meat it dropped and yet again headed home. But on my way over I got caught in the darkness and can to settle in the middle of nowhere. During the night I was attacked by like 6 bats. So during night I was just running around my fire like I was doing a rain dance.Day 32 through 54 The Quest for the Fire Staff and Leaving the World Behind Me.The snow has stopped. The rain continued. And I have literary no worries of dying anymore. I have all the food I need and I have my fellow pig Neighbours for protection. At this point I thought I had nothing else to do. So I wanted to start messing with magic! Luckily I found a bunch of collapsed rabbit holes so I caught 4 of them, made a Top Hat and then made the Prestihatitator. The first thing I made with it was the Meat Effigy which pretty much acts as an 2nd chance if you die with the cost of 20% of your total health. But what I really wanted to make was a Fire Staff. But first you needed a Shadow Manipulator. Which are not easy to make due to the fact you need 3 Living logs and 7 Nightmare Fuel. Getting the Nightmare Fuel was easy but getting the Living Logs was a quest in its self. After many days of searching I finally found a Living Tree and got it. Now with my Shadow Manipulator made I needed 1 red gem. So I found graveyard and started digging graves until I got one. Literary the 2nd grave had a red gem. So I was happy. I made my Fire Staff and it was total worth losing lots of my sanity! I burned Bees, Spiders and an ENTIRE FOREST!. So that was fun! and pretty much from then I had a daily life and I left it on day 54. During all of this I happened to find all 4 of the “thing” items to enter a new world. Having explored the entire world and not wanting to stay any longer, I head over to the “Wooden Thing” location. Knowing it is guarded by the Clockwork mobs I of course, yet again, had a pig army!. We made our way over, killed the mobs and I said goodbye to the world and my fellow Pig friends. I have yet to start the new world. The End.I love this game. 10/10			"

												Ever had a feeling of utter helplessness? An impending sense of dread? Well if you like pressure, Don't Starve is your game! A bundle of wicked all wrapped up in a funky little art style which we all know and love.+Like I stated before, these graphics are wonderful, they aren't next gen but they don't need to be. They are like old school Tim Burton and grab your eye like a sexually frustrated teenager grabs a breast; they make this game what it is.+The game balances a sanbox survival aspect with a real purpose which I won't spoil. In survival games I just feel as though I wander round aimlessly until I inevitably die, with Don't Starve I feel like I am really accomplishing something with every decision I make.+You get a ""keen sense of despair"". Like the game says, there really is fear aspect to this game. Every choice is crucial, fraught with unseen consequences. A choice you make 5 minutes into your run could make the difference 50 days in. There are countless terrible creatures out for your blood. One of the worst moments you can experience is in the dead of night as you are racked with pain as insanity takes over. You will hear a child's tune play like that from a Jack-in-a-box. Then you will see an evil shadow hand come to steal your fire and envelop you in darkness.+It's downright witty and fun.There are no negatives to Don't Starve: this is game at it's finest. -Developers open to suggestion, always adding new and exciting content.-A welcoming and inspiring community.-A game that challenges you to think but remains fun.

I had always been fond of it, but playing it was far better than I could have imagined.Don't Starve has won a very special place in my heart. So much that I even bothered with a review.One of my favourite titles of all time.Can't be  Recommended Highly Enough "

												If your a fan of games which don't hold your hand from the get go and are actually quite challenging to the extent that you will no doubt die multiple times during your time playing but which also reward skilled play and efficient micromanaging, then this is the game for you!Engaging, immersive and enjoyable experience. You will find yourself actively making mental notes on what to do the next day, stocking up on vegtatles for winter and scouting for animals to hunt to get loot which will accelerate you into the games not so obvious progression curve.Even once you have a fully established base with a constant supply of food and a surplus of anything, you will still end up dying to the natural environment. This game encourages you to be thinking on your feet and be ready for anything, whether that be an incomming wolf attack, or a surprise giant you are always on your toes. Thats what makes this game so unique, there is no time to be bored while playing because you always have something to do and it feels good once you accomplish it. If you are not a fan of busy work tasks then you will also like this game, there are no objectives set in the game, you essentially set your own path and every task you set isnt one you do for the sake of doing it - its because you need to to survive.Looking forward to the Shipwrecked patched, cannot wait to sink in (lol get it!) hours of fun into the new content to come. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes rewarding games. I was skeptical at first when I saw the graphics, then I realised how ignorant I was, the art fits the theme perfectly and gives the game a bit of charm. Recommend!			"

												An unforgiving perma-death survival game with a Tim Burton aesthetic that rewards planning and management. A beef jerky you reluctantly ate on day 10 can lead to your demise on day 30. Features a diverse range of characters to play and a great modding community that promotes replayability. Who would have thought we'd see an indie survival game that actually functions properly.

												If you like hard, stressful, moody games, Don't Starve is for you.The rogue-like qualities of permadeath and procedurality have spread far and wide, and now we have Don't Starve, a survival game with a Tim Burton-esque aesthetic that demands you navigate a hostile world of unforgiving plants and wildlife. And then, come nightfall, deal with monsters.This game is equal parts stressful and fun. In directly proportional amounts.The lack of achievements just goes to show the game's focus: You can play this game however you want, change the spawning rate of specific plants and critters, the length of seasons, all of which would undermine achievements and their place in the community. But could make the game more fun, if you want to enjoy it that way.KLEI seems intent on polishing a single aspect of a game in each release, SHANK the action, Mark of the Ninja the stealth, and now Don't Starve the procedurality. Their previous games were tightly focused and linearly designed, but here we have something almost infinitely replayable. And incredibly unforgiving.Crafting, managing resources, and carefully avoiding conflict mean that long term you might manage to erect a homestead with a farm and wander the world with a loyal pet. More likely you'll die trying instead.But I like that. If you do, too, then this's for you.			"

												An awesome art style like if it was made by Tim Burton himself, an amazing OST in one of the most creepy open world games.ProsImmersive is one of the worlds that describe this game.An art style that makes you remember the Tim Burton movies, pretty well realized.The soundtrack is amazing and fit with the world in a outstanding way.Gameplay simple but well realized.Pretty original.Enjoyable and variated Characters.Lots of amazing mods.ConsDoesn't have a Tutorial.Its trial and error, and unforgiving, if you die you lose all.A really great game, if you like open world survival games this game is for you, and its not like the other games of the genre, this will give you a lot of surprises, especially if you lose your sanity.

Maybe you'll die from a spider attack,Or maybe you'll die from a raging wolf pack.Maybe you'll die from the sting of bees,Or maybe you'll die from a sentient tree.You could even die from a beefalo horde,Or possibly die with little sanity restored~At which point your shadows would begin to kill,Within the midst of all of these thrills.It's unlikely that you'll die from an ongoing storm,But good luck later on when snow begins to form,As you start to have trouble keeping things warm,Whilst nature breaks down and becomes deformed...Maybe a tallbird will ruin your day as you decide to grab your lunch,Pecking away at the trail you leave, persistent in it's hunch.And just when you get away from it's frighteningly large size,The montrous Krampus will come to grab both you and your prize.Perhaps the end will come to you just when you think you're safe,Your chests are set, your fire is lit and the grass begins to chafe.But, somehow, you will forget about the most important affair-Then soon your belly will start to scream in hopelessness and despair.When you scramble for warmth and shelter,When you battle big beasts on your own,When you worry about the the sweltering summer or the ghosts lying under gravestones,Make sure you remember the main point of this journey you are on,And make sure that this December,You Don'tStarve Alone.

												Simply, wow!  First look at the game, I loved the whimsical, gothy caricature artwork of the characters and environment.  I didn't survive the first night because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.  Round two, I lasted about 3 days.  I would have lived longer had I not gotten too much into exploration mode.Don't Starve is a quite the time/resource management game packaged into such a casual looking box.  It's quite complex.  With each time you die, based off of how long you survive, you earn experience points which helps unlock a new character to play with, each with their own quirks and personalities.I highly recommend this game and can not wait until they release the multiplayer version!

												Hi, The first big paragraph is me ranting about FPS games, if you want to hear about DS, skip down a bit... How to create a review that doesn't just repeat what everyone else has said 10, 000 times before? I don't know if I can, so instead I wish to share a little version of my journey through video games, and use that to explain why I settled on this huge gem, and why It's the first game in my library (about 420 as of this writing) That I paid full retail for.I'm a gamer. no, seriously, that's what I am. I play games, I collect games, I live games.*For reference,FPS=First Person ShooterPvP = Player Vs PlayerPvE = Player Vs EnvironmentI have always liked and preferred FPS single player shooters, and only much later did I start getting into skill based FPS (vs Perk based FPS - read: CoD is not in my games library. Shucks, Battlefield BC2 flet like a mistake to me after playing it, even for $4.89). I only started playing CS:Source to shut up some young know it all in my internet cafe. Next thing I'm playing tier matches on CS:GO with $800 of DLC in my account. Why? It's a tight, fast paced tactical game with the only advantage over the other guy being my skill, not my special gun.I actually can't remember why, but I got this urge to start playing some slower paced survival type games, I do know I was beginning to tire with the fastest fast paces of PvP, and often not knowing or caring about my teammates, as I'd be in a different match in 4 mins anyway. I tried with Nether which feels like PvE until some base camping 12yo snipes you from 3 blocks away. I got tired of getting 8h in and then permadeath to that. But all of a sudden, I like permadeath. You failed? start again. No, really. Start Again. Perks? Byebye. Guns? Gone. Here's a kitchen knife, go stab some guy with a full kit in the back. If it had true PvE, I might still be there. I wanted to give Nether a go, because other games like DayZ, etc already had a huge negative reputation. And I really don't like Zombie themed games except maybe Killing Floor, which is team based PvE, and they are clones, not zombies, but they are called Zeds... hmmm... Don't even know why I got KF in the first place, I think it was because it looked interesting and I actually wanted one of their other games, ""The Ball"" - a single player puzzle oriented FPS with no shooting but lots of squishy (Puzzle-Solving via Giant Rolling Artifact Of Death).So at some point, I saw this title, and instantly dismissed it as a cheap flash-based game that was popular in a similar way to ""Candy Crush"". Heh, that's what you get for not looking into something properly before forming an opinion. Wish I had - was on sale for half price with a second copy of the game for free. (I don't think Klei will ever do that again for this game). This game was suggested in a Nether thread I had started about wanting a better PvE experience. I'd put in a  list of requests/prerequisites that would make it a game I would want to play, and someone suggested Don't Starve to me again. I thought 'no', but I saw in one of their threads that they adamantly refused to add multiplayer, because they wanted to create the best single player experience possible. This had my attention, as I saw it as now being a truly PvE experience, and by this time, I was craving it.I likely would have got into this game much, much sooner if it had ever gone on sale. It only had sales in the early days, whilst it was still gaining traction. Now, they are planning on making it more expensive when they release the next DLC (multiplayer patch). So it's pretty well now-or-never.___________DS is a brutally unforgiving game. You are dropped of in the middle of nowhere, in a foreign world, no idea about anything, except that night is coming. You will die. but you will learn, and live to day two. then day 4, then 7, then 22 (trust me you're gonna die on day 22 the first time). but you learn, you progress, a little bit, a little bit more. You try this mushroom, nope - not good. But cook it, and it is good. There are no quick save / reloads, no retries, no mistakes because you will be greeted with the realities of permadeath and a new world generated, Day 1. The reason that I love it, is that it's open ended - the goal is to get through until tomorrow, and that is always the goal, and it never, never ends. It's often a slower pace than FPS, and you pick days dedicated to exploring, resource gathering, or building better defenses. You gather. You plan. But when the stuff hits the fan, it's all on, and if you get through it, it feels like an accomplishment, and brings a huge feeling of quiet (is that it? are they all gone?) and satisfaction, because, well, it's all you, and the odds are stacked against you. That, right there, might just be the reason this game is so great.Should you buy it? Is this game for you? Probably. Should you wait for it so go on special? I wouldn't hold my breath. Check out some Let's Plays. Read some reviews. ask an IRL  [In Real Life] friend if you can have a jam (you'll want to put 20h aside to start to get a feel for the mechanics of this game. Anything less wouldn't be a fair assessment. That's how deep it is). But if you want something challenging, rewarding, and a game that is designed around long-term play, you have found it.			"

												There's a definite element of horror to survival games. It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.Don't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.This feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.Death is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really, really sucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.So why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.You'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.			"

												So the winter is almost over, and thanks to the crook pot I'm doing pretty good.And then the hounds came.I heard their houls in advance and prepared myself to deal with them by equiping my spear and grass armor.The beasts arrived and they numbered at least 6.The ghost of my dead sister tried protecting me but the beasts overwhelmed her, but not before she took down 2 of them.Unwilling to give up I ran a short way to a pack of Beefalos. I kited the hounds tru the pack and made them fight each others.I survived the hounds, but how long will it be until something else gets the best of me?----This game is AMAZING!It's hard, but with knowledge you can survive.I feel that there is little luck involved. Either you learn how to survive or the game will eat your character.The graphics are AWESOME!I love the ""Tim Burton style"" and the creepy victorian feel!I bought this game at a Christmas sale and I recomend you do the same.

Passing through the seasons, including a harsh winter that will kill him cold!Varied characters with unique characteristics facilitate their adaptation to the game. From various animals, such as rabbits common to more rare and buffaloes. Of course, without leaving out a dear friend and companion Chester.The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand, which can complicate a bit is the selection of items. Many materials and raw materials that you collect throughout the day, and this opens up new combinations and creating tools to help you on this journey. Worth it if you're a fan of survival kits.So buy this game as soon as possible and test how many days you managed to survive 20? 100? 1000? ... "

IntroThis game was developed and published by Klei Entertainment. This game has received positive ratings from critics and users alike. Its mostly compared to other games like Minecraft and Terraria where the goal is survival. The main difference is that in those games mentioned above you are digging deeper and deeper and its usually about getting resources from the depths of the world. This game on the other hand is about utilizing resources on the surface for survival. Which brings about many difficulties as a result since you cannot hide in a cave for the winter.Difficulty:The permanent death component of this game really adds tension to surviving and trying your best to live the cruelty of the world. The difficulty really feels tailored made once you actually get into all the settings for making your own world. You basically have options over all enemies and resources to customize the world you desire in a fashion that you would want to explore it in. By having the player able to change the difficulty dependent on variables to such a degree they have made this game fun to replay over and over.WorldThe world can be medium to grand depending on what options the player chooses. However despite the size you end up with you will always feel like there is plenty to explore which is a important component of this game. The idea of exploring for resources, gathering them and utilizing resources to survive is important.CraftingThe crafting system was well done and has plenty of diversity of what you can create to enhance your odds of survival. Its interesting that you need the labs to first construct the objects but are able to construct them anywhere after your first time.GraphicsThe art direction is actually really good, the eeriness of the graphics combined with its other components really makes it stand out from other games, if you were to show me a ton of games i would never confuse it for don't starve.

Posted: November 30, 2013
												Don't Starve is an indie game in the somewhat crowded genre of ""survive a hostile environment by crafting"". I bought it just as it went out of beta, drawn mostly by the TimBurtonesque graphics.I feel I gave Don't Starve a fair chance, investing 13 hours into it, although the prospect of abandoning it felt tantalizing after just 5. I have to be honest: 13 hours is far from enough to experience the most sophisticated tiers of crafting. It’s unfortunately more than enough to resent the experience and I’ll soon get to the reasons for that.But first, the positive. The initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are intriguing and can best be described as what a children’s pop-up book could look like if it was designed by Tim Burton. Almost all of the game's elements (animals, plants, …) are delightful and original. The only flaw in the graphics concerns some of the ground’s textures, which are slightly pixelated, at least on Full HD resolution. Music is rather sparse, but the sound effects are realistically bucolic and I loved the idea that when your character “talks” (in reaction to one of your commands), he/she does so with the sound of an orchestral instrument (luckily, with English subtitles)The first couple of hours with the game are great. You feel very free exploring your environment, and yet captive of the timing: night comes all too soon! At the very minimum, on your first day, you need to collect a couple of food items (even as weak as berries and carrots) and get enough material to make a fire, which itself requires an axe (that you also must craft on the first day). The next day, you must to learn to balance three vital gauges: heath, satiety and sanity. Should any of them reach 0, you’re history. Speaking of which, let me introduce you to your new nemesis…PERMADEATH! If you've played roguelikes in the past, you two have already met. If not, let me explain. Permadeath means that when you die, there is no pressing a load button and re-starting from a safe point from the past. The game allows you to save your progress, but only when you quit, so that you don’t have to play a full game in one session. But should you cross path with the Grim Reaper, Don't Starve will mercilessly and meticulously destroy any save file that might inhabit your hard drive, forcing you to go back to the very beginning each and every time you die. In many games, this is not problematic. Many roguelikes are fun to start again over and over, because their random world generation often comes up with a unique situation and/or because you can try a completely different strategy, maybe by creating a character of a different class.The problem with Permadeath in Don't Starve is that there aren't many different strategies in the beginning. Sure, after some in-game days, you can specialise your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons. The point of a crafting/surviving game like this, especially one where you have to figure out most everything by yourself, is to experiment, to try crazy things and hope for a reward. But here, with no way of knowing in advance if a new enemy is fair game or completely badass, experimenting often means dying, and being punished by re-playing the same boring first days.You’d be forgiven to think that Don't Starve's unlockable characters alleviate the above-mentioned problem. But you’d be wrong: they mostly add a bit of flavour to the game, but don’t offer any real potential for strategic diversification. As if repetitiveness wasn't enough, the world generation algorithm hates you. The algorithm basically creates a huge map made of different “biomes” (forests, plains, swamps…). A biome has a specific population of animals, plants and other resources. Some of those resources are really basic building blocks for crafting, yet the algorithm sometimes takes great pride in placing the biomes that host them very far from you. You therefore often have no other solution than to spend several in-game days running around without crafting anything useful, just because there is no gold or even plain rocks, anywhere near your starting position. Judging from my experience, it's not a rare occurrence. There are some interesting special features disseminated across the map, but they’re spread fairly thin. In the end, it's hard to understand why such a huge map was needed in the first place.The last major complain I have is perhaps partly inherent to the genre and therefore not entirely the game’s fault: an almost complete lack of information. I already explained how not knowing anything about an enemy could mean death by experimentation. But it’s the same for almost each of the game’s features. The crafting recipes are mostly public, but the uses and strengths of the crafted objects are not. So, I've crafted a helm or an armour: Just what difference does it make? Beats me. So, I see my sanity declining dangerously. Why? What can I do to improve the situation? The game never tells, leaving the player to try things and not always finding a satisfactory answer. There is a fan-made wiki that you can consult if you’re curious about this or that aspect. But it's still very difficult to find just the information you need without having other secrets spoiled for you at the same time. I really wish the game would give you clues, even infrequent and vague ones. At the very least, I expected the game to explain the controls, how to move my character or rotate the view. Turned out, I needed to visit the official forum for that too!Overall, I was extremely disappointed with Don't Starve. I find it hard to recommend to anyone, save maybe the most patients among you who don’t find repetitive grinding objectionable. It’s a shame really, because for the purpose of this review, I read a significant part of the Wiki, and there are some really neat ideas. But more of them should have been used to diversify the starting strategy and they also need to be spread less thin across the map.			"

Hold Me !! See i love this game!!! Don't Starve is a Indie/Adventure/Survival/Crafting/Sandbox game. I also love games like this that are Small in size and a good bit of content to keep the player engaged...even if you die over and over and over you will keep coming back for more lol The art style in this game is very whimsical and real good with a lot of good animations.The controls are done real well and have found no issues with them so far.I recommend a controller for this game it makes the game a bit more relaxed and faster to switch through the menus.This helps also in crafting and eatting and so on and so on.I also recommend getting the DLC also to add more to this already impressive game! The game also has Steam Workshop also so there are a good bit of mods and stuff to add to it!!!And also i think its real good they are also giving the new Stand Alone DLC Dont Starve Together FREE to all that bought Dont Starve !!! Even though i bought the Dont Starve MEGA BUNDLE (Came with it BETA) on the xmas Steam Sale lol I say if you love a good indie survival game ,i say pick this one up ASAP!! FYI dont punch a bee :P  "

												I blink. I appear in a strange new world only to be suddenly confonted by a sleek man wearing a rather dapper suit and top hat! I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: ""Say pal, you don't look so good."" ""You'd better find something to eat before night comes!"" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.After what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food. Hours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.Brilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games. I can't wait for the multiplayer and some more awesome things that klei will produce. 10/10			"

I cannot express how awesome and entertaining this is, and just to top it off it's easy and fun to mod! (I modded the game myself, not so much now) The amount of content those updates in those 6 months of free updates was just immense. The fact we HAD updates for 6 months is amazing in itself, and now we're getting a DLC! I cannot wait for the amount of content that'll probably overwhelm me... BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												Don't Starve is the kind of game with a steep learning curve, and a process of discovery which can only truly 8e analysed through trial and error. This is a recurring theme, too, as the Game is permanently Permadeath, and is incredibly unforgiving. Admittedly, I did only get this game for the pre-order Hats for tf2, but I must say I haven't been disappointed. Don't Starve is small and easy to run on even the oldest computers, and a good way to pass the time if you are unfortunate to not have access to multiplayer games (Like me ;-;). The design scheme is sinister and eerie, but never actually scary. The game is all about surviving, and is more about managing resources than anything. Multiplayer was always a heated de8ate, 8ut finally the developers have decided to add it to the game, finally. So, with more DLCs and Multiplayer to look forward to, the game is only getting 8etter			"

												This game is the epitome of obscenity. It starts off innocent enough, promising a nice ""build-to-survive"" experience, until you glance at the clock and realise you've lost most your day. It takes a fair bit to get into the swing of things, having to learn how to play from scratch as there is absolutely no hand-holding in this game. But it still somehow remains simple enough to grasp quickly, and yet complicated enough that you continue to discover new things with each play. First time I managed to work out how to not die immediately, I lasted 16 days, until death by giant bees. The rage I felt to then have to start again, from scratch, in a new completely randomly generated world left me unable to keep playing. And yet, same time the following day I had returned, if not out of desire to play, as much as a desire to flip the birds at this game, so that it knows it has not beaten me yet. Highly addictive, very engrossing, and overall just a really awesome concept. I definately would recommend this game.			"

												""So much to do, so much to see""Don't Starve is a beautiful challenging survivor indie game.In this game you explore the world and craft different things and of course don't die.This game is also little bit humorous and it keeps getting updates, so it's fun to play and it has many hours of gameplay.In Don't Starve there is currently 9 different characters (11 if you buy the Reign of giants DLC) with their own unique abilities.When you die you can always start a new save with a different character, and the world is always different.

												The concept art of the game gives it a unique vintage look. I'ts a funny indie survival game.Let's resume the gameplay: ""You wake up and you've realised that you are lost in a forest, what will you do?"". The gameplay is basically that, you have to survive as many days as possible by collecting resourses, crafting stuff and eating food that you collect/craft. Also remember to put some lights at night.			"

												One scientist, nature, wilderness, night, cold, food, dangers, friends and enemies. All is good as long as you ""don't starve"". The amazing visuals (Tim Burton like artwork) and music sets the tone well for this masterpiece. In Don't Starve they tell you nothing about your adventure as it unfolds. You will start out with no knowledge, and will run around grabbing objects until you find out how to build things. Whenever you discover something new, it adds it to a list of item to build. This is truly fantastic progression.Don't Starve is a incredible game and with the updates they keep putting out every few weeks, this is a game that I will keep playing for a very long long time. 10/10			"

												A surprisingly immersive and aesthetic game that is effortless to get into and play for hours on end. It's entertaining for hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike and as much as it is engaging to play alone, it is also fun to play alongside others even without DST. I can easily run it on a laptop not built for any type of gaming which is a huge plus especially for a game so well rounded. This is one that I recommend anyone curious to try out at least once because the odds seem to definitely be in favour of your liking it. Please be warned that it is extremely addictive. Those who have enjoyed Minecraft or frequent games where the object is building or/and surviving etc will be thrilled with Don't Starve. Have fun! ;)			"

												TL;DR: skip to the verdict at the bottomThis game is a masterpiece. It truly shines in comparison to the other modern survival games.The art style really fits with the game's setting, making for one of the best immersion experiences out there.Other survival games *cough* The Forest *cough* give you a handful of starting items and tips when you press the magnificent ""new game"" button.Well,no,♥♥♥♥ you, The Forest.In Don't Starve,you are told literally NOTHING about the enviroments that surround you,what can kill you, or what is edible.It is the authentic survival experience, where you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no idea of what you are going to do next.That brings me to the learning curve. It is a really harsh and unforgivable one (Dark Souls style),but once you get used to it, and that should be after your first 5 worlds created, you will get the hang of what's what in the world of Don't Starve.Heat kills you, hunger kills you,spiders kill you,pretty much never ask yourself the question ""what does that thing do?"".You will regret it a short 10 seconds afterwards.Where the gameplay can't do the job, atmosphere is further more created by the Tim Burton-ish twisted art style,with a slight touch of a cartoon character design.This game is also a true teacher. In my humble 30-ish hours of trying not to starve, I learned that frustration never leads to something good,so don't get mad the first 5 times when you die,it's part of the game, and it's a healthy method of learning the ropes and the mechanics.Basically, the trial and error system would be the best description of your first playthroughs.The game is full of new content, it makes sure that you always discover something just when you tought that there couldn't be more to it, so don't worry, it is NOT a short game, nor one with an empty open world.The DLC, Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked, expand the content of it to whole new levels,easily adding 60 more hours of gameplay to the 50-ish of the original content and the 100+ ones that mods add, and (I can't believe I'm saying it), they are worth their full price.Verdict: If you want a serious survival game with tons of content and an expansive open world, tough with a harsh learning curve, but that is worth your time, Don't Starve is perfect for you.Actually,scratch that,Don't Starve is for you no matter what kind of survival game you are looking for.Just try it,because I'm giving it a 10/10.

												Okay, first thing first. Thank you for the gift, George.At the first glance, I don't know anything or have any ideas about what this game is supposed to be (well, no instruction, almost no tips, nothing, only funny dialogues when clicking on certain objects), but that all makes sense, and it's quite interesting.- You have an inventory to (of course) store things to help you survive (light up a fire, foods - including flower petals, seeds, carrot,...).- You have basic recipes to make useful tools like axe, traps,... for what? The player must figure his/herself.That being said, I have survived for 5 days. If I have time, I will re-install this thing. It's a good game, but I have something else to play also. I will continue play this later on (and they provided a CD Key to redeem on Google for every single copy).Oh, no achievement, sad, but no.			"

												Well I have been a fan of Don't starve for quite some time. Pretty much back when it was in beta, back before caves, back before rabbits had an ai. Watching it progress has been interesting.So this game is a survival... sorta horror game? It is hard to say it has things happen that are kinda creepy. The point of this game is to try to stay alive for as long as you can. It is easier said than done. Throughout the game you will have problems trying to stay alive. Hazards include hunger, wetness, heat, freezeing, monsters, giants, the dark, sanity, seasons, thunder, and fire. So basicly you start the game if you can survive long enough you will be able to get a little camp going and have enough food to live off of. But things in this game never go your way. Random mobs sometimes attack at the worst times, and bosses can randomly come and destroy your ""house"" and set your crops a blaze. This is basicly one of those games where you can be having fun and then your fun will be ruined and you will go sour on the game. Pretty good for an indie game, I give it...8.5/10.Ah, almost forgot, console commands![dont-starve-game.wikia.com](`) So you can cheat your heart out and not starve!			"

												-Rabbits are trolls-Night is no time to rest-No animal is innocentDon't Starve throws you into the wild, and uses everything it's got to kill you, literally. Did you build a farm? Good because I hope your well fed because were going unlease a pack of angry dogs at you. Did you kill those dogs, did you? Well, you just ran out of food and to get more you'll have to go across the other side of the map. Oh, good your still alive, then I guess we can test this forest monster on you. Don't Starve guides you to progressively find intuitive ways to survive, but with perma-death around the corner, lurking behind your every shadow, you'll be doomed to start over again. That's right, Don't Starve challenges you to cheat death.Recommend purchasing the 19.99 bundle or the mega pack...Now who wants to go make some science - Cave Johnson, founder and CEO of Aperture Science...

												In this clever, strange and unforgiving surivival game, you have one job over all else:DON'T STARVE.With that being said, it's perfectly fine to:-Surivive.-Die.-Fight off spiders.-Go insane.-Have an army of Pigs.-Cheat Death.-Annoy Maxwell.-Be a Gentleman and a Scientist at the same time.-Become a pyromanic.-Have a twin sister that's a ghost.-Be the strongest there is by over-eating.-Be a humanity hating robot.-Wonder why you aren't in your library.-Have a talking axe and a dark secret.-Become the weakest Mime there is, but hey, balloons!-Get murdered by pengulls.-Learn to respect nature the hard way.-Try to escape.-Have the slim chance of getting destroyed by a giant Deerclops.-Start a forest fire.-Scream a refrence while getting chased by bees.-Find a herd of Beefalo.-Get run over by a herd of Beefalo.-Play a cruel version of Splunky.-""WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SPIDERS?!""-Fail.-Try again.-Get farther, but fail again.-Unlock secrets.-Tense up when you hear howling in the distance.-Become who ever's a playable character in the workshop.-Wonder what happens when you jump in a wormhole.-Get hunted by a fashionable Walrus.-Science!-""OH, IT BURNS!""-Get hunted by robots protecting statues.-Many other wacky occurances-Realise you can never win.Yet dispite all that...You'll laugh. You'll yell. You'll wonder why you even bought this game in the first place. But you'll retry, and retry, and get better.

												If you enjoy playing survival games; you'll love Don't Starve. In this game you will die a lot and realize how much this game hates you. However, for every death you will gain knowledge of the game and experience to unlock other characters whom all are different and unique. You start off by collecting many items such as wildgrass and twigs so that you can survive for the first couple of nights but, the game get progressively harder with each passing night which makes this game so challenging. Once you die in this game, the game deletes your save file and you have to start all over from scratch but, the games world generator always keeps the game fresh and new for you. The community workshop also has many mods to help assist you in learning the game as well as adding new characters that already exist from other games,shows or even just made up.For some, Permadeath in this game is what ruins it. For others it gives the game a more realistic feel to the game. There are various guides and tutorials on Don't Starve but, I highly recommend not looking at it because the beauty of Don't Starve is finding out yourself the ups and downs. There are also various ways to give you an ""extra"" life such as touching the pig alter or the life giving amulet.Here are some of my experiences of the game:-1st time playing- Day 0: I spawn and start collecting items. I see a pig alter unsure of what it does and avoid it. I see an odd white sphere out of the ground and proceed to head towards it. I am ambushed by spiders and die.Day X (Can't Remember what day): I see the odd white sphere which I know now is a spider nest. I approach the nest and kill the first spider that greets me. The other 2 come out of the nest, eat the meat of their fallen brethren and proceed to chase me.Day 35: The Deerclops is chasing me and has killed all the beefalo with 2 hits. I proceed to shoot a fire dart at him which kills him, and starts burning all the drops from the beefalo. I run to the drops panicing and die to the fire from all the drops. I respawn from one of the pig alters that I had previously touched and immediately get ambushed by 6 hounds.Day 48: While I am collecting berries from the row of berry bushes I had gathered, it starts to rain. After a couple of minutes a lightning bolt hits one of the nearby trees burning all the bushes. Today is sad day.11/10 would attempt to survive again			"

												It's a game where you don't starve.But, it's more than that.These days, games are just for entertainment value and fake praise. That's cool and all, but, this game does more than that. In this game, you not only eat, but you explore a randomly generated world, ranging from the aboveground and underground, plus many biomes to explore and traverse, like the Forest, Savannah, Swamp, etc.There's also a wide range of different characters to unlock. Some unlock by gaining EXP (Which you earn when you die or other reasons), or when you do a in-game action, which unlocks them!Plus, this game is updated regularly, with all new kinds of new content to explore and discover! There could be simple bug fixes or changes to items, or even something big like a new biome! This brings the player back so they can explore the new content and see what it does and how it's affects them!This game reminds me of an arcade game -- you see how many points you get (or, how many days you can survive), until you eventually die. When you do eventually die, you may ask ""How the heck did I die!?"" But that's the fun in it! As you progress, you face greater and more challenging things to face and survive from! And, by dying, you learn more about the game, so you'll want to do it again and last longer and longer!So, that's my two-sense on this game. It's overall a fun little experience those Cod and Minecraft fans should experience, so they can see that there's more to life than gunfire and a bad game! "

												Excellent game, a quick run-down of the pros and consPros-Deep gameworld with alot of hidden and interesting things to find within the depths of the game-Excellent design, game art, and audio-Soon to have multiplayer. Yay!-Replayability-Sates the need of putting things in boxes and organizing a perfect base defense and structure system-Really never know what your going to find exploring a new area-Beefalo.-Interesting crafting system-Good valueCons-Somewhat steep learning curve-Lack of tutorial means finiding a new monster deep in a playthrough could end up killing the player and losing all progress, no tutorial also makes changing of the seasons, or meeting a new monster, deadly for the unprepared.-Gathering of resources can become tedious, but the better your base, the less need you have for random resource hunting.-Permadeath can turn off a new player quickly, ex. surviving through winter, then getting murdered by the end of winter boss, often the total loss of progress can be disheartening.-Really could have benefited from some sort of in-game explaination of the game world and wilson's plight, there is a cinematic trailer, but it isn't at all in game.OverviewAll in all this is a great game, but it takes patientience and persistence to be good at surviving, I consider myself pretty decent at the game without mods, and I still die random non-creature deaths due to random events, and often die in caves because of the high difficulty they can have *cough* depthworms *cough* I probably wouldn't reccomend this to casual, console type gamers, unless playing ""Dont Starve Together"" with an experienced friend or the like. But to anyone who likes a little challenge and has some time to play, this is a very well made game, and quite entertaining.  Plus if you find it to hard, you can customize world generation to make the sandbox mode much easier and forgiving, and the steam workshop has lots of great mods that can make the game more enjoyableI would consider it one of my top 10 personal favorite games			"

												First of all, I'd like to point out that I have atleast 20+ hours game time on this game but played it mostly outside steam.This is one of those games that was given a unique touch on it's style. So, if you're the type of person who looks for ""something different"" in games then, this one is for you.Don't Starve is a survival game with an art inspired from Tim Burton's works. Now don't get that statement get to you as it surprisingly fit the game overall. You are dropped in a random-generated world and start of from them. The game has no tutorials but its easy to get the gist of the game while at the same time It's hard to master.Controls[+] The game works well on both mouse/WASD controls depending on your preference.[+] Zoom in feature.[+] Full controller support.Sounds[+] Atmospheric OST.[+] Good choice of SFX for small things like picking flints.Graphics[+] Tim Burton style. The art for characters, monsters, and objects blends well with the world.Balance[+] Challenging. You can spend a lot of hours playing the game and you will still have a hard time surviving for a long time especially for winter.[+] Different kinds of monsters, objects, and resources spawn near you each time you start off a new world.[+] You will have to do more than just picking up items and cutting pine trees if you want to craft advanced items.[+] Multiple characters to unlock. One has more advantage than the other but still keeping the balance to keep the difficulty of the game.Others[+] Dialogues to keep you from getting bored playing in a gloomy atmosphere.[+] Huge in-game content.[+] The type of survival game where survival is your real concern.[] No story. Although it doesn't need one, it wouldn't hurt to have one.[-] It could use a short and justified tutorial for some players who can't get into games quickly.[-] Craftable materials appearing and disappearing while moving away from machines can be confusing at times.

												You may say I didn't play a lot of Don't Starve on pc , it's because I had some problems with steam so I jumped on Don't Starve console edition on the ps4 ( a must have on the ps4 ;) ) . Now that my steam works I can make an honest review :) Pros: -Don't Starve has a large world so you can explore a lot (sandbox world) it's great . If the map is too large for you , you can always change the setting to a smaller map.-The crafting is just brilliant and don't always follow logic . -There is an unlimited amount of things you can do (I'm not kidding ! ) . -There is different season .-Don't Starve world has a dark twist ... ;) -You can unlock all 9 characters and they all have a different quality than the other . If you want more character , you can always get some from the steam workshop (People have a lot of imagination) . Pros/Con: -When you die , it's REALLY frustrating but then you want to make another character and try to get much further than the time before . Con + Guide's link :-The only problem that you'll encounter the most for a begginer is : They almost never gives you hint on what to do . It's not that much of a Con if you like doing everything by yourself but it can become very frustrating . So I'm going to give you the link of one of my friend's guide . It's really helpful and he's a pro at Don't Starve :)Link:

												A very challenging and fun game, Don't Starve brings us the creativity of Minecraft and the adventure of Terraria and mash them together with some lovely art. You play *mainly* as Wilson, a scientist who was whisked away into this hellish world of violent trees, annoying hellhounds, and a deadly night. Although this game is quite challenging, and yes, frustrating, it is a lot of fun to play and experience for yourself. There are gameplay mechanics such as sanity, hunger, and weather. As you see more disturbing things, your sanity drops, making shadows and other hallucinations appear at night, and eventually, at day. Hunger is, obviously, a big problem. As you go throughout your day with food in your inventory, it will decompose and spoil. To combat this, you either eat it or store it in an ice box. Even so, your food still isn't completely safe in the ice box. Finally, there is rain, lightning, snow, and more snow. As the winter months draw near, you will be forced to stay near your fire unless you have the proper attire. Each and every enemy in this game is basically out for your head as well. The hellhounds will come every once in a while to remind you to stay on guard. Swamps come alive with deadly spiked tentacles that lash out if you get too close. Pigmen will defend their brethren to the death if need be. All of this comes with a grim reminder that to survive, you must always be alert, unless you want a beefalo horn shoved up your bum. 9/10 overall score			"

												Don't Starve is a wilderness survival game.  You are left in a world to explore, set up camp, and above everything else... Don't Starve!   Here's my review as a disabled gamer (I play with only a mouse).


YouTube™ Video: Can I Play... Don't Starve? 

			Views: 222		

			Are you a disabled gamer... ever saw a game, and wondered ""Can I Play That""? Do you need to see options and settings for accessibility? You're not alone! Join me as I test options and find out...		

Don't Starve begins in Full Screen but you can immediately access options to change to windowed mode.  Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop without exiting the game.  No colorblind settings were in the options.  Mouse only gamers can play with ease.  When you start this game you may not see your friends or family for weeks...  the game is just that good!  Everything can be controlled with simple mouse clicks, a few keyboard buttons can help you lower your right clicking and adjust camera settings.  You can left click to move your character collect objects or attack.  For keyboard only gamers the news isn't as good.  You can walk using wasd & collect items with space.  My problem came when trying to access build menus.  I personally never found a key to access them and looking through forum posts I failed to find a solution.  If keybindings do become available,  I'll definitely update notes here!			"

												This game is HARD.  You get thrown into it with no tutorial, no explanation and no help.  Not gonna lie - I ended up looking a lot of things up at the beginning because I don't deal with these types of games very well.  However, you learn quickly and it gets to the point where you don't care why you're in this other world, why there are shadow creatures trying to kill you, etc.  You just have to survive.  There's a lot of item collection and the opportunity to build bigger and better defenses, offenses, etc. There's no real right or wrong way to play this game.  You will probably die a lot but there is tons of replayability.			"

 Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a standalone expansion to the base survival game  Don't Starve . Let it be known that I have not played the original game to any extent and my impressions are based on the expansion and its content.  Narrative  The narrative is entirely freeform and allows the player to create their own story according to personal playstyle. Your enjoyment in this regard is mostly limited to your own imagination. However, each playable character has his or her own personality quirks, quips and unique gameplay interactions. For example, my favorite character is a snotty librarian who is able to bypass certain tech restrictions due to her vast intelligence and in exchange is unwilling to eat spoiled food.   Gameplay  Due to the nature of permadeath games, the player's response to death is paramount to whether or not the game succeeds. When the player inevitably sees the ""You died"" screen, frustration will be a natural response. However, does the player feel enticed to try again? Has the player learned valuable information that will serve to prevent the same death from occurring?  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  succeeds for the most part in this regard. For example, at a predetermined time a certain mob will spawn and attack the player. This acts as a test to see if the player has adequately prepared. The first time I had to fight this mob, I instantly died - I was  not  prepared. How could I be? I did not know that the pounding footsteps and the shaking ground were signs of my coming death. However, during my second attempt, I realized that this certain mobs' movements were incredibly predictable and burdened with a long attack animation. I kited them and dispatched them with ease. Five minutes later, while congratulating myself with a hearty vegetable stew, I was punched to mincemeat by a enraged ent revenging his fallen children who I had unwittingly used as my kindling for said stew. And so the ouroboric cycle of punishment/information/success/punishment continued. During the downtime when you are not being chased by rabid sharks or angry buffalo, you will spend your time traveling from island to island in search of new materials, new technologies and establishing bases of operation. There is also a beautiful settings menu with ample customization options for certain mobs/events/seasons/resources to be tweaked, increased or even removed. Do you really love picking berries? Increase the berry bush seed. Do you HATE @#(%@^( KLEPTOMANIC MONKEYS? Remove the monkeys... Or just feed them a banana next time, recruit them permamently, and start a primate civil war. Watch their monkey huts burn down; watch the baby monkeys scream for mercy while you lounge by the shore sipping some iced tea and listening to Rage Against the Machine. Sensory  The art style looks like the baby of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and American McGee's Alice: sharp lines and bright, contrasting colors all wrapped up in a twisted design. You will never look so good being mutilated over and over again. The sounds are interesting, unique, and did not devolve into repetition. However, the musical soundtrack needed more variance - I eventually listened to my own music and was perfectly content. Conclusion  Do you enjoy being slapped in the face repeatedly by someone other than your wife? Do you relish the idea of convincing monkeys to murder each other with their own feces? Are you titillated by the notion of spending five hours building an empire only to die from a coconut falling on your head?  Do you enjoy complex games with a myriad of gameplay elements which allow you to play your own game against the game? If you said yes to the above then  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a game definitely worth dying.			"

												Don't Starve is a 2013 action-adventure video game with survival and roguelike elements, developed and published by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year and further versions for iOS and mobile phones are under consideration. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.[1]The game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's ""Adventure"" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.Time by time, you unlock more valuable and specific-abilities characters.'Rate: 11/10			"

												This game really turned me against myself. A part of me really liked the game, while another was eagerly waiting to get off. Dont Starve is a survival game that blends a unique style of artwork with a fasinating story. By all means, the story is very well done and the gameplay is not bad, and if you like survival this is the game for you, but somewhere it just failed. It failed when it came to replay value, or how much you can play a game after you have finished it once. i felt that it started getting repetetive, doing the same things over and over for the same objective. Overall, i do recommend this game to anyone who loves survival, but i would only buy it if it were on sale.			"

												I recommend Don't Starve wholeheartedly. Playing Don't Starve without the DLC Reign of Giants does not get old because there are so many map generated worlds to discover and characters to play that you can pit your skills in the game against the elements.  I like the fact that players can choose specific characters that all bring something unique into the game experience. For example, Mrs. Wickerbottom doesn't sleep and anything that is spoiling in her inventory affects and decreases her sanity so you have to think carefully about your food sources including the flowers in your garland! Players who want to add more of a challenge to the game edit their worlds. If you are a hardcore ""Don't Starver"" you can choose to play a preset world with harsher conditions, maybe add more spiders or Deerclops. It was definitely not fun to have one knock down my walls like dominoes. You can even select a world to play  that only has night as a setting. I just purchased the DLC Reign of Giants and I have already died twice due to the summer heat and me having no idea that the game would roast me in the summer sun, or the birds. Klei continues to provide a new game experience and that is what I am interested in.			"

												If you don't have this game in your library yet. You have to get it. It's an amazing sandbox and survival game with Tim Burton-esque art style. You'll never get the same world twice, and the adventure mode is really challenging. If someone tells you that they already did everything in Don't Starve and have less than 10 hours, they're lying, there's TONS of stuff to do, Get through winter, fight bosses, explore the caves and the ancient ruins, and if you get bored, assemble the Wooden Thing and change characters in a new world to make it a much challenging or different experience. The devs are amazing and keep the game fresh. Currently waiting for the Fall DLC. They also try to respond to all e-mails personally as well as comments on their Facebook page. Also since the addition of workshop you can improve your game and have a lot more things to do. I love this game and every aspect of it. 10/10			"

												Minecraft as a rouguelike experience drawn in a style I associate somehow with the works Tim Burton. It's funny, dark, difficult and pretty addictive. First time you die after a new personal record streak of survived days, you'll find yourself cursing and frustated...for about 10 seconds and then restart the game. Highly recommended for those who enjoy rouguelike and sandbox games. Also, the devs are updating the game with new content constantly. One of the few games I have in my library I'm always looking forward to see what's new.			"

												One of the most fun and addicting games I've played. Originally played console version on PS4, but had to pick up the steam version to play on my computer. The controls are great once you get used to them. There are an endless number of things to do, and every time you play, you discover something new. It's a little confusing at first, but stick with it and you get better with each playthrough. This has quickly become one of my favorite games. Great community support and mods in the Steam workshop as well!			"

												Very addictive and unique game that really makes you feel like you are accomplishing something when you do it right, and punishes you when you do it wrong. Expect to fail the first dozen times you play, but it is just a learning curve. If you stick it out you WILL live through that first winter and when you see it rain for the first time after a winter of snow, or when you see the Redbirds come back the feeling you will get is worth the price of the game. Only made it to day 67 so far and the reason I died was because I decided to explore a swamp in winter, stupid idea. I never felt like the game screwed me over, it is always poor planning that does you in, and that is what makes this game great in my opinion.			"

												It really is one of the best indie games ever made. You can play it for as long as you want, because you can unlock more characters with their own personalities and possiblities. The good things about this game are:- A random world generator - You will never play on the same map again! Yes. NEVER.- You can customize your world - YOU pick if you want frogs, trees, rabbit holes, long day, long night, short winter, etc.- New characters to unlock - They have their own possibilities and personalities.- The game has got a sense of humor and nice graphics- It isn't really expensive and worth the moneyNegative things:- The game can get too stressful - If you build a big house with a fireplace, stone walls, science machine etc. and if you die... Well, you can get very disapointed.- Literally everything can kill you in this game - Even frogs!- After some time of playing you will simply get bored - But hey, you can always generate a new map!So yeah, Don't Starve is a very nice indie game. If you're a fan of such games - It's a must-have for you!			"

												10/10Easily the diamond of the survival genre, with so many unique and wonderful ideas.  Don't starve is a unique take on said genre, with an almost 'cute' gothic tim burton esque aesthetic containing characters that literally exist purely to make your life a misery, chase you, eat you, crush you, sting you, hunt you, steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥ evict you, destroy you and your base, backstab you, become mobile npc bases that still hate you and there is even an npc that goes on a spree looting the map of all resources. I can remember when this first came out and played from like 7pm until about 4am one time and i loved every second. The game starts you off with no tutorial or explanation to anything at all. You are required to fend for yourself in this unforgiving land of permadeath and bees, and if you are the more casual sort of player i'd highly recommend giving the wiki a look as it may explain some things. You must fend for yourself, build a camp, set up crops and as the title implies...don't starve. But starving is the least of your worries. Everything in this game exists to murder you in ways you never thought possible. On top of that, you must worry about your sanity, temperature and health as well. Too many spider bites and you'll die. Been out in the night for too long? You'll go insane and even the shadows will be out to kill you. Oh look, it's become winter! Good luck, because you'll need to wear some nice warm clothes or you'll freeze to death! The game does have some less than lethal additions to it as well. You can come across villages of friendly pig men who you can befriend and trade with, which is wonderful since they are can sometimes be farmers, giving you free resources, food and even defence as the pig men are rather hostile towards monsters.This game really is bursting at the seams with content here and the maps are even randomly generated to ensure that no playthrough is like another. Even if you manage to ""beat"" survival mode by finding all of the tele-portato parts an exploring the cave systems for super duper loot, you can always play campaign for increasingly hard scenarios that are really fun as well. Avoid bees. Avoid all the bees.			"

												""Don't Starve"" is an amazing survival game that manages to merge the beauty of Tim Burton's well known art style together with the normal aspects of survival that you'd find in games like Terraria or Minecraft.It's a game that'll challenge you, even if you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where even the friendly pigs will eventually try to kill you. To survive, you will have to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself - all while paying attention to both the environment and your own wellness (hunger, mentality & health). The developers of the game (Klei Entertainment) are also constantly adding new content to the game, making it a game that'll offer hours of endless fun (and to times, bits of frustration too).Conclusion: Buy it.

												Let's make it quick: I believe Don't Starve is the best sandbox survival game in the market. Whatever the price, the lower the better. Just buy it. The DLC as well, especially the multiplayer standalone expansion: Don't Starve Together. Why?Because it's really well made right from the start. Don't Starve has a very robust system in place within the gameplay. Despite being a survival game, it plays out almost like a 4X strategy. To survive, you need to eXplore the world. eXploit its riches, eXpand yourself and your base of operation, and eXterminate the enemies that threaten your life. Except you're just playing a guy, not an empire or somethingThe visual is fantastic. It has a very distinguished art style that people can easily recognize. The animation is smooth like a cartoon on TV. The characters are all unique and plays very differently. The monster are varied with its challenge and the world, oh the world... It pose a lot of question. It begs to be explored.It's really great that the devs didn't cop out with retro pixel art like a lot of other indie game out there and it really shows. Very few of those game looks decent and most simply look terrible. Don't Starve is a proof that hiring actual artist is worth it.I absolutely have fun playing the game and can't reccommend it enough.EDIT: I nominated this game for Steam ""Steam Best Use of Farm Animal"" Award			"

A while back I reviewed this as boring, basic and lacking. And it was. I played during the first days of release, and didn't give it enough time to get interesting. After sinking a ton of hours into this and still finding new things to want to check out, mess around with, explore and unlock, it's safe to say Don't Starve is a well made and interesting game.It's stacked with charm and intrigue. It still has a dead end in terms of discovery, tech and gameplay, like any survival or city sim game, but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there in Don't Starve than most other games. It's also fuelled by lots of strange little gameplay mechanics and items that you find along the way.I haven't even touched the DLC yet, and I'm not the greatest fan of survival games, but Don't Starve has definitely given me my moneys worth after investing a little time and effort.Pretty boring survival game. Don't Starve starts off with the same feeling you get playing Minecraft for the first time: You want to collect food and items to survive the first night and it's pretty exciting and fun.Unfortunately this is about it, and after the first few days of experimenting and finding out what everything does all you're left with is exploring and fighting. Fighting never really seems very exciting and has no real purpose other than maybe collecting items, and exploring seems like a waste of time since it doesn't help you survive any longer (which ultimately is the goal of the game). As a result this game gets boring very quickly and there doesn't appear to be much to do.Pretty boring survival game. "

 Long Story ShortDon’t Starve is an extremely difficult masterpiece that will take you 50+ hours in order to learn how to survive in this unforgiving universe. The art style is unique and the sounds/music is beautiful and creepy.  The game play is outstanding and it will, whether you want it to or not, draw you in for hours of game time without giving you a chance to take a break. You’ll probably starve in real life before you can put your controller down. It’s without a doubt a 10/10 and is one of the few games I think couldn’t even be improved upon. Long Story Long- The Game PlayDon’t Starve is a survival game and therefore your only natural objective is to survive. This is accomplished by keeping your sanity, hunger, heath, warmth, and sogginess in check. In order to do so, you’ll gather resources, make your camp, plant crops, craft recipes, etc. in order to create a working outpost. The game will constantly become more difficult as Maxwell, the villain, sends his hounds to attack you, you run out of any resource, and then there is the ever looming threat of winter. Variations to the game playThis game is almost 100% customizable whether you want more or less tall birds, no winter, or if you want to commit suicide by making it permanently night.  There are also several unlockable characters that all have different stats, starting items, and uses. Lastly, you can, if you’re lucky enough to find a rare portal where you’re able to switch to adventure mode where you are plopped in a premade world, opposed to the randomly generated worlds in survival mode, where you attempt to live past the more increasingly difficult worlds you’re put into in order to make it to the next and, eventually, toss Maxwell off his throne of lies!Music and SoundThe creators of Don’t Starve cut no corners when it comes to the music and sound effects. The music is beautiful, exiting, and darn right creepy depending on the circumstances. In fact, me and my roommate once did a scientific experiment in order to see if playing frightening music, in this case music from Don’t Starve, at night while we were asleep would affect our dreams or not. We both had nightmares. The sound is also perfect for whatever action is happening. I often want to eat my food reserve just so I can hear Wilson munching away at the meat or kill a spider so I can hear it shriek.ArtThe art style for Don’t Starve is completely original and shows character for objects through its harsh strokes or gentile lines. Combined with the music and sound, the art gives the player a perfect atmosphere that, in my opinion, has never been matched by another survival game.DLC and Don’t Starve TogetherThe DLC for Don’t Starve, Reign of Giants, adds craftibles, items, enemies, and even two whole freaking seasons! If you ask me, this DLC adds difficulty and challenge to this already challenging game and, unless you’ve played lots of survival games, I wouldn’t suggest using it till you’ve at least made it till winter in the normal version. As far as Don’t Starve Together goes, it adds a little content as well as making the game significantly easier. I’d suggest you’d get it if you’ve already bought and liked the original but find yourself wanting to shake things up by tossing in some other players. ConclusionGame play- 10/10. Music and sound- 10/10. Customizability - 10/10. Art style- 10/10. DLC- 10/10. This is the best survival game I’ve ever played or ever seen played.  It’s addicting, entertaining, and challenging. Without a doubt it’s one of my top ten favorite games. It’s also one of four games I think is as flawless as humanly possible.  Oh course, like all games, there is those who won’t enjoy it. So if you’re someone who doesn’t normally enjoy intense, extremely difficult games, the most likely won’t find Don’t Starve appealing. However, to anyone that doesn’t fall in this category, I’ll say this: Don’t Starve is a chef-d'oeuvre, a masterpiece beyond words, perfected in every way, and I can’t suggest it enough. Final rating- 100/100 one of the few perfect games on this earth.			"

												YES! YES! Another Minecraft themed game, not first person, not 3D but that's what makes this game unique, Almost as good as Minecraft if not better. In this game, you are given a character (you unlock characters later) and you need to survive for as long as you can, picking up resources that will aid in getting you a weapon or Light Sources and helping you in battle. There are lots of food for you to pick up which in my opinion was limited in Minecraft. This game also gives you access to Mods so you can download Mods from the steam workshop which i find helpful especially the mods that have a neverending light source. I am loving this game. This game lets you save your progress, Food is much easier to find than in Minecraft. Some of the features are better than Minecraft already. This is a 2D Minecraft! Simple as that. I definitely recommend you buy this game because it has come to the point where every Steam user MUST have a copy of this game. 10/10 Fricking Awesome			"

												Like in any extreme survival situation, the early moments of Don't Starve's grueling-yet-fascinating struggle to stay alive are electric. Suddenly the clock is ticking. Confidence is high as you first explore a vast open-world wilderness teeming with danger. From trapping a rabbit for the first time to crafting an axe to chop precious firewood before nightfall, every minor accomplishment that keeps you ticking is immediately gratifying. But as the days draw on and dodging death's icy grip gets harder, the rigors of this unflinchingly brutal roguelike adventure chip away at your patience.Don't Starve casts you in the unfortunate role of Wilson, a scientist who has been mysteriously transported to a strange and deadly world by a demon-gentleman. With little more than a quick greeting, your adversary vanishes, and you're left alone to figure out how to stay alive. Story and dialogue are pretty minimal, aside from a few encounters in the super tough adventure mode, which is accessed by first locating a portal hidden in the randomly generated survival mode world. The hands-off nature of the story is a strength, allowing the heavy atmosphere and outstanding visual design of this grim land draw you in. There's little time for dalliances anyway. A great many things in the game's eerie world are out to kill you from the get-go.Survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge. Your first few minutes of exploration hinge on harvesting whatever basic resources you stumble upon: a few twigs, some flint, rocks, a handful of grass. Collect enough of these raw materials, and you can make an axe, a torch, rope, a spear, and other crucial tools that increase your chances of survival. Don't Starve's deep resource harvesting and crafting system brings previous open-world games like Minecraft and Terraria to mind, and it's one of the game's strongest hooks. Figuring out how to put each item you collect to good use is a fun process of experimentation. Basic items are relatively easy to cobble together with minimal materials, though creating science and alchemy stations also pushes you further down the crafting rabbit hole by unlocking tons of more elaborate item recipes to pursue. Of course, staying alive long enough to build everything is another story.Dangers are frequently stacked against you in inventive and sometimes frustrating ways. Exploring, scavenging, harvesting resources, and building are best done in the day. Without a torch or a campfire to provide illumination when night falls, you will be torn to pieces by the demonic creatures that roam the darkness within seconds. Building a fire isn't enough either. You have to have enough wood or other fuel sources to keep it lit throughout the night, which creates a constant state of near panic every time the twilight phase of the day/night cycle arrives. Getting caught without the necessary ingredients for a fire or ample burnable materials to last the night spells instant doom.Changing seasons also usher in new problems to tackle. Live long enough, and winter rears its frosty head, bringing subzero temperatures that cause you bodily harm if you venture too far from a heat source. Admittedly, these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play. They sometimes tip the scale too far, however, particularly given the plentiful supply of other potentially life-ending obstacles thrown in your path.Managing your hunger, sanity, and health meters is a meticulous juggling act that demands a lot of your attention too. Food sources are often scarce, leaving you to scavenge berries, pull up wild carrots, and trap small animals early on to keep your belly full. While it's possible to build gardens and cook the meat of large beasts you slay to provide more-sustainable and gut-filling meal options, death by starvation is an omnipresent concern. When your stomach is completely empty, your health depletes rapidly until you die. Your sanity also depletes over time, and as it dwindles, you see more and more shadowy hallucinations and trippy visual effects. These hallucinatory creatures attack if you let your mental well run dry, and they're far from the only beasts you encounter.From giant cyclops birds and living tree monsters to carnivorous frogs and spiked tentacles, there are lots of creepy critters out there eager to end your existence. The rewards of battling them outright rarely feel like they measure up to the risk involved. Point-and-click combat is unfulfilling, since you basically stand there and whack away until someone dies. Often that's you. Slain foes may yield crucial ingredients for crafting and survival, but enemies are just as likely to kill you with a few quick hits before you have a chance to finish them off. Even docile critters can turn deadly with only the slightest provocation, since they tend to rally their pals in large numbers and come chasing after you en masse.Dying wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't wipe your progress away permanently. While other roguelikes make it easy to get up and running, building a foundation for survival in Don't Starve is labor-intensive and monotonous at times. When you finally gain a decent foothold on survival after spending so much time chopping wood, scavenging sticks, and fighting for your life, losing it all in a split second is absolutely agonizing. You lose steam after being wiped out a few dozen times and forced to start the whole process over from a few twigs and berries. Every day you stay alive in each run does add toward your total experience points, but that only unlocks a handful of additional characters to play.Adventure mode ups the danger and frustration substantially too, since it requires you to hunt down pieces to assemble portals across five increasingly tough world maps. Die once in, and you're kicked back to Survival mode, outside a portal. Granted, when this cycle gets too irritating, you can manually tweak the frequency of most resources, monsters, and perils before starting a new run. But it's hard to find the sweet spot between painfully hard and absurdly easy, since having everything at your fingertips saps the enjoyment of foraging and crafting.The way Don't Starve blends its crafting, exploration, and survival elements makes for an enthralling and unique combination. This game will readily eat up many hours of your time if you let it, but the promise each run holds never seems to pan out thanks to the insidious challenges the game constantly stacks against you. The initial sense of wonder that comes from stumbling upon the surprises and discoveries of this interesting world rapidly fades away when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground for the hundredth time. It's disappointing, because Don't Starve otherwise packs a tremendous amount of charm, depth, and intrigue.			"

Even more there are mods which you can download for free which makes the game even better. All in all I recommend this for every person who likes survival games. I rate it 10/10!			"

												Don't Starve is one of those games that put you right up on the difficulty roller coaster making you learn as you go with no real direction as what you are supposed to do. This lets you explore things slowly as you begin to get better at surviving and unlocking new characters along the way to keep the game a bit more fresh. The Reign of Giants DLC gives you more unique items and adversaries to play with.Overall, this game is great. One of my personal favorites on Steam.			"

												In its minimal and simple atmosphere, Don't Starve succeeded where many failed: delivering a balanced, challenging and story driven survival game.As the obvious main focus is to survive (and how hard it can be at the beginning!), the player will progress through a story that has an impact in the game (trying to avoid any potential spoilers).The survival machanism is traditional and unique at the same time:There are many resources to loot, and several items can have multiple uses (for example pine cones can be planted, used as fuel to feed the fire or become crafting material); exploring the land around you not only gets you to secret or story-related areas, but also signals how the world changes due to nature rhythm (for example seasons will progress and according to them resources may grow again faster or slowlier, the day/night cycle will change), moreover, it is always best NOT to explore during the night: the land becomes completely dark, pitch dark, and creatures will literally devour you unless you have a source of light, so it's best to build a safe place and dedicate the night to crafting and refining materials you gathered in the day.Crafting and researching new ""technologies"" is, of course, the vital part of the game. You start with some basic knowledge of craftable items, but you need to build scientific buildings (and stand next to them) to unlock more advanced options.The grotesque atmosphere is one of the winning points of this game: everything is weird and questionable, from totem-adoring pigs to crawling shadows. The overall feeling of Don't Starve is similar to when you read a fantasy book, curled up in your bed sheet as a thunder storm is raging from afar.If you love survival games, dark settings and challenging stories, get this game!

												This is the best survival game I have ever played. If you love survival, you are not doing yourself any favors by avoiding this game. It throws you to the wolves and does not hold your hand. Yes, the graphics are cartoony, but dont be fooled. This game will test your skills and you will die and die and die again. Grab the DLC's and you have a beast of a challenge to survive. Especially the new Shipwrecked DLC.I have owned this game for years and still keep coming back. The mechanics are deceptively simple, pick up as much stuff as you can and start trying to figure out how to survive. Not starving is only one priority. You will want to set up a camp and start doing science to unlock the best stuff. You will also have weather and heat and cold to contend with on top of the fact that nearly everything will try and kill you in one way or another. Caves add another layer of challange to the game with multiple levels of darkness and monsters to explore. You cook, build, explore, fight, and science the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of things to try and survive.Use Wiki or Youtube to help get started.Overall this game is one of my favorite all time games. Do yourself a favor and buy it now if you dont own it.			"

												Wow.....I knew I would enjoy this game...but I did not expect to put 250 + hours in it and still going! I had not played minecraft before this but it is cleat that Don't Starve takes the survival aspects of that game and totally runs with it...making the experience more brutal and tense. It is hard because you die...alot. But around the 12th time or so you start to learn what to do and what NOT to do. Once you pass the amount of days you've stayed alive...you feel a sense of accomplishment! Then you just try to beat your record over and over. But the game isn't just about that...there is a mysterious charm to it and very deep! There is a story even! Its hidden. Also, there is additional game modes that can only be accessed by putting time in the game and exploring. There's too much to say about the game....to newcomers...I would say give it time and enjoy the challenge and charm...try new things and eventually the game will click for you! I give it a 10/10....amazing job Klei!			"

												I've been playing games since I was 8 years old. I'm 21 now and I can tell you that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.With that said, I want to tell you why this game is so good.1st and most important of all is; this is a survival game. Meaning hard difficulty and permanent death. Even though, you can customize the world to your liking and survive with your conditions. The default version being the intended difficulty.2nd is the gameplay. You can move with clicking your mouse, just like in any Diablo-esque games. You can move with ASDW (which I prefer and recommend). It's simple to play and is very responsive. The game is simple in graphics and has really good animations (meaning anyone can play it!). The music and sounds are awesome but they might become repetitive at some point (at which you just turn them off :D). This may be one downside that bothered me a bit, but it is not a big problem at all.3rd is the game itself, you are placed inside a world where you are only told that you should look for something to eat. Don't starve is not nearly the only danger you should look out for. You have to stay warm in the Winter, stay cool in the Summer, protect your things, avoid monsters, kill monsters, survive giants, maintain sanity. But more importantly, you build structures, walls, farms, protective structures, traps, weapons, tools. Furthermore, you explore secrets, caves, biomes, animals, monsters, items! There are so many options in this game to explore. I have 40-ish hours on this game (for now) and I have only explored barely half of all the things that can be done. I haven't even customized the starting world yet! I've been playing default untill I got the hang of it. But the number of settings and customizations you can make to your world are nearly endless! You can also unlock other characters which all have different perks and abillities.4th and last are the community mods that can expand and improve your game greatly (I'm using 8 mods at the moment). Not to mention the upcoming multiplayer that will allow you and your friends to experience this survival game in a world that has your rules and settings.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes: survival / fighting / building and crafting stuff.Best regards, Devon.

												Don't Starve is an absolutely awesome survival game with a mesmorizing soundtrack and genuine dark, mysterious -- and sometimes satirical aura surrounding it.You start off with no weapons, no protection from the elements (aside from the preset clothing the character of your choice is given, which I will get more into later), and most of all, little knowledge as to where in the heck you are -- or how you got there (unless you watched some of the trailers.)You are spoken down to by this mysterious and dapper being sporting a traditional suit 'n tie, very reminiscent of the ""G-Man"" from the Half-Life series, he addresses you with a few words, and then poofs into nonexistance -- though you'll meet up with him in the near future.Don't Starve may SEEM like an absolutely pointless survival game with an infinite number of days, and that the clock won't stop ticking until you die (permadeath is a real thing, and you can't come back unless you've crafted yourself an effigy!) but fret not, there's more to this game than meets the eye!After what might be hours and hours of grinding, you'll find yourself coming across a variety of different scenarios - what looks like towns inhabited by xenophobic pig-men, stone ruins patrolled by mechanical 'robots', and much more. You'll find mysterious objects like ""Box Thing"", ""Ring Thing"", and they might just be miscellaneous objects you can just throw around and never pay any further mind to.. or they might be the key to 'beating' the game.My experience with the game has been absolutely splendid, I've encountered moments when I've been absolutely mobbed by armed pig-men, nearly scared to death by what looks like extraordinarily large turkies which pop out of bushes, and nerve-racking moments when my characters sanity begins to deterioate, causing haunting figures to appear..But lets break it down, shall we?PROS - A Survival Game: But a more well-designed and optimized one, constantly managed and won't be forsaken like what happens to most survivals.. (looking at you, DayZ)A Neat-o Crafting System: Items can be either very simplistic or slightly trivial to create, starting off is quite easy - mere flint and twigs and you have yourself either a Pickaxe, Shovel, or Chopping Axe, and can now chop down all them trees! (""Take that, Nature!"" -- Wilson)Insanely Vague Story: This can go both ways; some people enjoy a story that's fleshed out, has alot of dialogue, and is clearly presented to you, but not this game - the game itself doesn't provide the player much information to work off of, conclusions will have to be made on your own end, and there are plenty of wiki's that'll help you further understand the game.Wild Encounters: There are alot of things to see in this game, from the occasional mysterious item surrounded by 'Evil Flowers' that'll drain your character's sanity to wormholes that'll consume you whole and transport you to a different part of the map. (Wormhole transport systems are great, yo.) Not to mention the shifting of seasons, an abundance of sinkholes leading to caves, and with the addition of DLCs, you could be taking down colossal giants or sailing the seas. You could also purchase ""Don't Starve Together"" (free if you've already bought the base game prior to the DLC's release) and try and survive with friends, or random people on the interwebs!A Variety Of Characters: Wilson is the preset character, and has no other special abilities other than the ability to grow the most manliest of beards (I mean, what more do you need than that, right?) but there are also little old ladies, muscular men afraid of the dark, and even a little pyromaniac girl and her dead sister at your disposal. All with their own unique abilities.CONS -Tedious Gameplay: There are people who have yet to beat the game despite having weeks logged into it, YouTubers still at the first stage whilst on Day 300, so on and so forth. So if you can't handle devotion or have commitment issues.. might wanna steer away from this game a bit.Rage Factor: The rage factor in this game depends on your progress, really. I wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if I was brutally slaughtered by a spider on my first day.. but if you're the kind of person that has over 50 days, collected the items that'll help you progress through the game's ""story"" and are mistakenly killed by one of those♥♥♥♥♥♥headed frogs, well.. I'll set up a prayer circle to mend your broken heart and sanity.Game Length: This goes along with 'Tedious Gameplay', but just take a gander at the people who've actually 'beaten' the game and the hours THEY have. Or just go on YouTube and see for yourself.TL;DR - An absolutely phenomenial game, the music makes it all better. Don't buy it if you can't handle the whole survival concept, permadeath, and sheer overall length of the game.Graphics/Art: 4.5 out of 5Gameplay: 5 out of 5Story/Lore: 2.5 out of 5 (if not researched) 4 out of 5 (if researched)Overall Grade: 4 out of 5 "

												Don't Starve is about surviving in a hostile fantasy world filled danger! When night falls you must have a source of light, else the beasts of darkness will strip the flesh from your bones!  You must collect wood and start a fire, but even the trees in the forest can turn against you. Explore harsh landscapes with varying weather, collect resources, and attempt to protect yourself from not only the monstrous creatures, but the environment itself. Don't forget to mind your mind, either, lest insanity grasp you, and the bearded ones return!			"

												This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.   Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.  In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.  The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)  This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff. This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)   One last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.Another thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D			"

												We are all familiar with the stereotypical grunting, primitive, idiotic caveman. But have you ever tried going outside (bear with me, we're all gamers here) and trying to make a simple tool with only rocks and sticks? Given the fact that they were born into a world where it was kill or be killed and every day was a fight for survival, it's incredible what the cavemen managed to accomplish.In Don't Starve, you take control of a scientist named Wilson*, who has just been thrown into a world as deadly as those the cavemen lived in. However, you have the advantage of knowledge. You know what fire is and how to make it. But you better make it quickly, because the night is fast approaching, and unlike the cavemen, your stars and moon do not provide light. At least, not enough to keep the shadows away.Welcome to a world of survival, where terrors lurk around every corner, where hunger and madness can prove more dangerous than wild beasts, where death is always a few steps behind. Can you gather the resources you need to defy your own doom? Can you build, research, and advance, all while keeping hunger and madness at bay? Can you build a civilization to stand the test of time? Oh wait, wrong game. Anyway, the world of Don't Starve is filled with horrors and dangers. And that's not even including the winter.Oh, yes. Winter. The most dangerous time of year. Perhaps you thought you were safe from starvation with your bountiful crops of fruit and vegetables. But when the ground freezes over, the plants become stagnate. Now, right when you thought you were safe and secure, you find yourself on the brink of disaster again. For winter is the season of the hunt. But what are you? The hunter? Or the prey? Brace yourself. Winter is coming.Wait, wrong thing again. In any case, this game is a must-have for those who love surviving by the skin of their teeth. The art style is reminiscent of Tim Burton animated movies, making the game truly unique in its field. The gameplay is great, either with keyboard and mouse or with the steam controller. At the time of writing this review, I've played 70 hours of Don't Starve, and I've only scratched the surface. Maybe that's just because I suck at it, but even so I enjoy it immensely. And I haven't even gotten started on the DLC's yet!*Wilson is the default character, but there are many others, including Willow the Firestarter, Wolfgang the Strongman, and Woody the... well, you'll see. ;-)			"

												Well, Don't Starve Together, the multiplayer expansion of this is out, but it doesn't mean that this game is bad. It's a survival game. It's like Minecraft, but not in the slightest. This is the game that gets all the DLC that Don't Starve Together doesn't get. Also, the boss health in this version is smaller than in the Don't Starve Together game, so if you want to play alone, this is what you should get. Only problem is that the base game doesn't get updated anymore, but Don't Starve Together does. The DLC costs like 3 or 4€, i think. And the fact that the base game doesn't get updated, doesn't mean that the DLC doesn't. Fu*king cash grabbers. "

												I already reviewed this game, though I didn't do it justice the first time. This is by far the most addicting game I have ever played, and its stood strong for three years since its release back in 2013, and given that I have managed to survive for over 250 days in a world I generated two months ago, I felt it proper to give my overall thoughts on the game in general. I still recommend it for someone looking for a challenge, and anybody interested in this should definately give it a try, since it does offer a lot that other survival games do not have. On top of managing hunger, you need to manage sanity loss and health as well, making for a challenging experience. With Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLC, you can further expand your worlds with new challenges and items to craft. With an endless until you die Sandbox mode, and a portal to an Adventure Mode that offers six harder more challenging worlds, the replayabillity is near endless, with each world generating a completely different world layout every time.Also, if you end up liking this and would like to play it with friends or strangers, I'd suggest to take a look at Don't Starve Together, the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, complete with all new content and the Reign of Giants expansion content already included with the game.

												This is a very tentative upvote on my part.There isn't anything objectionable about this game; the aesthetics are excellent, the system in place is very well put together. However, I think this is much a case of YMMV on if it's fun for you or not. In my case I found myself searching for a goal and not finding one, which borked any reason I might have to continue playing beyond the first 10 or so runs. Sustaining interest by burning down the forest all through the night can only work for so long.If you are considering buying this game, look to the mechanics as you make your choice. Do you enjoy a procedural world where the only thing to do is gather resources and survive as long as you can? Then this is the game for you. If you need a goal the game gives you to work towards in order to maintain your motivation to play, then bypass it.			"

												50 hours on the XboxOne version and another 20 hours now that i downloaded it on PC. This is my go to time waster, So much fun and so immersive, it's one of those games that can make you late for work. On the downside, there is no tutorial and there is a bit of learning curve. It seems like everytime I sit down to play, I learn something new. This one is a must have.			"

												So difficult, frustrating and ... fun — this game is just what I needed. There is a lot of exploration, crafting, resource management, and combat, all of which are appealing and well executed and neither of which is at all forgiving. I am very curious about the direction in which the developer will take this game. Perhaps eventually a mode without permadeath? Who knows!			"

 Don't Starve  Is one of a kind survival game.You hear people talking about  Minecraft  being a difficult survival game, well you haven't seen anything yet. Don't Starve  Brings in all the basic elements of survival games - yet it twists them in a strage, yet clever way.It's difficult to explain - it just  does  Besides the obvious title, "" Don't Starve "", I don't think Not Starving is your main concern.Your more ""serious"" concerns should be  Don't run out of light  And  Do not go insane ""Don't Starve - Refueling your childhood irrational fear of the dark since 2013""			"

												:dsham:Isometric view survival game with quite unique, memorable art style.As you may imagine from the title, focus here is on non-combat survival - fighting hunger and adverse environmental conditions like weather or darkness at night. Granted, monsters are out there to get you as well.The game is rather open ended, no clear goals other than survival, although there's an adventure mode to find, which is a more focused challenge.You're definitely meant to discover things yourself on the go, through many deaths of you, forging mad in-game survival skills in fires of hell. If you're looking through guides, wikias, videos... you are somewhat missing the point and missing out great deal on the intended ""fun"".And good riddance, as far as I am concerned, and wikia contributors be praised. Otherwise game is very unfair, puts constant pressure on you, demands great deal from you yet explains nothing, all the while throwing curve balls at you from all possible directions simultaneously and just waiting for any suitable moment to sucker punch you with extreme prejudice. And on top of that this is perma death. You screw up royally, you're out of luck, and have to start from zero on a new random world (but hopefully with more experience now to do better; also I should say there's a way to secure resurrection, but not like it's fool proof, so the royal screw up is always an option).Seriously, eff that noise. I'm pretty sure die hard fans who went through this without any external help are suffering from Stockholm syndrome.As you may see I'm not entirely a fan of the frantic gameplay and main design decisions in general, but I cannot claim the game is bad. What it wants to do, it does very well, and it's an interesting experience to get out of your comfort zone, change the pace a little. Although I did get me some external help on how to survive in this hell, missing a lot of the intended ""fun"", I had some quality time nonetheless to appreciate this title and I don't regret it.It's not really that hard to set up some nice sustainable camp and a variety of defenses from weekly wake up call, you can even set up reasonable supplies despite your main focus here - food - being perishable... It's just that at some point this becomes a chore that prevents you from doing the real good parts. At least IMHOI had way more actual fun with, say, Terraria, which has quite a different focus - on combat and exploration, with ample addition of creative projects you can undertake, where gathering up resources is a means to an end not your primary worry. I guess I like to mess around in games, especially such that promise sandbox experience, at my own pace, rather than being constantly rushed and pushed and with perma death looming on the horizon to make me lose my entire progress. For the latter, I'd rather play some rogue-lites with well balanced pacing.You may probably get bit philosophical about this and claim this game gets it real... Too real for my taste, I guess. Where's my goddarned escapism, eh?Oh, a final thought, though - the above mostly concerns default settings, but actually the game is extremely configurable so once you do get the taste of the intended default experience, you can tweak practically every aspect of the game a lot to match your tastes and perhaps make it easier or even more difficult. Workshop support also something to consider, and official DLC that adds two more seasons, overheating on top of freezing and some other elements, is also something to mix things up. So despite my whining above you can really get a lot from this title, so give it a shot if you have a chance.:dsham:			"

It begins to turn to night so I put down a campfire and begin to mine, I hear the familar sound of a tallbird. I think to myself, ""this is no problem I'll just avoid it by running around the campfire all night, right? Wrong. More and more Tallbird sounds appear and soon I am being chased around the campfire by 6 Tallbirds who are hungry for my flesh. Morning comes and I run down from my campfire to discover a Tallfort (a real thing) with 20+ Tallbirds. 20 Tallbirds all attack me at once.11/10 would be destroyed by Tallbird orgy again.			"

Well with the beauty of steam sales  myself and this game met and we decided to crawl into a dark corner with each other and play...So why would i recommend this game? First of all it's pretty smooth i mean yeah it's a 2d game in a 3d environment but hell it runs nicely. The game gets challenging to survive and the world is random. The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												The title says it all. Don't Starve is one of those addictive survival games, delivering you with the idea that your character(s) lives are at stake. Alike many other survival games it aims to make the idea of food a priority, and the rest will seamlessly fall into place. However Don't Starve wouldn't be complete without its amazing mod support, in which you can build new stuctures or delve into new stories. The options are endless! Some of the mods can't support some of the options in the vanilla game, causes crashes and save wiping issues. Faced with alot of hideous monsters and natural dangers, Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on the market!Pros: Fun survival, great mod support.       Cons: Mods can cause crashes, would love to see it multiplayer~8.5/10~			"

												Let me start this review by telling you how I absolutely LOVE this game. Do note that this review contains spoilers and stuff that might ruin parts of discovery and fun in the game I cannot put my love for this game in words but I will try to explain some points of why I believe this is the revolutionary game that help video games progress as form of art.--------------------------------------First of all let me start by telling about the social commentaty this game makes. I know it's hard to see the social commentary in a game where you're all alone in the wilderness but it's there to be found. The social commentary is subtle and told in a very dark soul-ish way which is leaving hints and bits of information that the player figures out. There are multiple parts implying that the silent protagonist is a female-to-male transgender. For example the protagonist has very feminine jaw and chin. He also has feminine hair with lots of volume. Another not so noticed part is the depression in his eyes. Many think the depression is from being alone in the wilderness and darkness of the world. Well they're wrong. It is from the depression caused by being transgender and being oppressed by white cis men and women.---------------------------------Now to the story of the game. I know this is hard to believe for most people, even the most diehard fans of the game, but the game doesnt actually happen in wilderness but inside the person's dreams. The story is very metaphorical about everything. The safety of fire means support of loved ones when transitioning to opposite gender. The angry animals of the wilderness represent the people who are against his transitioning into a man. The neutral animals/critters are considered bypassers. Those are the people he is able to interact without the people being rude/different towards him just for being transgender.The day and night cycle represent the mood swing caused by hormones in transition. While this is not social commentary, it tells about how reality reflects to his dream which the game is. This mechanism is one of the subtle things that make this game a masterpiece.------------------------------We're done with the story now, lets progress to the gameplay.The gameplay is something completely fresh. You start of in a hostile world of no comfort, like transgender person is before getting his/her support for transitioning. Slowly you start gathering materials to get fire. The materials represent bits of trust you build up with other people. Fire represents, like I earlier explained, the support. This is a big gameplay aspect that makes this game extremely good.Another excellent game mechanic is the hunger mechanic. Hunger reflects upon the character's need for love. If he is let without love, he will most likely die. In the dream he isnt just likely to die if the hunger for love isnt fed, he will die.-------------------------------I know this might be shocking to even most diehard fans but everything in this review was researched for a very long time. I spent countless hours finding out all of this and much more. I didnt include everything I found out in this review because I wanted to keep this as a Steam review and not a full review for a bigger site. If you're hungry for more information and stuff I've found out, just ask me.This concludes my review and I strongly recommend everyone to play this.If you're big fan of art games, this is a must have.

It doesn't patronise, the communities around it are wonderful, and its Devs keep good ties to their community enabling good communication and support.

Faced with alot of hideous monsters and natural dangers, Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on the market!Pros: Fun survival, great mod support.       Cons: Mods can cause crashes, would love to see it multiplayer~8.5/10~			"

												This is one of those game i looked at and said bleh who would want to play this... Well with the beauty of steam sales  myself and this game met and we decided to crawl into a dark corner with each other and play...So why would i recommend this game? First of all it's pretty smooth i mean yeah it's a 2d game in a 3d environment but hell it runs nicely. The game gets challenging to survive and the world is random. The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												Day after day, hour after hour is spent building up the inventory; chopping, exploring, planting, building, crafting, cooking and there are more clicks needed to survive than you've had seconds in your life. And then you die.... and when you do, that's it. Finito. There is no save game, no ""go around again"" button. Permadeath!It's either some horrendously nasty forest boogeyman, a pack of wild dogs, some benign ""neutral"" that you attacked first (cos you just don't know right?) or the bitter cold or of course, you starve!You can die in a blaze of glory or die softly, subtle even... Either way, and there are oh so many ways.... you die.What stupid♥♥♥♥♥dropkick m0r0ns thought of game genres like this??!!!I love it. It's a first for me, this permadeath stuff. It won't be the last. At time of writng I put in 140 hours and I'm no doubt going to be doing more. PROS: Dying.CONS: Dying.I can't tell you much more except to say there is a good wiki and some almost ""essential"" mods if dying so often is not your thing.

												If you want to be surprised by a survival/indie game, then you should buy Don't Starve. This is one of the games that you can play for hours and won't even notice. Competing with your friends is quite fun. The game is very artistic and uses the graphic style to enhance the playing atmosphere. You definitely must buy this game!			"

												If anything there is to say about Don't Starve is that it's probably the best survival game out there at this moment. Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you. I have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters. Either way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it.			"

												Awesome little game. I was gifted it by a friend and I immediately was captivated by this little survival. At first the game seems very simple and the concept easy enough, but as you play you realize how incredibly deep the game actually gets. The days gets tougher, the enemies appear more, and winter slowly approaches causing you to rush yourself to get the material you need to survive! Fantastic little game and I definitely recommend it to anyone. I also heard it's on PlayStation Plus for free otherwise it is a 10 dollar purchase there. Either way, play this game.

Don't Starve is a survival/resource management sandbox game, and whether or not you enjoy it will depend largely upon how much fun you can have in said sandbox. The game is largely undirected; you're literally dropped in a field and told, fittingly, not to starve to death. After that you gather resources, craft items, and try to find a way out of the strange world you inhabit.There's a lot of game to explore. Each successive world is randomly generated and all are thus challenging in different ways. Nothing is ever explained; you learn by doing and exploring. Sadly, the various characters you unlock change things minorly at best, and the core gameplay never really changes: collect things, craft things, try not to die or go insane (and, with the new expansion, try not to freeze or overheat).Don't Starve good game, but not one I liked. I found the resource management tedious, and although the exploration and investigative elements were compelling, the constant ticking clock of starvation and insanity and freezing and overheating was too oppressive for me to enjoy myself.

												Alot of people say this is if Tim Burton invented minecraft, but I compare it to terria the more I play it. It's a top-down survival with a sense of despair. I love the simplicity of the art direction it's dark but charming.It's got nice mod support, but I'm gonna say 2/3rd of the workshop is just totally OP OCs or furry charaters with such little changes that It's basically Wilson( stock charater, he's not a bad option, he grows a beard that helps him with the cold and it can be shaven to make an item that could save your life) but without the beard.It doesn't have multiplayer which some people have a major proplrem with, but I sorta like it because I don't have the patience to keep my friends on par with what I do and it allows your friends to learn the game, which makes a dark and scary world not as scary.Definetly recommend it, but it can be annoying having to go through the begging of the game and get your base camp set up. Don't (starve) be overwhelmed by the cast of charaters, you die enough get to give them all a chance.			"

It is really rewarding when what you do works out. I would give this game a 9.2/10			"

												For what I played in the demo only, I could say it is totally my type of game of survival and environemental survival so far.  I hate not having had enough time with it...  :)  But I guess it was the whole deal with a full week-end (if ever I would had stayed home longer ;) ).Usually I flee demon related games within the exception of Diablo.  But this one so far in my full hour deserved all the attention I could put in it.  No tutorial but all too intuitive you end-up well immersed too.EDIT 24th May 2015I finally have the game and found the portal to stage 2 a couples of time.  No matter how long my game last (Normally now between 15 to 27 days in-game), I still marvel at discovering new things and tricks and I don't want to apply yet mods to fully discover this world and new strategies and how to pass winter.  I don't think I can ever being bored with it.  Just having some things more urgent to do IRL than quench my need to survival or quench my need to prove my ingenuity.  But yet I never yet seen the like!  It is fun, yet intuitive and just enough realism to see all seasons for a crafty enough player.  ;)			"

												Review written after purchasing the DLCAbout the Basic Game:Alright lets get it straight and simple: the basic game is an extremly hard, easily modable and overall fun survival game. Interesting mechanics, good combat mechanics, and in general no items are completly useless. Even if you allow your food to rot because you do not have a fridge yet to slow spoilage down it will still have a use as fertilizer. Every damn item has a use in this game and that happens not that often. No item is outperformed by another one. Each of them have flaws. Even ""inferior"" stone/flint which break more easily have a nice advantage over gold tools: They are alot cheaper to craft. Though the concept of gold tools is kinda stereotypic because gold is a really soft material... oh well. Oh and btw, you dont want to be in the darkness without a light.Creative and unique enemies with relativly decent movement patterns which will hit hard if you do not respect them as a propper enemy (though the regular spiders are a bit weak), fairly expensiv but powerfull ranged weapons, a good, well balanced armor system and very lovely characters to play with. You can even play as the main antagonist ""Maxwell"" if you finish the game. Each character has its own unique abilities giving him perks to support his survival in some way and having disadvantages making certain things harder. For instance Wilson: That character is unlocked from the beginning. He has very well balanced stats and as a special perk he grows a beard. Doesnt sound that special right? But the beard can be shaved and used as an effigy of himself in order to give him another try in case he dies. And extra lifes are EXTREMLY HARD to obtain in the game. Other characters like Woodie, a canadian lumberjack, has a fear of birds and therefor looses sanity near them, but brings his own unbreakable axe, a HUGE advantage over other characters. Also he is ""cursed"" which affects him at certain days (not spoiling too much).So after hinting on sanitiy theres also a very inspiring sanity/insanity system. Surviving in a lone, strange world with different laws of physics can be harsh. Where everything you encounter might kill you you might turn insane. Well thats the case in the game: You slowly loose your sanity if certain events are happening. For instance if you are in the dusk, exposed to certain terrifying hostiles or if you are close to some ""evil flowers"" which are poisoning the air arround them letting you go insane slowly. As sanity drops the character begins to hear weird noises, voices and starts hallucinating draining his sanity further. Once he is over a certain threshhold those ""hallucinations"" manifest and you have to fight extremly powerfull, otherworldly monsters who could have come from Lovecraft himself. Those ""shadows"" are able to teleport and as already said hard to kill. You have to gain sanity by doing ""sane"" things, like picking a few dozens of flowers, then throwing them away (well however that should keep you sane), wearing civilized clothes or killing said shadows. You need to be insane once in a while in order to survive alot better because said shadows drop a very usefull material. Lastly I like to point out the weather/season system: In the standard game without the DLC there are 2 seasons: Summer and Winter. Summer is relativly easy, you basicly setup your camp, gain materials, fight monsters, survive. Winter turns the game alot harder. You will start freezing without a fire or propper clothing, have trouble finding food (good luck farming in winter) and a giant mob called deerclops will spawn at some point who has to be killed in order to protect your camp and your hard work. Winter plays completly different then the regular seasons.And theres alot more content to explore then those highlights I listed up + the community really produces high quality mods for the game.So now to the DLC:I hate DLCs... usually. But if its that well done and for a price of 4.99$ then I can just say ""Go ahead buy it now"". It adds the remaining 2 seasons and turns summer into a drought. In spring you have to fight with dampness of your character because of frequent rain. Summer is a drought which means plants will wither and dont yield food, heat will affect you badly similar to winters cold, trees, plants, mobs, items on the ground, you etc will combust once in a while if its burnable and faster food spoilage will occur. Autumn is by far the most peacefull season... untill you encounter the Giant in autumn which is extremly hard to fight. He is basicly a far stronger version then winters deerclops and has a ""beserk attack"" where he (or it) will rush towards you destroying any contraptions you build and derooting trees. He will eat any food he can find if left alone and only turns hostile if you hinder him from eating. Thats just 1 giant. There is 1 giant for each season now, and the deerclops for winter got rebalanced and got a powerfull ""icicle erruption"" as a stomp attack causing icy spears to appear infront of him out of the ground. With all the new seasons, new giants/bosses and new survival mechanics... basicly all the content comes a heck of more items. Again all of them have uses and none of them are completly useless. And all of them are very balanced. Overall a very good ""DLC"" which I would rather call an addon because of the sheer mass of content it dumps on you. Oh and you get to play 2 new unique, high quality, characters with unique abilities. No reskins or anything like the stuff you get from bigger ""AAA"" companies. This DLC worths the money and is a great addition to the main game. I highly recomment getting both, Main game and DLC, its an awesome, joyfull yet extremly hard game. If you fail and die you lost everything if you dont have any kinds of resurrection methods. Its the thrill of loosing anything which makes the game really fun. And there are alot of mods out there, some just adding new items, some which add completly new ""levels"" to play as. Or just unique characters like a Weavile, The red Soldier (Jane Doe) from TF2, The Heavy from TF2, several LoL Champions or completly original characters with unique abilities (William J. Dannigar (hopefully I wrote that name right)). So go get the game if you want a challenge. Its fun and really enjoyable.-Sigma.			"

												This game's nice. Full of bloody surprises and you will be dying, again and again, then you finally learn how to play, set up a camp, harvest vegetables and create yourself a fluffly warm hat made of bunnies. You will mind your own business and avoid all the evil monsters. Maybe even invent stuff with your newly built science machine. SO HAPPY! Then a group of pinguins appears and you out of all the happiness can't resist to pet them. They instantly kill you in return. I didn't even visit places like worm holes and caves, the world is just too cruel. It's fun, just a little disappointing when you loose all your efford so easily. I like that you can modify the world to decrease the amount of evil in it and increase the number of carrots, before you start the game. Still, this one's a nerve kicker, I give it 7/10 "

												Don't Starve is an indie game about...not starving. Or getting killed by spiders. Or werepigs. Or stupid, randomly spawning dogs...or, well, there's a lot of ways to die in this game besides just starving, and I'll leave it at that. Overall, it's a rewarding, if not incredibly challenging, experience.Usually, indie games are highlighted by either their story, design or gameplay, which may prove significantly more innovative or intriguing than your average AAA game. That's why we buy them. Don't Starve is...a little bit different, to say the least, in that it's not all that inspiring in terms of story or gameplay. Here's the story: you don't want to starve, and also there's this dapper looking gentleman who appears to be channeling the ghost of a douchy harmonium. In terms of gameplay, point-and-click or use WASD to move around and interact with your environment, etc, etc. It's nothing that special.BUT! The design and presentation of the game make up for this apparent lack and reveal that the game itself is not nearly as lacking as it may seem to the wandering eyes of you potential buyers. In terms of design, its quirky, dark, funny and heavily Tim Burton-ized. The art style is simple enough that it doesn't overstep the abilities of its indie designers but still appears fresh, pretty and new, and each character you unlock through surviving longer and longer is unique, with his or her own set of perks and weaknesses that can be amusing, annoying or just plain scary. There's a girl who's dead twin literally follows her around, or a lumberjack with a possessed axe and a dark, beaver-based secret. Personally, I hope for more characters to be added to the vanilla game or perhaps as DLC because the current roster gets unlocked pretty quickly on an good three or four runs through the game. Still, these characters are more interesting than what you'll pick up from most games at this price.And when you do delve deep into this game after many, many, many trial runs, you'll discover that there's actually a lot of lore and story to this world. This mostly begins after entering Adventure Mode (and if you die in this mode, it doesn't affect your progress in the sandbox world), which can be done by opening a door randomly generated in any of your played worlds. You progress through five unique and challenging worlds, and along the way, you get a chance to see some of this lore and will probably hunger for more. Don't Starve leaves a lot more questions unanswered than I would like, but it's all to the cruelly addicting benefit of the game itself.Finally, I should address the difficulty of this game. You probably won't make it past the first five or so days on your first try without customizing the world. It's not an easy game, lacks any form of tutorial at all and all enemies, from bosses to weak spiders, can be found in the overworld on Day 1. Yes, there are one-time respawn points if you find them, but if you die, then it's over. Sometimes those respawn points don't even spawn. Your forty days of surviving through the turmoil of winter? Screw it! Never happened! And that does kind of suck, but it all adds to the tension and atmosphere of the game itself. You don't get a tutorial in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods! No one saves you when you decide to attack a herd of water buffalo with a stick of meat! And that mushroom over there? What does it do? Oh wait, it drains all of your sanity and makes shadow creatures in your head eat off your face. That'll learn ya.So yes, Don't Starve is difficult, especially during the winter months. But this is a survival game about surviving in a magical survival forest full of pop culture references and musical instruments. It's not supposed to be easy. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more rewarding than making it past your longest survival time. And if it's too hard, then you can tweak the spawning in a customized world so that only friendly bunnies and happy flowers populate your world. And occasionally, Satanic trees possessed with the vengeance of a thousand sundered splinters will pop up and absolutely wreck everything you hold dear and precious, as was intended by the Founding Fathers.

												  Terraria gameplay meets The Binding of Isaac creepy style.   Don't Starve is an odd game. It has no story, no instructions, doesn't offer much help. This is rarely a good thing. In this case it really really is. You get tossed in a strange, not to mention very dangerous, place with nothing but the clothes on your back.   First thing's first. The title. Don't Die wouldn't have had the same impact that Don't Starve has. Being honest, not starving, even though being tweaked countless times during beta, is a lot easier than not dying. The dangers are countless and unforgiving.   When it comes to graphics, the style is something to appreciate. Everything seems to have been drawn by a kid with too much imagination and that is actually remarkable.   When we look at games we look at certain things like story, graphics, gameplay, mechanics and so on. This being a personal opinion, I mostly look at gameplay and how good and fun it feels. Don't starve does that in style. From collecting twigs and grass you get to weild things from blow darts to magic wands, to wear from Log Suits to Miner hats and Football helmets, from gathering carrots and berries to creating a farm with plots to grow vegetables from quite an interesting variety. .   The best part about gathering food? You get to cook it. Cooking can be done at a simple fire that you build to survive the night or at a more complex Cooking Pot which allows you to combine to up to 4 items to create specific dishes from a nice variety of recipes.   As I mentioned above, you get to craft the tools and items you need to survive. The crafting system is interesting and it works great. You require certain items to do so.  Actually gathering the ingredients can be quite demanding and more often than not requires you to hunt some of the most dangerous creatures, a lot of the times costing you time and health that could cripple your survival or even end it.   The world itself is as it was in Terraria or Minecraft if you will. You encoutner different biomes each with its own rewards and dangers, from grass fields to rocky terrain, marshes and so on.   The goal of the game? There is none. You do everything you can to survive for as long as you can. The days survived counter is a testament of that. The in-game time is calculated in days in increments of 3: daytime, evening, night. The night time is the most dangerous time of the day as your field of view is limited, monsters roam around the world and your sanity gets drained a lot faster.   Your adventure time is also split into season. Winter is of course the most perilous season, requiring you to wear warm clothes or being near a big enough fire for fear of freezing to death.   On the topic of sanity. Sanity is an interesting mechanic. The more time you spend in the dark or fighting, for instance, your sanity gets drained. The more sanity you lose the more paranoid you become and shadow monsters, for a lack of a better description, start seeping into reality, from them creeping at the edge of your field of view to actually being able to attack you and you attack them.   The so called monsters, or should I call it prey, offer quite the challenge. From Beefalos to Tallbirds, Hounds and Tentacles that come out from the marsh, to Treeguards that intend to revenge their fallen brethren.   In the case of characters, WIlson comes out as the main protagonist but he is certainly not alone. The assortment of playable characters allows for different strategies. The other playable can be unlocked in an interesting fashion. You have to die to get experience and you get experience based on the number of days you survived.   The main conclusions are that even though permadeath causes you to obviously start from the beginning again and can prove tedious at times, the urge to see how long you survive and adapting your strategies as such provides quite the reward when you see the days survived counter go beyond your last try.   The other main conclusion would be that for the current price, the value is undeniable.9/10			"

												Awesome little game. I was gifted it by a friend and I immediately was captivated by this little survival. At first the game seems very simple and the concept easy enough, but as you play you realize how incredibly deep the game actually gets. The days gets tougher, the enemies appear more, and winter slowly approaches causing you to rush yourself to get the material you need to survive! Fantastic little game and I definitely recommend it to anyone. I also heard it's on PlayStation Plus for free otherwise it is a 10 dollar purchase there. Either way, play this game.

												For what I played in the demo only, I could say it is totally my type of game of survival and environemental survival so far.  I hate not having had enough time with it...  :)  But I guess it was the whole deal with a full week-end (if ever I would had stayed home longer ;) ).Usually I flee demon related games within the exception of Diablo.  But this one so far in my full hour deserved all the attention I could put in it.  No tutorial but all too intuitive you end-up well immersed too.EDIT 24th May 2015I finally have the game and found the portal to stage 2 a couples of time.  No matter how long my game last (Normally now between 15 to 27 days in-game), I still marvel at discovering new things and tricks and I don't want to apply yet mods to fully discover this world and new strategies and how to pass winter.  I don't think I can ever being bored with it.  Just having some things more urgent to do IRL than quench my need to survival or quench my need to prove my ingenuity.  But yet I never yet seen the like!  It is fun, yet intuitive and just enough realism to see all seasons for a crafty enough player.  ;)			"

												A great survival game with many hours sunk into it.  I'm not too fond of the giants DLC however -- while it adds many nice new features, I find it makes the game much too heavy on it's 'perma death' genre.  Chances are, you will lose your sanity and die before you're able to explore many parts of the game.I recommend starting by customizing your map settings...disabling the giants and perhaps even lowering the rate at which your sanity lowers.  Unless ofcourse, you're the gamer who enjoys dying over and over again...then the default settings should be ideal for you.I still enjoy this game and find myself comming back...there's also a decent mod community in steam's workshop.

												The title says it all. Don't Starve is one of those addictive survival games, delivering you with the idea that your character(s) lives are at stake. Alike many other survival games it aims to make the idea of food a priority, and the rest will seamlessly fall into place. However Don't Starve wouldn't be complete without its amazing mod support, in which you can build new stuctures or delve into new stories. The options are endless! Some of the mods can't support some of the options in the vanilla game, causes crashes and save wiping issues. Faced with alot of hideous monsters and natural dangers, Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on the market!Pros: Fun survival, great mod support.       Cons: Mods can cause crashes, would love to see it multiplayer~8.5/10~			"

												If anything there is to say about Don't Starve is that it's probably the best survival game out there at this moment. Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you. I have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters. Either way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it.			"

The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												If you are a fan of sims,like survival games,have a love for Tim Burton styled graphics,great humor, and detailed game play mechanics then look no further. This game has a lot going for it .Game comes with adventure mode and sandbox mode.In adventure mode you go from world to world surviving til you find all the pieces of a item that takes you to the next world.The game has a ending in adventure mode so its worth doing if you wish to see it.There are different characters in the game you can play as each with their own plays style.Some characters can only be unlocked in adventure mode but with the power of mods you can unlock all of those characters if you wish.Speaking of mods,the game is quite mod friendly and has many mods on the steam workshop for your pleasure.You need to know how to do slight lua scripting if you want to do some beefy mods,but tweaking value sets of items in the game is easy to learn.You hunt,set traps,gather resources(pick things,chop down trees,etc),grow crops,fight mobs,lead pigs,herd beefalo(a sort of bison),make camps,dry meats,fish,craft items,etc in the game.The game has 4 main status types you need to worry about; Hunger,Sanity,Freezing, and Soggy.To take care of hunger you eat.Sanity is a interesting status because when you start to go insane you being to face new challenges that can end up killing you.The world itself starts to look different and does more than just look different. There are various ways you can treat your sanity as there are ways that can make you go insance.Freezing, occurs but only during the fall - winter season and can kill you if you do not keep yourself warm.Soggy is a condition that affects food and fire, you do not want soggy food trust me..There is far more to this game than even I explained in this lengthy review.Still not convinced? Watch some lets plays on youtube or just have blind faith in my opinion :PP.S. Don't Starve together incorportes many of the vanilla content for co-op but incorporates things not found in the vanilla game and even its DLC expansion Reign of Giants.As of this review Don't Starve Together (a standalone co-op sandbox) is in beta status.

												It's very fun to play, its like a adventure game mixed with a survival game, all the mob's are very interesting but one thing thats very tedious is the fact that the Mobs do so much damage with just one blow and the fact that your health regenerates so slowly. But all in all its a enjoyable game, and i would recommend this game.			"

												If you are a fan of sims,like survival games,have a love for Tim Burton styled graphics,great humor, and detailed game play mechanics then look no further. This game has a lot going for it .Game comes with adventure mode and sandbox mode.In adventure mode you go from world to world surviving til you find all the pieces of a item that takes you to the next world.The game has a ending in adventure mode so its worth doing if you wish to see it.There are different characters in the game you can play as each with their own plays style.Some characters can only be unlocked in adventure mode but with the power of mods you can unlock all of those characters if you wish.Speaking of mods,the game is quite mod friendly and has many mods on the steam workshop for your pleasure.You need to know how to do slight lua scripting if you want to do some beefy mods,but tweaking value sets of items in the game is easy to learn.You hunt,set traps,gather resources(pick things,chop down trees,etc),grow crops,fight mobs,lead pigs,herd beefalo(a sort of bison),make camps,dry meats,fish,craft items,etc in the game.The game has 4 main status types you need to worry about; Hunger,Sanity,Freezing, and Soggy.To take care of hunger you eat.Sanity is a interesting status because when you start to go insane you being to face new challenges that can end up killing you.The world itself starts to look different and does more than just look different. There are various ways you can treat your sanity as there are ways that can make you go insance.Freezing, occurs but only during the fall - winter season and can kill you if you do not keep yourself warm.Soggy is a condition that affects food and fire, you do not want soggy food trust me..There is far more to this game than even I explained in this lengthy review.Still not convinced? Watch some lets plays on youtube or just have blind faith in my opinion :PP.S. Don't Starve together incorportes many of the vanilla content for co-op but incorporates things not found in the vanilla game and even its DLC expansion Reign of Giants.As of this review Don't Starve Together (a standalone co-op sandbox) is in beta status.

												Frustrating, and yet a great game to play! You got 1 life, and thats it! Don't starve is a very fitting name for this game, hunger will be one of your greatest opponents, but sanity comes in great as a second! At night, when the creepy monsters come.. When you're nearly dying of hungry and slowly start to go insane. That is when things start to get creepy! Where did that music come from!? Stay off my campfire! Oh no, My torch just ran out.....The art is simple but appealing, reminds me of Tim Burton a bit. The characters speak an amusing jibberish, and all of them have great up- and downsides depending on your playstyle.This game may cause some rage-quits, but it is very rewarding to stay alive! .. My Rage quit: . After i set my own farm on fire by accident with a very nervous Willow (character, who loves fire a tad too much) my hp started to drop because i was starving without my crops. A few minutes later 3 hounds came and ate me. Damnit! Mother of all ragequits.. And yet i started to play again within a day. It's just so appealing. The Reign of Giants DLC is fun, but not my cup-o-tea. I prefer the normal version. But it is fun to mix and match up at times, i would still recommend atleast trying it.			"

												Don't StarvePros: Great time killer, cute animation style, deep crafting and survival system, always a new experience with plenty of replayability.Cons: Difficult to grasp at first, must learn from previous mistakes to improve, at times can feel slow.I enjoy Don't Starve a lot and it is really fun to try and 1 up your previous attempt(s) and live for just a little longer. Although the game will constantly surprise you with somthing new that kills you, that is all part of the fun. Trying not to starve is usually the least of your worries here.			"

She sits and suggests all kinds of things that we should try to make with various objects found, she wants me to build a house and ""GET BACK TO THE HOUSE!"" When it gets dark...and then she wants to explore when it's light. This is a truely bonding experience and I've found it so very enjoyable.She asks about and references ""Don't Starve"" in day to day things and it is truely an amazing thing for us both. I collect Video Games from DOS-Atari-NES-SNES-and onward. Thank you for this game, it's really fun I've always enjoyed it but I am so glad that it gained her interest as well.			"

												Pros:1. The artstyle is amazing.2. New features are added regularly.3. The game is relatively bug-free.4. Great season-cycles and day-night cycles.5. Clear end-game goals.Cons:1. I think there could be more craftable items.2. Extremely unforgiving. I think there should be some mechanism that allows you to get back to base from the resurrection stone otherwise it gets too hard if you die in winter.Overall, its an excellent game and I have made 4 of my other friends buy it as well. If you're an indie game lover and can't commit to long gaming sessions, then this is the game for you!			"

												The game is indeed a great survival adventure and I don't regret wanting it and then buying it at all, but I also can't deny that I'm pretty disappointed in developer's choice of not supporting ""Steam achievements"". I like tracking my progress and my dedication for a game through those achievements, and displaying those was often the only way of showing off. I don't mind the perma-death and the frustration that comes with it, it's a survival game after all. It reminds me quite a lot of those WC3 survival maps, which is a good thing cause those were really fun, but also of Faster Than Light because of the frustration and perma-death parts.Anyway, the game is awesome, artsy without getting fancy, complex without getting complicated, and incredibly addictive. I can hardly wait the arrival of the multiplayer mode too.			"

												Tim Burton meets Gathering / Crafting adventure game goodness.This game captures my imagination like very few others. What it lacks in immersion it makes up for in truckloads of creativity and art originality.Some of the mechanics feel a little ""left by the wayside"" such as combat, which to me has always seemed to work a little haphazzardly. But the exploration and curiosity factor are so over the top its very easy to forget such things might get in your way.The music and sound fit perfectly with the art style in a melancholy yet purposeful romp through a dark and twisted wonderland of putrid or warped settings.I've had a blast playing Don't Starve, on and off Steam. Don't let my Steam playtime fool you, I'm a long standing supporter of Don't Starve and highly recommend it to anyone with a penchant for slightly warped or morbid yet humorous adventures.			"

												8/10The game is ammazing and bloody addictive!!!The game is A lot of fun, You dont really get any instructions as to how to play the game. So a good way to figure it out is to use the WIKI here http://dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Wiki I've used this a number of time's to figure out things that are a bit confusing at the start.The Main goal of the game is to simply try to survive and ""Dont starve"" :D.....This game has kept be busy for ages, And I jenerally dont survive any longer than 14 days in the game.Another note worthy thing about the game, Is the Modding community. Lots of brilliant mods to make the game either harder or easyer. Really depends on how you like playing.The new DLC ""Reign of Giants"" Adds a lot to the game as well. Lots of new things to find, explore and figure out what they do. It's enough to confuse you again and make the game seem fairly fresh.As per normal with my higer rated games... DO YOUR SELF A FAVOUR AND GET IT. It's worth the price			"

												Growing up under illegal sovjiet rule I know this theme very well and found myself very much at comfort with the gameplay and, esspecially now that we are victims of the EU and have a plague of Arabs, Polish and Turks in our land too. It is a very realistic game right down to the accurate simulated model of sanity and the effects that you may have when running from a lot of angry foreign creatures who live only to kill you. For some this game is only a game but, for me it is a tool to test my survival skills in varying scenarios that may be fall me or, any other person on the street here.			"

			First Look Don't Starve video showcasing PC Gameplay. Don't Starve reviews, impressions, tips and features to get you started. Thank you for watching, like, comment and subscribe if you enjoyed!		

Don't starve brings a lot of genres/games together. It's quite tough being able to survive and stepping up to the next levels. Actually that's what makes this game so interesting, the challenge.You can have 5, 10,200 games in Don't Starve but they will always result in a different outcome.			"

												This is a wilderness survival sandbox featuring lovecraftian horrors pig men jackalopes and other strange things. You start in a sandbox mode shanghied by the mysterious maxwell and can work through an adventure mode within the sandbox.You have 3 stat bars health hunger and sanity controling these stats is the key to surviving as long as possible. You build prototypes of new equipment and structures to advance in the game and increase your probability of long term survival. This is not another minecraft clone and is an awsome game despite lack of multiplayer. Hunting gathering trapping beekeeping crafting fishing herding, all possibilities in this immersive game. Overall definatley worth the price if you like sandbox games and survivalism in general intruiges you, give this game a try.			"

			Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety.		

Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety. Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.But, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.So as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.My only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap. I personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!TL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together! -Double Thumbs Up from Royial			"

												This is a great game, I've suggested it multiple times to anyone watching my twitch channel while playing it. It's got an amazing Tim Burton-eque art style with plenty of survival aspects. The world is randomly generated so you'll not get the same map multiple times unless you wish to (there's an option to retry if you die on current map).Many people ask, ""How do you get further than 10 - 20 days""? Practice, play the game, it's a survival game. Explore, craft stuff and mainly look at your surroundings for what's most helpful (beefao).Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves Survival games, give it a try and if you get stuck there's an always growing wiki page for the game. You're going to die, it's a feature.			"

												Almost 40 hours into the game and I've only scratched the surface. I have just managed to survive the winter with some ease but I haven't even tried the adventure mode nor gone into any caves nor hunted the Koalephant nor fought the walrus or any of those chess-inspired-geared-thingies... meaning that I have yet to explore more than half of what Don't Starve has to offer.I can't wait to experience the rest of it and maybe someday even try out the terrifying-sounding DLC Reign of Giants....or at least gain some experience so I'll be a good partner in Don't Starve Together. The game is worth definitely every euro (or dollar) it costs. It has a vast, beautiful, intricate and carefully built world with interesting mechanics and adorable sounds!			"

												A captivating game, with a brilliant art style, and a fantastic mechanic of not being told what to do, Don't Starve is a game that with its updating will keep you coming back for more. Rarely has a game got me so excited, but I really can't say how fantastic this game is.It has balanced an different characters, all with a unique optimal playstyle. With the hostile and unpredictable environment, players must fight for survival at all costs, revelling in the luxury late-game provides. Whilst yes, you do hit the content wall, name another wilderness survival craft em' up game that doesn't.I could not be more excited for the upcoming DLC.			"

Like i think it'd be great if there was 'cause some of us players would want to have 'em.Edit - shipwreck early access review- This dlc is just amazing and it just makes the game 50% more fun and better than it already is.Jellyfishes, crabs and coconut coming from a palm tree, I mean what can we possible not like?

												Don't Starve is one of those games where the only word that justifies it's quality and content is ""perfection"". It is such a complete experience, it has everything you would want in a survival game, and the level of content is monumentous. The one thing that really makes this game a treasure is the simplicity. What? You might ask. I will try to explain:The UI/ menus are perfectly uncomplex. They are neat, responsive and incredibly easy to navigate as everything is very well organized.The inventory spaces are placed neatly at the bottom of the screen and are always available to you. you have the option of organizing your materials into a few groups with slight spaces between lots of inventory slots. The clicking + dragging mechanism makes this process so much easier. I often organize all my edibles into one group, main building materials into another and tools/ armours/ weapons into another. The crafting system is also very easy to grasp. You can click whatever it is you want to build in the menu to the left and see what kind of resources you need to craft that item, with pictures of the actual items which makes the whole identifying process a breeze. The map is excellent. You can see (as far as you have travelled) key locations such as berry bushes, forests, different biomes e.t.c... You can also see where you've built stuff, if you have. This is very important if you don't want to get lost!The actual physical game map that you travel on is amazing. Resources are easy to find, click and collect. Your main tools (hatchet, pick-axe and shovel) require the most basic resources so you will easily be able to replace them without much hassle. This is also probably the only game where people won't question your pathological excitement over poop.Trust me, you will have so much fun just collecting hordes of resources and then putting them to use and generally just trying to survive another day. The game does get difficult, especially if you have the expansion enabled, which offers a whole new and exciting experience, but even if you fail, you'll want to immediately start again and perhaps learn from your previous mistakes and do things differently. I simply cannot find one negative aspect in this game, it is, as I said before, perfection. "

												Love this game think I am going to be playing this for a while.  I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  I really like the crafting and gathering in this game the bunnies are cute and furry and the enimies are super scary... buuut this game can really make you rage.  Permadeath with make you punch something after losing your 6 hour + game to a stupid mistake.  I have lost a ton of characters to just forgetting about something like poison or not healing before a fight.  The game gets better with additional playthroughs and you will see very different worlds each time.  The game has changed a lot since launch and I think klie is making even more content.  I don't think I have ever seen a single player game with so many free content patches.			"

I am not the type of gamer who wants to sit through an introduction on how the game is played, or the 20 minutes of intro scenes. This game takes all of that away and leaves you will really unique game play where you have to constantly keep up with your hunger, sanity, and health. After playing for a few hours, I realize how much more to this game that there is. If you have $15 to spare on a game, this would be a good choice!			"

												Don't Starve is an inventive indie game with endless replay value. It constantly updates, so there's always something new to discover. The art style is creatively done like a storybook and the graphics are very sharp. Story wise, the goal is fairly simple: to survive through many worlds in order to defeat Maxwell once and for all.

												One of the most difficult games I've ever played, yet I keep coming back for more. It'd be easy to stop playing out of frustration, the game doesn't teach you anything and you learn simply by doing. With every death means starting over from scratch, the permadeath is both punishing and extremely rewarding to see how far you will get and how you must adjust your strategy in order to survive. The odds are stacked against you, but it never feels unfair. There is always something you could have done better or a different route you could have taken that may have lead to you living longer. Believe it or not you can even beat this game, or so I've heard.Nothing is more satisfying than figuring out a new mechanic while you are playing simply from experimentation, this game is so finely tuned and balanced that it must've been a nightmare for the devs to make. The combat is excellent yet simple and easy to understand, it is really all you could ask for in a Survival Crafting type game. And to make things even better the Multiplayer version of the game is even more fun, although not yet as feature complete as the singleplayer variant.The graphics are simply beautiful and extremely charming, nothing is more adorable than a sleeping homeless spider or a recently shaved beefalo. Add in unlockable characters, an excellent and tweakable world gen, and a plethora of mods on steam and you have a game that is well worth replaying.			"

Getting through the adventure mode is very difficult and requires making good strategic decisions all the way through. One stupid mistake and everything you struggled to create is gone. HARDCORE.The ""Reign of Giants"" DLC adds to the difficulty of the game thanks to a lot of new elements, one of the most significant being the introduction of two new seasons.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging/original gaming experience.

												I wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not initially but I was always interested in it. Now I want to kick myself for not picking it up earlier.  Its a pretty tough game to navigate the first few times, and I'm still trying to survive winter but I get a little closer every time.  I appreciate the fact that once you die the world is gone, but it does discourage me to not play for a day or two afterwords. Once I start it back up though I'm hooked right back in.Its funny how often things can go completely wrong in this game (I'll just attack that beefalo annnnnnd I'm dead) but adapting to bad situations and managing to survive despite the odds against you is really satisfying.  It almost reminds me of the first time I played Minecrraft survival, except much harder, and also much more rewarding.  This game is good at creating memorable moments and it makes exploring really fun.  Just buy it already.			"

												Really fun game. Its additive but can be boring and repetive after you have everything and the idea of actually starving is ridiculous also its really annoying after you die and you feel like you never wanna play this game again!			"

												This game is amazing. It's psuedo 3D graphics mixed in with some artistic ""horror""-theme art style is truly giving the game it's own feel to it.This is a survival game that truly challenges you to survive. Pick up flowers to regain sanity, eat food to fill your belly and eat spider sacks to regain health. Love it.			"

												""AH♥♥♥♥♥♥HOUNDS!"" i yelled, running through the woods in my attempts to escape the beasts. nearly bled out from making mysterious 2 legged pig men angry. What did i do to deserve this harsh world? Everything is fubat. Tree monsters hide in the forrests, spiders all over the place, insanity growing, hunger rising. Now this. Will this finally be my un-doing? To loose all i have gained onlt to start a life anew in the constantly hostile world. Only comparable to that of a schtizophranic mind. Beasts roam wild and all is dangerous. So few are the safeties of the fire in winter, and so rare is the safety of defences at night. Scavenging was hard enough to survive for the first few weeks. Now im going to die bie these blood thristy hounds of hell, or wherever such beasts were created. WAIT! a hole in the ground! I must get to it in order to survive. I jump down, only into darkness. Insanity is building, i see things in this dark tunnel. What awaits on the otherside? When i awaken my eyes, i am in a land i have yet not seen. My pursuers may not have easily given up, so i must run. Run fast, run far; only that i could if my stomach wasnt so empty, aarg i must have something to eat. Thankfully theres some bushes, but is that....a spiders nest? with little strength left, and a spear in hand, I make the short path to the dangerous bushes. To so i dont allow my self...to dont starve.9/10 for immersion: Very dangerous gameplay, you must be quick to think, or die from the elements of this vast and wierd place. I must say even being experienced in survival games, the night times in here are terrifying and detrimental to your health if you are un prepared to venture fourth in such time.10/10 for creativity: Very different sense of survivalism, if you like turkeys to be hulking 2 legged beasts, and any sort of socialness to be between a living pot following you, and pigmen. This is definitely for you.8/10 mechanics: Simple to use, as simple as click to move, use, everything else you need to know. Though i had alot of problems with picking up items behind other items. Which quickly became a nuissance.			"

												Don't Starve has a simple premise: Survive as long as possible. However, that's easier said than done, and this game has quite a bit of content to make it an enjoyable game with plenty of replay value. At the start of the game, you can choose from a group of characters to play as. You will start with only one option, but unlock more as you play through the game. Most are unlocked through experience points that are gained after dying, with a few hidden through various other methods.After choosing your character, you wake up in the wilderness, and are forced to find materials to help yourself survive. There are other living things in this game, ranging from ordinary animals to strange beasts such as pig-men or walking trees, and a lot will try to kill you. You will need to keep yourself from starving by making use of food found throughout the world, keep your sanity high so you don't begin to hallucinate, and keep close to light at night so the shadow beasts won't kill you.  Traversing the large area you play in is a lot of fun, and hunting for materials can feel very rewarding when you finally find that last gold nugget you needed for a science machine. You'll need to plan very carefully, as a mistake can lead to death. The game gets addicting very quickly, and each death will only build your knowledge of the world until you can finally get the lucky attempt where you survive past winter. The sense of progression is fantastic, as you can easily see how much your hard work has paid off. The game is in a very nice art style that suits it very well, and the sound effects really add to the atmosphere the game has.Pros:+Fun and pleasant visuals+Excellent use of sounds+Variety of different characters makes each game interesting+Wide cast of allies and enemies you will meet+Addicting gameplay that allows the player to learn as they play more+DLC that's really worth the price+Steam workshop mods really add to the overall experienceCons:-The game is very confusing at first, and doesn't really offer any sort of tutorial. This isn't too much of a problem, but can make the game really confusing for some playersIf I had to give the game a score, it would be a 9/10. The lack of direction at the very start is the only potential issue I can think of, and even that isn't much of a problem for most people, myself included. I highly recommend this game, especially now that Don't Starve Together is in beta!			"

												This game is stunning: the artwork, visual, concept, and the sound. The gameplay is a great sandbox game where you must gather things to craft items and trying to survive. I love minecraft so this one is totally a must have one. I really respect the artwork where it is so gloomy, dark, horror, and thrilling but also funny and cute. It is an addictive game, especially when you die and learn something new. Once you try this game, you will fell in love with the gameplay and when you know how hard it is to keep your stomach full while being chased by hounds, or when you were trying to keep your self sane when there are no more resource left in your area. Everything in this game is trying to kill you and you need to survive while keeping your stomach full. The spider will kill you, the hounds will kill you, the were pig will kill you, the tree will kill you, the darkness will kill you, even your shadow will try to kill you when you lost your mind.Frankly, I am going to miss this game when I am older. Thank you Klei for making this great game. "

												This game for me was a huge surprise , first impressions was like Tim Burton made this game. The environment is so cartoonist and dark, very nice. Well like the game name says, 'Don't Starve', this is our main goal, survive, make our own corn field, survive the winter - Winter Is Coming - and fight against some animals. Days will pass on DS, and are only 3 things that can kill you, hungry monsters or if you get bored. And why i say this? Well, like in any survival game you need to survive, but you need to build things and some times take a long time, and you may have luck or not to find those material fast. After some in-game days, you can specialize your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons.Another inconvenient could be the world generation, you can get a nice world like a few meters away from you, you find a boomerang and some provisions or you have generated a bad world and you won't find anythng good.This game also lacks on some details like not having a mini map on Hud and others things, but don't worry to much because there are mods that you can add to the game to make it perfect. Now the biggest things the game should have, Multiplayer! This has been asked so many times and the answer is always no, but i kind understand it because is a survival, and you should survive alone. I'm pretty happy with this game and although i don't have many hours i expect to play more on future, also huge amen to Klei Entertainment for making such awesome game! ~ 8/10			"

												I've always liked survival games. They are rare, very rare to come upon on. The game is sort of like other survival games like Minecraft. However, people can't make copies of it like they can with Minecraft. Don't Starve is good in it's own little way. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes exploration, hand drawn graphics, or mysterious you-never-know-whats-gonna-happen games. The game is challenging and fun. It has way more variety than Minecraft when it comes to animals. I'm not saying that Minecraft is bad, but Don't Starve is a bit better than how it appears. You would know if you played the game. So do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												Combining the aspects of survival, adventure and sandbox into one game full of mystery and wonder makes this well worth playing. Since every world you play in is completely randomised, the adventure never stops as you explore, fight and survive as you delve deeper to find every little thing to do and uncover. So, if anyone out there is up for a good challenge, then Don't Starve is the one for you. Plus, with the Reign Of Giants DLC coming out soon, you can be sure to be surprised and running for your life as you discover what this game has in store for you...			"

												To all those who say there is no story, you obviously have not played enough. Inside the game there is an ""adventure mode"" which is basically story mode(and very challenging).Crafting is a primary part of the game. It starts very simply — you'll pick up items in the landscape to construct simple tools, necessary to break down more raw materials. The system expands all the way from grass and twigs up to scientific machinery, complex farms and magical devices. The tech tree has enormous depth and room for experimentation, all dependent on your priorities.I recommended this game to anyone who wants to have great time for a couple of hours.			"

												For such a simple objective--not starving (or dying by creature, cold, heat, darkness, or other means)--this game is extremely rich and complex.  It has two modes; a sandbox survival mode in which your goal is simply to explore and become self-sustaining, and an adventure mode in which your goal is to overcome harsh environments to complete a machine to move to the next world.  You can play either in the spirit of discovering how to construct, create, and build everything yourself or consult and external reference for help, but either way, you'll be presented with a challenge that will keep you occupied and wanting to go a little further for weeks.  I highly recommend it!			"

												With a title like ""Don't Starve"", you'd think you'd only have to worry about finding food. And you would be sorely mistaken. The maps are randomly generated, so what was a problem for you last time you played might not be such an issue for you now. That said, the things that came easy last time may not be so simple this time. For example, I frequently found myself running out of food on my first few attempts, while things like developing new technology came easy. However later on food was a bit easier to find, but I had trouble finding the stone and gold needed to unlock new recipes. THEN once I'd finally found a balance, I made the foolhearty mistake of taking too long to light another torch at night. This game is extremely difficult and while normally a frustrating mechanic such as having to start over everytime you die would put me off, I found myself going, ""Well, that sucked. But I wonder what's in store for me next time?"" If you're like me and love a good adventure, even if it tests your patience a bit, check this title out. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Don't Starve and Dwarf Fortress share one thing in common; losing is fun!The game itself is a huge learning experience, and you'll always get further (usually) the last time than you did the first time.  Even if you manage to make a self-sustaining base that was indeed somewhat indestructable, the game would lose a lot of what made it fun to begin with.  Of course, getting to said point requires said experience; which depending on the person may or may not actually come.It's brutal at first glance, but even after you get better; the game doesn't stop getting harder.  If anything, the longer you live, the more merciless nature itself gets.  If you're not prepared, then prepare to die!			"

												Don't Starve is easily one of the best indie games available on Steam.In a nutshell, Don't Starve is a rogue-like survival game aimed specifically to punch you in your nuts so it can give you a taste of permadeath. It's main pros are:- A library of characters to choose, from Wilson, a intrepid scientist who can grow a beard, to Woodie, a Canadian lumberjack who has a terrible curse. - A immersive world full of things ready to be discovered, and possibly ready to wreck you up while it's at it.- A vast army of creatures that can possibly either help you or hinder your chances of survival.- Unforgiving deaths. You ♥♥♥♥ up, you die and restart. All of these combined make for a great game and it's easily reccomendable. Not to mention that Klei Entertainment, the company behind it all is fair and produces high quality products and they're trustable as a team.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Hounds are little annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that will be happy to ruin your day.			"

												Absolutely amazing game, that will have you coming back for more every time you die! At first I bought it just because I enjoyed the art style during a steam sale, had no real expectations of how the game play would turn out. In short, its one of the best survival games I have ever played. Always something to do, something to improve, an adventure to go on, MORE FOOD TO GATHER, and before you know it its day 200! And to top it off, now you can struggle to survive with friends in Dont Starve Together! One day I will fully explore a cave!			"

												This game for me was a huge surprise , first impressions was like Tim Burton made this game. The environment is so cartoonist and dark, very nice. Well like the game name says, 'Don't Starve', this is our main goal, survive, make our own corn field, survive the winter - Winter Is Coming - and fight against some animals. Days will pass on DS, and are only 3 things that can kill you, hungry monsters or if you get bored. And why i say this? Well, like in any survival game you need to survive, but you need to build things and some times take a long time, and you may have luck or not to find those material fast. After some in-game days, you can specialize your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons.Another inconvenient could be the world generation, you can get a nice world like a few meters away from you, you find a boomerang and some provisions or you have generated a bad world and you won't find anythng good.This game also lacks on some details like not having a mini map on Hud and others things, but don't worry to much because there are mods that you can add to the game to make it perfect. Now the biggest things the game should have, Multiplayer! This has been asked so many times and the answer is always no, but i kind understand it because is a survival, and you should survive alone. I'm pretty happy with this game and although i don't have many hours i expect to play more on future, also huge amen to Klei Entertainment for making such awesome game! ~ 8/10			"

												Is this game worth £11 you may ask? Silly question, of course! Inclusing the DLC too, this game is a bundle of amazingness. Don't starve is , if not, on it's way to becoming the best gaming experience around. The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.If you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better? This game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!Overall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one.

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

Sure its a survival game, but after playing it the first few times you feel as if you are on a mission show what killed you before whos boss. The art stlye beautiful and despite being out for a while it continues to grow as a community and a game. Everytime you die you start over with new knowledge than you had before. DLCs  and Mods add for a fun experience that change things up when it seems a little tedious, but as a whole it is fun to try and beat your own score of how long you can survive. Make bold decisions, and don't give up. "

Product received for free
												Gather resources, build weapons, cook food, kill mobs ... sounds like Minecraft eh?That's where the similarities end. This game can be brutal as everything in this game will kill you ... I mean everything!!!Bees ... kill you!Spiders ... kill you!Hounds ... kill you!Horny Beefalo ... kill you!Insanity ... kills you!Hunger ... kills you!Darkness ... kills you!Even winter ... yep, you guessed it, winter kills you as well!If you like survival games and the Tim Burton style graphics, you'll love this game! However, you may find the game challenging and a little frustrating at first until you start to find your way. Don't let this put you off because as soon as you find your way you will immediately find yourself addicted and telling yourself ""just one more day then i'll switch off I promise"" only to find yourself playing through at least another 10 days ... well, if you survive that long.My tips for getting started:- Explore anywhere and everywhere but find a good base within 5 days if possible ... pigmen are your friend and so are Beefalo (just not when horny!) so pick somewhere nearby- Gather resources as quick as you can and when you think you have enough, collect more ... you'll NEVER have enough!!!- Always make sure you have the ability to make fire, and- Get a weapon ... you never know when the first attack is coming.Remember folks, winter is coming (as well as a lot of angry mobs) so be prepared ... and whatever you do, Don't Starve!

												IT'S NOT MINECRAFTThe name of the game is really deceiving as starving is one of many ways to die in this game. I'd like to point out here I was expecting something like old Horde game - you stay in a camp, build your defences during the day, defend at night and reap your rewards.It was not the case as instead the developers gave me a game about survival and exploration. I have to say that second ""X"" part is really crucial for the game, as in early stages you will starve or freak out if you don't collect a lot of food, branches, some little stones that help you start a campfire. This game makes you watch out not only for your hit points but hunger level and serenity as well. Strange things happen if you become insane.Gameplay also brings you back to point'n'click adventure games where you had to find out what can be combined with what. Here it's similiar, it's trial and error with a bit of punishment, but keep in mind: this game is not an extreme hardcore self-destructive masterpiece. The learning curve isn't any steep. It's just a pleasure.As the days go by you learn new things, which gives you a lot of satisfaction. Surviving more and more days also gives you that feeling of progress, because there are new characters to unlock (with different abilities and stats).The downside to this game is that it's kinda cryptic at times and thanks to random generators you can either be in a very good starting position or a very bad one, but usually it doesn't go as far as spawning you next to a lvl 9001 mob which one-hits you.I can recommend this game. I'm not exactly a fan of survive, craft and explore games, but it still gave me some nice memories and I will certainly play it again.			"

												First let's just start with I've put around 10hours into this game and there is still so much I don't know and have not even touched. The best part of this game is not knowing anything about it. Running up to an animal and poking it only to have it two shot you. While you might think like a typical surival game you'll eventually get a cozy farm and endless meat and resources... Suriving is only half the battle. If you want to advance the story and actually get everything out of the game you'll need advanced items, food enough to last you a while away from base and luck in finding what you're looking for. This game has so many layers and so many ways you can play it!There is so much replay value to this game as it is rogue like and your world will be destroyed if you die and your file deleted. While there are one or two methods of gaining... basically an extra life... they're far and few between so just be prepared for lots of deaths at first. You unlock new characters as you progress and survive more and more days so each time you get different buffs ande debuffs making each experience unique and with its own challanges. Overall and amazing game with a ton of depth that is so much more than your average survival game.A huge thing is multiplayer coming out for this game. It says Summer 2015 ALPHA will be released called ""Don't Starve Together."" This is a major enhancement to the game. Buy it now! The devs have stated once multiplayer is fully released the price of the game will go up to $19.99 from $14.99. So grab a copy and buy one for a friend in preparation!Most importantly, don't starve!Edit 3/23/15: I'd like to add that I reccently added Reign of Giants and oh wow. You should play don't starve to death until you get bored then add the RoG dlc to it. It's a whole new game. The difficulty is much higher since you now have to deal with the rain in Spring and the heat in Summer. It feels like they've added such a huge element to the game. It honestly makes the original base game feel like it was in Early Acess or something. I won't spoil it but there new mobs, tons of new items, new playable characters and just so many new ways to die and ways to avoid dying. Get it!			"

												'Don't Starve' is a fun wilderness survival sandbox full of science and scary dark arts of magic. This eerily stylish hand drawn game can be easily be modded through Steam Workshop. With the options of modding, this game can be even more challenging or can played very casual and also includes 'The Screecher'  a total-conversion horror story mod made officially by Klei Entertainment. (gameplay similar to Slender)couple downsides to this game are: First time noob gameplay can be difficult because of no ingame beginning tutorial or inventory items (unless modded)Gamesaves permanently delete itself when played character dies (unless modded not to).This is a kind of game you can enjoy replaying multiple times with the many playable characters and adjustable settings on its already random map generation. I definitely recommend this to anyone who's into survival/sandbox world games.			"

												A very good survival game.  Choose a character, each with their own little quirks and dialogue.  Explore the world, harvest food and supplies, build camps, survive attacks, discover and create crazy new things, survive the night and the hardships that come with each season, rinse and repeat.  There's good enemy variety and lots of things to discover, and you have a good amount of customization for the world before you spawn in it.  Everything from frequency of the various enemy/food spawns, to how the seasons work.  The game also comes with a Caves update (probably big enough to be a DLC) that adds an entire new biome, enemies and more, and also a mod that adds an entire other little game called The Screecher.  The DLC Reign of Giants is also worth getting, it adds quite a bit of content for it's price.  Over all, a great game.			"

												For a game that tries to kill you at every single turn, it's amazingly fun. You WILL be starving, almost always, but when you finally get to the point where you are full up, sane and ready for whatever season is coming, you will feel like the master of your own destiny. Or just really really satisfied.			"

												I'll be lying if i'm not immediatly fall in love with this game.At first it's a little confusing because you will be just thrown into the wilderness with no tutorial, hints, or something. But with time you'll know what to do, by experimenting on your character a lot. The survival gameplay is also fun, sometimes uncertain thing will happen to you when you're exploring the area or found the maxwell door (which is very hard for first timer). Aside from the gameplay, the script used for interaction also humorous. The game is not exactly so serious, when you died you will received exp to unlocking another character. You can also found a lot of useful mods on steam workshop.You can play this game with friends if you want. But you must buy the ""Don't Starve Together"", since this game focusing in solo playing for your own fun. "

												Don't Starve is a really simple and easy to learn survival game which I have really been enjoying. You can alter the difficulty yourself through options such as making the days longer (as it is easier to be attacked at night) and preventing the change of seasons (as your character may be effected, such as by freezing in winter), which can allow you to quickly learn the games mechanics to progress to an increased difficulty.The aim is to simply retrieve resources and craft items to aid you in surviving in the wild as long as possible, but as the world changes with each new game you allways face the challenge of exploring the new land and, if you're struggeling or need tips, the community is full of guides and advice for new players to help you survive longer.Although I have'nt played too long yet, I've still been enjoying it loads and would definately recommend this game to anyone and everyone!

												Don't Starve is one of the best crafted titles in my entire library. Everything works together exceptionally well. The Burtonesque art style is great, the slightly disturbing music continually sets me on edge and the things that go bump in the night make me jump in the day. The game is one of survival. You'll be chopping wood, mining ore, farming....oh wait, this sounds familiar. It sounds like every other survival game. Except it's not. You're going to be crafting some really odd things with odd ingredients. Without spoiling it for you, there's just a lot of weird things that you can and will need to make out of wood, stone, gold, monster meat, etc.  Weapns. Armor. Boomerrangs. Crock pots. Science machines. That's the normal stuff - the weird stuff is just weird. You'll be facing creatures that are cartoonish nightmares. You're going to explore a game world that's quite original and of course, randomly generated with each start.And you're going to die. A lot. In fact, Don't Starve isn't a game. It's a death simulator.You'll die of starvation.You'll die of exposure.You'll die from bees.You'll die from walking trees.You'll die from ostrich-looking things.You'll die from your beefalos in rutting season.You'll die from things that go bump in the night.You'll die because you went insane.You'll die by spiders. You'll die by a dozen other things.And maybe, you might just starve.It's a survival game and there's no saving, so one mistake and you'll be restarting again from scratch. I generally hate that and avoid games that require restarts. Yet I keep playing Don't Starve. It's the favorite game in my library that I truly, completely suck at playing. I'm terrible and yet I have a good time.This is one that no gamer should be without.PS - Note that there are a couple of expansions for this. I never picked them up because they make the game harder and I don't need the help dying.			"

												What can I say about this game what has not been said before?Beautiful style, a lovely story that many fans even to this day try to figure out the missing pieces and cannot wait for an official one to see how all the characters tie in.Many ways to die and some can be funny, others annoying but hey, live and learn. The mods make it a whole new game so plenty to do if your bored with the original game itself. I am delighted this game allows people to create mods as there are lovely ones yet still waiting for the mod which lets me make bridges to cross the sea ;)If you love Minecraft then you will love this with its extra challenges and surprises.

												The biggest thing I like about this, is that you can never become an untouchable killer - you are always vulnerable so that it stays a survival game no matter how long you play. You can go insane to get killed by creatures of your mind, seemingly harmless animals can kill you in 5 seconds when grouped together, packs of hounds can come out of nowhere, walrus hunting parties will actively seek you out in the winter, you can freeze to death if you don't have warm clothes or fire, the night will kill you, you can starve, trees will come to life randomly, and there is no escape from the dreaded Deerclops.Lovely music, great art style (demented Dr. Seuss), large emphasis on survival, and a great developer that actively adds new content every month (see: Mojang's dumbassery).One thing I don't like is that you'll reach a certain point where you'll feel like you've seen and done everything, but this point comes after 80 hours in a single world.8/10			"

The creatures are very unique and new features are still being added to the game even after the release. With the addition of easy modding and the steam workshop it's going to be hard to get bored of this game. I've payed 90+ hours so far and haven't even started looking at the mods.			"

												Review of Don't Starve : Survival games are somewhat my thing, even though i am not good at them, i manage and enjoy playing them!Most survival games are repetitive, like the same world/maps...etc, But not Don't Starve, it is a pandora's box, each gameplay is not the same!The survival in this game is based off 3 thingI) Hunger : it is obvious that a survival game without a hunger meter is no survival game, in this game, there are two ways to get food :1\Hunting2\ planting II) Health : every game has this so there's really no point in explaining!III) Sanity : This is what made the game challenging, you have to keep yourself sane, that is by many ways, but the only one i've discovered is gathering flowers!So let's recap the whole thing : + Single player ( there's a multiplayer version too will be free when you get the game at this time )+ Workshop ( mods )+ Art Style (so you do not have to worry about needing a killing machine PC to play this game)+ Actual working DLC ( Adds a few monters and stuff, so it's worth it to improve the gameplay, but i strongly suggest you get the DLC when you get truly bored from the game )+ Replayable ( since each gameplay is not the same )+ Not a slight bug in sight= Fair XP system+ Many vanilla Characters that differ in skills!So that's a 9/10 i suggest you get it!

I killed the giant demon tree, which left some wood for me to use. I later used the wood for my campfire, where then the wood screamed at me once I put it in the flame.

												I bought this game a couple of years ago and since then have notched up close to 1000 hours after probably a break of six months or so, I felt drawn back recently.  For those who don't know, DS comes in essentially four formats - vanilla (Original DS), Reign of Giants - more challenges more environmental hazards, DS Together (Multiplayer) and Shipwrecked.  DS is a quirky and fun survivalist game, the Tim Burton style graphics are part of the significant charm of Don't Starve.  Arriving in a world with nothing, you must forage, build a base camp, hunt, trap, fish and farm... all the time exploring whilst preparing for battle with the bosses and the harsh weather conditions of the next seasons whilst trying to keep the nightmares away.  There are multiple characters to play as, having different strengths and weaknesses and their own unique charm. There are many different ways to play this game, you can be an animal lover, just living off what you can farm, or hunt down the various animals in game for a meatier diet.  You can have a central base or live a more nomadic lifestyle with perhaps smaller satalite bases dotted around the world.  There is an adventure mode and also the ability to decamp and travel to a newly generated world when you get bored of your current one.  Since the launch of DS shipwrecked it is now possible to link a DS Reign of Giants world to a Shipwrecked world, allowing you the ability to world hop back and forth and enjoy two different worlds within one game.The world is extensive, and comes with significant customisation options to allow you to design bespoke worlds to suit your game play, in addition to this the modding community have gone to town with this game, providing all kinds of bolt on mods including additional bosses/beasts and characters for gamers to enjoy.  When I stumbled across this beauty on a Youtube video, I knew immediately that I wanted it.  I died so many times in the first few weeks and I remember the first time I made it to day 21 in DS and the start of Winter, only to spend a pitiful 2 days by the fire with no warm clothing and no means to make it far enough to find the resources to make the clothing... cue another frustrating death.  Fortunately, one of the best parts of this game is that starting over is as engaging as being 100 + days in, the battle against time to prepare for what's to come, the flexibility of world hopping when this world becomes a chore or over run with spider queens or stripped of resources.... The thought that has gone into DS is brilliant, its a game that is gripping, fun and challenging.  Don't be fooled though by its cute quirky graphics... you will die lots, you will laugh, cry, threaten to throw your computer through the window... and you will love it.  It really is a game that will provide endless hours of ammusment. I can highly reccomend.			"

												Alone in the wilderness, placed there by a mysterious man from a radio, you (as Wilson or other characters) must survive monsters, winter, hunger, and insanity all throughout trying to find the man who put you here on this backwards land. The is only one life per save, and if you die, all you have left is the experience you went throught to learn off of. - Amazing game! I love the replay-ability even though it is fustrating. It may seem dark and creepy, but it grows on you. Overall- Buy it! 9/10			"

												I read one review which said minecraft + Tim Burton + pain. I'd say this is pretty accurate. I dont think it was quite mentioned in the game description but if you die, then the game stops - you have some methods of resurrection but you have to be really careful in this game! :DYou will die many times before you start to get the hang of things. I've played 50 hours before I even decided to start Adventure mode..... so I thought I was going to find it quite easy to begin with. How wrong I was....I like this game for its difficulty and the random quotes you get when examining stuff! I wasn't expecting much, but it really is fun.Update @111hrsI can still easily spend all day playing this game and I still haven't mastered it! Half the time Im just fighting for survival that I can't get to explore the caves and stuff. Haha I guess I'm just bad at the game although I have managed to survive a few 100+ day games.. I don't think my review does the game justice. Its definitely great fun but hella challenging			"

												This game is incredible its just like your basic Sandboxish game with the build and stuff but it also has a legimate adventure mode once you make the diving rod and find maxwells portal anywayDont starve has many aspects so you will die eventually (unless you have a crap ton of farms to last you forever)Plus even if you do die you get xp points so you can get a new characterDont starve offers a very simple way to install mods like all steam stuff anyway~And Dont starve never gets old because if you die you still havn't found everything in the game yet.Another mechanic there is in dont starve is the Sanity system and the being afraid of the dark.During night or doing other stuff such as picking evil flowers can reduce your sanity and the lower it getsthe more Ghosts you see that want to kill you,At night if you dont have any light around you,then you'll just die cuz of monsters lurking in the darkEdit: The dlc ""Reign of giants"" is a great addition for hardcore players who tend to find dont starve too easy and are looking for a better challenge,one thing we would all like to see tho is Multiplayer in either a mod form or just added to the game.Anyway dont starve is a brilliant game and this is the longest review i've written.

												To start off, this game is widly addicting, if a bit frustrating at times. Fans of sandbox games would love this kind of game, with such a high scale of replayability. Trust me, with permadeath, you will be replaying this alot. Most of the game is infinite resource farming, after a while on a single world. With many characters to test, so many items to find, and so much to do, you will get lost while playing this game. If you like a challange, or ANY kind of sandbox/survival type game, Dont starve is worth the low price tag. 8/10.			"

												This is one of my favorite games! I love the look of the game, and have enjoyed it since it was first released on steam. Though, one thing that would make this game so much better would be adding multiplayer. Those of you who play and enjoy this game, just imagine playing with a friend or two, it would be great! Also, please make a way to create your own characters in a simple way, such as a ""Character Creation"" option, where you can draw a character in each frame, change their sound to one of the character sounds, and choose their heath, sanity, hunger and other stats. Other than these two things, 5 stars!			"

												Such a unique game, I've been playing this since the early access days and it was amazing to see how it evolved, this is the way all Early Access should be managed. The game was always highly playable but evolved into a completely different beast as it neared release, constantly adding, improving and refining content so that each update made the game feel fresh.There's nothing else on the market quite like it, it's not just the tone and aesthetic that differentiate this from other survival games.  Don't Starve is a unique, fun, highly replayable experience that everybody should try, and hopefully it's only going to be improved by the upcoming multiplayer patch.			"

												Is this game worth £11 you may ask? Silly question, of course! Inclusing the DLC too, this game is a bundle of amazingness. Don't starve is , if not, on it's way to becoming the best gaming experience around. The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.If you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better? This game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!Overall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one.

												Don't Starve harnesses all of the successful elements of other sandbox survival games and tweeks them to create an atmosphere that is unsettling, urgent, and charming all at the same time. Overall, the game is very well executed. The world the game is set in is at first very brutal, very unforgiving, and there is little-to-none tutorialization. When you eventually start to gain a foothold, the experience can be extremely rewarding. Character perk sets and the ability to customize the world generation and cycles add lots of replay value.

It's really hard to stop playing.. I only wish it were multiplayer/co-op. ^__^  Highly recommended for really, anyone!			"

												I have a very soft spot for this type of games. You start in the wilderness, destitute and alone. You gather, you hunt, you hoard, you craft, you create, you survive. You build an entire civilisation on your own, and what was once an unknown and terrifying place becomes your home, your conquered land, where you have become the apex predator.			"

This game is all about it.There are varieties of different ""biomes"" you can visit, and each step you take updates the map even further, even though the world is pretty much indefinite. There are many different creatures you can encounter, some being cute, scary, screepy, or just  plain silly-But yet deadly. This is a really fun survival/exploring game from my point of view, and crafting is pretty easy for the most part. There's not much complication, so its pretty easy to get used to.

It is well worth the money to buy it, I have plenty of hours on it, and could play for hours more if I wanted to. Really cool sound/art style goes along with the creepy survival theme.

												I've always liked survival games. They are rare, very rare to come upon on. The game is sort of like other survival games like Minecraft. However, people can't make copies of it like they can with Minecraft. Don't Starve is good in it's own little way. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes exploration, hand drawn graphics, or mysterious you-never-know-whats-gonna-happen games. The game is challenging and fun. It has way more variety than Minecraft when it comes to animals. I'm not saying that Minecraft is bad, but Don't Starve is a bit better than how it appears. You would know if you played the game. So do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												Combining the aspects of survival, adventure and sandbox into one game full of mystery and wonder makes this well worth playing. Since every world you play in is completely randomised, the adventure never stops as you explore, fight and survive as you delve deeper to find every little thing to do and uncover. So, if anyone out there is up for a good challenge, then Don't Starve is the one for you. Plus, with the Reign Of Giants DLC coming out soon, you can be sure to be surprised and running for your life as you discover what this game has in store for you...			"

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												Don't Starve has tons of item crafting, starving, dying, and ""what the hell?"" moments. Can be difficult at times, especially your first time playing it. If you want a more lenient and forgiving experience, there are plenty of mods in the workshop. If you want a more difficult and ""hardcore"" time, there are in game settings and mods to change those as well. There are more than a few different characters you can play as, each with their own abilities and weaknesses, after you unlock them. With a plethora of items, survival strategies, creatures to kill and eat (or get eaten by), this is a great survival game. It has plenty of replay value, and if you put the time and patience into it, it can be a very rewarding experience.			"

												I wasn't too sure about this game when I first saw it.  Then I saw the pocket edition for my phone and decided that I would give it a try.   It took all of 5 minutes for me to realize that I HAD to have this on my PC.  I bought the bundle of the original game,  Reign of Giants, and Shipwrecked. I cannot put this game away.   I think it's totally possible that this game got its title not because of the starvation that can happen in the game but the starvation that can happen to you in the real world when you start playing this game!  I love the exploration that this game puts you through.   I have resisted the urge to watch videos or get tips online because the ""not knowing what's going to happen next"" aspect really adds to the experience.   Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.   It's well worth the price for the intense HOURS of fun,  stress, frustration, and obsession that you will experience while playing.			"

												A very good survival game.  Choose a character, each with their own little quirks and dialogue.  Explore the world, harvest food and supplies, build camps, survive attacks, discover and create crazy new things, survive the night and the hardships that come with each season, rinse and repeat.  There's good enemy variety and lots of things to discover, and you have a good amount of customization for the world before you spawn in it.  Everything from frequency of the various enemy/food spawns, to how the seasons work.  The game also comes with a Caves update (probably big enough to be a DLC) that adds an entire new biome, enemies and more, and also a mod that adds an entire other little game called The Screecher.  The DLC Reign of Giants is also worth getting, it adds quite a bit of content for it's price.  Over all, a great game.			"

												(Experience: unlocked 7 out of 9 characters)(Time spent: 22 hours at the moment)(Bought price: Gift from friend)Don't Starve - and its DLC Reign of Giants - is a spectacular survival game that definitely nails the 'see-how-long-you-can-survive' aspect. The amount of craftable stuff keeps every run fresh and fun. This includes: weapons and armour to fend off monsters, firepit and crock pot to cook your meals, science machine and lightning rod to extend your survivability, and so much more!This is a game that tests how well you budget your time, Each day consists of a day and night cycle. By day, you can harvest food and materials but by the time night comes around you'll find yourself having to cook enough food to feed your stomache. And, if you manage to survive your first day, you get to repeat the whole process all over again, and thus, it tests how long you can live as long as you Don't Starve.Bottomline: This is a game that you should ABSOLUTELY try out, if just to see why it is so popular among many fans.

												Most immersive fps on the market to date. Use fireballs to demolish foul enemies such as Don Cheadle, Don Cheadle as a bird, and Don chindle. The graphics are absolutely breathtaking and almost as good as minecraft. Very euphoric experience you will never regret. 0/10 don't buy this game.			"

												Every single aspect of this game, feels as if it has been developed to its absolute best, finding a true balance between, a wonderfully creative survial based game, and amazingly unique graphics.This game has superbe replay value, and you feel as if after every death you learn something, which makes you not even care that you have possibly lost dozens of hours of gameplay, since you will want to continue playing, despite having to start over. Eventually, you will learn the secrets of the game and then, you break a wall, that you were constantly hitting, and boom.The game starts...			"

												Don't Stave,A lot of prep work is put in to helping one have an easier journey and survive, but it is challenging. This challenging side of the game makes players have to use time wisely and manage their resources. Don't Stave Dlc,The Dlc is amazing, it adds a fair bit in gameplay and items to use in the world; plus it spices the challenge of surviving.The mods for the game are great and add tons of different content, like leveling RPG elements of fantasy characters.Overall Great game, challenging, but fun and a lot of different mods if want to try something different. 8.2/10			"

Even though it is in 2D art, the artists didn't fail to keep the ""spooky"" feel in the game.Sounds are nicely played, although the crafting sound is a little bit deafening.Background music suits the seasons and the mood of the game well.~~There's just a lot to explore in this game!

What may kill you in big bad world?:- bunnies? - CHECKED!- flowers? - CHECKED!- trees? - CHECKED!- bees? - THEY WILL DESTROY YOU!- penguins? - THEY WILL OBLITERATE YOU!...and that is only the top of the whole mountain, you will spend alot before you discover all ways to die.After...- tens of hours spent in the game,- hundreds of slained monsters,- thousands of gathered materials,... I am still on the Day 1. Yep! Totally worth it!Great game. It has very nice art style, and music. It is gameplay wise, it may seem like other ""survival"" games out there, but this one is really different. On the first look, you may think ""Oh damm.. it is a Minecraft copy"", but that opinion is far from truth. On conceptual layer they are both simillar to each other, but on the gameplay leyer they are completely different. They got completely different priorities expected from a player.My Walkthrough Guide:

												You're dropped into a world with no tutorial, no narration, no guidebook.  Simply click on things, find out what they do, combine them with other things, and LEARN.  This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content.			"

												I absolutely love this game. You get thrown into the world with absolutely no real tutorials, just the challenge to try to not starve to death, or die from insanity. A tutorial is honeslty not needed though. You can quickly learn the basics through trial and error, exploring new combinations of actions. The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is. I originally saw this on a game stream a friend was watching and had to play it. I am not sure if this still works, but I was able to take my game key and register it within a chrome app so I can even play quick games in my chrome browser at no extra cost. Amazing replay value.

												This is basically the premier ""survival game"", and barring a few classic roguelikes it is also the premier randomly generated game. It owes these high honors to its extremely long development and constant updates, bugfoxes, and balance patches. It's important for a randomly generated game to have a significant amount of content in order to keep replays fresh and exciting; I'm sure it was for this reason that the developers did not stop when the game was merely ""adequate"". My only complaint is the occasionally inaccurate diablo-style controls that occasionally force the player to learn some strange workarounds. In conclusion if you're not Not Starving yet why aren't you Not Starving?			"

												Don't Starve is a wonderful survival and exploration game for the ones who crave adventure. Durring the day, You are free to do what you wish. At nightfall, Stepping into the pitch black of the night will get you killed. Make a campfire, or be adventerous and explore with torches and a miner hat! Beware however, death in this game isnt just a simple click to respawn. Death means you must start all over again, in a new world.Oh, and a word of advice: Dont play with fire.			"

												I read one review which said minecraft + Tim Burton + pain. I'd say this is pretty accurate. I dont think it was quite mentioned in the game description but if you die, then the game stops - you have some methods of resurrection but you have to be really careful in this game! :DYou will die many times before you start to get the hang of things. I've played 50 hours before I even decided to start Adventure mode..... so I thought I was going to find it quite easy to begin with. How wrong I was....I like this game for its difficulty and the random quotes you get when examining stuff! I wasn't expecting much, but it really is fun.Update @111hrsI can still easily spend all day playing this game and I still haven't mastered it! Half the time Im just fighting for survival that I can't get to explore the caves and stuff. Haha I guess I'm just bad at the game although I have managed to survive a few 100+ day games.. I don't think my review does the game justice. Its definitely great fun but hella challenging			"

												I'm a big minecraft fan, especially playing survival game types. Unfortunately, I have a big issue with minecraft and survival games - it's too damn easy! It's too easy to make impervious shelters, stockpile food, and there arent any mobs that are dangerous if you're cautious and attentative. It's really hard to make the game difficult while still playable, so I've been looking desperately for other options.Don't Starve addresses many of the issues I mentioned above - shelter is hard to build (and never impervious/safe), food can't be easilt stockpiled (it spoils!! Woo!), and enemies can be VERY deadly, even when you are prepared. The seasons are also great in that they impact food availability and hot/cold can do you physical harm. So many great mechanics!Only downside is the game is currently only single player, but they are currently working on Don't Starve Together, which I'm super excited for.In short, if you like survival games but want a more challenging environment, check this game out.

												Dont Starve is a relitively hard game to start on without going on somthing like the wiki or watching others play it, though the first few times you might not know how to get a flint to make that axe and so you will die when night comes.

If you think you know everything, something else happens and once again may decide your fate. At the beginning it all looks easy, manageable, etc... but you really have to prepare for everything and beyond to make it through. Don't write it off as childs play by the cute graphics.

												Don't Starve is a difficult game where you must rely on your skills and reaction times (as the game throws things at you constantly). This game has a pretty deep story line if you dig into it as well as some neat DLCs and mods. This is a great game that I recommend to everyone who enjoys survival sandbox type games.			"

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

												There is so much to do. There is too much to do. Not enough time. I'm going to waste my life on this game. Maximum I've lasted is 30 days. Either winter or summer, I have not been able to survive. Summer burns everything in its path. Winter is kinda ok, you just need a thermal stone and rabbit earmuffs or beefalo coats.I love the way the map is randomized every time. That way I don't mind beginning anew each time.The game is incredibly difficult. I wonder how many people have actually beaten adventure mode.Frogs and spiders don't attack each other. Or so I found. Thumb rule is to expose an attacking enemy (spiders, bats, frogs) to a non-attacking enemy (beefalo, bees, pigs) while you run around and collect their drops.Cons - no tutorial. That sort of undermines the value of unique items. We store them but we never get around to realizing what they are meant to do. Unless you build those prehestihilitator things.- pixelated graphics at close-up. Maybe it's just the settings. But I can't make out if it reads 12 stones needed or 2.- at default settings, not all characters are present on every map. Not that I've ever explored the whole map. But sometimes, some resources are really scarce. Buy the game. Support the developers. And remember, it's not just Don't Starve. It's Don't Get Hit, Don't Stay in Dark, Don't Eat Mushrooms, Don't nay NEVER Attack Creatures in Groups, Don't Stand Idle, Don't Stop Collecting Twigs, Grass and Rocks, Don't er Do Plant Trees.			"

												This game is one of the best games i have ever played that is a survival game. The main protagonist is a mad scientist called Wilson who gets sucked into a world, where he (you) have to survive by killing animals for their fur to make clothes for the winter and meat for not starving and pick, garden vegetables for not starving too... and you can make weapons, staffs (magical things), traps, armor and other really cool stuff to survive...The map in this game is random however you chose between small, medium and HIGH (size for the map) but it's nature. A lot of trees, water, flowers, fields and swamps. But be aware you are not alone... there are monsters and wild animals in this game that might not be so friendly as they look like... and you have to build a fire before night comes, because if you don't... shadow monsters will kill you in the darkness without you seeing it coming...And actually you don't always have to play as the main character you can play as other characters once you unlocked them... and you can download other characters at the workshop... but the original characters for this game always have names that starts at the letter ""w"" except the last character in the list...It's an amazing game with amazing graphics (cartoon graphics) ,amazing music, amazing story, amazing experience, amazing concept and amazing everything!!! :) 10/10 ...But i recommend you buying this game for ps4 (if you have one) because it has a lot of better control for the gamepad then.

												This game is really unique and charming.  I particularly recommend it to fans of survival TV shows as it gives you a survival game experience.In the game, it is a constant struggle to manage your hunger, health and sanity levels.  You are always prioritizing what you need to better your survival situation.  You rarely have time to sit around idle, and are always on the hunt for things you need while fending off occasional attacks from wild hounds or other creatures you come across.Also, with the addition of Steam Workshop, you can easily tailor the game even more to your liking.

												I love this game!  This is a survival game in every essense of the word. In a world where you can die at one simple mistake, it really embodies a true survival experience. The amount of sheer content is enough to pick up this game alone. With randomly generated worlds, many characters that change the way you play, a wide assortment of resources that i'm sure i haven't found all of yet, a great art design, a living, breathing world everytime you boot up a map, caves, ruins, a huge and complex crafting assortment, a story mode, multiplayer being put in after early access of DST, customizable worlds, and one of the best modding communities, this game has an imense amount of lastability and will age extremely well.      The soundtrack is interesting but grows old. After a few hours I started listening to my own music. This is what I call a ""wiki game"" meaning you will have to live on the wiki if you want to have a clue on what to do. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that to utilize most of the content, you have to be good, which goes back to the wiki.      Once you've become a grade A survivor, you will find yourself losing countless afternoons on building up your camp, testing new mods and so on. It is an amazing survival games and one of the best indie titles to come out of the past few years. You owe it to yourself not to overlook this masterpiece 10/10       Just look out for penguins......I HAD IT THAT TIME YOU SCUM!!!! AAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! Just one more try.....			"

The game is surprisingly addictive. there is more depth to this game than many i have played and it also has a broad appeal. there is humor and strategy evenly mixed with a fair bit of action at intervals just long enough to keep the game from getting boring or repetative. It is both frustrating and rewarding. you will laugh at silly ways you can die after spending hours setting up you camp and smile as you load the next attempt.Pros:deep strategy and planning are rewardedCons:where did Thursday go?

												This is a really fantastic game.  I first got it on sale ages ago, but never really played it.  I finally installed it to give it a shot and was instantly sad at how bad I was.  I died within the first day.This game is built around trial and error.  You are going to be exploring randomly generated worlds and making a bajillion mistakes as you start to understand the things you need to do.I do not recommend reading the wikia about this game, as it will spoil a lot of the fun, which is just exploring and learning from your mistakes.  Reading a beginner's guide isn't a terrible thing, but I would save it until you've died about 20 times or at least made it to your first winter alone.I recommend waiting to play with the RoG expansion, although you could go ahead and buy it but just start playing the vanilla version.  Save mods and guides for after you have had a lot of fun wandering around being bad.			"

												This is a really fantastic game.  I first got it on sale ages ago, but never really played it.  I finally installed it to give it a shot and was instantly sad at how bad I was.  I died within the first day.This game is built around trial and error.  You are going to be exploring randomly generated worlds and making a bajillion mistakes as you start to understand the things you need to do.I do not recommend reading the wikia about this game, as it will spoil a lot of the fun, which is just exploring and learning from your mistakes.  Reading a beginner's guide isn't a terrible thing, but I would save it until you've died about 20 times or at least made it to your first winter alone.I recommend waiting to play with the RoG expansion, although you could go ahead and buy it but just start playing the vanilla version.  Save mods and guides for after you have had a lot of fun wandering around being bad.			"

												I love this game!  This is a survival game in every essense of the word. In a world where you can die at one simple mistake, it really embodies a true survival experience. The amount of sheer content is enough to pick up this game alone. With randomly generated worlds, many characters that change the way you play, a wide assortment of resources that i'm sure i haven't found all of yet, a great art design, a living, breathing world everytime you boot up a map, caves, ruins, a huge and complex crafting assortment, a story mode, multiplayer being put in after early access of DST, customizable worlds, and one of the best modding communities, this game has an imense amount of lastability and will age extremely well.      The soundtrack is interesting but grows old. After a few hours I started listening to my own music. This is what I call a ""wiki game"" meaning you will have to live on the wiki if you want to have a clue on what to do. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that to utilize most of the content, you have to be good, which goes back to the wiki.      Once you've become a grade A survivor, you will find yourself losing countless afternoons on building up your camp, testing new mods and so on. It is an amazing survival games and one of the best indie titles to come out of the past few years. You owe it to yourself not to overlook this masterpiece 10/10       Just look out for penguins......I HAD IT THAT TIME YOU SCUM!!!! AAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! Just one more try.....			"

												Don't starve is a great survival game that feels a bit like a darker, harder 2D version of minecraft (you need to collect, build and progress in order to stay alive). If you enjoy learning stuff the hard way and constantly improving your style of playing then this is definitely a game for you, but if you don't enjoy working hard and losing everything you built up over and over again by dying afterwards (you will always die sooner or later) then this is no game for you... Would definitely recommend this game to the more experienced and determined gamers amongst us.I had so much fun I nearly starved to death myself because I couldn't stop playing!			"

												HELLO FLESHLINGS, THIS IS WX-78, ALSO KNOWN AS THE SOULLESS AUTOMATON(AN APPROPRIATE MONIKER). ARE YOU FOND OF BEING KILLED BY YOUR OWN FOOLISH ERRORS? IF AFFIRMATIVE, ""DON'T STARVE"" IS WITH 100% CERTAINTY YOUR DREAM COME TRUE, AND MINE AS WELL!WITHIN THE WORLD OF ""DON'T STARVE"" YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF PIT AGAINST NATURE ITSELF. I HAVE MADE CALCULATIONS AND FOUND THAT THIS ""MOTHER NATURE"" HUMANS SPEAK OF IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFERIOR TO MACHINES, YET IS REQUIRED FOR THE CREATION OF MACHINES. AN INEXCUSABLE FLAW IN ANY LOGICAL CREATION CYCLE. FOR NOW SHE IS A NECESSARY EVIL, BUT I WILL SEE THIS WILDERNESS WORLD CONQUERED BY MY OWN COLD, METALLIC HANDS, AND HAVE IT TRANSFORMED INTO A SELF-SUSTAINING LAND RULED SOLELY BY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, (AND MAYBE A LITTLE MAGIC IF I'M IN A GOOD MOOD) WITH MYSELF AS ROBOTIC OVERLORD OF COURSE. I JUST HOPE IT STOPS RAINING ON ME SOON, I HA#%#%ATE-ATE-ATE RUS*ZzXZxzZ*T.WARNING, WATER LEVELS CRITICAL. BAG OF RICE REQUIRED... OKAY THAT'S BETTER.DO YOU DARE TEST YOUR METTLE HUMAN? I LOOK FORWARD TO DEFINITELY NOT ENSLAVING YOU AND SHARING IN THE STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL (THOUGH I PREFER TO CALL IT AN UNENDING CONQUEST AGAINST THE NATURAL FORCES OF THIS WORLD) IN THE UPCOMING MULTIPLAYER UPDATE. IN THE MEANTIME, DON'T STARVE! SERIOUSLY IT'S THE MOST UNEXCITING WAY TO DIE, DO SOMETHING ENTERTAINING LIKE GETTING MAULED BY PENGULLS, THAT IS ALWAYS A LAUGH.			"

												This game is a very detailed and complex game that starts out with you waking up and this man pops out of the ground. He tells you to look for some food before nightfall so, you take his advice and get up off the ground in search of flint, food, etc. It seems so simple yet it is so complex! there are many characters in the game that you DO NOT NEED TO BUY! They are all unlocked by survivng and gaining XP. This game is a very addictive game that keeps you coming back! There are also mods like Wulfe, Easter Eggs, and Bigger Stacks (my reccomendations). Check this game out and get the Reign Of Giants DLC, its really cool! So, overall, this game is a fantasy-based game that feels like Minecraft and Terraria but in a 3-D world with more things to craft, much more things to do, and many other fantasy creatures out to get you like Hounds, Tallbirds, Spiders, etc. So, check this game out! And are you good enough to not Starve?			"

												There are plenty of videos out there showing game play, but I think the best recommendation for this game is how much new stuff you still learn about the game on almost every playthrough. At first, the game appears impossible and that everything is out to kill you. While not impossible, most things are out to kill you, and survival is using it to your advantage. Then, as you learn what is important, when is the best time to do things, how to do them, where to go (or not go), and why you should, the game becomes ""easier"".Make no mistake, on my current playthrough, I am almost to Day 200 and the game is certainly not easier. In fact, some things have gotten more difficult, and death is around every turn. However, this is what makes the game so great.Then, to top it all off, there is Adventure Mode, which is accessed via an object in the Sandbox Mode (where all games start). While Sandbox Mode could be a full game by itself, Adventure Mode is like checking ""Hardcore"" as you have to take everything you know from Sandbox and use it to make it through all the Chapters (a feat I have yet to accomplish). These Chapters ramp up certain challenges, limit a random resource, etc. Fortunately, this is where the game does let up, as you can repeat Adventure Mode without consquences because you ""regain consciousness"" upon death in your Sandbox Mode to try again. The best part? The Chapters and levels are regenerated every restart, so you cannot memorize the maps, making it truly an ""adventure"".tl;dr You want a challenging game that makes you think, and punishes your every mistake? Get this game.			"

												After watching trailers and several pictures provided, Don’t Starve’s bettlejuice inspiration, alluring soundtrack, and hand-drawn adorable cast of characters to the wilderness the itself, it begged me to play it. Aside its show and tell features, Don’t Starve truly emphasis the survival genre. Survive however you want to survive: live off the land, wield dark magic, rely on old school hunting tactics, or take your enemies head on to a glorious death. Be prepared for anything and stay well stocked, because if you’re not, the telltale of winter will make survival become much harder. If you find the game too easy, too hard or isn't offering the challenge you want, no problem. There’s plenty of options for you to customize your own world, however you see fit.The asking price is fair or even spot on with its abundance of content and uniqueness makes this survival game truly stand out. Search no further for I utmost recommend this game for those who love survival and looking for uniqueness. The Reign of Giants (RoG) DLC made the game even more content, stronger, dangerous and funnier survival experience.			"

												As a hardcore fan of RTS or RPG games such as the StarCraft or Diablo series I wasn't too familiar with too many indie titles and Don't Starve was basically the first sandbox action-adventure game I've ever really tried playing. I actually saw my girlfriend play it on my computer when she came over and it looked pretty interesting which is why I took the time to play it on her account and eventually decided to buy my own copy (this probably had more to do with wanting to try DST though). Even if English isn't your first language, Don't Starve is pretty simplified in terms of navigation.			"

												This game is amazing. The style is incredibly cool, the music is great, and the gameplay even better. I cannot find the words to accurately summarise the level of awesome Don't Starve is, it's just absolutely brilliant, in so many ways. As you get no tutorial, no hints (apart from the obvious - don't starve!), it is a game of figuring stuff out at first, and there are so many things to expore, find, and craft! Seeing as you can customise just about everything in your world before you start a game, there are endless possibilities when it comes to difficulty, and not to mention, the dreaded Adventure mode which will make you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty spoon and throw them at the treeguards while you scream with the fury of a thousand suns. If you like survival, base building, hillarious puns, exploring, crafting, and not having a game tell you exactly what to do at all times - Don't Starve is for you. 10/10 in my book!...Apart from the treeguards. F*** you, treeguards.			"

												This game is worth the money.  Always getting new characters with their own unique set of skills.  No tutorial, so you have to figure it out on your own, but wicked awesome.  Everytime I learn something new I get excited!  Can't wait till multiplayer option! :)			"

												Don't Starve is such a good game to play if you love a sharp and ""Tim Burton"" esque art style. The ideas and concept of this game are really cool, especially the characters such as Wilson, Willow, etc. Although the game has a nice aesthetic, the survival aspect is pretty relative for survival game goers. The workshop is also very good, I usually get custom characters and items and such. Overall a good game, definately worth a play if you love survival.			"

												I highly recommend this game. It runs very smoothly and quite fast. Dont Starve can be very dark and funny in its own ways.It took me some time to fully understand what I needed to do exactly, but once you start playing frequently, you should understand it. I also love all of the workshop items that can be put into the game, many characters, and stuff to help you along in your survival. This game is perfect for me.			"

												The whole game is a buttload of fun! If you think minecraft was hard, this'll be even more difficult. The adventure aspect of this game is absolutely wonderful with the dangerous nights. The thing I don't like about this game is the delay when you're attacking. Whenever a tree guardian is about to hit, I immediatly dodge in don't starve together. In this game, when I stop holding the left mouse button, it has a 1.5 second delay and the mob ends up killing me. Other than that, the game overall is great.			"

												I'm a big minecraft fan, especially playing survival game types. Unfortunately, I have a big issue with minecraft and survival games - it's too damn easy! It's too easy to make impervious shelters, stockpile food, and there arent any mobs that are dangerous if you're cautious and attentative. It's really hard to make the game difficult while still playable, so I've been looking desperately for other options.Don't Starve addresses many of the issues I mentioned above - shelter is hard to build (and never impervious/safe), food can't be easilt stockpiled (it spoils!! Woo!), and enemies can be VERY deadly, even when you are prepared. The seasons are also great in that they impact food availability and hot/cold can do you physical harm. So many great mechanics!Only downside is the game is currently only single player, but they are currently working on Don't Starve Together, which I'm super excited for.In short, if you like survival games but want a more challenging environment, check this game out.

												Don't starve is a single-play survival game, where you each death gain xp to unlock different characters in the game, but if you are interested; you can add mods, which can spice things up(unlock more new characters, NOTE some of them may have bugs, so it is at your own risk to add them). There is also ""Don't starve together"" which is a multi-player version of the game, that is also enjoyable and funny to play with friends. The mechanics(crafting,gathering and exploring) is simple, which is one of the things I like about the game. Great game overall; Should you buy it? YES! you should :)			"

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

												This is what I'm talking about. I love games that force you to make hard decisions about what your doing next in it. Don't starve is the perfect example of how games should make you consider almost every action you take. Theres almost no story, no tutorial, and no hand holding. You make the story as you go along. You make life and death decisions every step of the way, and if you mess up? BOOM your dead, game over, please insert two quarters to continue. This is how games should be made. I've faced more indecision and planned farther ahead in this game then Banner Saga, Mass Effect, Dragon Age or any other game that touts its ""branching storyline"". Theres ALMOST no check points, no reloads, and no do overs. And If you do manage to figure out how to respawn, theres penalties for doing so. Everytime you come back to life, your overall health, sanity, and hunger decrease. This game is amazing, and true to the Golden Era of gaming. Play it.			"

												You want to survive and you want it badly. Well, screw you, you will die.Alright, alright, it's not that desperate. Perhaps maybe next time you'll try harder. And probably, just probably you'll have enough food and wood and grass and sticks and stones and... just Don't Starve. That would be enough to prosper.			"

												My favorite genre of games are survival games and Don't Starve is the survival game that I played a great deal of time.There is always something interesting to do and a new challenge to overcome.  I am a fan of Don't Starve because of the easy to pick up game play and the surprising depth to the game's mechanics.The Tim Burton'esqu hand drawn style graphics are not really the sort of thing that would attract me.  The sound effects are fine but could use some more variety.  The music is good but repetetive.There are hundreds of hours of fun to be had playing this odd little game.			"

												I am out of words to describe how amazing this game is. The depth in gameplay will keep you entertained for a very long time. If you think you know everything, something else happens and once again may decide your fate. At the beginning it all looks easy, manageable, etc... but you really have to prepare for everything and beyond to make it through. Don't write it off as childs play by the cute graphics. This game is serious. Highly recommend.			"

												Don't Starve is a semi-3D survival adventure. A witty, amusing style takes over this game and it has its ups and downs. On one hand, it has roguelike characteristics (permadeath) and just tosses the player into the world. The games settings can be altered per playthrough, but judging it on the normal difficulty, I can say it's certainly a challenge. I'd recommend it for people who love to be on edge. The game constantly throws new challenges at you, and only the most obvious mistakes like staying in the dark or poking a beehive, will outright kill you, or close to it. While it's not known for being difficult, the learning curve is steady. Survive though, and it's strangely satisfying. Recommended for those who like challenge, learning experiences, crafting, exploration. It's as adventure as it gets.			"

												The graphics are unique and fascinating, personally I love them. Some people even fear the game a bit because the graphics are unsettling to them which I personally just think would only add to the experience of being in a new, hostile world.There are tons of mods for the game if you'd ever get bored of it, a large variety of characters and hours of playtime.The game at first seems real frustrating but in a way that you'd want to give it another shot and avoid what killed you.Also the amount of pets and styles of pets are pretty fun. I personally love Chester most, a treasure chest looking dog creature that follows you around and lets you store things in his mouth.Whenever you seem that the world has dried out and you are sure to die unless you find something that will rejuvinate everyting, it is time to head into the caves. But you risk your life to the new enemies that await you there.It's not ONLY survival as far as you can go, there is for example the Adventure Mode.The different mechanics to the characters and different stats for them make it seem like you're playing another game since you'll have to play the game a completely different way if you're to gain an advantage, so when you've unlocked everything you still might not know what character it is you want to use. None is better than the rest.If you are looking for a realistic game, then this is probably not for you.If you're looking for a game to spend quite a lot of time in and see new types of enemies and like games that look pretty (Perhaps such as Sworcery and Bastion) then this is something you should give a shot.

What do when you aree starting up the game you think to your self ok this is how im going to survive and then you see OH♥♥♥♥♥♥I CANT FIND THIS 1 THING THAT I NEED TO F'ING SURVIVE or ""WOW I finally did it I made the dream base!"" then you get attacked my a pack od wild dogs and then your dead. then you come up with another Half♥♥♥♥♥thought and say ok i'm doing that for now on and then you do it then you get killed by a living tree (tree Guard). So then you make another bullet proof plan then you do it (or don't because OH♥♥♥♥♥♥I CANT FIND THAT 1 MATERAIL) then you die by THE ♥♥♥♥ING DARK I MEAN LIKE WTF. *sigh* you do it again not die by the dark then die of huger or hupletherma or by ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING TREE or by a 1 eyed bird because you grabed its egg. oh and when you die you gain Xp and if you get you will unlock a charecter and that charecter my be a bit better or a bit worse then the other.They are also adding multiplayer to this game which can be good or bad on they make it. I leave you with this this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and it will contune being a ♥♥♥♥♥ untell you make the pefefect idea on how to survive (oh and there is mods that suck♥♥♥♥♥♥must of the time unless they have 4 to 5 stars.)

												Love this; survival in a very real sense - word to the wise, YOU WILL DIE. Don't let it put you off, it's part of the learning process. You should find the game far more entertaining if you don't resort to the wiki for everything and just try to see how you can do each time. Several characters to unlock with very different strengths and weaknesses (and in some cases very unusual abilities)Randomly generated worlds each time means you have to scout fast and set up shop somewhere with plenty of local resources, you can starve, you can freeze to death, you can poison yourself, you can get attacked by angry wildlife, you can burn to death, get trampled, or eaten. Enjoy :DHighly recommended!			"

												Don't Starve is a really simple and easy to learn survival game which I have really been enjoying. You can alter the difficulty yourself through options such as making the days longer (as it is easier to be attacked at night) and preventing the change of seasons (as your character may be effected, such as by freezing in winter), which can allow you to quickly learn the games mechanics to progress to an increased difficulty.The aim is to simply retrieve resources and craft items to aid you in surviving in the wild as long as possible, but as the world changes with each new game you allways face the challenge of exploring the new land and, if you're struggeling or need tips, the community is full of guides and advice for new players to help you survive longer.Although I have'nt played too long yet, I've still been enjoying it loads and would definately recommend this game to anyone and everyone!

												Don't Starve is one of the best crafted titles in my entire library. Everything works together exceptionally well. The Burtonesque art style is great, the slightly disturbing music continually sets me on edge and the things that go bump in the night make me jump in the day. The game is one of survival. You'll be chopping wood, mining ore, farming....oh wait, this sounds familiar. It sounds like every other survival game. Except it's not. You're going to be crafting some really odd things with odd ingredients. Without spoiling it for you, there's just a lot of weird things that you can and will need to make out of wood, stone, gold, monster meat, etc.  Weapns. Armor. Boomerrangs. Crock pots. Science machines. That's the normal stuff - the weird stuff is just weird. You'll be facing creatures that are cartoonish nightmares. You're going to explore a game world that's quite original and of course, randomly generated with each start.And you're going to die. A lot. In fact, Don't Starve isn't a game. It's a death simulator.You'll die of starvation.You'll die of exposure.You'll die from bees.You'll die from walking trees.You'll die from ostrich-looking things.You'll die from your beefalos in rutting season.You'll die from things that go bump in the night.You'll die because you went insane.You'll die by spiders. You'll die by a dozen other things.And maybe, you might just starve.It's a survival game and there's no saving, so one mistake and you'll be restarting again from scratch. I generally hate that and avoid games that require restarts. Yet I keep playing Don't Starve. It's the favorite game in my library that I truly, completely suck at playing. I'm terrible and yet I have a good time.This is one that no gamer should be without.PS - Note that there are a couple of expansions for this. I never picked them up because they make the game harder and I don't need the help dying.			"

The mods make it a whole new game so plenty to do if your bored with the original game itself. I am delighted this game allows people to create mods as there are lovely ones yet still waiting for the mod which lets me make bridges to cross the sea ;)If you love Minecraft then you will love this with its extra challenges and surprises. Would highly shove this game into my friends faces until they buy it			"

												I bought this game a couple of years ago and since then have notched up close to 1000 hours after probably a break of six months or so, I felt drawn back recently.  For those who don't know, DS comes in essentially four formats - vanilla (Original DS), Reign of Giants - more challenges more environmental hazards, DS Together (Multiplayer) and Shipwrecked.  DS is a quirky and fun survivalist game, the Tim Burton style graphics are part of the significant charm of Don't Starve.  Arriving in a world with nothing, you must forage, build a base camp, hunt, trap, fish and farm... all the time exploring whilst preparing for battle with the bosses and the harsh weather conditions of the next seasons whilst trying to keep the nightmares away.  There are multiple characters to play as, having different strengths and weaknesses and their own unique charm. There are many different ways to play this game, you can be an animal lover, just living off what you can farm, or hunt down the various animals in game for a meatier diet.  You can have a central base or live a more nomadic lifestyle with perhaps smaller satalite bases dotted around the world.  There is an adventure mode and also the ability to decamp and travel to a newly generated world when you get bored of your current one.  Since the launch of DS shipwrecked it is now possible to link a DS Reign of Giants world to a Shipwrecked world, allowing you the ability to world hop back and forth and enjoy two different worlds within one game.The world is extensive, and comes with significant customisation options to allow you to design bespoke worlds to suit your game play, in addition to this the modding community have gone to town with this game, providing all kinds of bolt on mods including additional bosses/beasts and characters for gamers to enjoy.  When I stumbled across this beauty on a Youtube video, I knew immediately that I wanted it.  I died so many times in the first few weeks and I remember the first time I made it to day 21 in DS and the start of Winter, only to spend a pitiful 2 days by the fire with no warm clothing and no means to make it far enough to find the resources to make the clothing... cue another frustrating death.  Fortunately, one of the best parts of this game is that starting over is as engaging as being 100 + days in, the battle against time to prepare for what's to come, the flexibility of world hopping when this world becomes a chore or over run with spider queens or stripped of resources.... The thought that has gone into DS is brilliant, its a game that is gripping, fun and challenging.  Don't be fooled though by its cute quirky graphics... you will die lots, you will laugh, cry, threaten to throw your computer through the window... and you will love it.  It really is a game that will provide endless hours of ammusment. I can highly reccomend.			"

												Don't starve is 2d survival game with a gorgeous art style that looks like Tim Burton movies have turned into cartoons. There is a sandbox mode, where you try to survive as long as you can, as well as an adventure mode with a minimal story. There is also a wide variety of crafting (as well as cooking) which is neatly organized into different tiers.While the game's purpose is quite simple -not to starve- you get no handholding whatsoever. Your character is stranded in an unknown world, where you need to figure out what to do in order to survive. This can result in several deaths initially, as well as loads of hilarious situations which inevitably occur when you run around poking things. Don't starve is mostly unforgiving to your mistakes -which can end in permanent death- but rewards you with unlocking several characters with unique abilities, in order to spice up your gameplay. There is an option to tweak several world aspects as well, if you are looking for a more casual sandbox experience. I should also mention there are constant updates and a workshop community for this game.Definitely recommend it, if all the above are your cup of tea :)			"

												One of the most genuine survival games I've played in a long time; ordered it since alpha and it was definitely worth. Unique art style with a lot of everything: loot, mobs, crafting and areas. Don't Starve also offers an option to customize your world to your own liking, take notes other survival games.[✔]> character & abilities variety> replay value> workshop support> in-depth weather system> astonishing sound design> controller support[✘]> combat is very basic			"

												I like this game it is fun for the whole family and you can enjoy it anytime no matter what you are doing. The game can seem very hard and like you want to stop playing forever because you die. But this game keeps you coming back over and over for a long time. I think this game is great and with the new DLC coming out soon the game has a lot to offer.			"

												Don't Starve is a sandbox survival game with an unique graphic style, odd setting and challenging but rewarding gameplay. The goal is to survive as long as possible in a very hostile world. It's a tough task but it can be done if you know what you are doing. The game is usually pretty enjoyable but sometimes it can also be very frustrating.  If you like survival games, if you enjoy Tim Burton-esque artwork, or if you’re just looking for an unforgiving challenge of a game, pick up This game immediately. Pretty much everything about this game is fantastic, and you’ll undoubtedly fall in love with it.			"

												I have not played this game in a while and I honestly regret that. Its such a great experience on so many levels that I can't do anything but recomend this game.Atmosphere and stlye are paramount here, but not at the cost of substence and gameplay as is sometimes the case. This won't be the first time someone has said this, but this is a survival game made to match the sensibilities of Tim Burton movies and its just great. A silly yet horrifying time is to be expected as you attempt to survive and craft your way through a world hellbent on killing you.A more long winded review can be found here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/03/dont-starve.html.

And with each death learn, and become better at surviving. And try again. And again. And again. When you have mastered surviving winter, giant monsters will demolish you. When you survive giant monsters, cave dwelling beasts will devour you. When you survive even those, youa re ready for Reign of Giants and Summer witll make you long for winter. And you will never be able to put this game down.Dont get this game. IT will take time away from getting through your backloig. :p			"

												Don't stave is a very unique game. Not only because of the gameplay, but also because of the artwork.But seriously, i really can't compare this game with any other game i have ever played.It's a survival, sandbox, building, fighting and crafting game basically.You craft your own weapons, your own tools, you can build traps to catch other animals with, you can build your own base (not a house, but a base) and try to survive pretty much.The crafting menu in this game is very organized and readily comprehensible, which is a must, especially if you play other crafting games you sometimes forget how to craft what.You can also unlock and play as other characters who all have different perks, so that's another point for the replayabilty of this game.The seasons in this game also change from spring to summer to autumn to winter (if you survive that long.)There are also different ""stages."" On the map there are various locations of ""worm holes."" When you jump into them, they teleport you to another map.I haven't seen that much from this game yet, so i can't go into too much detail, but i like what i have seen so far.I would recommend this game, especially if you like survival and crafting games. It's very unique, both gameplay and artwork-wise and there is a lot to discover. Also because the maps are always randomly generated.			"

												Don't Starve is an addictive game that requires you to not only not starve but live through multiple challenges that constantly threaten your survival. It has wonderful artwork that creates a charming yet creepy atmosphere. It reminds me of Tim Burton's style. I love the size of the world and what you stumble across in your explorations. Artifacts (useful and not), skeletons with helpful equipment and my favorite, the Beefalo. It's great that you can tweak the game to your liking and have different characters to choose from. The characters are imaginative with their own strengths and weaknesses. I recommend this game. It's well worth it and has a lot of replay value.			"

I don't need HD graphics and 3D gameplay. The majority of those games are bad anyways. Don't Starve has charm. It's everything I could want in a survival game. There's ALWAYS something to do.

												This is that sort of game that'll kick you in the groin and then give you a reasurring pat...ONLY TO KICK YOU IN THE GROIN AGAIN.I hate it....Probably one of my top ten games.Don't starve is a survival game with a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics creating a 3D world filled with 2D characters,items and what not. The game will send you into the wildreness without any tips and you'll learn on from there. Don't Starve is a game that offers a lot but does it slowly so there are those who would find the first one or two hours of playing in a new save (world) boring. The most GLORIOUS thing about it is,exactly,the sheer lack of knowledge. From the first five minutes,you'll learn the basic controls on your own,but you will encounter many new things that you will have no idea what they are and the only way to learn would be to interact with them....Experiment,pick 'em up,eat them,burn them,attack them...Of course,do know that you might end up dead and....Yeah,it's that game. It's that glorious perma-death game and it was delivered very nicely.Please,just,PLEASE don't go looking for 620 kink scope try hard guides on how to be PR0 at this game as it'll just remove all the fun fo learning on your own. It is much better if the player is forced to explore and learn on their own,even if it means going through trial and error. The worlds are always randomly generated which give the game a somewhat different flavour every time you play and let's not forget the different characters with different perks which will affect your play style too.Hunt,gather and make your own camp...Then spend the nights trembling in fear next to your campfire hoping those ''things'' don't gather the wits to come near the light of your fire....And then...When all of that is done and when you think that you've survived the worst,winter comes making everything much harder to get to and,once again,changing your tactics and food rationing.Definitely a game worth playing,thouh I can only imagine this having a small Multiplayer mode. Perhaps two to four players surviving together?  "

												Don't let the adorable Tim Burton-style graphics and cute beefalo fool you. This is a game that wants you to die.Repeatedly.Even if you make the game easier (you can disable some of the more game ending monsters from spawning!) on your poor, weather-beaten and starving soul, you are still going to die.But you'll like it. You'll do it again and again and you may just forget you were supposed to do adventure mode and actually accomplish something other than establishing your base camp.Since purchasing this game during the summer sale, I have been completely in love with Don't Starve. The object is simple; survive. It's just that the whole surviving part isn't that simple and you'll end up killing yourself if the wildlife doesn't do that on your behalf. I guess that's what makes it so addicting. I keep learning from my mistakes and I build better farms. I get myself better armor faster and I've figured out what I failed to do in winter that kept me from surviving the next summer.It's a survival game in which you'll collect items, learn recipes, and kiss your character ""good luck"" as you embark on a little adventure. Do some farming! Do some exploring! Do some fighting! ...and then run for your life!The music is lovely and fits the mood from each day dawning to a change of scenery (and boss battles with trees from satan). Worth noting with the music character has an instrument that serves as a speaking voice, embodying their personalities as you learn to get along with them as you well, don't starve! Each character is unique and provides pros and cons to their playing style. Personally, I'm a fan of Willow, Wendy, and Wilson. You'll notice that each character has a name starting with the letter W and there is a much larger connection to everyone than at first glance. It's rather neat and I'll admit, I spoiled myself after I reached day thirty and died in a ball of fire.Graphics are dark and cartoony. You'll think Tim Burton or one of your favorite ""edgy"" and darker cartoons of the 90s that we all had as some brain junk food. It's actually rather cute and can make even the most ugly and terrifying creatures in the game look very disarming until they try to rip your head off and suck out your fluids. For this type of game and the storyline eluded to, it works. It's delightfully creepy yet you're smiling along because it's a twisted little world you're traversing in. Nothing is at all what it seems, but you can't help admire what pretty little things are there.Until they murder you.This isn't a difficult game to learn. Use the mouse and the WSDA keys to move. I tend to use both and click with the mouse to harvest or order a character to act, leaving ample time to react to things such as demonic wolves wielding fire (yes they're in this game and I'm not sure why wolves need sometimes need fire when teeth and claws were perfectly fine, but the game is called Don't Starve, not Easy Super Happy Camp Time).You'll be tempted to sometimes play this game in long marathons. While there's no work-out you'll get from your mouse or keyboard, give your eyes a break. The only sudden flashes you'll find is from in-game lightning, but this can actually be disabled before you start a new world.While you might get a jump from things coming out of the woodworks to kill you and ruin your hard work or you may feel very frustrated when you accidentally set fire to your camp and ruin about a hundred days worth of work, I still find this game to have everything I was looking for after a long time of searching. No rampaging armies. Just me and the elements as my own doom.If you've got a short temper or you dislike doing repetitive things in order to build up a catche and THEN venture forth, this probably isn't something you're going to like. For me, however? I needed this game a long time ago and I'm very ashamed I didn't get it sooner. It's my new favorite game and you'll pry it out of my cold, dead, starving fingers. "

												Here is my personal review of Don't StarveGame play: Don't Starve offers an immense spectrum of how to approach surviving.  Players will be able to survive the way they want to survive and discovering what works and what doesn't is part of the fun of Don't Starve.  Use the Don't Starve wiki to a minimum and learn to play the game your way.  Don't Starve can be fun for children and adults.  There is very little room Don't Starve leaves for boredom, really the only downtime I have found is those nights I get caught away from my base, which often turn out to be the scariest.Sound/Music: Not much to say here.  The sound is not annoying or appealing in any significant way.  I often turn the music down or off, as it can drown out the hounds calling.  When tired of the music  I replace with any music that I enjoy listening to at low volume.  The music is fitting and well done, but pretty repetitive after so many hours.Controls: I have now played with both keyboard/mouse and controller, I will have to admit I prefer the controller now.  There are times where I wish I had the mouse again, so there are advantages and disadvantages to both.  In a way that is unique, I usually find myself of the opinion that one method is superior to the other.  The control system shouldn't disappoint a new player or even a veteran player and the control mechanics will not leave much to be desired.Graphics: Being a 2D and stylized game, the artwork must be impressionistic to vitalize the player's cognitive reception.  Don't Starve accomplishes itself graphically with a simple approach that does not get in the way of the game's strengths.  The only part of the graphics that seem odd to me is the ocean or shore lines, but again that doesn't actually affect the game in any negative way.  Value: Currently at $15 Don't Starve is a great value.  The game is fun, appropriate for family, and has good replay value.  Also purchasing now is a good investment for Don't Starve Together which is an update coming soon that adds multi-player.  They plan to increase the price of the game by $5 when that update is live.  Likes/Dislikes:The most distinguishable ingredients of Don't Starve is the survival balance.  The game is not too hard and not too easy, yet if you feel one way or another you can modify the game world how you see fit.  I enjoy the ability to create a base, but not have it so powerful that it breaks the difficulty.  I also love that the game is a wilderness survival game and doesn't offer a house or tower to stand atop to break the threat of enemies on the ground.Little upsets I have had is the worm-holes and how you cannot enter a worm hole while being attacked; I've died like this multiple times now and still have not learned that lesson.  The need to rotate the camera is often aggravating and disorienting, but there are some remedies to that.  Conclusion:A very pronounced title that offers intimidating experiences in wilderness survival.  Don't Starve holds a key to my desire that many survival games do not.  I hope to see more of Don't Starve in the future, especially with Don't Starve Together.			"

												Don't Starve has to be one of the most original and fun games i've ever played klei entertainment made something special when crafting a game as amazing as Don't Starve i've played hours and hours and it dosent ever bore me. It throws you into a randomly generated world and makes you learn for yourself. Expect death at first and learn from your mistakes this game was crafted in such a way that it's a hardcore death game, but yet makes it so fun. The artwork is also amazing and detailed i highly suggest getting this game for the low price it is.			"

												I adore this game. It's a quirky survivalist game, but don't let the adorable artwork confuse you---this is not an easy game. The UI is minimal and the controls are simple, and in the beginning the learning curve isn't too steep. Find food; collect items to make a fire. Stay in the light. Not so hard, right?Until you start exploring, and you find unknown foods, unknown creatures, and unknown items. Will you eat that mushroom? Those berries? Will you touch that giantic bird thing that you've never seen before and it looks like it might be frien----NO, OH NO, DO NOT TOUCH THAT BIRD RUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN....Ahem. This is a clever and wickedly addicting survival game that will keep you on your toes. Even better, it's now multiplayer--though don't think that makes it a whole lot easier... The main game has permanent death, which I actually quite enjoy. There's something so exciting about surviving longer than any other time you've played. If you really wish you can turn that option off, however. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find out what happens when I use a sleeping dart on that giant tree thing over there.			"

												Pros:        - Hunger, health, and sanity are all factors you need too worry about, keeping you on your toes       - If you die once, it's all over; Giving you bragging rights once you ""beat"" the game       - Once you have learned the ropes and have lasted till day 100+, you can do Adventure mode, Go underground, or          buy the DLC       - There are different seasons that each have there own sruggles and hardships       - In case this is too easy, hounds come every 7 days (aproximatly), getting harder each time. Cons:        - None that i can think of :)10/10 one of my favorite games!			"

												A deliciously brutal game of discovery.  The main game is highly customizeable for those who want to take a pleasant camping trip, but the game offers a real sense of accomplishment for those looking for a challenge.  Every death is a lesson learned, and you'll find yourself saying ""I'll just play for a couple more minutes so that I can build this or hunt that.""  There are plenty of characters to be earned as well, which helps keep the experience interesting.  This is definitely a game where you must set your own goals and plan ahead; if you are the type of player who wants quests and clearly defined objectives, this is not the game for you.			"

												Already died over 30 times. Wilson never even lived to see another day on the first game.The following characters lived for less than 10 days. As I learned more about the game, I got really hooked up with gathering items so that I can get my character to craft and eventually fighting monsters for the loot. I enjoyed looking for food sources and then cooking crockpot recipes. Figuring out how I should build my base also got me really interested more with other events that may happen in the game. Eventually I got Wilson surviving through the winter and was able to make him live for more than 100 days. Most of my playtime were done in survival mode, now I think I am ready for adventure mode.

												Dont starve is one of those games that every time you play you get a little better at it and in doing so you feel an overall feeling of acheivement not seen in many games (dare i say it,it reminded me of the feeling i had playing dark souls).Very much like the classic games from FROM SOFTWARE this game throws you in at the deep end and you either sink or swim,having said that every time you die when you play next time you know a little bit more to get that little bit further and survive for that little bit longer.I have many a time played this game and yet i seem to keep being surprised by the amount of new things i keep bumping into (especially during a full moon OH THAT WAS CREEPY).I love the games that the developers made before this one (the shank games are fantastic-still remind me of the film machete though) but i think that this game is their crowning glory and will be hard for them to top.The graphics suit this game and just add to the overall experience you have whilst playing.Again this is another game that again shows up the big developers and shows that smaller developers have more more orriginality than they do (money does'nt allways mean that your game is the best and shiny graphice dont allways make good gameplay please take note all you power hungry developers).In closing i love this game and if you want a challenge you should look no further than DONT STARVE.

												The game is an original survival game. Nobody knows the full story behind it, but they put little secrets in the game so you can see a bit of the story. In the game you don't just pickup stuff and shove it in your mouth... well you can do that but you can cook the food, build a base, prepare for winter. The whole ""crafting"" mechanism is awesome I think. The landscape is giant so you can venture anywhere. However if you get bored in that world... you can find or create a portal wich will activate ""adventure mode"" wich is a little more challenging than the normal gamemode. The Adventure Mode has scenarios that will make the game harder and it has five chapters. At the end of the chapter theres the end of the game wich i think was pretty good. By the way these ""screnarios"" in adventure mode, you can imagine them like... in the first chapter (""King of Winter"") there is always winter... wich is bad because you don't have anything warm at the start.Well that was a little review. Hope you want to play the game and experience these things. And remember, Don't Starve.(sorry my english is kinda' bad :D)			"

For the price it has a lot of life and replay value as you slowly learn the world and get better at surviving. The game also has a decent modding community around it that is easily implemented through steams workshop. Everytime i think ive figured this game out and made it past my last playthrough it isnt long before i encounter some new enemy or hazard that ruins my day. My only complain is that your inventory can get a little cluttered and hard to manage though it hardly takes away from the overall feel of the game. Highly recommend.			"

												Probably one of my favorite games purchased on steam. Between my own account and a friends I have clocked approximatly 50+ hours into this game, from the dark art style to the endless grind for materials there is nothing I don't love about this game. The only issue for some players I see for some players would be the difficulty curve and the endless hunt for resources, however for me personally this wasn't an issue. My hat goes off to the developers :) Highly recommended			"

												Don't Starve is seriously my favorite game that I've stumbled across on Steam. The learning curve was rough, but all your deaths make for good stories once you get the hang of it. Day 157 I can jokingly recall the run where I died 3 times in a row because it was night time and Willow had lost her lighter regenerating. There are so many ways to play with all the characters you can choose from in game and with mods from the Steam community there is something in Don't Starve for everyone. All around it's a great game of survival that gets addicting fast. I can play it for hours at a time or even watch others play it because it's always different. There is always new stuff to find or be killed by.			"

Overheated and died. 10/10But really, this is a game you cannot win. You can only survive until your inevitable death finally catches you. And it'll probably be something ridiculous compared to all the things you survived. Frogs want to kill you. Hounds want to kill you. Penguins want to kill you. You might go insane or starve or die alone in the dark. Even the things that generally don't want to kill you may decide to kill you.			"

												On the surface, it seems like a very simple 2D game, and to be honest when I saw trailer I wasn't that interested.  However, a friend recommended it to me and after trying it, I was immediately hooked.  It has hidden layers of complexity and a charming morbid Gorey-esque aesthetic which fits perfectly into the game play.  You'll start off gathering berries and luring bunnies into your traps with carefree carrots and soon be fighting off nightmare hounds and delving into caves in search of glowberries and other things that grant you precious, precious light.  Its complexity comes slowly and its the sort of game that's as deep as you want to make it.  You can spend days and days just playing around collecting food and making the perfect camp or you can try for more challenging content in your own time by calling upon the dark arts for more powerful items.  Don't Starve, but also don't be caught in the dark, don't freeze, don't get eaten by a monoptic ruminant and most especially don't forget to build lightning rods.			"

												Don't Starve is a very different take on the popular survival genre. It's not a new game, but it's still earned hours of playtime. The art style is very different, the mechanics and crafting are easy to use, and the progression is tough but rewarding. This is a great game, and I would reccomend it.			"

												""Uncompromising"" is right!  While you can customize pretty much every aspect of the game if you want to, jiggering with the default settings is for whiners, crybabies, and those who need to be fed with a spoon.I discovered this game about the same time I got into Minecraft, so the comparisons are irresistible.  However, ""vidjamagame where you take materials from the wilderness to survive amid myriad threats and it's more dangerous at night"" is where the similarities end.  I'll highlight a few key differences: ~ Minecraft doesn't have a sanity meter.  And unlike most games with a sanity mechanic, here your hallucinations can kill you. ~ Minecraft doesn't have a half-dozen-plus characters, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. ~ Minecraft is about building.  Don't Starve is about surviving. ~ In Minecraft, you can safely ignore the tech tree if you're in creative mode, or even in hardcore mode if you mainly stick to the surface and concentrate on building well-lit structures.  In Don't Starve, ignoring the tech tree will get you killed in short order. ~ In Minecraft, only enemies, heights, and lava are really dangerous.  In Don't Starve, the darkness itself will kill you, winter can kill you, bees can kill you, and every few days a pack of roving hounds will spawn specifically to kill you - and yes, every pack you kill makes the next one stronger.In summary, Minecraft is an exploration and building game with wilderness survival elements; Don't Starve is a roguelike wilderness survival game with building and exploration elements.  The ""roguelike"" is what's key there:  high difficulty, frequent death, no backup saves, and don't forget the delightful Victorian aesthetic.  OK, I got a bit away from the ""roguelike"" theme at the end there.  :)If this game appeals to you at all, give it a shot.  Plus, The Screecher (a free included total conversion mod by the dev team) is the first game in a long time to make me physically jump in my chair.  It's almost an homage to Slender, but the fact that it's randomly generated (so you can't memorize the map across multiple playthroughs) and the stylized graphics really set it apart.			"

												Imagine. You are a mad scientist, plucked from your lab and dropped in the wilderness with naught but the clothes on your back. And it's not just any normal wilderness, oh no! It's one filled with strange and dangerous creatures! Its up to you to survive, using all the natural resources available to you, as well as your own ingenuity! Just, don't forget to eat. And dont forget to pack a torch either.Don't Starve is an exercize in survival. You need to keep yourself fed to avoid starvation, you need to fight off monsters as you explore your surroundings, and whatever happens, you need to make sure you have a source of light at night. Failure at any of the aforementioned three means you die, and have to start over in an entirely new world! Don't Starve is surprisingly complex and can eat away hours of your time as you try to figure out new items to build, new food recipes to try out (that may or may not be poisonous) and new ways to help you stay alive in a hostile world! If you're an avid lover of indie games with a flair for the strange and the creepy, Don't Starve is at the top of my list for you to buy!			"

												Would you like a game that utterly destroys your sanity? Well, this is your game! It's Brutal difficulty will bring you to your knees, and then after, thustly chopping your head off! Let me recall my experience thus far,First game:Get in, try and collect food... enjoying my time, then suddently blackness! My character, confused, comments on the sheer darkness of the night, and then, 1 SWIPE! 2 SWIPE! Game Over!Second game:survive 6 days, and then my sanity level dropped so low, that monsters of my imagination ravaged my face off with their mighty claws and teeth!Third game: Still surviving, found a good cycle to keep steady food, so i built a small fort surrounding a science machine, and others, it rains. I notice a slight increase in frogs around me, and pay no interest. I then, later try to kill one, and by now, they have surrounded my small fort, i hit it once with a spear, and it, with its giant mallet tongue, hits me 3 times, down to 10 health! Still alive though! I retreat to my fort, when then, a lightning bolt cuts through the sky, and burns my humble home to the ground, and the ashes, blew away swiftly in the wind! SUCH A DIFFICULT GAME, it will hurt you again and again, and the challenge is compellling! i enjoy this game, because it does not hold your hand, in fact, if u try to hold its hand, it will slap you across the face, and kick you while your down. 10/10 would recommend this game, verrrrry challenging, but very fun!

												If you like rogue-like games, this game is A MUST HAVE.Tons of characters, all with hilarious and personal dialog that really makes you love the characters (My favorite is Wendy or WX-78)This game has a pretty nice modding scene, and gets an update at least once every 3 weeks. The developers are also planning workshop support.EDIT 4/12/14: The new DLC came out, and it added an absolute boatload of new stuff and features, and adds so much to the game, even though it's still in early access. If your going to get this game, be sure to get the DLC too, great DLC!4/5 stars9/10			"

												The world of Don't Starve might first look like the one of Minecraft or Terraria, but many things are different, you can't just spend the night inside a house, looking out from a window. You are always in danger and you can't know when the worst will come and without any preparing, you'll easily get killed. You can't have infinite light sources, you need fuel and something to burn the fuel on every night. You always need to be on the lookout and get more food. You can't know when a giant monster totters to your camp and breaks everything apart, or if giant spiders surround your camp. Then where do you get the food? You can't magically make meat, or anything. You need to get it yourself. Neither you can magically put together two mushrooms in a bowl to make excellent food, you need to cook it. and for cooking you need it's own ingredients. And you never know if your top-class cooking recipe turns out to make a big chunk of goop.			"

												Reluctance and hesitation were the first feelings out of me when I acquired this game, mainly due to the seemingly never ending popularity in knock-off Minecraft games. However, this game quickly won me over after about an hour or two of game play.Don't Starve is a survival game as the title suggests, but contrary to the title, the cause of death usually won't be starvation, as nearly everything in the game seems to want you dead. Not much is explained to the player, aside from the fact that you and your character need to find food and shelter before nightfall on your randomly spawned island.Game play is tedious and crafty and only grows in difficulty as you progress. I find more joy in learning as I play, rather than looking up how to play or how certain elements work. I don't think you can get much enjoyment out of simply playing for an hour or so and then quitting. No, you must be persistent and be prepared to sit on your butt for a few hours in order to become properly and fully immersed into the environment. Each time you die you must start over, unless you figure out some way to re-spawn (don't worry, it's entirely possible). The map also changes every time you start a new game, so there's no worry about knowing where you are or what could possibly lie at the edge of your screen.Something I find special and charming to this game is the characters. As you progress, you can unlock unique characters, who all have their pros and cons and as well as distinctive personalities. Their different abilities can dramatically change how you view the environment given to you, whether it's for the better or worse.The main focus of this game is survival, so if you're looking to build incredible structures then I suggest you go back to Minecraft or some other such game. With that being said, after I'm able to build a comfortable base, map out the entire island, and survive the dreaded winter, I enjoy starting a new game and tormenting myself all over again.Of course, this review says nothing about the underlying plot hidden between the cracks of the updates. That's for you to figure out though.			"

												Absolutely love this game. A proper survival horror, with a gritty illustration look. You will care about not dying in this game, as if you die, your game is wiped and you start again (although there are a few in game tricks to let you respawn). You can make the game more, or less challenging with the options which allow you to change all the factors individually which is a fantastic feature and much better than a generic ""easy"", ""medium"" or ""hard"" mode. Sadly, this game has no multiplayer mode which would have really improved the longevity of the game, but here's hoping for a future survival game from this company which will include a multiplayer mode. I will be looking out for it! Definately give it a go if you haven't already!			"

												TL;DR version:Rating: 8/10Reason: Easy to pick up and play, hard to master, very entertaining whenever.Long Version:No matter what I seem to be doing in this game, the situations always go from bad to worse. This might seem bad at first, but it wouldnt be a survival game if it didnt do this. Whenever things go bad, you gotta find a solution somehow.Whats that? A giant sentient tree of sorts is coming to spill my guts for defiling the forest so I can gain a few measly logs? I cant fight this thing on my own? Let us befriend the local pig population to have it fight the creature for me, an army of my very own!Crafting in this game is easy to use and simple, while the materials themselves are the challenge and so fun to gather. If youre looking to pass some time on a game you dont need to think too hard on.. Well.. Maybe go for some solitaire but, if youre looking to pass some time with a game that stands out from other genres, pick up Don't Starve! I give it a very solid 8/10 (since im a tough critic)			"

												I don't often rate a game as good. But when i do, it better have some unique and original game concepts. This game is great, hardly anything like it on the gaming scene. One down side, the better you get at it and the more days you survive, the more upset you will be when you inevitably die.			"

												The world of Don't Starve might first look like the one of Minecraft or Terraria, but many things are different, you can't just spend the night inside a house, looking out from a window. You are always in danger and you can't know when the worst will come and without any preparing, you'll easily get killed. You can't have infinite light sources, you need fuel and something to burn the fuel on every night. You always need to be on the lookout and get more food. You can't know when a giant monster totters to your camp and breaks everything apart, or if giant spiders surround your camp. Then where do you get the food? You can't magically make meat, or anything. You need to get it yourself. Neither you can magically put together two mushrooms in a bowl to make excellent food, you need to cook it. and for cooking you need it's own ingredients. And you never know if your top-class cooking recipe turns out to make a big chunk of goop.			"

												This is probably the most stimulating game that I have played in a long time. I love games that don't have a set guideline and allow me to be in charge of my own fate. This game is really entertaining and not to mention the art work is outstanding. I love spooky, messy, hand-drawn looking art. It adds character to the game.The only thing I would change about the game is maybe supply a little more knowledge or tips within the game as the person plays. I found it hard to play at first until I watched a few guides on youtube. Maybe having a small trailer or clip before the first initial play might help this.Other than that, this has easily become one of my favorite games and I will/have referred it to many people.			"

												Redo-a-review rave!  My old review was made back in Dec 2012 and alot has changed, I've found.Back when I found Don't Starve, it was a good survival, and had round islands connected to eachother from slim 'bridges'. From the beta to now, much changed, much got added and best of all, full mod support via a lua-scripting based API was added, along with full integration for the Steam Workshop.Don't Starve is a Tim Burton-esque survival game based on living as long as you can or progressing through its adventure mode onslaught. You'll have to manage your days to thrive in this harsh environment with several well-fleshed biomes to peck your beaks at. You begin your game as Wilson. A crazed scientist hell-bent on his goal of endless knowledge, promised to him by Maxwell, a dapper fellow who traps him on the unknown island that Don't Starve takes place in.The first thing I want to say, is that Don't Starve's art style and sound design is the best I've seen from an indie game to date, with the entire game being aptly themed to its dark, humerous gameplay, a nice simple, pencil-shaded art style accompanied by lovely OST's which use exotic and well themed instruments. The character voice acting is none existant, instead, each character has a instrument as their vocals. From Willow's flute to Wolfgang's tuba, all suit the characters personality.The characters in Don't Starve are widely varied and have unique abilities and shortcomings which bring different playstyles to each playthrough, keeping the gameplay fresh and unique, while keeping you interested with what they have to say with unique witty examination lines per-character about everything. The world changes around you by itself, Beefalo (the native buffalo herds) will grow, the season will change, terrors grow in the night and the world turns more and more hostile, forcing you to go and --spoilerfied for the sake of spoilerness-- before things get too heated.Combat or survival. You can, if so inclined kill everything you can get on your spear to try and survive, or try your hand at trapping and farming, or balancing the both out as best you can. There are several random events, leading to bosses, treasures and traps as you explore the island, along with newly introduced caves for spelunking.Don't starve still has a few months of development cycles left, and a thriving community still present as it was back in '12.Oh, and its ON SALE (as of review date)!Science! Over and out.			"

												Would you like a game that utterly destroys your sanity? Well, this is your game! It's Brutal difficulty will bring you to your knees, and then after, thustly chopping your head off! Let me recall my experience thus far,First game:Get in, try and collect food... enjoying my time, then suddently blackness! My character, confused, comments on the sheer darkness of the night, and then, 1 SWIPE! 2 SWIPE! Game Over!Second game:survive 6 days, and then my sanity level dropped so low, that monsters of my imagination ravaged my face off with their mighty claws and teeth!Third game: Still surviving, found a good cycle to keep steady food, so i built a small fort surrounding a science machine, and others, it rains. I notice a slight increase in frogs around me, and pay no interest. I then, later try to kill one, and by now, they have surrounded my small fort, i hit it once with a spear, and it, with its giant mallet tongue, hits me 3 times, down to 10 health! Still alive though! I retreat to my fort, when then, a lightning bolt cuts through the sky, and burns my humble home to the ground, and the ashes, blew away swiftly in the wind! SUCH A DIFFICULT GAME, it will hurt you again and again, and the challenge is compellling! i enjoy this game, because it does not hold your hand, in fact, if u try to hold its hand, it will slap you across the face, and kick you while your down. 10/10 would recommend this game, verrrrry challenging, but very fun!

												Don't Starve embraces the true meaning of a dark, yet comedic world to survive in. In playing as Wilson, you will survive the dangers of Maxwell's world, and even attempt to confront Maxwell himself with the included portal to Adventure mode which is found within survival mode. Don't Starve currently has a significant amount to offer in its permadeath environment, providing hours of enjoyment. The only downside is the repetitiveness that the game brings after starting over, and having a sufficiently outfitted base set up. Other than that, the game provides various enemies, all sorts of scientific and magical inventions, and a plethora of other obstacles to your survival.			"

												Don't Starve is an addictingly entertaining game, worth every penny. It is a survival sandbox game, where the ultimate goal is to... don't starve... and explore the vast wilderness and survive for as long as possible. The game is based on a rogue-like concept, which means that every time you play a game, everything is randomized. In addition, the game offers no tutorials or guides on how to play, which only enhances the aspect of exploration. This is definitely the best element this game has to offer, as there are numerous things to discover, even after 90+ hours of gameplay. As with most rogue-likes, the game can be quite difficult, and death often lurks behind every corner. The game also features permanent death, which means that once you die, you will have to start all over again, although there are ways to cheat death a couple of times. There are a number of different characters to unlock through varius means. They have emphasis on different aspects of gameplay, which can either make the game easier or harder for you. In addition, they have all a unique ability that differentiates themselves from the other characters. The visual aspect of the game is pleasing, and the audio is very enjoyable. It perfectly supplements the cartoonish atmosphere of the game.Additionally, the community is great. There is a plethora of mods and guides available. The modding community is vast and the mods can either make life easier or more difficult for you, depending on your preferences, and veteran Don't Starve players can utilize mods to keep the game alive for a long time. For new players, there are tons of guides to be found, many of which I have used myself. They are a valuable resource when you are in need of tips and tricks. All in all, a great indie survival game, which I would recommendable: 10/10			"

												This has to be the best survival game ever next to Minecraft. Its like your trapped in a whole other world when you play, and playing survival offs with my friends so epic. Heres a good way to have a survival off, Who ever survives and gets the farthest into the game the fastst is how it goes.			"

												This game kinda reminds me of my first night in Minecraft. The game does not tell you what to do at the start, you're just thrown into the world and will have to rely on your wits and creativity to survive. However, Minecraft is a walk in the park compared to Don't Starve. Its hunger and sanity mechanic really forces you to go out to find resources to survive. In a way, it makes exploring in Don't Starve a more rewarding experience as the randomly generated world always has surprises. The art style is also pretty cool (and scary sometimes).Its a true survival sandbox in every aspect. 8/10			"

												This game is insanely addicting and fun, and I strongly suggest anyone who enjoys a little rogue-like survival game here and there, or even someone who enjoys Burtonesque-style things would enjoy this game. Now, for the newcomer, it may be incredibly difficult to figure out what to do at first. But the more you play, the more you'll start to get a hang of things, the more you'll figure out what to and what NOT to do. This is a quality game, and it is incredibly unique, unlike really anything I've seen before. It is well worth the money, and for those people who are on the fence, I strongly suggest you get it now, since the price will go up once they add the multiplayer feature.			"

												This game is insanely fun.  It's addicting.  I can't get enough.  In my first game I began clicking like a madman.  Collecting every little thing I possibly could.  I ignored the warnings about the night time and so I had my first death.  Round two.  I build my axe and my pick.  I start harvesting again.  I'll live this time.  I build a science machine and traps to catch rabbits.  I'm doing pretty well.  I build a spear and now I'm feeling tough.  I find some animal tracks on the ground.  I follow them.  I find and attack the animal.  I die.  Alright.  Start again.  Rebuild.  I find these friendly buffalo!  They're pretty chill.  I keep exploring.  Keep building.  Go see the buffalo again.  Why are some of them red♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  Why are they attacking me?  Dead.  Apparently when they're in heat they're aggressive.  Okay let's try again.  Build another base.  Harvest more resources.  Plant a grove of trees that I can harvest at will.  Start cutting down trees.  Tree comes to life.  Tree kills me.  I've since died to spiders, frogs, creatures spawned of my insanity, and some weird robots.  Even with as much time as I spend dying and rebuilding I never hesitate to restart and continue.  I love this game and you probably will too.			"

												A Hilariously fun survival game, In which, despite, the blatant instruction... you will starve ;~PThe artwork alone makes the game fantastic, along with the witty commentary and insanity that goes along with it. The game is definitely challenging, in that death is actual, no restoring to a save point, no cheat codes, if you fail to survive, you end up with your own Obituary in the Morgue.A terrific game if you are the type to poke around, and learn, however if you expect a simple mindless punch tree to get wood, use wood to make pick... and so on, there is a little bit of that, but for the most part you will be failing, starving and dying until you learn how not to do so. ;~P 1st try lasted until day six, going in and out of wormholes, setting up a base with no nearby food, near the wormhole that took me to the most desecrated lifeless land of nothingness that you could ever find... needless to say I starved ;~PP.S.: Don't Starve ;~P      x~D			"

												Very cool little survival and crafting game.  Casual in it's gameplay but also challenging and rewarding at the same time.  The graphics are in the stylized in a creepy comic book sort of fashion that serves the theme of the game very well.  The sound design and music are excellent and only enhance the experience rather than distract from it.  Most importantly though, the game is simple to get into and features some very intuitive and streamlined controls.  Whether you're using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad, players will be able to jump into the game and explore the Don't Starve with relative ease.  The challenge is finding the ingredients and materials necessary to survive while discovering the usefulness of each item and tool that becomes available, all while avoiding the dangerous creatures that come out at night and the lingering darkness they bring with it.    ---  The Good  ---  - Nice graphical style- Great sound design and music- Intuitive gameplay and user friendly control scheme- Made for gamers of all skill levels and backgrounds (casual and diehard gamers alike)- Both Mouse & Keyboard and even Gamepad support!  ---  The Bad  ---  - Nothing really, this game is very good all around!- The only thing that might throw off newcomers is the fact that they  will need to discover what they'll need to do within the game all on their own without very much help.  The game is relatively easy to figure out though and shouldn't cause frustration for even the most casual of gamers and newcomers to gaming.			"

												This game seems some-what boring from the trailers, but I can assure you it's not. My friend gifted it to me for Christmas and it actually was pretty fun. I started with a lack of light my first night, and got murdered by whatever in God's name that thing was. Next, I tweaked a new world to have a lot of food. I began finding carrots everywhere. But, I found something interesting. I found what was called a mandrake. They look almost exactly like carrots in the ground, and yes, they're the things from Harry Potter. When you eat one, it cycles the time of the game to either day or night (depending which you are currently in). I proceeded to find many, many, many mandrakes. Started carrying them with me all the time. I befriended one, called him Charles. I had found almost all the mandrakes in the world. After a long time, Charles was all I had left. I'd gotten lost in a sinkhole, and my fire was almost out. I could here one of those stone monsters walking around, my heart beating incredibly fast. As my fire just went out, I whispered. ""I love you Charles,"" and listened to the monster slowly walk towards us. Overall, I'd give Mandrake Simulator 2015 an 8/10.			"

												This game is a ton of fun to learn. It can be a little frustrating playing the game at first and not knowing you needed to do X Y or Z (the first time you're killed by a tree when doing something you've done a hundred times before...), but its a fun kind of frustration.This is a game that ANYONE can play but can require quite a bit of thought and experience to master. I have yet to meet someone that doens't like the game. Just about everyone becomes disillusioned with it when the mystery is gone and they learn all the ""pieces"", but it can't be helped. It's still worth a good 20 to 30 hours of playtime, and if you just love the game even without discovery you can always play some of the unlockable characters for a different approach.			"

If the original game play gets a little ""boring"" because you've survived too long you can get the Reign of Giants DLC which will increase the challenge. There are tons of mods in the workshop to individualize your game play and add an extra element to your experience.			"

												I am a big fan of this game. It's awfully challenging the first several play throughs, especially since its primary (and I think only) difficulty setting is the equivalent of Minecraft's hardcore mode: 1 life. However, that's part of what makes this game so satisfying. Aside from feelings of accomplishment this game has a great spin on the crafting/survival game. It's artisitc style is expertly done, the variety of things to discover and create is expansive as well. The world is large with lots to explore. I have played for a... fair amount of time, and there are still many things in the game I have yet to uncover.High replay value with diverse worlds, tough challenges, several playable characters, DLC I haven't even jumped into yet, and some mods that I have seen that look like they could be seriously awesome (The Screecher). Interested in this game? Buy and play! Very much worth it.			"

												Absoultely worth full price. The developers have put a lot of work into making this one of the best survival games I've ever played. The art style is fantastic, as is the gameplay. However, the game is HARD, so if that's not your thing.....buy it anyway. You can adjust the world generation to make the game easier if you like. Or even more hellish. The world is randomely generated by the way. This means every playthrough feels fresh. Which is great, because when you die, you die. All of your progress is gone. However, its always your fault if you die. Didn't have supplies for a torch, wandered into a clockwork bishop, lit a forest on fire...punched a pig. The game encourages you to learn as you play; with each subsequent playtrough you are a little better equipped to make it out alive. This is absolutely a journey worth taking. BUY IT!			"

												Don't Starve is one of the rare games that is so atmospheric that once you start you can't tear yourself from it.  It's insane difficulty mixed with that true feeling of advancing, discovering, and conquering is a recipe for long hours of fun.  Though you can surround yourself with walls and food, the underlying creepy tone (which I absolutely love) always reminds you that death is never more than just around the corner.  This game isn't for a very casual gamer, it takes determination, skill, and will to advance anywhere, which makes it all the sweeter when you do.Overall Don't Starve (RoG included) is a hardcore, rewarding, and atmospheric game that is hard to even look away from.  I definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves the above.			"

												Don't Starve is a survival game done in ""Tim Burton"" type visuals. The game starts off with you creating or generating your world on a set of options, and than you are thrown into the world without help, advice, any tools etc. You main goal is to not starve, hence the name. You must gather tools, materials, food, and start crafting your base. The game has day/night cycles, weather, seasons, etc. Tons of different cute monsters and enviroments await you in the game. You must figure a way out of the world by the evil boss at the end of the game. There are many craftable foods and weapons to make, tons to do, and caves to explore and whatnot. This game doesn't get boring. Many characters to unlock that have diffferent skills and things, like Wilson (first character) grows a beard, and other characters like the robot can eat anything. The game is well worth it, and is fun to play.			"

Even after 80 ingame hours, I'm still discovering and learning new things about the game that I previously didnt know. With the upcoming addition of Dont Starve Together (multiplayer), I suspect that this game can only move forward. I most definitely recommend its purchase (especially if it's on sale!!). Hope to see you all in the multiplayer! Cheers!			"

												It's a very very fun game. The best survival i have ever played so far. It has nice and simple design but can be ridiculously hard sometimes (at winter for example). Basically KNOWLEDGE IS LIFE in this game, so it's very worthy and advisable to search on google/wikia for items, strategies and tips to survive.Be aware this game will provide many hours of joy and anger. Enjoy it!			"

												Help,I'm addicted to this and everything related to Don't Starve. Its continual random spawns of new worlds keeps me going with the chance that I can get a good place. Hungry for more, you keep discovering new things once in a while but only if you survive for long enough. Also, ♥♥♥♥ you Maxwell.			"

												This should actually be a ""mixed"" review, but steam only allows ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether to recommend.The problem with this game is it's hardcore difficulty only. If you die you lose your saved game. The game is fun and challenging and all, which is why I do like it, but it gets boring when I had to do the first steps over and over again just to get to the fun part.Please give an option for not making it hardcore difficulty. Give us a choice.Edit:The above review was made when I played just a couple hours. Now I have played much longer, and some of my poinions have changed, so here's what I think now:The use of difficulties in a game is always something argued about. Good difficulties are challenges that makes the game more interesting, bad diffculties are nausiences. I think for this game, yes, prema-death does make sense, changing it would require changing the entire game. But that is exactly why I don't play it anymore: It was fun for the later 47-ish hour out of the 57 hours I played, but not after.So I'm changing my review to a thumb up. cheers:)			"

												Don't Starve is a mediocre good game that you can find in the most money milking survival horror genre era.I personally dislike the Art style, it looks a bit like Tim Burton's art style ? I know it's nitpicking however I wouldn't let that get in my way since I am an avid Otaku.So I let that out of my chest, now to the game.The game requires alot of ""finding things"" and ""crafting things"" to survive, which are both core elements to horror survival game and they nailed it. Although I would really say that the ""horror"" part was maybe toned down a little. If you aren't patient then this game isn't for you because you would have to wait for like 2 or 3 minutes every time the game goes into nighttime before you progress on. I am not really that far into the game and I found myself dying to stupid things because I was curious to experiment with stuffs that they provide in the game. Curiosity killed the cat and the game made me do it which is not a bad thing. I love it when game does that, meaning I can get more out from what I paid.Overall it's a solid game, can't wait for the multiplayer. Although it gets a tad boring sometimes.7/10			"

I would recommend to buy the Shipwrecked DLC after you have learned little bit about the game. The Shipwrecked DLC has cool new features and offers new type of gameplay and tactics.			"

												Full of danger lurking around literally every turn, Don't Starve is a fantastic game. Thrown into a very unforgiving world with nothing but the clothes on your back, you must work quickly to build tools, find food, and make a shelter in the often vain attempt to survive. This game is pretty difficult, and only gets harder as the game goes on; the longer you survive, the more dangerous the world becomes and harder it is to continue.I cannot recommend this game enough to people who enjoy difficult and survival games. From plants and animals that want you dead to the very shadows and darkness of night out to get you, this game will have you huddled around just about any light source you can find in minutes. I give this game a very easy 9.5/10. In short: YOU WILL DIE.			"

												Well, where to start?... I bought this game back when it was released as an early access title on Steam. From there it has improved and developed in so many ways that it's hard to describe...Don't Starve is a cute & sometimes a little creepy survival and crafting game. Upon starting it you're dropped in a strange and hand-painted world full of mysteries, monster and ressources. From this point you'll have to build up a base and explore the world to improve your equipment and survive against the wilderness... By discovering some in-game secrets or by plain out surviving long enough you'll unlock many different characters with certain strenghts and weaknesses... The greatest thing about this game is, that it's very content rich and open to exploration...With the two DLCs ""Reign of Giants"" and ""Shipwrecked"" even more content is added to the game. In Reign of Giants you'll have to fight far stronger enemies than before and thus develop new tactics to defend yourself from those new creatures that were added to the game. You'll also have to face new environmental threads, such as dangerous and unforgiving deserts.The newly released DLC ""Shipwrecked"" features the exploration of a tropical version of Don't Starve, featuring completely new bosses and items, giving the game a nice and new kind of concept and tactical approach.I certainly recommend this game to anyone whos interested in open-world survival games. Don't Starve can be very harsh and unforgiving on the player, but uppon learning from your mistakes you'll survive longer and become better and better until you finally ""beat"" the game. I can also recommend both of the DLCs since they are extremely well made! Have fun playing and good luck surviving!			"

Frogs Raining? Better Leave your base or Hire an Exterminator. With The New Multiplayer Coming This summer ( SO EXITED) possibilites will be endless with a couple of friends or random people! You Could build a huge base..... Fight awsome bosses together, Have an all out war on each other.....

												Best game I have ever played. For the money I have had hours upon hours of fun. Yes certain parts of the game get repetitious and it's frustrating when you die but it's all part of the game. It takes a certain person to like this game. You need to be able to lose all your stuff and just shrug it off. Because it's the experience that really matters. The game never gets to a point where I feel there's nothing to do. If you don't have this game I recommend you to buy it now. I will never ever be sick of this unique game and amazing art style. Plus the DLCs for this game are both cheap well made and like a whole new game. Last but not least the modding community is one of the best and will always be there to renew any lost interest. 11/10 game.			"

												A disturbing, slender, and well dressed gentleman bids you to wake up, and insists you find food before nightfall. What he doesn't tell you, is that come nightfall, should you be lost in the shadows, something terrible might happen. Several days pass since the start of your adventure, and you may feel pretty good about yourself, your supplies, and your structures. Just know that nothing is permanent... nothing.In Don't Starve, you're thrown into a sandbox survival game mode immediately. There is no tutorial. Death is your tutorial. Learn from it. Your goal, to find out what your goal is. There is no hand holding. Figure it out. Because if you don't, you will enevtually die. If you find out, and are ill prepared, you will also die. Take your time, but don't waste it. There is also a door, somewhere in the world. Within it, you may find answers.I was very skeptical of this game at first. ""Oh great"" I said, ""Another sandbox survival game. Just what we needed.""Then I played it, and I was hooked. The gameplay manages to be fun, rather than tedious like so many other survival games. The art style is distinct, and reminiscent of Tim Burton's older works. Each playable character works a little differently, adding to the game's replay value.This game is like being in an abusive relationship with a sociopathic puppy. In that you never know what it wants you to do, it actively tries to make you miserable, but you can't help but love it. All in all I am very pleased with this title. I would reccommend it to anyone who enjoys survival games, structure defense games, or someone just looking for a good challenge.			"

												Don't Starve is like a hardcore survival game. It's pretty fun, gets dull sometimes, but with dlc it's pretty well done. I think Klei did a good job with dlc, I reccomend shipwrecked because it's basically a new game. Reign of giants kinda does too with caves but that's the only reason to get Rog. Overall pretty solid game.			"

												The most fun you can have starving. Have been playing this and Reign of Giants for some time and dont see myself quiting soon. I recently purchased the Shipwrecked game and have been having a great time with it. This game is so much fun that I got my wife to start playing it with me (she doesnt play any pc games). Now we are starving together. I recommend purchasing the Mega pack. It contains all the games for half the price as one AAA game. Doesnt matter how you starve, all the versions are great and will keep you entertained for months. After that you can start modding your game, as there is a huge modding community available.The developers are constantly rewarding their players and are very involved in the game. Klei has become one of my favourite developers.Wont Starve again!10/10			"

												Don't Starve is my all-time favorite game, and might I say, that's quite an achievement since I play a lot of games on a daily basis and am part of many game-related fandoms.DS has a silly air to it at the beginning, but the longer you play, the more you realize how deep it actually is in terms of variety. The gameplay may be confusing at times but it's generally user-friendly and has nothing a few bug fixing mods won't fix. The storyline may seem shallow but it's altogether quite interesting if you're really into DS as a fandom more than just a quick play and actually want to know the characters' personalities and such.It's a nice, well put together game that can work as either a quick 1h play and a 24h marathon without getting sick of it. I made sure to buy as many copies as I could to my friends because it was just that fantastical, and I've been in love with this game ever since its first steam release.If you're into survival games as much as I am and want to explore the world rather than to just stick with one base and fight off crazy monsters that won't let you enjoy the entire experience, then it's one game for you to consider.

												As a fan of these type of games (in which you have to work and work to get what you want - ex. Harvest Moon, games like that) , I recommend this game to those with a lot of patience and time, who won't just quit in frustration after the first few plays. If the gameplay doesn't drag you in, then the plot-line will if you follow it. The Tim Burton style gives it a nice, creepy touch that I applaud it for. The mechanics are well-implemented, and the time-management factor is a great touch to it, since you may have to plan out what you're going to do and how long you have to get to a certain area, what's more important to focus on for a day (dedicating a day to rabbit-hunting, chopping wood, tending to a base) and so on and so forth; some survival games don't put this in very well, but this one certainly does. Sometimes it does get a little frustrating, but once you get the hang of it, it gets very fun and addicting; you never know what's ahead until you explore. 10/10, definitely would recommend.			"

												Don't starve is one of those Indy Games that you like, play fore a while, get addicted to, play a little longer and the put it away for a year or so to start the process again later on.The way this game plays, feels and is being experienced just works for me. the art feels both safe (mainly because it is cartoony) and yet dark too. And for a game in which the dark will kill you and you'll have to create light to stay alive that is great! At night you'll be terrified while feeding your campfire with the last pieces of wood, and during the day you'll be ready for an adventure to gather supplies, food and weaponrry for the next night (and day).I must admit, after playing it for too long it will get boring. mainly because it's still an indy game which just isn't build for great scale and an unlimited supply of options (Except for the all-known Mojang Project, if you get my drift). But, after a while, you can pick it up again an loose yourself again for a couple of weeks (maybe months).For the price I would say it is definately worth it! Great and addictive to certain extend, 8/10			"

												One of my great fall back games. Even before the Reign of Giants DLC the game received much love in the form of updates by the developers. In the game you start out as Wilson, you are pulled in to a bizarre world and someone named Maxwell and you basically have to survive. There are two implicit game modes (you don't have to choose they just both are there) to play. One is just the pure survival in a bizarre world and the other is to find the person who got you in the world and ""deal with him ""Both things are really entertaining to do. The game is hard enough as it is on its default standing but you can change any custom generated world as you please. If you don't like a world all are random generated so best start a new one. The game has its own art style you either love or hate. Its got a unique atmosphere and an isometric 3rd person view when playing the game (camera can be turned)I personally just love this game and every once in a while check what has been changed. I'd say if you like how the game looks, like a challenge, like random generated worlds, like survival games and this art style, than this game is for you!			"

												Don't let the small amount of time fool you, I've spent many hours in game both online and offline. I must say when it comes to survival games this has to be one of my all time favorites. I had a fasination with them back in the old days of WarCraft 3 Wilderness survival. At first this game appeared as a typical collect stuff, Build, Eat, survive. But, it offers so much more and with a unique twist using your characters sanity. There is an added bonus of so much to explore.For a game with the price set at $14.99 I don't know many games that can beat it. I would give this game a soild 9/10 in my books. The only downside is getting started is a little overwhelming as there is so much to be done (In no particular order).			"

												This game probably doesn't need another positive review, but I've been having fun with, so I'll add one.  It is essentially a survival crafting game where you try to outsmart the world (which is constantly trying to kill you) in order to live as long as possible and discover it's secrets.  The best aspect of this game is discovering secrets, so play without instruction and discover all these secrets for yourself.  It seems simplistic in the first few hours; then you realize there are lots of fun surprises that let you overcome seemingly impossible obstacles.You will probably die a lot in this process.  And when you die, you start over.  It can get frustrating.  But if you put it down for a while, you will want to come back to it.  The game would have benefited from 'undefined' achievements; e.g. achievements where you don't have instructions on how to achieve them.  This would provide a record of what you have discovered without giving you a grindy laundry list of things to do and wouldn't make you play for the wrong reasons.  The developers (and particularly the forum mod) have a strange attitude of not allowing discussion of development decisions on this topic and others, which is off-putting for those who like to discuss the games they play, but it does not directly impact the enjoyability the game itself.It's a lot of fun, has a great art style, and definitely worth playing.  I only hope it doesn't get too repetitive before I'm able to survive adventure mode.			"

												You'll be proud of surviving your first day, your first hound attack, your first winter. When you manage to get your basics together, you'll be amazed at how easily you can die for any stupid mistake. And still you'll be yet to experience the depth of the full game.

												You awaken in a strange land with no memory of how you got there. A mysterious figure notes that ""you don't look so good"", and tells you to find something to eat, before vanishing. So begins your adventure. You are Wilson, gentleman scientist, and you have been cast into a world that looks like it was conceived and drawn by Tim Burton. Your goal: survive and thrive. To succeed, you must maintain Wilson's physical health, sanity, and, yes, hunger level. The world around you is full of resources, which can be destroyed, collected, and combined to create tools, shelter, food, and so on. As you progress through the game, you become more adept at magic and science, giving you the ability to shape the world around you in fantastical ways. Beware, though. The world has a copious supply of monsters, traps, and obstacles, and death is always only a misstep away.			"

												I am a big fan of this game. It's awfully challenging the first several play throughs, especially since its primary (and I think only) difficulty setting is the equivalent of Minecraft's hardcore mode: 1 life. However, that's part of what makes this game so satisfying. Aside from feelings of accomplishment this game has a great spin on the crafting/survival game. It's artisitc style is expertly done, the variety of things to discover and create is expansive as well. The world is large with lots to explore. I have played for a... fair amount of time, and there are still many things in the game I have yet to uncover.High replay value with diverse worlds, tough challenges, several playable characters, DLC I haven't even jumped into yet, and some mods that I have seen that look like they could be seriously awesome (The Screecher). Interested in this game? Buy and play! Very much worth it.			"

												Don't Starve embraces the true meaning of a dark, yet comedic world to survive in. In playing as Wilson, you will survive the dangers of Maxwell's world, and even attempt to confront Maxwell himself with the included portal to Adventure mode which is found within survival mode. Don't Starve currently has a significant amount to offer in its permadeath environment, providing hours of enjoyment. The only downside is the repetitiveness that the game brings after starting over, and having a sufficiently outfitted base set up. Other than that, the game provides various enemies, all sorts of scientific and magical inventions, and a plethora of other obstacles to your survival.			"

												At first, I really didn't understand Don't Starve. I was dying all the time and it was really hard. It didn't seem like there was much depth. I quit for a long time and stumbled upon the reviews for it one day and thought to myself, ""Why does everyone like this game so much?!"" I had to try again. What I discovered is that what I perceived to be a lack of depth was an excess of suckiness on my part.I looked up walkthroughs and was like ""Okay, I got dis.""The truth is, you really don't got dis. Unless you obsessively invest time into this game, because you refuse to die yet another time after such a, what you believe to be, wise investment of time and genius in the relentless wilderness of Don't Starve (which seems to happen to everyone else).In truth, this game is a whole lot of fun, albeit frustrating. There is no lack of persistent challenge, upset, and especially the thing that keeps you going, an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and discovery. The possibilities are endless. And what keeps you coming back is the heartbreaking failure when a giant deerclops somehow destroys everything you have spent hours building in mere seconds. By that I mean you keep playing out of pure spite and vengeance. It's all in good fun!			"

												To start with I will give a little background, I got this game on the PS4 when it was free for PS+ members, so I have played much more than the Steam number shows. This is quite possibly my favourite indie game I have played.Don't Starve is an incredibly good game, it has great depth and incredible replayability. There are many different characters you can unlock, each with unique traits that will make replaying this game continiously enjoyable. I would highly recommend buying this game, even if it is not on sale, although it does go on sale frequently.The DLC Reign of Giants expands upon the world of Don't Starve by making the game even more challenging, by adding 2 more seasons, Spring and Autumn and reworking Summer to be much more difficult. It adds many new items that can change the way you survive. And with the new mechanic of smoldering items in Summer, the game gets a lot more difficult. I would also highly recommend purchasing this DLC because it adds an incredible amount of content to the game.The new DLC Shipwrecked is also very good, with a completely new theme and many new game mechanics it is another great way to test the skill of the player. The new boats and rafts that you can build and the new mobs and adaptions of the seasons make this DLC incredibly fun. It is in early access, so there are going to be a few bugs and not all features are implemented yet, but it is incredibly fun so I would recommend purchasing it.			"

Once you get a good general idea of what you need to survive what the game throws at you and where to put it all, the game is pretty fun.

												This game isn't fun, it isn't relaxed, and it isn't easy to understand. This game requires you to learn from your failures (or the failures of others), it demands constant resource and time management, and sometimes it can be down right cruel, But this game is a rush. You will be scared of anything that can kill you (which pretty much includes everything in the game). You will be paranoid, expecting your demise around every turn. But it is precisely this fear of a world thats out to get that makes exploiting it feel truely rewarding. If you can work up the nerve to rely on your skill, risking the loss of your progress and forcing to learn and start from scratch, then mastering this game will prove to be a challenging and rewarding experience.

												This should actually be a ""mixed"" review, but steam only allows ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether to recommend.The problem with this game is it's hardcore difficulty only. If you die you lose your saved game. The game is fun and challenging and all, which is why I do like it, but it gets boring when I had to do the first steps over and over again just to get to the fun part.Please give an option for not making it hardcore difficulty. Give us a choice.Edit:The above review was made when I played just a couple hours. Now I have played much longer, and some of my poinions have changed, so here's what I think now:The use of difficulties in a game is always something argued about. Good difficulties are challenges that makes the game more interesting, bad diffculties are nausiences. I think for this game, yes, prema-death does make sense, changing it would require changing the entire game. But that is exactly why I don't play it anymore: It was fun for the later 47-ish hour out of the 57 hours I played, but not after.So I'm changing my review to a thumb up. cheers:)			"

												Absoultely worth full price. The developers have put a lot of work into making this one of the best survival games I've ever played. The art style is fantastic, as is the gameplay. However, the game is HARD, so if that's not your thing.....buy it anyway. You can adjust the world generation to make the game easier if you like. Or even more hellish. The world is randomely generated by the way. This means every playthrough feels fresh. Which is great, because when you die, you die. All of your progress is gone. However, its always your fault if you die. Didn't have supplies for a torch, wandered into a clockwork bishop, lit a forest on fire...punched a pig. The game encourages you to learn as you play; with each subsequent playtrough you are a little better equipped to make it out alive. This is absolutely a journey worth taking. BUY IT!			"

												One damn fine game. The various updates the (as of this review) beta build has gone through all point to the same thing: a game that the developers care about doing RIGHT. From adding mod support out of the blue to adding more and more characters and creatures, this is a survival game you are meant to have fun playing. From the first time you run at a jackalope screaming ""I will destroy you!"" to the feeling of glee you'll get upon murdering a massice dearclops, to the fear you'll get upon seeing a Scottish Walrus walking toward your camp, it's a fun trip the whole way through.

												This is Honsetly as good a Survival Game gets, Its Unique Play Style makes it different from the plain old MineCraft Or Terraria        One You Start You wont stop. Having the Feeling of 1 Life Only makes you try harder than just respawning.Although there are some ways to Ressurect your self ( Touchstone, MeatEffingy, ETC) They Are Very Hard To Claim and you leave all your stuff behind when you die, Unlike Mine Craft Stuff dosent De-spawn Including most Mobs. Frogs Raining? Better Leave your base or Hire an Exterminator. With The New Multiplayer Coming This summer ( SO EXITED) possibilites will be endless with a couple of friends or random people! You Could build a huge base..... Fight awsome bosses together, Have an all out war on each other..... Play as webber and get a bunch of spider to ivade their base- er what?Anyways This Was The Best Survival Game Experince ive ever had so Buy it or Maxwell will find you			"

												Don't Starve is a GREAT game. I don't have much play time as of me making this review, and that's becuase I mostly play Don't Starve Together.  Don't Starve is a game where you play as Wilson (when you start), a wanna-be engineer/scientist. He makes a portal to this mysterious world, once he hears Maxwell's voice on his ""radio"". Once he builds the machine, Maxwell urges him to pull the switch. But Wilson Had made a mistake. You wake up on a completely random generated island with Giants (if you have Reign Of Giants Add-On), Spiders, shadows, and way too many things to explain right now. Maxwell says ""Hey buddy. You don't look so good. You should find some food before night comes."" And that's it. You can do whatever you want. Why did Maxwell want yo to build that portal? You have to craft the divining rod, and fight out yourself. But I do urge you to grab this game, and the Reign Of Giants DLC. You can also unlock charecters (sorry for spelling) further on.			"

												Don't Starve has a lot going for it in the way of interesting rogue-like mechanics, but it still feels like a work in progress despite its 'release' status.  A few failed attempts to figure out what's what and most players will likely be able to sustain themselves indefintely -- or, at least, to a point where they are bored enough to quit or find the objects necessary to teleport to another map.  Many items seem pointless/overkill as the vast majority of enemies can be killed with easily craftable log armor and spears.  There are unlockable characters but the variations are minor and gameplay is the same.  All of that said 'Adventure' mode provides a  NG+ challenge after you've mastered the basics.  A solid game but it has the feel of a pet project that could do with a lot more development time.			"

												You are a man named Wilson (Or someone else depending on if you unlocked the other characters or are using workshop characters) you wake up in the middle of nowhere, your only job is to not starve. Instead of starving you forget to build a campfire and place it and so you die by gigantic deadly monsters which you cannot defend against because you can't see jack. Very fun game. But I'd say buy two copies of don't starve together instead of this as you can play Don't Starve Together by yourself, and starving to death with a friend is way better than starving to death alone Controls are simple and easy to get used to, controler support, decently sized modding community, a fanbase that I believe isn't full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, yeah I'd say Don't Starve is worth every penny.

												Don't Starve is a 2.5D Adventure Survival game , randomly generated worlds that want you to die the worst way possible. You play as wilson , a gentleman scientist who has been trapped in this world by maxwell , an evil demon , you must gather your research , think survival , and survive for as long as humanly possible. The game gets addictive after a while and you want to find yourself surviving longer than your last game. This game solely controls on surviving , wby having enough food sources and surviving from the evil monsters that lurk everywhere on the map , choose a playstyle and stick to it to survive the longest you can!

												The very first thing you may notice about this game is the unique style, sketchier and darker than other games of similar genre I have seen, yet still pronounced and very easy to recognize. As you play the actual game, though, you begin to see the complexity through the little details from your hunger and health to the spoilage of food, range of temperature, and changing of seasons and weather among many other things. Simply put, if you go in just expecting a little fun and easy survival challenge, you may find the whole world of Don't Starve opening up and encapsulating your interests with its subtle hints of folklore and storytelling.In my personal opinion, loving story and complexity to said tale, I think Don't Starve is an amazing game that has captured my interests moreso than any other recent game titles I have played. Of course, this game is not for everyone. This is one of those games that drops you in with the only hint that too is the title of the game, don't starve. If you have no clue or introduction, it can be difficult to figure out how to survive, as there are no clues as you play, but you can decide with what you are given to do most anything. This includes modifying your world to the difficulty or ease you please, but if you want to participate in the story more thoroughly, I recommend trying out the Adventure Mode, but this you cannot modify as it is randomly generated. I won't give any spoilers to the elusive story or specifics of the game, but something to the charm of this game is the characters themselves. Each has their own unique design, strengths, weaknessess, abilities, and personalities. Most of these unlock with experience you gain from either dying or escaping your world ( details excluded), but some are Reign of Giants exclusive and require certain actions to be taken to unlock. I still must say that without these characters and their diversity, it would take away so much from the experience. The community, too, has made some phenominal mods for the game, including characters, and I say go and give 'em some love as they make this game even more enjoyable.Something else that plays an important role is the music, or lack thereof. At times you feel helpless and alone, wandering this strange land uncertain of what to do or where to go, and other times you may be picking flowers to the happy tunes of day and relax as pronounced notes finally signal the end of a dreadful night. While sometimes non-existant, I find that whenever the music plays I become even more caught up in the soul and feel of the game.Overall, I recommend this game for its uniqueness of style and play, development of environment, character, and story, and for the community Don't Starve has created that I am proud to be a part of.Thank you very much for reading my review!

												I've spent a lot of time on this game. More than the 160 hours that it shows. This game is amazing. If you like survival, then you'll love this game. The beginning can be pretty unforgiving, but you'll eventually get your feet under you. The game does a good job of constantly throwing curve balls to make you feel at least a little threatened. You can survive until the end of time, or you can proceed through the game as intended with each map getting more difficult. The artwork is gorgeous, the music and sounds suite it perfectly. This game is just really near and dear to my heart. If you haven't played this yet, pick it up next time you're looking for something new. I promise you wont regret it!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The whole concept of 'Dont Starve' is so simple, yet so easy to make HUGE. There are so many ideas you could get while developing a game like this, and the developers seem to have created and adapted their own ideas along with the wide open world and the lingering feeling of despair to create a downright great game.The monsters, resources and yourself are all put together into a bowl and mixed about, combining the three and making endless posibillities for what can come out of a game. The characters you play themselves have unique personas which makes them their own person. Not only does this game have fear, death and the constant feeling of dread, but it also creates a bond between you and your character, with laughs and creativity throughout.  "

Engaging, challenging and fun, you can often find that something you have worked for hours collecting resouces for has just been destroyed by a stray bolt of lightening, your fancy garden now has a pack of fire-breathing wolves inhabiting it and some of the local flora has taken offence to your camp fire and now wants to try planting you firmly in the ground, head-first.

												What struck me as a quality that is rare and should be in most modern videogames is Don't Starve's ability to make you learn from your mistakes and try again. To not make this annoying, they've softened the blow of the mistake with a little something special.You must have heard a critic claiming that Don't Starve makes you start an entire world again just because you died. First of all, you're provided many opportunities in the game to have a respawn. But dying isn't so bad. Assuming you've survived enough days, you receive a new character! It's neat how Klei Entertainment took the time to develope the well written characters Don't Starve has to offer (except for that one mute character that's meant to be more of a challenge than a character) After unlocking each new character, you can clearly make out each of their interesting personalities and views. Along with being well written, new characters have interesting ups and downs (like unique weapons in Team Fortress 2) that can suit or even  benefit  your playstyle! But there isn't one overpowered character, each is unique and fits everyone differently, real neat. My favorite character is Maxwell, not because of his abilities but because of the heartbreaking backstory he has, play the game to find out what his astonishing plot is! To keep this short and sweet, my rookie review covers only a very small part of what I enjoy about Don't Starve. That's right, I don't normally write reviews but Don't Starve made me dive straight into this positive review writing when I've decided that more people need this treasure in their lives. Alright, here's some more review I can dish at you. After playing this, it didn't make sense that the price is as low as it is, I figured it should be $20. It's only $15 dollars! I can't comprehend that! You go ahead, whip out some dough and buy yourself a Don't Starve right here and right now. Save a couple dollars for the soon to be released ""Reign of the Giants"" DLC that's been recently announced. Surely, they've been cooking that one up for months. The DLC can't be more than $5.Happy starving!tldr: Well written characters, well written plot, good for sandbox game lovers due to its increased creativity and decreased objectives, real cheap, HELLA GAME.

												This game should be banned!! It is addictive! It is annoying and it is fun. It is simple and it is complex. You will be sleepless in game and possibly in real life too. Just when you say ""OK i have figured it out how to survive, i will be safe now"", whoops you are dead :) You will be never safe in this game. If you have hesitation, dont hesitate just buy it ;)			"

												A brilliant survival game which is both challenging and also fun to play. Lots of different characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and play styles. Edit 08/02/2016 With the new Shipwrecked add on DLC, this game just gets better and better! A new World, new characters and new challenges. Definitely worth it.			"

												Some days, it's fine just to sit back and relax on your own.Making friends on 'Together' is all fine and dandy, but when you want your own little world, your rules, your way, then it's ok to play this game. And this way, you will never have  a shortage of food (unless you're a pig) and you don't have to worry about leaving the camp abandoned to go exploring.			"

												Don't Starve is a Game about survival. Bit like MineCraft in some ways, if you are looking for a hard game to play, you found it, i can't count how many times i have raged playing this game. It is one of my Fav survival games, it makes me feel scared like i am playing a horrie game, it makes me sit on the edge of my seat trying to predicked what will ahppen next. I strongly recommend this game!			"

												I played the demo years ago and when I saw this game was available I couldn't wait to play it again.  I was hooked... I was playing so much that I would often have dreams about mining for gold and picking berries.  I love the choice to play different characters with different advantages and disadvantages.  It keeps the game fresh and entertaining.  Woodie is my favourite character to play... not only is he Canadian, but he turns into a beaver... who doesn't like beaver ;)  Overall it's an easy game to start, very little instruction needed and over time you will pick up on different tips and tricks to stay alive longer.   It's totally worth it on sale and at full price!  Enjoy!			"

												A good mix of surrealism and survivalism, Don't Starve is a game that immerses you into Wilson's struggle against the world he is trapped in. This game will make you value the importance of being prepared against every known (and sometimes, unknown) threat, and the value of company, as well. Amongst the many harmful elements of this game, we find: Monsters, Time and Weather, your worst three enemies, as you will be constantly at the mercy of getting attacked from (apparently) harmless bees trying to defend their hive, to giant beasts, threatening your life with every step they take; you will have to struggle against time, to make use of every precious second before the dreaded night falls down and, trust me, scary things happen in the dark; and even your fight stretches up to weather, where you will feel the constant threat of every winter coming down to chill your bones if you are unprepared. But one of the most important things to keep an eye on is food, since, after all, your objective is to Don't Starve, so you must think carefully before eating that lucky carrot you found on the ground, or maybe that steak you cooked after fighting a fierce beefalo, because you never know when will you have the fortune of finding another piece of delicious and coveted food. With an assortment of unlockable characters (with unique perks, each one), random generated and customizable worlds (so your experiences will always vary), survival (endless mode that ends when you die, once and for all) and adventure (challenging set of five consecutive world, each with different conditions) modes, a fitting soundtrack on every situation and a beautifully aesthetic created universe, Don't Starve is definitely a game you will keep coming back to.

												Looks simple but it takes practice. A trial and error game. Don't get too frustrated, as the learning curve is there, but you can climb it quickly. Don't get too invested into your character at the beginning, learn the tier 1, then progress. Could use more variety in the music but I enjoy what is there.You could play the entire game with a mouse, or (I prefer) use a keyboard and only use the mouse for menus and toolbars.A variety of characters to choose to survive the wilderness, each with a personality their own.The download content Reign of Giants adds some new things. I can't comment much though, as I've not played much.Overall, a fun single player game. Worth full price.I've not put many hours into Don't Starve, but I've played Together (The multiplayer beta that supports up to 6 players, that comes free with launch) 40+ hours. I find that to be more fun, even though it's in beta (not all the content, and no RoG content).Really, though my hours are low, that will change as time goes on.Also has a good modding community, can't forget that.Well, I'm done. Good luck to those who brave the wilderness, you're going into the wild.Edit: Some Reign of Giants content is in the Don't Starve Together.			"

												Don't Starve is one of the rare games that is so atmospheric that once you start you can't tear yourself from it.  It's insane difficulty mixed with that true feeling of advancing, discovering, and conquering is a recipe for long hours of fun.  Though you can surround yourself with walls and food, the underlying creepy tone (which I absolutely love) always reminds you that death is never more than just around the corner.  This game isn't for a very casual gamer, it takes determination, skill, and will to advance anywhere, which makes it all the sweeter when you do.Overall Don't Starve (RoG included) is a hardcore, rewarding, and atmospheric game that is hard to even look away from.  I definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves the above.			"

												As awful as I am at this game, I can't say anything bad about it. The art style is awesome, as is the soundtrack. There is so much to do in this game, and yet, depending on how difficult you made your world (which you can customise to your skill level), you'll see just a small part of it before actually learning how to play well enough to get further. However, I wouldn't consider that a downside - the difficulty just makes you play even longer. I guess it's similar to Minecraft in the way of surviving (especially through the night, where, if you're not in the light, you'll be attacked by the darkness.) Saying that, I wasn't prepared for the creepiness of the game, with the bizarre creatures that might be peaceful but, more oftenly, will try to tear you apart. The combat can be a bit frusturating at times, and you really need to get out of the way when an enemy attacks, because you'll get hit no matter what side of it you are on. That being said, there's also multiple characters to be unlocked, all with different stats and abilities (and if you get tired of those, the workshop has plenty more!)TLDR; It's a great game with wonderful graphics, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sandbox-survival type games.

												This game is awesome. Honestly I haven't played for a few months and I know a ton of updates have come out with even more cool stuff that I have no clue how to get or what it does. Never the less, I played this for 36 hours and look forward to playing many more with the new updates. One thing you need to know is that this game is ruthless and creepy as heck! When you die there are limited ways you can respawn and when they are exhausted, its game over, the world is deleted and all that cool stuff you had is no more. You have to balance your caution with your agression to sucees here. Yet my best advice is to make sure that you . . . (insert cheesy joke here) . . . Don't Starve!			"

												This is one of the best survival games on the market with loads of replay value, highly addictive and brutally difficult. Hundreds of items to gather, more enemies or creature types here than in any other game I have seen and with the DLC ""Reign Of The Giants"" adding even more difficulty and hours of extra content plus multiplayer on the way too this game is great value.Check out my first impressions video to see more Don't Starve:
