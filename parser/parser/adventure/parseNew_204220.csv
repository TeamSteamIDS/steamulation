												Overlooked little puzzle platformer game. Now, I know the genre is kind of saturated and there's a lot of stuff going on when it comes to this type of games. Snapshot manages to be unique with simple but nice graphics, nicely scaling challenge, lots of stuff to do. It is definitely best idea to play this in small doses, like one set of levels per day, you just can't grind it unless you are hardcore. And somehow that's how it actually keeps you playing which gives it a good life cycle. Give it a shot every now and then when you are bored and someday you will finish it. There is no hurry. Just a few minutes for Snapshot. Again and again. Truly nice execution.			"

												Unlike the other Kyle Pulver game I've played, Offspring Fling, which I absolutely loved, I can't say the same for Snapshot.  A unique and interesting concept quickly tires itself out and becomes bland and repetitive.With around 120 levels it's a game that really overstays its welcome.  Each set of three levels introduces a gimmicky twist to the gameplay- I feel safe with saying gimmick because all but the most fundamental of them are promptly thrown out the window and never seen again.  There is no cohesiveness to the design that brings all these scattershot elements together into something greater.  A lot of them are poorly implemented, frustrating to use, or just plain boring anyway- if you do happen to find a mechanic you like, you'll probably never see it again.A broader problem is that it's supposed to be a puzzle game, but has failed to puzzle me in any way.  I've rarely been stumped on how to approach a problem; instead it all seems kind of obvious.The only real difficulty I've had in finishing a level is from frustrating deaths due to a combination of insta-kill falls/spikes, the poor mechanics mentioned above, and the lack of checkpoints in levels.  A lot of the levels take far too long and offer far too much room for mistakes to not include any sort of checkpoint.  I wouldn't speak too highly of the level design itself either.Unless it's something you're receiving in a bundle of some sort and just want to try out for a little bit, I cannot recommend Snapshot at all.   A lot of potential seems wasted with such a unique core mechanic behind it.  It is an exercise in frustration rather than problem solving; repetiveness rather than innovation.			"

												Cut, paste. Cut, paste. Cut, paste.The constant deletion and reproduction of content experienced playing Snapshot feels like the perfect counterpoint to its almost schizophrenic eagerness to continually replace mechanics, too insecure with the ideas its putting forward to ever spend long enough on any given one to actually develop it into more than a one off curiosity. The only constant is your ability to copy certain objects and then place them elsewhere in a level, but Snapshot treats its core mechanic as a novelty, one I quickly grew aggravated with as I attempted to work with its unwieldy interface.Basic movements are already stiff and awkward, making rudimentary jumps hazardous and unpredictable, but trying to frame and position objects while avoiding obstacles at the speed you're often forced to is agonizing. I was constantly falling onto hazards and screwing up puzzles because I wasn't able to move my frame quick enough to grab an object, and this only becomes worse the longer you play as the game abandons any notion that it understands the weaknesses of its interface. Nearly every chapter brings with it a new concept for you to work with, be it magnets or fireballs, but they're so briefly utilized that Snapshot is never able to build any sort of mechanical vocabulary. I never knew what I could or couldn't do or how different items interacted with one another because Snapshot never tells you, and spends so little time using any of its ideas that you're constantly going through tutorials and then being told the thing you just learned is irrelevant beyond your immediate puzzle. Snapshot's kitchen sink approach to game design also completely abolishes its difficulty slope. As it has to continually stop to tell you how something works, it creates a series of levels that vary erratically in challenge, some obnoxiously difficult while others only ask you to press right and jump. Completely a challenging puzzle only to have it followed up by one that was almost insultingly easy made it feel like my time was being deliberately wasted. Snapshot has more ideas than it has levels to hold them, so it forces you to spend needless amounts of time within a single level so as to make it appear as if whatever mechanic its currently using has any place in the game.And a handful of them are kind of cool, but they're buried deep in a game that's too busy trying on clothes it doesn't fit to notice the parts that work. Even if it had, I have little hope it would have had any more luck utilizing them when Snapshot's foundation struggles to hold itself together during even the simplest moments. Retro Affect has stuffed their game to the point of breaking with content, but it seems to suggest even they realized most of what's here needn't be, as you can see the ending after less than half the game is actually finished. It's a silver lining I quickly took advantage of, but hardly something to recommend a game over.			"

												Platformers really need a unique hook to do well these days, and Snapshot certainly comes through on that front. Your little robot dude can take pictures of the world that save the items he snaps in them. He can then load the picture back into reality, rotating it to fit whatever the situation calls for. Pictures also capture motion, so if you snap a flying crate, it'll still be speeding through the air when you bring it back. Add in 120 levels to puzzle through, along with stars to collect and hidden objects to find, and you've got a quality mix, right?You would, if the levels weren't designed by a sadist. Snapshot has one massive flaw, and it's the level design. Not five levels in, you'll start encountering death spikes that force you to start the whole level over. There are no lives and no checkpoints, so even on the larger sprawling levels, one misstep can cost you a lot of time. Worse than that, many of the puzzles in the game can be rendered impossible to solve, forcing a restart of the level. This is because many levels like to make you stack objects to scale tall walls or shafts, and then continue using those items later in the level. Of course, if you fall back down after moving your items to the top, there's no way to get them back. The very first level involving springs is very easy to ruin if you do any exploring whatsoever.I want to say it's a shame, but honestly all Snapshot has going for it is the picture gimmick. The graphics are clean and cute but nothing special. There's no story to speak of, or if there is it's locked behind dozens of aggravating levels. Really, puzzle platformers come down to their level design, and if it's crap, nothing can save it. Surely there's already another platformer out there that uses the same or a similar system to greater effect. And even if there isn't, Snapshot certainly isn't worth braving just for that.			"

												Awesome art and level creativity, definitely won me over due to the uniqueness. However plays like garbage with the 360 controller, and mouse controls are awkward, especially because some levels require accuracy on the shots. I liked how well defined the sprites were and how everything seemed so polished. But I cannot play a game confortably if the controls are bad. Gave me a headache because of the effort I had to make moving around. I'd love to recommend it, but under the circumstances, no.			"

												The game had an interesting game mechanic that appealed to me - taking a 'snapshot' of an object to use later on. In the beginning it was delightful to use the 'snapshot' ability to solve puzzles, do some simple platforming, and perform simple tricks. The graphics are simple. As far as I've seen, the narrative is purely visual - no text or voice acting. As the game progresses, the platforming puzzles become increasingly complex and interesting. The puzzles were creative and varied. However, the actual platforming gets tedious and frustrating.  I loathed the many puzzles that required double jumping on a spring using the 'snapshot' ability.I would recommend playing this game in small sessions over a long period of time. I found more enjoyment when I played a few levels at a time, stopping when the platforming became frustrating.			"

												This is a rather overlooked little Indie, worth a buck or 2 should you see fit.It's a puzzle platformer where you 'snapshot' objects in the map to get across obstacles, collect stars, hidden items and whatnot.It's a rather beautiful game with a lovingly crafted graphics and cute protagonist. It's got some pretty neat music along with it and has a nice playful feel to the whole experience.My only issue is that is does get rather tedious after some time. I found myself finding it hard to continue to play, and have left it be in my 'played' category at about 40% complete. Although the game does add new elements over time and the level variety does get mixed up somewhat, it just is all a little too much. Though I've always been relatively impatient with games of this genre, so take that as you will.Played on a MacBook Air 2013.			"

												Snapshot is a platforming game which allows you to take ""snapshots"" of items to store them and them drop them in place around the level to help you get to the goal. The first few levels start off not bad, but then pretty soon you're hit with the terrible level design with no checkpoints. It becomes quickly frustrating to start a level all the way over when you fall into spikes right near the end of the level due to the poor floaty controls of your character. Also new mechanics are quickly added into the game, for example springs get added one level and then the next some elephants get added all which are implemented poorly and become difficult to utilize. Most people do not even progress far in the game, only ~11% of players have unlocked Chapter 2!			"

												Snapshot is a very nice puzzle-platformer in which you take photos to remove objects from levels, and then you paste them back where you want. It has some issues, but the game is good enough for you to overlook it.Pros: There's a total of 4 chapters, each with 9 levels, which in turn have each 3 parts, for a total of 108 relatively short stages. Each of these 108 stages has 3 optional objetives, which add to the game: speed run, collect all stars, and find the special artifact (aka ""gallery item""). Most of the 36 levels introduce a new game element, so the game always feels fresh. Seriously, there's always a new item to learn how to interact with. You won't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. Most puzzles are smart and don't require insane platform skills, not even for speed runs. For me this is good, because I don't like to mix speed, platforming and puzzle for some reason. I've read some reviews saying that the levels werer designed by a sadist. It might seem that way when you're trying to do it the wrong way, but, believe me, once you understand what you're really supposed to do, the game is not hard, not even the speedruns. I honestly think level designs are awesome, and if you've been following me, you probably know I'm a bit hard to please. Graphics are cute and the music is also nice.Cons: The worst of all: This game has been abandoned for reasons I didn't wanna look into (I think the devs went separate ways and none took the game for themselves, but I'm not sure). This game has a major problem with achievements. You have achievements for beating the game with 25%, 35%, 45%, 55%, 65%, 75% and 100%. First of all, you can only see your percentage when you beat the game, and that sucks a bit. Second, if you reach the next percentage tier (eg., 55%), you won't be able to unlock the previous achievements (same eg., you wouldn't be able to get 25%, 35% and 45% achievements anymore). There are guides to help you, though, and I think there are even savefiles for each percentage (haven't tried them, though). I probably had to watch the credits about 20 times because I didn't wanna miss the achievement. Also, it should've been cumulative in the first place. The game gets a lot of tearing and stuttering if you don't know how to tweak it. It was almost unplayable for me. After searching the forums, I managed to run the game smoothly enough (ie, it was smooth, but when I alt-tabbed, it would stutter until I restarted a level) by turning fullscreen on, then going to NVidia Control Panel and turning v-sync and triple buffering on (in-game v-sync option doesn't seem to help much). The game crashed about 10 times total for me, sometimes when I beat a level, sometimes not answering commands and forcing me to close the game. But since there's autosave after all stages and since they're all short, you'll hardly lose much progress. It should be easier to navigate between chapters. Sometimes you have to walk for too long for my taste.Also, some people complain about the lack of checkpoints. But, to be honest, since stages are short, you don't really need them. It was only on a few occasions that I felt frustrated by this, but I considered it part of the game.Last but not least, don't play this with a controller. Mouse is almost mandatory.Despite all those annoying issues, Snapshot is a solid game, totally worth your time.			"

												In this puzzle platformer your a robot that has to get to the level exit by taking and placing objects. You take objects by taking their picture and replace them by untaking their picture. You can collect stars along the way, take pictures of special objects and try to beat the fastest times.  There are 100+ levels and they are divided into groups of 3. Each group introduces and highlights a new object. Most of the objects only make appearances in their group of 3. The first level of each group are the shortest with the second and third being progressively longer. Collecting the stars and special objects also adds quite a bit of length to a level. There are no checkpoints, So most failures require you to redo the whole level. Which objects to place where is the meat of the game, But that is pretty obvious most of the time. The puzzle aspect comes into play most when figuring out how to get things into or out of no picture taking zones. Again not that difficult. The hardest part of the game is when you have to perform some mid-air photography acrobatics. Which can get quite annoying as you'll have to play the entire level over again just give it another try if you fail. It presents itself as being a casual game, and for the most part it is, But it has these areas that require patience and persistence.It's an OK game, best played in short sessions. I went for the extra stuff and got them all up until the last 5 or 6 levels. At that point a failed jump was crashing the game making it very hard to figure out what to do next. So I skipped the rest and just finished out the game at 81% complete.Marginal thumbs up.			"

												Would've liked it if it had some sort of save or checkpoint system, but as it stands most of the levels are too long to explore thoroughly without a death. The level design is poor and death makes me really not want to re-do the mechanics I've passed again. I would normally just power through it, but it's incredibly disappointing and over punishing to die in a puzzle game where I should be allowed to test and see what works. Instead I have to repeat a bunch of steps just to get back to where I was before.There's a LOT of levels, and they're generally very long and repetitive. Even with the ""new"" mechanics it adds every once in a while, it feels like you're doing the same thing.			"

												Really, I'm on the border line with recommending this game. It's visuals are stunning, the audio is great. The background music can get a bit repetitive, but the tunes are calm enough that you don't mind. The concept is wonderful, I'm a big fan of puzzle games and when I saw where this game started I was very excited.But it sort of flat-lined. Even within the first world I was getting bored. There was just enough new concepts introduced to keep me playing, but I found the difficulty of the game to not be in the puzzle-solving but in the controls. I knew exactly what to do, but I couldn't get my darn keyboard-touchpad-click combo control madness to make it happen. Definitely needs to let you map your own controls. Also probably best played with a mouse, because with a touchpad it is near impossible.The story could also use a little work. A good storyline can save a bad game sometimes. But this had little story, and relied entirely on the puzzle-solving, which as previously mentioned was weak. 100%ing this game would get really tedious. If you're into that kind of thing, this is for you.Definitely worth a try though. If you get it in a bundle or as a gift, cool.			"

												As someone who has 100% the game I can say that I highly recommend this game. One thing to bear in mind though is that it is the kind of game where you want to take your time, explore and exploit the mechanics to their fullest. The first time I tried the game I ended up uninstalling it after beating the first world because I just rushed through and as a result did not get much enjoyment out of it. Only a year later I decided to pick it back up and give it the go it deserves.Another thing to note is that almost every three levels througout the game (yes even [actually especially] in the end-game) introduce a new mechanic to the experience. Usually in this kind of game the further you go the more the same mechanics get beat to death and levels simply get longer and more complicated. Not in this game, I was overwhelmed by the creativity and innovation that is spread throughout the entire game like breadcrumbs making you follow their trail and eat up all the way from the beginning to the end.

Include a whole bunch of other elements and you have your puzzle platformer.

I could make it through normal mode of Super Meat Boy - some of the challenges presented in this frustrate more than that. I think a big part of what frustrates me is that with slow air strafe, and high gravity accelerate, it is very difficult to correct a mistimed jump.If you work past the unforgivingness in platforming, you can probably find a lot of entertaininment in the challenges Snapshot will bring you.

												The game started out interesting but I feel it drags on for waaay too long. I started my playthrough by taking my time and grabbing all stars and collectables, but when I got about halfway through that felt like too much of a grind to continue doing. Partly because of the extremely frustrating deaths from spikes and falls and what not, partly because of the way the game introduces mechanics. Why teach the player how to deal with so many mechanics and even ""enemies"" if you don't see them back later in the game at all? My biggest disappointment however was that there's no real climax. At the final stages of the game I expected to finally see the things I learned so far come together, but instead they just introduce a new mechanic or two and have a couple levels based around those, just like any other part of the game. That was quite a bummer.			"

												As another reviewer pointed out, If you look at the global gameplay stats, it becomes clear very few people have played this one beyond the first section. Before looking at this I had the insane idea of trying to complete the time trials, get the hidden object and collect all the stars in each stage. The time trial times are completely unforgiving and after the 10th or 11th level the tedium made me want to stop completely and just play the levels without getting anything. But at that point the frustration had set in and every new level made me think, who in their right minds would bother will all this?The level of precision needed to even complete some levels (specifically, bouncing and snapping up the item just after you've bounced) finally did me in. Games this difficult need to give you a reason to continue, more than the vainglory of proving to the world that you could 100% Snapshot. As far as I could tell, collecting stars, pictures of the special items in each level, and completing the time trials gives you nothing. We are not living in the days of the NES where money and game options are limited. When frustration and overwhelmedness are the core emotions a game provokes, it is time to put your pride in your knapsack and move on to the next world with the dream that somewhere out there love awaits.

												Unfortunately there's too many things designed poorly to make this game fun, despite the idea behind it being fun itself.To enter a doorway, you *have* to press S (the down key), which no other platformer does (it's usually their Up key, or even Jump), once in the air, you have absolutely no control over your trajectory, which makes quite a large number of puzzles exercises in jump-fail-instadeath.

												Snapshot is equal parts clever and beautiful, albeit riddled with bugs and a rather unfair difficulty curve. The concept of taking pictures of items to move them is masterfully expanded upon with all kinds of tricks and tools. For the most part, puzzles are fun to figure out and satisfying to master, especially when beating those par times.I say ""for the most part"" because every now and then the game likes to put important objects in really stupid places. In addition, some properties of the game aren't well-taught. Most of the objects are telegraphed in a way where you can figure out what they do, but some in the later levels are just maddening.What's also maddening is the sheer amount of bugs in this game. Missing textures, frozen player controls, BRUTAL crashes near the end of the game, and achievements unlocking erratically are just a few of the issues I found. They weren't enough to detract from the overall experience, but it's a troubling tell, as when searching through the Discussions for this game, it's clear the developers either don't care anymore or have simply vanished off the face of the Earth.Snapshot has a weird difficulty curve and a few bugs to break you out of the experience, but overall it's inventive and fun. The music is gorgeous, and the visuals are charming, albeit a bit on the bright side. Recommended if you want a unique puzzle-platformer to last you a weekend.			"

												Snapshot is a very clever side-scroller, I'd definitely recommend it to any combination of puzzle/platformer/2D-side scrolling fans. There are both easy and difficult side challenges for each level, and a wide variety of levels and visuals, with fairly smooth animations and such to hold it all together. Simple to learn, moderately challenging to master. Fun little title. Not very deep or extensive, but a decent length.			"

												A great idea and cool visuals are totally ruined by unresponsive controls, questionable physics, bad level design and a lack of checkpoints. Basically, you do the same over and over again and have to start each level from the beginning if the robot dies or becomes stuck. And it happens a lot here.Oh, and here are time trials which were clearly designed by a sadist. It took me a dozen tries to finish the very first level in the allotted 10 seconds (which i did in 9.76). And in this level you simply run forward and jump a couple times.			"

												This starts-off really well but it quickly starts to feel quite tiresome and repetitive.Furthermore, as the difficulty increases, shortcomings in the controls get more obvious and the checkpoint-free nature of the levels makes this more tiresome.Example:  a lot of levels require you to jump from a platform, snapshot that platform and then paste it where you're going to land - but aiming and timing this feels random and when you need to do it 10 times to get to a star (any mistakes resulting in a restart) it's just boring.I've also been killed on the 'wrong side' of spiky platforms a few times - and timing landings seems a bit wonky in places (resulting in you hitting spikes or whatever)It's not a bad game - it's a lovely idea - but it's just too keen to punish you for what are it's mistakes and not yours...

												The basic concept is a very original and creative idea--capturing pieces of the game world in photos and then releasing them in intelligent ways to help the player solve puzzles.  But the game is far too short, the levels generally consisting of one or two puzzles each.  The story is dull and even the novel gameplay gets old after a while, and Snapshot ends up feeling like just one more platformer.			"

												With so many years of 2D platformer games to copy from, Snapshot ignores them and does it's own thing. Retro Affect makes something slightly original, yet I'm left preferring a floppydisk game from 1992 over this. The soundtrack is partly an uninspired copy of Jerry Martin's SimCity 3000, making the 400+MB game largely a waste of space. An interesting game, if not average.			"

												Not nearly as clever or original as it looks in the demo videos. The photo mechanic is basically just a gimicky inventory system and mechanism for placing objects. However, since you place photographs but care about the location of the object within the photo, placing the objects can feel imprecise and some of the techniques such a double-jumping on springboards involve a lot of trial and error.Certainly not a bad game. Besides the photography, the rest of the controls are precise and responsive. There's no unskippable cutscenes or character animations that make your player unresponsive. This is basically a capable platformer but it's hard to justify buying this when you could have bought dustforce or super meat boy, which are slightly better platformers without the gimmicks.			"

												After finishing Snapshot, I can say its greater quality is the superb level design. Although the entire game being built around the use of the camera, the levels still bring something new until the very end. The first few levels can be a little repetitive, you practically just uses your camera to move boxes around, but after that the game introduces new objects  (disappearing clouds, fireball throwing flowers, elephant trampolines and many others) constantly, just giving you enough time to learn how to use them before introducing something new. The majoraty of the objects are used only in a handful of levels before being dropped for something new, keeping the game always fresh. The game is very easy if you finish the level without completing any secondary goal, so I recommend to go after the secret objects and the stars for maximum enjoyment.  The graphics, although simple, are a delight to look at, evocative of the 16bit era platformers: they are exactly how you remember them being at the time, not  pixelated and low resolution as they truly are.  If you try to complete secondary objectives, the game will give you at least 10 hours of fun, more than enough to justify the $10 price.			"

												Snapshot is a fun puzzle platformer, with charming visuals and sound that seem halfway between fairy tale and Saturday morning cartoon. Controls are simple and mastered without fuss, based around moving, jumping, and (of course) taking photos and ""printing"" the objects they capture back into space. Gameplay is calm, and the puzzles are not difficult, more often requiring a bit of extra thought rather than expert button mashing.For gamers who are addicted to achievements, Snapshot offers plenty of medal chasing: 40 levels of 3 puzzles each, with each level having 3 additional challenges (collect all stars, collect all objects, and run time) to complete. The game can be completed without completing all challenges, or indeed all levels, but the tempation to replay to 100% the game is strong.The one big downside (mostly for those 100%'ers out there) is a bug in Steam achievements related to completing the game. There are achievements relating to percentage completion, and lower levels (e.g. 35%, 55%) do not unlock when completing the game with a higher-level achievement (e.g. 75%). That said, the game is definitely worth a look for puzzle solvers young and old.			"

												This game is surprisingly fun. The concept is really simple and it works well. So far I am only about halfway through the game and it has remained somewhat challenging without losing the simple aspects that make it fun.			"

												Very fun action game in puzzle style. Pleasant music, likeable gameplay, movement, intresting challanges - I think this is enough to play Snapshot. I love playing this awesome game when i'm bored.			"

												I got this game in Humble Bundle 7 and I'll tell you what, It was an intriguing game from when I saw it's icon, but once I started playing the game, I really felt good that I had bought this game along with the others in the bundle it came with, you play as a robot who has the ability to take pictures of objects that you collect in your film either to take with you out of the level as a collectible item for the gallery or to help you get past the wonderfully designed levels, If you haven't played this game or have thought about it, I give it my seal of approval.

												Game is simple but not easy jump and collect pass-your-free-time-and-relax type of game. Its worth a while.To access your bought soundtrack on PC find your steam folder (C:\program files\Steam), then find folder ""common"" in ""Steamapps"" folder. In ""Snapshot"" folder there will be folder ""Soundtrack"" with your music. I could not find other way to access it. Enjoy!			"

												Snapshot is a great, family-friendly platformer with a neat mechanic whereby you can move particular blocks by photographing them and then reprinting them elsewhere on the level to provide access to other areas. Collection, phtographing and time trial challenges complete a well made and thoughtful game.			"

												Snap shot is a neat platformer with a neat mechanic where you as the cute lil robo dude can take objects in the level out of reality with your camera. You can hold three photos of objects worth of things as well. As you play each level has things like a time goal, the collectable thing, and a secret item to carry through each level for extra unlockables. The game gets pretty complex like photo blocking zones, Moving objects that can help or hinder you, as well as rotaing and placing every new thing you run into.I can reccomend this game although it took me awhile to get around to it I am gald I gave it another try.

												Snapshot is criminally underrated. Cool art style, interesting and responsive core gameplay mechanic, satisfying controls and generally good level and puzzle design. And the photo mechanic has something that's just so pleasantly janky about it that comes off as a little endearing and actually pretty fun when you get the hang of it.That being said, I've never completed the game despite my fair amount of hours in it, because I've lost my save data for it about five times. I dunno if that just happened because I'm dumb or because the developer put the save data in the cache or something like that.			"

												Very early in it felt like a rudimentary physics puzzler, but where the developer couldn't figure out how to have the player move the objects other than by teleporting them. It does some interesting things with it, but not interesting enough. It just didn't grab me in any way.			"

												A puzzle platformer. And one I'm not too terribly fond of. The mechanics are simple, take a picture of an object in the environment and replace it somewhere where you need it. However, when you increase the complexity, I found myself having to fulfill a large amount of detail sensitive sequences that peaked my frustration. A tough game, albeit an artistically beautiful one, perhaps one deserving of a more patient player.			"
