												The game is a quite good technical job: nice graphics, nice voice work, interesting story... It had everything to be perfect, but things were implemented just all wrong.    The ""puzzles"" are simply a matter of finding something well hidden in the scenario and, once you find it, you basically need to move your mouse in the right directions and there goes the ""solution"".     The path you have to take to follow up with the story is made way too explicit by the thoughts of the character. His monologues always tell you what to do next, as hints you didn't ask for.    But the worst is that this game just kills the basic principle of point-and-clicking: exploration. Most objects only become available for use when the character already realized that he needs it. So the first time you explore the ambient he will say something like ""I don't need it"" for almost everything you try to interact with, but then after some stupid event that makes the character think ""Hey, I need a blablabla for accomplishing that"" then suddenly the blablabla can be picked up(or turned on, closed, open, or any other interaction that was previously unavailable).      It's a big challenge killer, you never really get the opportunity to think things through. As soon as the problem is presented, the character's consciousness gets to the answer for it, inevitably preventing you to draw any conclusion by yourself. What keeps you playing is just the hope that at some point all that seemingly pretentious work will actually turn into something fun. But I guess this is just an illusion...			"

												Nice old-school style point and click.  If you like Noir and Detective stories then you can't go wrong.  Puzzles can be a bit frustrating since it's easy to simply not notice the one tiny object that let's you solve it. But once you've found all the clickables then the puzzles usually make sense.Two tips: double click when the arrow is red to jump to the next area without having to watch him walk. And Press F1 for highlights (or click the ? button in the inventory.)Edit: It's a two part story... Don't expect full resolution ontil the sequel comes out.			"

												Film Noir inspired Adventure Game. Graphics are simple.  Soundtrack is great, Voice Acting is good.  The Interface is very primitive (tip: highlighting is F1). Writing is pretty good. Characters are ... interesting: lets just say that Characters are written to be ""period appropriate"". Puzzles aren't exactly self obvious (I guess that is a good thing) - and could be accused of ""pixel hunt"". This one is for Adventure Game veterans and Film Noir fans... Me,  otherwise avoid.			"

												I love me some detective games, and this one is... well, worth buying for very, very, very cheap on a Steam sale. If you're as big a fan of detective games as I am, then maybe I added an extra ""very"" or two, just now.CONS: 1) Voice acting: The voice acting is really bad. Sometimes the quality is, well... ugh. Enough said. 2) Animation: The animation is sub-par, today. I mostly speak of the mouth movements. Everything else is quite par.3) Lockpicking: You can skip doing it altogether.4) Issues: Now, this is an interesting con. I would have broken this one down into more than one part, but, the single word ""issues"" really sums it all up neatly. For instance, near the beginning of the game, it seemed quite impossible to be able to find a light switch in a blackened room, which prompted me to get frustrated and stop playing for months. And then, when I finally mustered up the jimmies (yes) to play it again, and use a walkthrough to figure out where the hell it was, I still couldn't find it with my cursor for quite some time. Another instance was when trying to get around some NPCs to investigate; finnicky business, that, at times, but not awful. Just.... finnicky. You really have to play the game to know what I mean by  just saying ""Issues"". It's definitely not (it can't be) a big-budget game, by any means, though it does have it charms, and humour enough to keep me interested.PROS:1) Humour: The game has a good sense of humour, of which I won't spoil, because there's some fun quirkiness that you need to play into to appreciate.2) Interactivity: The game is very interactive, for a point and click, and doesn't hold your hand too much with what you're doing. Though, as I said, Lockpicking was just... yes.3) Story: The narrative is actually kind of interesting, once you... well, wrap your mind around it. Don't take this the wrong way; it's not complicated. It's just... a series of things happening, to the point of me not really remembering what sparked the narrative in the first place. But to be fair, I got frustrated and put this on hold for a few months. Maybe you would fare better..? All I remember is that I'm now framed for something I have to prove I didn't do, at this point. That's all I'll say, detail wise. That small tinge of con aside, it's amusing and not too shabby at keeping you engaged, so I take this as a positive thing.4) Puzzles: The puzzle solving and clue finding is just what it should be; involved. You really need to think hard, search around, and try every angle you can to get the solutions your looking for. Some are easier than others, but none are 100% obvious.FINAL THOUGHTS:If you like detective games, point and click, and something that feels a little rough around the edges, this is the game for you. As long as you don't mind the awkward and sometimes questionable quality of the voice acting...If you are looking for something to keep you on your toes, immersed, and delving into the shady underbelly of society, well... not so much.Do I recommend? Sure, why not. But only if it's very, very, very cheap.(Did I add one too many again?)			"

Short version: 71%Face Noir captures anyone easily in its world of noir tropes, but to enjoy that, you have to deal with the typical point ‘n’ click logic, the slow controls, subpar voice acting, and that… interesting ending.Long version:The title of Face Noir is very apt: it takes every noir detective story cliché known to mankind and pushes it right into the player’s face at full force.We are talking about clichés such as a mysterious phone call, a murder that the police is trying to pin on the alcoholic ex-cop private detective protagonist, and of course a case where the threads lead to the highest circles of the city — everything would fit a Philippe Marlow novel except the motive (which would go well with Indiana Jones instead). And, of course, I have to mention that anyone buying the game has to live with the fact that it ends with a cliffhanger, and the chances for a sequel are… slim.The presentation is a little difficult to rate. The exposition dump dialogues are part of the noir setting, and the writing is mostly acceptable. The voice acting isn’t bad, not at all, but it sounds more like some amateurs and family members doing their best to try to act than actual actors playing roles. (The audio quality is terrible though.) Game mechanics are painfully simplistic: look at items, pick up items, and use items. For the most part, progress is logical, albeit suffers from the ancient adventure game design problem that doesn’t want to finally die: every single action requires several trips to different spots of the city, even to do simple tasks as making a phone call.There is one addition that brings some novelty, the deduction parts, where the player has to select two previously acquired facts out of many to reach a conclusion. They are a welcomed change of pace, even if their contribution to the 9-11 hour game time is negligible compared to the constant travelling.			"

												A classic Point & Click adventure game, taking plqce in the 30s in New York. You play what I would qualify as the archetype of the Private Ivestigator; long trench coat, drinking issues, a tendency for cynisim, ex cop who has been kick off the force... Nothing really new here... And that's actually a good think. The game isn't particularilly beautiful, but the direction match the ambiance film noir wanted here. The story is suffisantly intriging to make you want to go forward, and the puzzles are not too challenging, without being too easy neither. It will take you around 9-10 hours to see the end. And overall pretty enjoyable game for P&C fans who like film noir that I will recommend. 7/10.			"

												Face Noir is  a old school point anc click game done right. The theme and scenario as you can guess is a Noir Detective placed in the New York from the 1930s. Decent lenght, nice story, lots of backgrounds the low points from this are the mainly for me the lip sinc animations that are uncanny awkward, and a personnal nitpick are some of the puzzles are too ''Myst'' like, rearrange puzzles that you have almost no clues for its complition.Regardless these, I have to say that I enjoyed very much playing this game. The main protagonist is vey likeable and the whole plot work just fine.Face Noir alongeside many other are prrof that point and click were never dead.			"

												Let me get to the skinny. I really, REALLY wanted to like Face Noir. A noir detective story wrapped around a point and click adventure? Yes please! But that said this game didn't work for me. The story was decent, the graphics were more than serviceable and level design was nice. But the game was, quite frankly, pretty boring. An excellent adventure game like Still Life pulls you in but Face Noir just didn't work for me. The puzzles were bland, voice acting was hit or miss and it just brought nothing new to the table. I think what I disliked most was the gameplay was so rigid. You HAD to do everything in a certain order or you were not going to proceed. I had to consult a walkthrough a couple times because I got frustrated by that. One last thing that ticked me off. The game ends up being set up for a sequel.  Welp. We'll see if that ever happens. I'd recommend Face Noir if you're really into old school style adventure games but be ready to have a walkthrough handy or you will be going back and forth over stuff you missed. 5/10 from me. EDIT: I'd be remiss if I didn't give some props to the soundtrack, which was excellent.			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- In terms of evidence and its storyline its well detailed and interesting- I quite liked the games atmosphere, it is as described, moody and intriguing- The soundtrack is so relaxing, I could fall asleep to it- Its not entirely straightforward allowing for a challenge not all point & clicks provideCONS:- It looks drab and well below an acceptable standard- The voice acting is dreadful- I didn't find it 'funny' instead I thought the script was uninteresting- The camera was poorly placed in some areas, you are so zoomed out that exploring can be frustrating as its not very responsive either.VERDICT? I almost recommended this as it was very interactive and didn't hold your hand, along with its atmosphere but ultimately I fell out of touch with this game as its too poorly designed for me to have cared enough to continue. If you really love point & clicks however I'd say go for it at the right price.			"

Product received for free
I won this game on Steamgifts.com, so I received the game free of charge, but not from the developer.A lukewarm recommendation.  It's a good, solid game...kind of a throwback even.  It feels more like a game released in 2007 instead of 2013, which isn't all bad.  But it's worth playing enough to see if the game draws you in.  But note that it sets up a sequel that may never be released.PROS:- good story- good length; a fair amount of content- glitch-free- good Noir ambiance; you feel like you're in the era- fully voiced- I liked the ""insights"" system where you'd have to combine two facts you've picked up to draw a conclusion- You can't screw something up so badly that you have to reload a save- Trading cardsNEITHER PRO nor CON- I didn't think the [English] voice acting was so bad...the protagonist in particular was sharp.- Extremely linear.  Some will consider this a con, but it doesn't bother me.- Mostly good puzzling; some were pretty obtuse or required real pixel hunting, but what do you expect from a point-and-click?  :)CONS- Feels old/dated: slow walking, low-resolution, awkward 3D elements- Several times I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and tried doing it in what seemed like a perfectly reasonable way, but it wanted me to do it slightly differently.- There were times where you needed information from something (e.g., by reading a newspaper), so you'd read it, but it wouldn't register unless you ""looked at"" (clicked) the area of interest.- The story is incomplete (makes a reference to Face Noir II) but this game may never be made.  I was getting a little worried about where the plot was going anyway, so maybe it's just as well.Anyway-- give it a try, with the caveats listed above!			"

												Don't listen to the bad reviews for this game. The art, style, setting, story, characters, gameplay and so much more are really dark, gritty, onimous and have a lot of the other aspects that really hit well with the noir genre. It really feels like you're playing some old Film Noir and really hit home with me as I am a huge fan of the genre. The puzzles aren't too cryptic, but aren't too easy. Most take a little bit of thinking without having some ridiculous solution that makes no sense as I have encountered in other adventure games. The story flows well, has twists and turns and always has a dark, slightly melancholy feel. The soundtrack is great ((and comes free with the game)) The game brings the suspense, style and so much more. Unlike many games today, it's really easy to delve into and really become entangled with the plot, characters, their issues and so much more.While the game does have a FEW MINOR problems, they are just that. FEW and MINOR. It's a nod to the classic style and feel of adventure games, in a world where gaming is becoming too mundane and unimaginative. It's a highly underrated game that deserves so much more. I enjoyed it so much that I will buy the sequel as soon as it comes out.			"

												Face Noir won't probably be remembered as a gem, or a masterpiece of the graphic adventure genre. Nevertheless, it's a game I'd recommend (at least to all the hardcore graphic adventure fans out there) because even with all its flaws, Face Noir feels like a game with something to say. I didn't like the puzzles very much, they are either very easy or very hard to solve, due to a massive use of pixel hunting, but I really enjoyed the story. I think the guys at Mad Orange made an awesome job at ricreating the 1930s atmosphere, and while you play you really want to know how the plot will evolve. I can't wait for Part 2 to know how the story will end. Gameplay-wise they could have done something more, that's obvious, but still, it's just a small indie team. For what concerns the graphics, some of the environments are really beautiful to look at, especially if you think that it's just an indie production, but the characters models feel a little outdated. Give this game a chance, it could surprise you.			"

Graphics: I found them to be ideal for this game, they were detailed and there were interesting ambent effects like the rain and smoke in bars.2. Voices: If you watch any 40's noir films you quickly notice that's how they talk, I thought it really enhanced the atmosphere.3. Humor: Dry and funny!

												""Dannazionne!"" this is one fantastic game!Mind you, this is more of a sci-fi noir game, there will be a few twists towards the middle that will have you doing a double-take. But trust me, the game is pretty good for what it is.It's a little slow to start and it's difficult to grasp the story at times since there are so many characters and side stories to keep track of and there are intervals throughout the game that calls for 'rewinds' and 'fast forwards' in time to portray other perspectives. However, what sets this game apart from other noir-themed games, is that this is a point & click game - which means it's going to be story heavy and less on the action side, which I personally enjoyed; also, you will be able to pick locks and solve puzzles (some of which can  be maddening at times, but they're a delightful addition). You do get to interview various characters and while there aren't necessarily any consequences for your choices, you might miss out on some details of the story if you don't ask the questions in a certain way or if you're too rough.  My outlook on the game is mostly positive but I do have a few complaints.There are a few plot holes, things that aren't explained; and, there's a cliffhanger at the end that leaves room for a supposed sequel - and I do hope that it is completed and released soon because I want to know more about the story! And, it's a bit frustrating that you have the option to skip lock-picking if it's too challenging, but you can't skip puzzles - I felt that option should've been balanced.If you're like me and craving the noir genre, I do recommend this game.

												Good point and click. There are interactive puzzles and a good story. One downfall is that you will occasionally have to go back and reinteract with items after reaching a certain point in the story, even though nothing changed from your initial interaction. Another is that some of the puzzles aren't exactly consistent when interacting with them. Occasionally a lock that needs to be picked will be missing a tumbler position, forcing you to start the lock puzzle over. Even with those two nitpicks, the story is compelling and it's a decent offering for a point and click story adventure.			"

												Joint joint joint damnazione joint joint damnazione joint joint joint joint joint joint joint damnazione joint joint joint joint joint.If that sentence didn't excite you, you probably won't like the script for this game.  The writing feels like a first draft where the second draft was just the same thing with bad attempts at slang shoehorned in.  There are multiple conversations where the word joint feels like it's being used every third word.  The acting is only slightly better than the script.  The only voice actor that felt like he belonged in a game that people charge money for is a character that you have a brief phone conversation with and (as far as I was able to get in 6 hour) never see. The gameplay feels like something from the 90s.  The screen is slow to move and so is the character.  If you're in a large room with a lot of things that can be clicked on, you'd better brew some coffee because you'll be waiting a while as Del Nero slowly plods across the room.  Fortunately, while examining things in smaller rooms, you get to see him occasionally flap his arms like a chicken, but I don't think that was actually supposed to happen.Despite the script, the story seemed fairly good for the first little while, but occasioanally you have to make some leaps in logic to figure out where to go next, and if you save and come back or miss a line of dialogue, you may as well just throw darts at the map because there's no real way to figure out where to go next.  While the story was decent it eventually started to drag by the time I made my third trip to the docks, so I took a look at a walkthough and said, ""Damnazione, I've still got at least a third of this thing left?  I'm getting out of this joint!""  Delete local content, move to the ""Bad"" category.			"

												The short review is that the game is fantastic. It's priced at $10 as of the writing of this review, and it's worth it, but getting on sale would be better!Except for one point, the story was excellent, the feel of the game was great and very immersive in 1930s New York, the soundtrack kicked butt, the puzzles were intelligible (I knew exactly what to do most of the time, but there was just the right amount of difficulty in getting it done), and I thought the humor of the protagonist was fantastic, but I like dry humor. The connect-the-dots mechanic was pretty inventive, I thought and added a good detective story even better, IMHO. The mannequins were probably the worst part of the game because they sometimes looked or did things that weren't right, but almost all point and click adventure puzzles suffer from this. My second complaint would be all the Dannazionis that were liberally peppered throughout the game. It was a bit overused.To address some complaints about the story being too linear or limiting in that I can't grab an object or do something now, but can later on when the story advances, I actually thought it made sense and, once again, is something most point and click adventure games do. I actually didn't mind because I viewed it as a story-focused game and that stream-lined it so that I could enjoy the story instead of getting caught up in picking up a bunch of useless stuff that I didn't need and wouldn't use.SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!The one thing I didn't like about the story was the paranormal element that was thrown in regarding the girl. While she is basically the MacGuffin for Face Noir, there is this allusion to her being able to control time and dreams and that she is going to do something supernatural in the sequel. This kind of threw me out of the immersiveness that the rest of the game established so well. The supernatural really has no place in a good noir story. Read any of the hard-boiled detective writers like Raymond Chandler, Dashell Hammett, and Mickey Spillane that typified the detective/Noir writing and none of them ever got caught up in that stuff. I also thought that its introduction in the last 1/3 of the game kind of blindsided me after being so true to the hard-boiled detective genre for the first 2/3 of the game.I do look forward to Face Noir II, though. Great job!			"

												Quite a nice climatic game to play on a rainy night. It is an old school adventure (point and click) game but it acts more like telling a story while most puzzles feel like a check if you follow the plot. Still it may hook you for long hours just to see what happens next. Sad thing is that this game is supposed to be part 1 and ends with a cliffhanger. (Was Oscar really left forever tied under the table? Haha... But it is enough for spoilers.) Unfortunately part 2 is not on the horizon yet but still remains a possibility according to some information on the forum. Nevertheless the part 1 is still worth going through and it is about 14 hours of a film noir style story without counting time being stuck on puzzles.			"

												8.6/10 - One of the Best Point and Click GamesIf you don't mind point and click this one is surely to delight. You are a private eye solving a mystery in the 1940's; the setting is very noir and complements everything perfectly. There are some pretty decent cut-scenes and I didn't mind the voice acting at all. The puzzles and clue finding are well done, especially lock picking!I'd pay the $10, but got this on sale for $5.

												At first this was a pretty decent point and click noir detective game. While some of the puzzles were annoying and/or pedantic, the art design and story was just about good enough to make up for it. Then the plot went down the rabbit hole and things got... weird. I'm keen to play any potential sequel, but less supernatural voodoo and more gritty New York would be nice.			"

Face Noir gets a lukewarm recommendation from me.  The story's not bad - a little bland at first, but it keeps getting more interesting and twisty as it progresses, making it worth finishing.  If a noir point-and-click casting you as a PI in the 1930's sounds like it'd be up your alley, go ahead, but be prepared for the flaws mentioned below.  I should note, though, that it ends with a lot of plot threads left dangling in anticipation of a sequel.Voice acting's mostly decent, but some characters seem flat while others have exaggerated accents, and there are occasionally times when a character's voice noticeably changes from one sentence to the next (indicating that the dialog was probably pieced together from multiple recording sessions with inconsistent quality).  Despite having no support for widescreen, the graphics are overall excellent and work well to set the mood.  The quality of the graphics, does, however, make the terrible facial animation that much more obvious.Compared to many other point-and-clicks, the puzzle solutions are logical and realistic, which works well with the story.  But that doesn't mean it compares well in terms of making the solutions fair and reasonable - in fact, it does just the opposite.  Some of the hotspots are tiny and barely visible, but that's a minor problem since F1 will highlight them.  A bigger problem is that at least a couple solutions depend on knowledge that the player cannot reasonably be expected to possess.  For example, you'll need to know what a certain country's flag looks like, which would be fine if said flag were clearly depicted in-game, but it isn't.  Worse, the game expects you to do things in a certain order that isn't always clear.  If you've missed inspecting the object that you need to inspect in order to open up the dialog option that you need to take before solving the next puzzle, you'll be stuck and you won't know why you're stuck until you've looked up a guide.  It may make sense, but only in retrospect.			"

												Face Noir is a game I can easily recommend. It executes well on every level (save the voice acting), and offers great puzzles, enjoyable characters, fabulous art design, and a fun (if pulpy) noir plotline. If you're interested in the Depression-era setting and enjoy a solid point-and-click adventure, you should absolutely check this one out.			"

												Playing Face Noir is like looking back in time to the first golden age of adventures. Face Noir refuses to hold your hand through its puzzles, no matter how insanely obscure some combinations of items might seem. It places names and numbers in the environment, but relies on the players to remember these facts or write them down in order to progress. It includes stealth sections in the same haphazard way that early FPS games handled platforming. For some, this will be a familiar and welcome return to the past, but most anyone who didn’t grow up combining items and pixel hunting will find nothing but frustration here.Full Review located at http://www.geekenstein.com/face-noir-review/.

Plot was nice and it makes sense. But then it started to get ridiculous. Introducing of paranormal events killed it for me. Last third of the game was boring, the same over and over again. There is even no real ending in the game. Apparently Face Noir II is coming, but I have no intention to play the sequel.  "

												Face Noir is an adventure that promises much and gets nothing. The development is slow, very slow, the story is boring and does not begin to engage or get interesting until about halfway through the game. The first part of the game will be running around doing silly things and visiting the port often.Too strict and lineal, you can only pick up and use things when he tells you ""you have to do"" ... even knowing what you have to do next... that´s the principal issue that breaks the enjoyment of the game. It had potential and eventually nothing at all.And when the story seems to make sense and find the plot, the game ends with a ""to be continued"". Anyway, the music is good.Trust me. I played a lot of adventures and this has been one of the most boring I've done.			"

												The game has a couple of glaring issues at first impression which I was willing to look past since I wasn’t on the lookout for something of the same calibre as L.A. Noir. But then some poor decisions in game design just made these flaws worse. The graphics aren’t too flash hot which was fine until there were a close-up of people’s faces talking. Nothing like the mechanical and rhythmic movements of individual’s mouth set in emotionless faces to really build suspense. The voice acting was pretty poor to say the least, lacking emotion, or at least the correct emotion. The game is originally Italian, so poor English voice-acting is understandable. This would not have been a huge deal if it hadn’t been coupled with the emotionless faces.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/03/21/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-face-noir/ "

												This game really feels like it was made by people who didn't care what they were doing. This is a mystery game with basic contradictions in the facts of the case. For example, there's a police report that claims a character was found 'not guilty' on Dec 1932, for a crime they were originally arrested for in either March or May 1933 (another inconsistency). The dialogue is incredibly disjoined (half-clinical, half written-by-someone-not-quite-fluent-in-English), and their idea of making it ""noir"" is to repeatedly use the same two or three Depression-era or Italian-immigrant words (e.g., ""joint"", ""Dannazione""). Also, when they talk, their models just chomp robotically for about two minutes longer than it would have someone to actually say what's being said. Textures on important characters are misaligned and then repeatedly shown close up (GOOD GOD PLEASE FIX THE LITTLE GIRL'S FEET, she looks like a cripple). Some of the puzzles are so contrived it's ridiculous. At one point you need to cheer someone up by finding some music on the radio, but there's like five frequencies with music and no hint as to which one she would prefer. At another point you need to get through a door with a barrel in the way, and the only way to do so is to pull a nail (one of 5, the only one you can pull out) from a pile of disused boats, then drive the nail into the barrel with your bare hands to drain the barrel of fluid so you can move it. Yup.			"

Felt boring and extremely slow paced. I tried to enjoy it, but I couldnt, especially when I cranked up something wtihin the game to increase something in the game and it gave me a BSOD. After that, I knew I shouldn't play this any longer as I do not want to reload everything again.The devs inside steam will tell you to email their support, even though, they know the answer. Like someone said that they cannot make it go to windowed mode and tried the run options. The dev said to email support which is what he says for many issues with this game.I don't know, the pace is very slow and I guess it is just that, I probably do not like Point and Click games. I think that must be it.The only good part about this is that voice acting. I thought it was done rather well.However, if you aren't into point and clicks, I would avoid it.If you love point and clicks, maybe you would enjoy this.Still, I would not recommend this game.			"

												I was close to leaving a positive review.  The story was curious, there's some delightful jazz in the soundtrack (real instruments possibly!).  But then I had one too many long, unnecessary minigame puzzles that involved walking for minutes at a time.  Too many times Jack Del Nero said ""Dannazoni"" or whatever his contrived Italian catchphrase was.  The pacing was just so stupidly slow at these less crucial parts that I couldn't take it anymore.  Instead of wasting another 5 minutes retracing steps for a lost item (thanks, FAQ), I am looking up the ending on YouTube and uninstalling.  So sad to see it come to this, but I have lost all patience.  Also - lack of multiple solutions to item puzzles is ridiculous.  Everything is linear, and it's a buzz kill.Feel free to try this if you have patience for inane puzzles and adventure game pixel hunting.  The lovely jazz soundtrack and curious story might even pull you through the terribly slow walking pace of the main character and inane minigames (there's even one that is SKIPPABLE if you fail enough!  SKIPPABLE, like with a Skip button.  Designers - if people would want to skip your minigame, chances are it's not fun or not done well, take your pick).			"

												This simply isn't that good a game. It's noir style means long-winded voice overs between scenes, and neither the voice acting nor writing is up to the task. Most of the puzzles are fine, but a few require objects to be placed in very precise patterns without the graphical cues or accuracy to make it clear why your solution does not work. A number of bugs plauge the game, one of which is game-breaking unless you realize you have to change a default Windows setting to get it to go away. The plot twists are fairly predictable, up until the end where it takes a twist to the absurd and goes in a direction that I personally found fairly undesirable. There are simply better point-n-click adventure games out there.			"

												I would Recommend to give this game a go but maybe wait for a sale. However be wary the ending is slightly abrupt less cliff hanger more oh its over, to be continued in the next game.What I Liked: The Story, It was interesting and kept me intriged even if it did get a little left feild at the end.The Puzzels, nice mix.The graphics, all though I would of liked it to use more of the film noir style it take from with the heavy shadows.What I didn't The controls, I felt when using the mouse during the puzzels it was very on or off. The hand cursor made some of the     puzzels fiddley the arrow cursor would have been fine. The abilty to run would have great, double click to run, after walking round the secne you've visited before can really slow down the gameplay. keyboard controls would of been a god send, trying to stealth with point and clicking can be quite infuriating.

												I'll give it a tentative recommendation. Nice style and music and the story's ok, but it's boring - too much slow walking, back and forth to locations, and a strict order of operations to the puzzles lead to a lot of retreading and pointless clicking. All those factors make it needlessly long for the amount of story it covers. Fans of noir or old school point and click will like it but don't pay anything close to full price. Oh and the ending is a cliffhanger for the supposed sequel, so there's no payoff whatsoever for your long dull tread.			"

												More reviews here: https://tdgameclub.com/face-noir-pc-game-review/What is Face NoirFace Noir is a 2.5D detective point and click adventure with a grim sepia filter and serious atmosphere. You will play as a private eye – Jack Del Nero, who somehow lives from day to day like most people after the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange. His only pleasure are cigarettes and whiskey, which he generally can’t afford and his job as a private detective doesn’t earn much. But one day he answers the call from his old colleague, who was involved in a pretty tangled cobweb of underworld.The story begins at the end to entice you, then of course you will play retrospectively to find out why it happened. Because I don’t want to spoil the whole story, let’s continue with parameters, which can be reviewed without interfering with the plot.Graphic3D characters have slightly more sophisticated Max Payne’s graphic. The textures are visibly more balanced. Well, there’s a difference of 12 years so it’s not an objective comparison, but I mentioned it only as a metaphor. Character’s facial expressions are horrible, but you honestly can’t expect more here (it’s technically impossible). I personally really didn’t mind the lack of facial expressions, even though it has lowered the seriousness and emotionalism of the situations. However the whole graphic is in the well chosen sepia tone, which underlines the depressive undertone of the game.Mini-gamesAs every adventure game this one has mini games and tasks too. Does Face Noir have some atypical elements? I can think of one mechanism – you collect thoughts by examining various subjects and obtaining information, which you can lately match together in order to get new conversation topics or it can lead you to a crucial track of the investigation. Otherwise, the mini-games are not significantly different from other adventure games.GameplayAs a player you don’t have any freedom. The game is exactly scripted and if you don’t complete everything in the correct order, there’s no way to get further in the story, even if you know what to do. This game simply doesn’t care that you as an experienced point-and-click player know, what is expected of you, here the game decides what’s next. E.g. You know that you need to go into that locked dark alley, but Jack won’t go there, because it doesn’t make sense to him. So you have to convince him that he actually wants to go there. Sounds interesting, right? Sometimes I had the feeling that Face Noir is pulling my leg, because I somehow always missed the right point and found it after I walked around all possible locations, I made a circle and returned to the same location, but this time I was successful. Anyway, I appreciate the opportunity to speed up the character movement with a double-click.If you are handy and easily progress through the game, you will soon realize that it’s pretty dynamic. You won’t play as Jack the whole time and you will find out that what seemed to be realism turned out to actually be a magical realism.SoundMy Italian vocabulary of four words – grande, italiano, grazie and arrivederci have expanded by another word - dannazione! Jack will use it so many times that you will never forget it. I don’t blame him, I would be cynical and negative too if I were him. But what I definitely don’t find negative is the English voice acting. I think that the voices fit to the characters and the music is also appropriately chosen.ConclusionI rank Face Noir among the games that didn’t really impress me, but didn’t really disappoint me in the same time. But what really did upset me is the end. I don’t mind the open end, but I mind that at the end I was acquainted with a sequel - Face Noir 2, which I wanted to play because I obviously am interested in how the story turns out. But instead I found out that Face Noir 2 was never released. I don’t know what happened, maybe the development team broke up, anyway, I as a player feel cheated. Of course, this fact doesn’t affect the evaluation of Face Noir, on the contrary, my disappointment is a compliment, because I'm interested in the sequel.Score: 57/100			"
