The song of praise to Math, Logic and... Checks.It's about:moving bunch of animals (sheep, wolves, pigs) between platforms of different capacity;delivering precise (not more, not less) amouth of animals to the extraction point;making sacrifices and counting inevitable losses in advance;foreseeing consequences of your actions.Why you should play this:you consider calculation as an entertainment;5 different worlds (30 puzzles in each) with different tasks' mechanic and new features - what started as simple moving between platforms step by step transforms into a complex (but fun) puzzle:there're fences you can't overcome, trampolines, lasers, switching platforms standing everything on its ear, traps, roasting platforms killing one aminal per move, burners killing all animals instantly, portals, etc.;like that's not enough, there's interaction between animals and enviroment: wolves eat sheep and can't be moved after that, lasers harmless for wolves, but splitting sheep in half (these parts are merged together on extraction point), pigs occupiy additional space on platform for their dirt-baths, if there're other aminals on platform - pigs have to be moved first, etc.nice, pleasant graphic and suitable soundtack;despite the fact that puzzles sometimes complex, it's not brain-melting kind of riddle;Why you may not like it:... I wish I knew.A paradise for math obsessed dorks, cold-blood calculation minds and people who know that it's impossible to make an omelet without breaking eggs. Don't get me wrong - all these are compliments. "

Key supplied by developer for review.======================================Divide by Sheep (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DRDivide by Sheep is a wonderfully crafted puzzle game, sporting a beautiful artstyle, well paced  difficulty increases with new feature introductions woven in, and a lovely dose of black humor.======================================Pros+Art: LOVELY modern-retro isometric style with great and vivid color choices.+Gameplay: Clever use of ""division"" makes for a smooth and fun puzzle experience.+Humor: The concept of the game alone is pure gold, even if the humor is black.+Difficulty: New features and difficulty both come at a good pace, although there is sometimes inconsistency in said difficulty.+Sound: The audio design is pretty good, and there are no problems that stand out.Cons-""Tutorial"": The briefing for new features through the use of a single picture can make instructions a little murky at times.-The menu is slightly awkward to navigate with a mouse.-Nobody likes it when the ""Rate this app!"" page stays on a mobile port, but this isn't a huge deal.Neutral+/- It would be cool if there were even more options for how to divide the sheep.======================================IntroductionWelcome to the wonderful world of Divide by Sheep, a fun puzzle game where it is your job to fling livestock from platform to platform to ensure the correct amount get to the end.GameplayDivide by Sheep is a puzzle game through and through. There's no run and gun, there's no portals, there's no incentive to click as fast as you can, there's no minigames or leveling up. All there is, is a collection of levels with simple mechanics used in very clever ways, and a goal. That's right, it's just you and your brain. You can take as much time as you need, and retry at any time, but be prepared to do it a lot if you intend to complete every level perfectly. Never before has it been more difficult to simply kill one sheep, or feed a few dogs. In your quest to (sometimes literally) extract these cute animals, you will have to systematically divide, subtract, and add to the groups of critters. You have various tools at your disposal for doing so, including incineration, lazers that split individuals in half, drowning, replacing (and still drowning,) jump pads that split your group up and send them in specific directions, platforms that swap with each other, etc.Sacrifice is the name of the game, here, and it's never been more cute or fun. Divide by Sheep starts off relatively easy, and with great pacing gradually introduces more features and difficulty, although sometimes a level or two might be easier or significantly harder than previous ones. All of the puzzles are completely solvable and require experimentaiton or calculation, but never abstraction; you will never have that moment where you have to look up a solution to a puzzle and then go ""How was I supposed to know that's what I was supposed to do?"" The design of the levels is brilliantly clever and you will find yourself feeling increasingly satisfied with figuring out how to beat them with a perfect score. Get ready, it's really addicting!GraphicsThe graphics in Divide by Sheep are pretty simple, but very effective. It has a classic isometric style with modern design, with an almost vector art aesthetic. The menu transitions and navigation are smooth and simple, and I love how the UI stays almost completely out of the way, however, I will fault it slightly for clearly being intended for touch devices, and for having a rate this app page. There is also no option to change resolution. There is, however, a button to make the gameplay more child-friendly, which is really cool, and considerate of the developers, because this would be a great mental workout for any kid who can understand the mechanics.If you've looked at the screenshots or trailers, then you know most of what you need to know about the game's graphics.AudioSo there's not a whole lot to say about the audio in Divide by Sheep, except that I like the music, and surprisingly at no point found myself getting tired of it or completely tuning it out. The sounds are pleasant enough, and there's good audible feedback for actions and navigation. There are also no problems with the quality of the sound itself. ConclusionDivide by Sheep is an exceptional puzzle game that will keep you busy for quite a while. It is challenging and engaging but never unfair. The content to price ratio is very good, and I am entirely comfortable recommending the game at full price...in fact, they could have charged more and I would still recommend it at full price. Seriously, treat yourself.======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												This game may seem simple and easy, but I have been playing for 4 hours so far and I am on level 20 of world 2 (around 42% of the game) and its already getting hard. I had to think more than 10 minutes on some levels. The music is nice, the graphics are bright and friendly and the puzzles are hard. What else do you need from a puzzle game?			"

												Death is lonely. Death wants some company. So naturally he would flood a plain filled with sheep and wolves, then float rafts requiring very specific numbers of dead creature souls at a time. Obviously. Divide by Sheep is a math-based puzzle game and to that end it works well. What makes it noteworthy is the window dressing, a whimsical cartoon presentation of fairly morbid subject matter.Like many well-designed puzzle games, Divide by Sheep starts out with a simple premise, which it builds upon as the player progresses. Groups of sheep in numbers ranging from one to nine are spread across platforms whose sizes can vary within that same range. Sheep can be moved between adjacent platforms, but if a group size ever exceeds the destination platform size then the excess sheep are thrown into the water and drowned. The goal is to load life rafts with sheep, but only in specified numbers. Too few and the raft won't launch, too many and the raft will spring a leak and sink. Hitting one numerical goal for a level will unlock the next, but mastering a level requires three quotas to be met in a specific order.n the beginning, there isn't a lot to think about. The options for adding and subtracting sheep from a group are small: combine two groups together to increase the number or throw more sheep than a platform can hold to decrease. It might sound complex in writing, but it's an easy concept to pick up after a few minutes of play. Not far in, Divide by Sheep introduces new elements to use toward the end of filling up life rafts. Fences block movement between adjacent platforms. Dynamite platforms explode and disappear if they have no occupants. Laser fields will slice sheep in half so one divided sheep takes up two spots on a platform. The first major change comes with the introduction of wolves. If a wolf and a sheep share the same platform, the wolf will eat the sheep and become so obese it cannot be moved or fed again. Wolves have their own life rafts and the two species can never commingle on rafts. It almost reminds me of the old fox/rabbit/cabbage puzzle; there are constant calculations for when and how to feed the wolves in order to get the right number of animals to safety. A wolf can be fed to completion on half a sheep, so one sheep sent through a laser can feed two wolves. With all of the mechanics put together, there are several ways to add and subtract from groups of sheep and wolves.What I like about the setup is that even though there is often only one three-star solution to a puzzle, there are several different avenues to mentally attack it from. In some levels when the quotas are high, it's important to note exactly how many animals can be safely sacrificed. Others require a different kind of foresight, forcing one initial move since all others would lead to failure. Still more are so complex that a sort of trial-and-error can reveal the path to the best answer.The next big wrinkle comes in the Dark World, where Death finally shows up. He has rafts of his own, and he is collecting souls. It doesn't matter how the animals die; they can be drowned, sliced, eaten, or burned and he will take them. It eventually gets to a point where sheep can do double duty in terms of raft occupancy. The sheep can be cut in half to fill Death's raft, then duct taped back together to fill a sheep raft.That highlights the odd tone of Divide by Sheep. At a glance, it looks like an average cartoony mobile title. The soundtrack is bouncy and upbeat. So the juxtaposition of that G-rated presentation and the graphic slaughter with copious amounts of blood is funny in the same way the fictional cartoon The Itchy & Scratchy Show is. It would be disturbing if it weren't also adorable.Divide by Sheep hits the perfect level of difficulty, where every stage makes me think for at least a few seconds, but each one is also small and self-contained enough that persistence and critical thinking can always lead to victory. It has never felt too easy nor have I ever been permanently stumped. It's smart, it's pretty, and it never dwells on any one idea for too long. At its heart is a quality math puzzler, but what makes it shine is the dark comedy found in killing cartoon animals just to satisfy some arbitrary numerical requirements.			"

			Divide by Sheep is a cute but challenging puzzler about counting sheep, wolves, souls and the like. Developed by Victor Solodilov & Denis Novikov and published by tinyBuild, PartyHard is out on...		

Written ReviewDivide by Sheep is a simple iOS port, which becomes obvious in the controls as well as in the lack of options. Often times, I would ignore blatant low-effort ports published on Steam for just another cash cow to milk. However, Divide by Sheep did surprise me in terms of its intelligent puzzle design. It first starts out simple enough with you trying to rescue specific amount of sheep in a certain order. This can be accomplished by utilising the size of islands, splitting certain herds with jump pads and so on. Soon, Divide by Sheep becomes a mashup of devouring sheep, sacrificing wolves or sheep for their souls, all while trying to give whatever the upper left corner of the screen at the current time point demands. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well the game gradually introduces more and more mechanics, melds them into more demanding puzzles and keeps you engaged and challenged throughout your playtime. At the same time, Divide by Sheep never pressures you, as the cute art style and relaxing soundtrack trot along with your gears doing the calculations. Should you be amongst the vast amount of people who never enjoyed maths in school though, you might not particularly desire to add, divide and plan ahead in Divide by Sheep. I personally enjoyed my time a whole bunch, except for the missing undo a move button, which led to me redoing a bunch of levels, as I out of idiocy did the wrong move a tad too early or too late. So yes, an undo button would have been great.VERDICTAll in all, Divide by Sheep will probably not lead to you falling asleep while counting. It’s a cute, polished puzzle game which provides a bunch of hours of gameplay for just a few bucks and can therefore be recommended easily to everyone enjoying a bit of numerical puzzling from time to time.

												Cut 3 sheep in half, threw two halves in the water and taped the other 4 parts back together. Fed 3/5 sheep to hungry wolves and added the other 2 to the taped sheep. Realized this makes 4, not 5, and had to start sacrificing sheeps all over...again.10/10 would fail at math again.			"

												*Reviewed With A Press Key*Divide by sheep is a very fun puzzle game where you have to get the correct amount of sheep onto a raft, which sounds simple enough but you will have to sacrifice Sheep in order to save the correct amount. There are a tonne of different mechanics it seems as I'm only 20 levels in and already seen 6 different mechanics that add a lot of thought into the game such as little rat things that swallow your sheep. The game is laid out very mobile like but controls very well.*Gameplay*You jump your sheep across islands that can only fit a certain amount of Sheep, if your sheep can't fit then they fall off to their death which may be nessesary. Like I said there are a tonne of mechanics that change the way you think and play.*Conclusion*This game is very fun and easy to learn and I highly recommend picking up the game. I give it a 9/10 for being, fun, addictive and just awesome.*YouTube*

												Cute puzzler that quickly got much darker. Within a few levels was flinging sheep through laser beams followed by duct taping them back together. Which may sound disturbing if not for the beautiful vector-like art. More directed towards mobile and touch interfaces can happily say had no problems with the controls or UI.

			Divide By Sheep PC Gameplay [60FPS] Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/252130/ Steam Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/252130/ Subscribe:...		

Rather straight forward gameplay. Fill rafts with the correct number of animals and get rewarded stars with a total of 3 per level being possible. Gradually introduced to new obstacles such as trampolines (split packs), wolves (eat sheep) and electric fences (let's not go there). Don't let the 'math' requirement turn you away, levels could be passed by receiving 1 star if just wanting to progress further. Depending on puzzle skills and if aiming to perfect levels, should get around 5~ hours of gametime. For the price it's worth taking at look at puzzle fans. Cheers. Likes:Visual PresentationSimple Drag and Drop ControlsFair amount of content (120 levels)Dislikes:Music was repetitive (separate volume sliders are available)			"

												If you would've told me a day ago that I was going to play a game all about math, division, and adorable little animals being cut in half, I would've called you crazy. Even more so for saying I was actually going to ENJOY it, of all things. That was yesterday. Today we have Divide by Sheep, a hilarious little puzzle game that is full of charm and some very challenging puzzles.Now I feel before we move any further, we should really note something. This title is extremely App friendly in design. If you are somebody who gets easily bugged by that type of thing, you are going to grind your teeth as you gain 3 stars and see a complete lack of options menu. With that aside, I love Divide by Sheep. The game is disguised beautifully, but its all about math and putting numbers in the proper order to get the outcome you want. Using sheep, pigs, wolves, lasers and more, you will send the adorable little animals on their voyage to the hands of Death.That's right, Death is lonely and wants a friend, but I mean Death is adorable, who wouldn't want to be his friend?Small plot aside, the aesthetics and charm of Divide by Sheep is what got me hooked. This is incredibly important aspect to the game, otherwise it's just a math puzzle game. The dark humor is what kept me smiling, even when I got frustrated. So much so as a matter of fact, that if you are not a fan of math, you may not enjoy this title as much. You must bounce sheep or an assortment of animals to a raft that requires a specific number. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it can be incredibly complicated. The difficulty scales rapidly and there have been more than a few times that Divide by Sheep has made me scratch my head and made my eyes go cross. More elements are introduced to complicate matters, such as limited number platforms, wolves that eat sheep, laser grids that divide sheep hilariously in half, and bouncing platforms that send your helpless animals flying.That isn't to say that Divide by Sheep is too hard to beat or play though. If you can match just one of the numbers you are allowed to progress to the next level. Getting stuck is never an issue, and the challenge is one you set on yourself. Go for three stars or just say screw it and come back to it later, just like a real math test. Divide by Sheep has a large assortment of levels all with the 3 star challenge. The aesthetic of the levels does change from grassy halls to frozen tundras but for the most part, level design is always the same. Some floating platforms, which is your puzzle, and a raft to put X number of animals on.On occasion after beating a number of levels, you are rewarded with an adorable piece of art, that usually explains a new up coming element in some manner.It really is hard to find a fault with Divide by Sheep, because it's a very simplistic game. That in itself may be an issue though, because sometimes lets face it, math sucks. Mind you, this is why I'm a writer instead of a Architect or something that actually pays. But I digress. The point is, if Divide by Sheep had a fault it would be that it's a one trick pony. It doesn't exactly claim to be anything else than what it is, so this isn't a fault to the game. You should be more than aware what you're getting into if you buy this game. Aside from that and the App like nature of Divide by Sheep, it's bug free and is very fun to play. The replay value comes from trying to get 3 stars on every level, which unless you're very clever, is going to be long and challenging.The options menu for the most part is non-existent, however there are parental controls if you wanted to leave the messy parts of the game out, like sheep being cut in half and leaving bloody messes. This feature while not incredibly important, is rather nice to be included and makes this game also a great learning tool. The music and soundtrack of Divide by Sheep are absolutely adorable and jaunty, matching the games almost carefree tone. It never really got grating on my ears or did any painful repeats. The music changes from area to area of the game thankfully so there is always something new to listen to around the corner.I have played plenty of puzzle games but none that actually made math fun for me. I am not huge fan of Sudoku or other games of its nature. That in itself is an incredible compliment to the games level design. After being stuck on a level for a while and finally beating it, you get the ""aha!"" feeling that is quite addictive. Divide by Sheep may not be incredibly innovative but I haven't seen many games like it.There are some areas that Divide by Sheep could've added a little bit more to make the game user friendly. There is no hint button or any hand holding whatsoever, so if you bang your head against the wall, you are heading to Youtube or a forum for help. While there is a quick start over button, a undo last move button would've been very nice for some of the more complicated puzzles that involved many steps. While these puzzles are rare they do happen, and having to start completely over again left me a little wanting. Divide by Sheep is available on Steam and mobile markets, the price is representative of that fact at $4.99. This makes it an absolutely steal if you love puzzle games, plus hey, Steam achievements are always fun. You can always nab this game for on the go at $2.99 on the iTunes store. This game makes a great traveling companion. So if you are in the market for an incredibly adorable puzzle game that is going to give you plenty of bang for your buck and more than likely make you scratch your head, I can't think of a better game than Divide by Sheep.

Game InformationDivide by Sheep, is a IPA* game, developed by Victor Solodilov and Denis Novikov; published by tinyBuild.There is a storyline for the game but it isn't much to it nor its' rememberable.IPA - Indie Puzzle AdventureGame VisualsI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.Game AudioI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even its simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.GameplayThere are no difficult modes to choose from but each of the levels has their own difficulty.There are five worlds with thirty levels in total six hundred levels. All levels has three stars to earn.There's an option for resetting the level if an error has been made. All levels can be replayed to earn all three stars. The first world is automatically unlock but the other four worlds are locked. They required a certain amount of stars to unlock them.New game mechanics are introduced into the game as it progresses. As it being said the puzzles will certainly get tricky to solve.There nineteen achievements to earned but each has a requirement before they can be unlocked. MiscellaneousThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price. "

												This is a solid little puzzle game with really really crappy developers. I got it originally for mobile and I enjoyed it. Then I saw that it had been ported to Steam and was excited beacuse it had achievements, and I love achievements, and it was Mac compatible so I could play it on my laptop. I played through the entire first world (in full screen because there's no windowed mode) and did not get a single one of the corresponding achievements. They just don't work on Mac.Since the game hadn't been out on Steam that long, I emailed the devs to make sure they knew about the problem and ask if they would fix it. They said they had no idea there was an issue and they'd look into it. Months later, no update, I email again and am told the devs have moved on. They just made a quick and dirty minimal work required port and have no intention of fixing any issues with it or ever revisiting this game ever again, despite the interest of many customers. I have no respect for that type of developer and do not intend to purchase games from them in the future.			"

												10 minutes in the game: aw this is so cute40 minutes in the game: haha ok wolves1 hour in the game: lasers? how are the sheep still jumping? why did this game get so dark?Ok but really, this game WAS super cute, but then it escalated super fast and there's blood (just a warning). The puzzle is really unique and pretty cool. At the start of the game (like all games), the puzzle is pretty easy and didn't require much brain power, but as you go on it gets more difficult (and darker). It requires maths, well kinda, there's no algebra, but there's the simple stuff like addition, subtraction and division (it's in the name). Pros:- Unique puzzle- Nice graphics- Addictive- Simple controlsCons:- It's a mobile port for PC and some people don't enjoy/like thatIdeas for the game:- An undo button would be nice because it's super annoying when you do something wrong and you have to start all over againI'll update this if any major updates come up if there are any problems please comment!

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It seemed like a nice little puzzle game, but ultimately it got too aggravating to play for one very simple reason. No windowed mode. On a puzzle game, this is not acceptable. I should not be boxed away entirely from everything else I'm doing just so I can focus entirely on a calm, casual puzzle game. Hell, I don't like being boxed away from everyone else for ANY game, but with a puzzle game such as this, that's particularly problematic. It wouldn't even work with DxWnd. I held onto this game for a while in the hopes windowed mode would be added later. However, the developer seems to have taken a very ""Fire and forget"" approach to this game, and has actually admitted he's too lazy to implement a windowed mode.http://steamcommunity.com/app/252130/discussions/0/517142892060966035/I am sorry, but if the developer isn't making time for us by updating thier mobile port with something so small as a windowed mode, and is outright saying it to people's faces, I'm not making time for the developer. I may change my tune if/when a windowed mode is added, but as of right now I'm a very dissatisfied customer due to this behaviour, and I have requested a refund.			"

												Quite challenging! Also not a small amount of content. It's an excellent exercise of math skill; you learn how to modify the numbers (of sheep) using tools around the board; split, reduce, divide (literally), until you discover how to push the correct number of sheep onto the life boat. The levels are of mixed difficulty, but always plainly presented and always enjoyable to complete, and a number of extra challenges introduce themselves to the game as you progress.Excellent game, I recommend to all puzzle enthusiasts.

												The only game where you can sacrifice sheep, cut them in half, put them back together and still win! Divide by Sheep has one of the easiest concepts for a puzzle game but yet still manages to make your brain explode whilst still making you want to keep playing more and more. Although, I can definitely recommend buying this as it is really fun, it still has a few things which could be improved which I will explain in my Pros and Cons.  Pros:♦ Great Gameplay that really makes you think without making you want to rage quit and never play again (There is the right balance here which makes it fun. It's one of those puzzles you just pick up and want to complete that no matter how frustrating it can be at times you never want to put it down until it's solved) ♦ Decent number of Worlds and Levels (5 worlds, 30 levels a world, this is a good balanced number as it's not too few levels or too many. It doesn't leave you wanting more levels or make you feel like it's just dragging on and on becoming repetitive)♦ Awesome Cartoon Styled Graphics (This adds a nice edge to the style of the game)♦ Sound that just fits (Music and Sounds that can be listened to over and over again without sounding repetitive and annoying) ♦ Decent Tutorials and Tutorial style (These are set of graphics/images before the level happens. They are well designed and detailed enough to understand what is going on which is awesome)♦ Not Repetitive (Each World looks graphically different from the last and incorporates aspects from the previous but adds something new. Also each level is scaled on from the last making each level a unique puzzle in its own. This makes the game fun and not repetitive)♦ Achievements are easy to get by just playing the game (Really easy to 100% if you can 100% all the puzzles)♦ Star incentive to keep trying a level until you 100% it (This is a nifty way to draw people into keep them playing a level until they 100% it and get all 3 stars for the level)♦ Awesome Graphical Story involving the Grim Reaper (For the minimal story in the game, it works)♦ Decent looking Steam Trading Cards, Emoticons and Backgrounds (Really well designed)♦ Controls just work (This is because the only thing you have to use is the mouse)♦ Worth the Price of $5 (At a $1 a world or $1 per 30 levels, you will definitely get your moneys worth)Cons:♦ Don’t have to rescue/kill all the sheep, pigs or wolves (I found this part a weird concept as it felt like I was completing a Jigsaw Puzzle for example without using all the pieces).♦ Ported from Mobile without 100% checking that everything is consistent for the PC version. (I say this as it says ""Rate this App"" in one of the tabs. This should say something like ""Review this Game"" and shows the Devs didn't bother checking it/changing it for pc)♦ Can't skip some cut scenes (Such as Intro Scene)♦ Some aspects seem randomly introduced such as Pigs (One second you’re just playing with Sheep & Wolves and the next you know you have Pigs. I just felt they could have introduced them better in my opinion)  ♦ Menu looks like Mobile still (This isn't a major issue as the game works fine, it would just be nice to have the menu looking more like a PC games to make it look more PC orientated then straight ported from Mobile)♦ No Graphics or Resolution options (This is annoying if you want to play in different size resolutions or change from FullScreen to Windowed Mode as this is the type of game that would suit Windowed Mode) Side Note:♦ Most people complain that this is a mobile port. In some aspects like the menus and options it is. However, if you can look past that fact, it is a really, really well made puzzle game that shouldn't fully be criticised on the fact that the Devs didn't fully change it for PC. With this said unlike some Mobile Ports, the Devs have made full use of the majority of Steam Features such as Achievements and Steam Trading Cards. Therefore, it's not just a straight Mobile Port in all aspects and the gameplay 100% works.Overall, even though there are a couple of cons, they are only minor things which could improve the game slightly. Therefore, as the game just works, has good graphics, a decent storyline, isn't repetitive and has a decent amount of levels, worlds and content that will keep you thinking and thinking... I recommend you buy this. You'll definitely get multiple fun hours out of this if you are into puzzle games or just want to sacrifice sheep... So buy this and sacrifice a sheep today!			"

												This is a really nice game, the mechanics are simple and the puzzles make really good use of them. The more levels you unlock more mechanics are added and the puzzles become more difficult. Its really fun and at moments it makes you think quite a bit. The design is simple, colorful and the music fits nicely. It's not a long game, took me 10 hours to finish it but I definitely enjoyed it. Something that is lacking would be a level in which all the mechanics are used at once. But other than that this is a really good game if you like puzzles.			"

												The game is cute a s hell but also has some pretty dark homour it is out-standing on the music front and the cartoony graphics only add to whats already a really great package. Make your way through the daring puzzles as you try and save the sheep from the Grim Reaper.

												What a lovely game! I just finished all the levels and loved all of them (especially 4 - 17, that one was hilarious)!It's got everything it promises and more and even promises of more content, which I am looking forward too.If you like cutting sheep in half and dumping their cut-up corpses on a pigs head while you throw wolves to the kraken, I would highly recommend it. It is an amazing game.If you are worried about all the maths being a problem, do not worry. If you finished the basic kindergarden addition and subtraction, you should do fine here.(Watch me play the first few levels, if you are into that sort of stuff.. )

												Divide by Sheep is a puzzle game originally designed for mobile platforms. It's conversion to PC is done quite well with controls moving to the mouse quite intuitively.This game is a definite must have for anyone who enjoys small puzzle games.I suppose it should also be noted for Steam achievement hunters that is relatively easy to power to 100% achievements.Note: Although there is blood when literally dividing sheep, there is a parental control option to make sheep division less violent.

												Divide by Sheep is math puzzle game disguised with cute critters. Yes, you also divide.Let me get it out of the way: this is a blatant mobile port that nonetheless ends up working ok with a mouse.The basic mechanics have you throw groups of critters from one island to the next, with the goal of satisfying 3 requests in each, be it save an exact amount of them or kill a certain number. These requests are tied to the layout of the map and require you to move around the animals until you've satisfied them all in sequence.You can merge groups on a single island (2 sheeps + 3 sheeps = 5 sheep!) as well as ""decrease them"" by throwing more than an island can take and drowning the excess. I should also mention that you literally divide sheep with laser grids. In half. A bloody half. And two halves make a whole, don't forget!Things get more complex as the game gives you more critters who interact differently with one another (wolves eat all others, pigs squash sheeps, the golden idol that exists somehow squashes everything...) as well as different types of islands that disappear when left empty or burn any visitor.While the game is fun, it doesn't have a very good progression; the difficulty varies wildly from one stage and the next, but it somehow manages to be fun for the most part. I have to point out that it does overstay its welcome by a couple dozen stages; the last world adds slightly uninspired elements that were most likely added just to increase the duration of the game. The achievement structure also suggests this: the ""get everything"" unlocks after the second-to-last world, with one more ""get everything"" unlocking after you're done with the last world as well.All in all, Divide by Sheep is a cute puzzle game, but I wouldn't suggest it to those who don't already love the genre.To such players, go ahead and get it during a discount for a few hours of fun; feel also free to let go when you get bored though: sadly, there's no majestic puzzle design waiting for you in its last phases.

												A cute little puzzle game that forces you to think a bit outside the box. While it may seem easy at a glance, and even childish with the cute animation and whimsical music, it certainly isn't. After the first level, you will start to question your own mathematical skills, and also sometimes forget the most obvious blatant answer in your face.

												Adorable and slightly disturbing, an excellent combination. And the puzzles scale nicely; new elements are introduced with an easy puzzle first before combining them with other elements. Even the hard puzzles aren't frustrating - there's an instant restart-the-level option that means not wasting time if you made a mistake, and you can progress even if you can't finish a level entirely.When I'm stressed out by real life, a few minutes of flipping sheep through the air (and through slicers, and into wolves) helps mellow me back out.

												Defined by: Looks can be deceiving; don't judge a book by its cover.  At first it looked like a try-too-hard-to-be-cute mobile puzzler turned quick steam port cash grab, and it is indeed a port, but oh was I wrong.  From the opening cinematic you know things are slightly off. It reminded me of Happy Tree Friends, turning the cute visuals into a sometimes gruesome scene.  Usually I'm put off by things like this, but this game nails it.  The soundtrack is not something you'd probably throw on while not playing the game, but it is very entertaining. Down to the gameplay itself:  This is actually one of few puzzle games that I've been infuriatingly stumped by, making the success that much more satisfying.  As the name suggests, the puzzles revolve directly around math and sheep.  Also wolves, lazers, trampolines, and lots of death.  Use this to teach your kids about math...or prove to yourself you're bad at math.			"

												What I learned from this game.1.  Sheep are quite durable.  Tape a couple sheep butts back together and your sheep will be good as new!2.  Pigs are kind of jerks...  There was an open space Porky!  Why'd you knock that sheep off?!!?3.  The game is even more hillarious after a few drinks.4.  I'm very bad at math after a few drinks...5.  Wolves do not chew their food.6.  Sheep. Wolves and Pigs do not float.   They are also quite flamable.7.  If you throw wolves, pigs, or sheep on the Reaper's boat he won't be pleased with you.This is a great game.   It's sick, twisted, funny, and tests your brain a bit with math and puzzle solving.  Definitely worth buying!   I just read in another person's review that Divide by Sheep is also available on mobile devices.  Guess I'll be getting that to so I can get my fix while away from home.If I could add anything to this game I'd add a timed mode with extra achievements & the levels out of order for each section.

												Divide By Sheep is a cute, fun and challenging mobile port. In each level you have to send the correct number of certain animals(sheep, wolf or pig) to the safety of the raft. The animals start out on islands, in various amounts and you have to determine how to eliminate or add to your group by letting the wolf eat a sheep or pig or by knocking another off the island. In later levels, lasers, fire, wolf traps add to the challenge. The achievements are fairly easy to get, but at this time the last achievement for getting all of the achievements is bugged. If you like challenging and fun puzzlers buy it!			"

												I was a bit skeptical at first but this is a very good time waster game. Not very challenging (I'm currently at world 3) but it's not designed to be. You can clear most levels in a few minutes without focusing only on the game.The gameplay is definitely there, and evolving during your playtrought, since new platforms and mechanics are making their appearance with each new world. They are also very nicely introduced. I have absolutely nothing to say against the learning curve.The art is cute. Music is getting really annoying really fast, but well I wasn't expecting a 10 out of 10 at this price, and  I guess it makes sense since the game is not designed to be played during long periods of time. It's not a problem thought, since you can just disable it and keep the sounds effects.I'd say you would need like 1 hour/world if you intend to finish it with all stars for each stage, at least for the 3 first world. Therefore I'm not expecting more than 5-6 hours of gameplay with this one.Would definitely recommend it, if it was a mobile game.The pc port is awfull. You can't customize anything, not even launch this in windowed mode. The UI is unnecessary huge and so on. I wouldn't even call this a port if you ask me, I doubt the devs spent any time thinking of how to improve the experience depending on the platform you play this game on.			"

												I will make this review short because this game is exactly as it looks like in trailer and screenshots.-> for its price I recommend it, gave me fun for about 3 hours the other 3 were to get the card drops, honestly.-> The game idea is simple and although it keeps adding new features every few levels you get some new thing to deal with in solving puzzles, it does get tedious after a while, however I suppose if you're the type that gets sucked into this type of relaxing cute looking puzzle games you'd find it right up your alle.-> It plays better on mobile phones, I played it on my friend's Ipad and it suits it perfectly, after all it really is the type of the typical mobile game, get 3 stars every level and move on to the next one.-> Overall if you're willing to pay 4.99$ for a game that sort of gets dull in my opinion after 3 hours or maybe even less or more depending on you, go for it, otherwise you could always wait for a sale or a bundle.OR if you have a smart phone I'd really recommend you go buy it there, it would play better since its a casual puzzle game, would be fitting for a phone.

												A puzzle game requiring simple arithmetic. While at first glance it may seem like Yet Another Mobile Game, this is one that really shines on so many levels in so many areas.Its difficulty level is just right, its learning curve is just right, its pacing curve is just right. It's cute, but not overly so, with dark humour, that's not overly dark. Small artistic touches abound wherever you look. The music adds to the mood and never becomes irritating. The tune for the Dark World even made me stop playing for awhile just to properly enjoy it.For me, it was 10 hours of gameplay over 10 or so sittings. I'd feel like stopping after an hour or two, but I'd be left feeling satisfied rather than drained or bored. This is a good game to relax with now and then, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.10/10 highly recommended, except for young kids (due to the visceral deaths). This review really doesn't do the game nearly enough justice, check out the other reviews or go watch a Let's Play.			"

												Stupidly simple. addictive, very funny. It really makes you think about your moves as it slowly adds in more elements. only on 2-6 so far but i find it hard to STOP playing. the puzzles are very clever and well thought out and once you find yourself feeling like you have the answer you realize you made mistake, thankfully it's a little forgiving as there are no move goals. Just 'save' goals and duct tape (when you play you will see what i mean)it controls very well, being originally for ap stores, but works very nicely on here anyways. It also doesnt do any hand holding, just a easy stage for you to get how the new element to the puzzle system works then drops you right back into the brain teasers. Though really, it is not all that hard to understand so long you remember your math. I found myself drawing out the puzzles a couple times on graph paper so i could keep track, but that is jsut cuz i tried to figure it out ahead of time. It's simpler to just figure out on go.the design fits the game itself to. which jsut helps with the fact it makes me laugh a lot as i play. I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS FOR SENSITIVE KIDS...especially those who like sheep...trust me. not for them. good gaame, but 'no sheep were harmed in the marking of this game' should ""apply"" if you get what i mean.worth the buy, especially if you love puzzle games. this one is great and well thought out and very goofy.

												4.3h for all achievements, with 10% of the levels finished with more than my brains... and I admit I'm dumb for the solutions I've watched.One nice little game made for the the brain! The only thing missing is a level editor... but still one ""must have"" in your game library!			"

												Not a particularly challenging puzzle game, with the exception of the last couple of levels and one or two in the middle that left me sctratching my head. It is, however, still satisfying to get 3 stars on each level. (Currently) 120 levels passes a few hours nicely enough. Nothing special but bit of casual fun.			"

												This is a really fun and charming puzzle game. I found some maps (mostly the ending) fairly difficult, but overall with the clear instructions, visually vibrant and different character types and just it's so cute you want to get to the end.It does have a narrative told in splash screens and the occasional cut scene (no dialog needed). My only down side was that for me personally (and this really will be up to the individual) I found that even with the blood setting turned off, the literally divided in half sheep were still a bit too morbid and cringeworthy for me. That said, watch the trailers, if that doesn't bother you, the game is adorable, the achievements are fun to collect and the price is perfect for the amount of content available (5 worlds with 30 puzzles each). Tl;drWould bounce sheep into life rafts for half a day any time.			"

												This is one of the few games I would recommend to anyone.  A fantastic little puzzler with a simple premise and an execution polished to a mirror sheen.  It's got cute colors and a catchy tune while also undercutting that overbearing sweetness with some violence and a quirky, dark story (simply and unobtrusively told through the occasional quick slide show).The puzzles escalate beautifully and, while never holding your hand, the game starts you off extremely simply and takes you through increasingly complicated scenarios until, by the end of the game, you have a complete understanding of everything and are able to utilize the game's weird toolset to your advantage.  The puzzles get quite clever and what may be an obstacle to work around in one level will be made into a vital asset in another, simply as an emergent property of the interaction of simple rulesets.Simply a great puzzle game.

												Note: Review copy received from the developer. They also gave me an iPad key, and that is where most of the time I've spent on the game is.Divide by Sheep is a fantastic puzzle game which requires players to use simple math in sheep's clothing for puzzle solving. Math is a tool, just like in the real world, making it a wonderful educational game, a great way to practice the kind of problem solving that is at the core of mathiness.Although the game is hilarious (cutting sheep into hemispherical halves with their bones showing), it might not be appropriate for all children. Their ""parental control"" setting only removes blood splatters and could easily be turned back on by kids. Use your judgement, parents.If you're not a parent, just enjoy the hilarity.My full preview, to which I had nothing much to add when the game came out, is on  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com].			"

												Quite honestly one of the most unique and best puzzle games I've ever played.  A simple mechanic that is used in lots of different ways and didn't get old at all throughout my playthrough.  I would've loved to see even more levels, since the biggest complaint I have is that sometimes a new mechanic is introduced, and then a few levels later, the game seems done with it already before it was even used much.  Really, though, that's a minor thing, and if you like puzzle games, I doubt you won't like this game.			"

The little sheep and wolfs are so sweet and you even feel guilty killing them for getting the right amount of each of them. The farther you get the more plattforms show up in the different levels. Each plattform has a unique feature that either helps you or make the puzzle more difficult. It will never get boring!			"

												Divide by Sheep is one of the most fun math puzzle games I have played ever since I joined Steam nearly three years ago.The main objective of putting varying amounts of sheep onto the live-saving rafts (and later on even wolves and pigs, all with their own quirks when moving them from island to island) is not as simple as it seems at first. Sure, the start into the game is very commonly done. Easy puzzle first, some jumping about, almost no way of mucking it up.Then come the fences.And the laser barriers.The wolves eating the sheep.Pigs making everything slippery.Islands of varying size not permitting for more than a certain amount of animals to pass.Islands getting blown up when they are left.Tiles that set sheep on fire.And even a big, big, stomping idol that squishes anything in its way.It's hilarious, and it's a fun brain-tease. Let's just hope that Death doesn't make the mistake again to flood the Earth in order to have more friends.			"

												This must be THE cutest and most hilariously jaw-dropping casual puzzle game I have EVER played. Just when I thought the game mechanics couldn't be any more cruel to the sheep, they did with each new world and mechanic. I'm not great at math or anything, but the game was easy enough to complete. And I enjoyed every moment of it down to the short periods of being stuck and the small snippets of story used to introduce new animals, tiles, and tools. Definitely a great grab-and-go game, or just a little time killer. There's even a no-gore mode for kids!!! As if that makes the game any less traumatizing. :P			"

												Very nice puzzle game with 120 different levels (30 levels per theme). A few levels are being used as some sort of tutorial to a new type of enemy or block, but the rest is challenging enough. I do miss some settings (there is only a volume slider), such as the ability to change the resolution, and the menus way too large for PC, but other than that it runs and looks great.			"

												First impression:a casual puzzle game requiring arithmetic in a non-obvious way, but  ultimately boringI'm going to go against the flow of 96% positive reviews here and not recommend this, because after 30 levels I felt bored by it and wasn't motivated to continue. But then I'm no fan of match-3 games either.The one nice thing it does is that it lets you literally divide sheep in half (you can set the amount of gore from the main menu). Other than that, it's a straight-up puzzler that I think of as a ""labyrinth"" game: figure out the correct sequence of actions to reach your goal. Some levels have multiple ways to achieve that, but there's no reward for choosing one over the  other. I should also mention that the difficulty ramps up nice and even over the first 30 levels (of 150), and that new mechanics are introduced with little more than a picture hint and an opportunity for the player to research what they do in the next level (that's good).A small nigle (steam doesn't let me spell this word correctly) I hold against it is that the game seems to favor playing by trial and error: when I want to do it perfectly and figure out a master plan before starting to move the sheep around, the game slows me down by making me do each hop (and animation) separately instead of doing broad sweeps: I wish I could swipe a group of sheep over several hops at once, or maybe swipe a circle on a group of islands and have every group make a hop to the neighboring island. Instead it is hop-wait-hop-wait, and precisely because the game avoids such grander mechanics, it's casual. Oh, and if you didn't turn the music off after 10 minutes I admire your patience. [There's more information on the music in the comments.]I don't regret paying 0.99 for this game (it is 80% off), but I had hoped for something more memorable which it ultimately isn't. Try this one out if you get it in a bundle.			"

more in depth below but to sum it all up: the game is really enjoyable and cute and something worth playing if you like puzzle games, on your phone. on pc it's not as enjoyable, if you don't like straight mobile ports you should stay away from this game, pick it up on mobile instead, thats what i intend to do.but on the otherhand, if you don't care if it looks and plays exactly like a mobile game you should give it a goits clearly made for mobile and i hate mobile ports on pc where they didn't even take the time to make a pc menu, options and controls when they ported it or even when they made it in the first place. just feels lazy imo, pc and mobile are 2 completely different platforms and people have complained about this issue a long time and still devs are making the same mistakes.the ui and menu is the standard mobile menu, its 4 pages of levels and the 5th even says more coming soon and the regular 3 objective 3 stars system on all levels, like i said standard mobile game stuff.there's no menu at all its just the level select and no options just sound sliders when you're in a level.the way you play it is clearly made for mobile too, you click something and drag in the direction you want to shoot it then let go.i breezed through little more almost 1½ page of levels just under an hour with 3 stars on everything. sure some of the levels had some challenge to it but the majority of the game was just about moving them around to one corner so i can move something else out of the way for the first pack to be moved all the way back with the annoying ""click, drag, let go"" controls.with all that said, the game in itself has really cute graphics and the gameplay mechanics where you cut them in half or eat them to get them to match up the right numbers is pretty fun and something i'd actually really enjoy playing on my phone when i'm in the bathroom or got some other down time. sadly i got an android so i have to wait for the android release but as far as the pc version it's a clear refund on my end.

However, I can not recomend anyone to buy this game because the port is just half done. There are no graphic settings (resolution or windowed mode). The in game menus are displayed as in a phone, which does not fell good with mouse and keyboard or on a PC screen.Also there is no steam cloud service, and I discovered that the wrong way.I am tired of having such low quality ports all over steam.

												   I bought Divide by sheep because I thought it would be an ideal game to be played while watching twitch/youtube videos. But unfortunately the developers took the easy way out, and DbS lacks windowed mode and basic resolution options. There is absolutely no need for me to use my whole monitor to play this kind of game. People making mobile ports should try and understand that PC and mobile phones are different platforms and usually have different requirements.   However.. if you don't mind the lack of windowed mode, ignore my mumblings and read the more positive reviews. The game is after all quite adorable.			"

												A mobile port complete with the star ratings and a screen that says ""Rate this App!""Me playing for 20 minutes complete with Lasers.Divide by SheepThe game boils down to saving specific numbers of sheep in order to progress.This can be done by drowning sheep, lasering sheep, or feeding them to rats. I think the novelty wore off for me around the 15 minute mark and never came back. I guess it would be a reasonable way to pass some time on the toilet and at $1 it is not too bad on steam.Just don't expect anything amazing after the game shows you lasered sheep.5.5/10			"

												Your task is to get the required number of sheep/wolves into the life raft at the correct time. Really great at first as it's an inventive puzzle game with a dark sense of humour (e.g. cut sheep in half and reassemble to get your quota). It started to war by the third world and could perhaps have done with greater variation or perhaps a level editor to make your own. I do keep returning to it, but after a few long waits.			"

												This is a puzzle game that, on face value, would be on par with other puzzle games, but unfortunately it's not, and there's a couple of reasons that you should avoid it.Firstly, it's a tablet/mobile game ported to PC.  This is not how things should work - you can lambast me for that opinion if you like, but the facts remain, the PC is a serious gaming platform, not a place for greedy indie devs to try shovel the junk that failed on mobile to try scrape through a few extra bucks.Secondly, no game should ever, EVER give you a Facebook icon.   I think people like gaming for reasons other than ""So Facebook can harvest my data even more, I enjoy having my privacy invaded.""			"

												Think ""Angry Birds"" - but without snapping catapults casually but doing very hard brain bogglers instead for half an hour without any hints or help. An explanation/tutorial what does what is basiclly non-existant, if something new is introduced in a level, you usually have to fail the level once just trying to figure out what it does (and sometimes it doesn't make sense, like the ""split-jump-pads"" that always shoot a single sheep into the same direction instead of randomly to the left and right). It also doesn't make sense that you're not rewarded if you save all sheep without sacrifycing any. The music - it's upright annoying, it's like a 30 second-loop, repeated over and over again. Play the game for two hours, and you will want to kill the composer. But most of all, the game is not FUN. It doesn't have the slightest surprising moments, it never makes you laugh because something unexpected ot ""cute"" happened. And even the intro movie (which is poorly executed) with death wanting some sheep companion doesn't make sense and isn't fun.			"

												Picked this up cheap because of the name, expected to have a 20 minute play around and never touch it again, but found it really compelling to play through. Throws a new mechanic at you every 15 levels or so to stop it getting stale, but you never abandon any of them so by the end it's quite complex. Couple of levels I found way harder than I should have, but it was always something that seemed obvious in hindsight, which I think it the mark of a solid puzzle.Biggest issue I had was no windowed mode, as it's the sort of game I like having video's playing while I'm on with it			"

												If I really like the concept behind the puzzles, and the cutesy art that goes with it, and even if it's a pc port that works rather well thanks to its simple controls, there's still some small issues with this game:   - Not being able to choose a windowed mode is kinda sucky. I personally like to play this kind of games and watch a video at the same time. It should be an option.  - In 3 puzzles, some moves are bugged. In two of them (spring-12 and another one I can't remember, and checking quickly each puzzles make the game crash so I gave up), containing pigs, the pigs are not properly eliminated by the sheeps, they stay on their zone while the supernumerary sheeps that should overtake them take the plunge instead. The third one, containing a small platform on the lower right side of the screen, you can't jump from the central platform to that small one. I'm pretty sure it's not me making mistakes, since I've finished all the puzzles with 3 stars (even those ones, I took what was ""the"" correct route afterwards, I guess).Still, I had fun with it, and it was a good challenge that didn't frustrate me to the point I'd just give up entirely.

												(This Review was orginally published on Gamegrin.com at http://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/divide-by-sheep-review/)The story behind Divide by Sheep is total whimsy. Death is a lonely little soul with a sheep fetish (maybe he’s from Buxton, I don’t know), he just loves those wooly little ruminants. Being an anthropomorphic personification of the slide into decrepitude and the inevitable surcease of life, he can only be friendly with dead things. As a result and in a leap of somewhat startlingly stark logic, he decides to kill everything. In a flood. Old Testament style. Sploosh.Now this is where you come in, it’s your task to float the little darlings on to rafts and rescue them from his bony clutches. So far so simple, but wait, they are on islands, and some islands only hold so many sheep. If you get them to jump from an island that can hold, say seven sheep onto one holding only four, three of them will drown and spent eternity as the grim reapers fluffy playthings! Ah well, them’s the breaks. Of course, just like islands, some rafts can only hold so many sheep, so you will have to strategically drown some of them anyway just to get to the end of the level.And so it goes, sheep drown, sheep live, and as the game progresses you get to slice them in half with lasers (they get duct taped back together on the raft, don’t worry), bounce them off trampolines, and feed them to wolves. Of course, wolves need rescuing too, so them too get to bounce about like little black motes of soot. A fed wolf can’t bounce as that would cause nasty vomitory complications so they just sit there looking happy while the raft floats off into the sunset. While you tax your brain trying to work out how to meet all three victory conditions for the level or at least one of them so you can move on and see what devilry has been set in store for you next.Visually, this game screams out what it is, a mobile game that has come to Steam. With blocky, voxel style graphics, cutesy sounds and music, and a user interface that screams out “I was on an iPhone” in a loud squeaky voice.None of this detracts from the inherent addictiveness of flinging sheep at laser beams, fences and the occasional kraken however, in fact it enhances the dark comedic nature of the game and has you giggling at the animated cut-scenes that explain the latest twist to the game play with visuals of bisected ruminants, flying ungulates, and snapping canidae.On the whole, Divide by Sheep is a cute, enjoyable, darkly comedic time sucker of a game. It has a real “one more level” appeal to it that has had me sit to play it, and then wonder why my freshly made coffee is now cold on more than one occasion. tinyBUILD have made a bit of a corker here, and it’s well worth the 4 quid it costs on Steam			"

												Divide by Sheep is a nice logical game with elements of brutality towards animals. Death was lonely. Who wouldn't be (I know thousands of people die every day. But really - people are boring)? So he decides to have some animals dead to have some friends. Players goal is to deliver exact amount of animals (Sheeps, Wolves or Pigs) to the raft. To do it, player has to move groups of animals between islands, increasing or decreasing (mostly by drowning) groups to make them fit into the raft. There are many types of islands, eg. ones that swap places of groups without them killing each other, there are lasers that work only on sheeps - they cut them in half, so you need two squares per helf of the sheep, and you need to deliver any 2 parts of the sheep to the raft. There are few more blocks, but these are just examples. Each animal have different relationship towards the others - Wolves eat sheep, pigs always kick their groups amount of animals from the island they land on and so on. Later in game there are more raft types; not only you have to deliver few animal types, but you have also ones that require you to kill specified amount of any animal, or deliver exact amount of any animals to the giant squid. Overally, this is a good game. Sure it gets hard sometines, but that's the charm of all logical games. With 150 levels aviable, it's a lot you get for 5 euro.			"

												a cool puzzle game where you have to divide stacks of sheep and other creatures (sometimes literally, with lasers) and get the required number to the lifeboats. there are 150 levels in 5 worlds and simply completing them by getting any of the 3 stacks right is pretty easy, but there are a few where getting 3 stars is tricky, I had to look a few of them up myself.I turned off the music not too far into the game, not for me, but the graphics are charming and gory at the same time (there's an option to turn off blood) and there's also a decent amount of variety between the worlds, new mechanics are introduced at a good pace, like different animals, blocks, traps, winning conditions, etc. it's clearly a mobile port with zero extra effort put into the pc version, it even has a 'rate this app' screen, but separate volume sliders are always welcome and the only real negative I can think of is the lack of windowed mode. it's a must for a puzzle game like this, but I'd still recommend picking it up, either on sale (wouldn't want to encourage lazy game development too much) or on mobile if that's your thing.

												Fun puzzle game. I love torturing the sheep. Cons:No steam Cloud support for the game. Promised last year but not delivered. Save file is literally just on one PC.Recommendation: If you buy and want to switch computers, make sure you know where the save file is and copy it to your new pc. Otherwise, you will have to start completely over. Honestly, the games not really that hard. Should be no problem to 100% the achievements.			"

												Who said sheeps are always innocent? Divide by Sheep proves that not every sheep is as innocent as the German proverb 'I am innocent like a sheep' says.The goal of this puzzle game is sending the exact amount of sheeps to the life boat which is given at the start of each level. This is done by using the platforms the wooly animals are standing on and ""shooting"" them to neighbouring ones. However if the number of sheeps exceeds the space on the platforms, you can watch some sheeps taking a dive into the water. But ofcourse sheeps aren't the only characters you need to complete each level: as soon as you think that you get the gist of this ""easy"" game, you will meet pigs, wolfs and painful-sheep cutting lasers as well as other mechanis to not only fill life boats but also the ride of the grim reaper.This game is a good way to get your logical thinking going, if you try to get a perfect completion on every single level. For people who aren't aversed to puzzle games that are repetitive in its main goal and are looking for a time killing challenge, Divide by Sheep is definitely a good game to get their brain cells going without having to rage quit too much. (Better get it on a sale, if you have a chance. Else it might hit the limit you might be willing to offer for a puzzle game you can only complete once without losing the fun)People who are more disdained to repetitive game play or are expecting a big complex story should probably avoid it.

												One of the best puzzle games I played this year.In my opinion it's not a pure math puzzler like other games like Hexcell or Knight. Divide by Sheep has plenty of mechanisms that are more relevant to logic (wolves eating sheeps then blocking cells, pigs taking priority over sheeps, lasers cutting sheeps in half but not wolves, switching platforms, triggered burners, portals, and so on..). Each element appears around every 10 levels, which makes the game never boring and always fun all along the 150 levels.The longevity is very good, it took me 18h to complete the 150 levels at 100%, which make an average of 7mn per level, please note that I'm very slow, and that around 20% of the levels can be solved in less than 2mn, while some other ones can easily take more than 10mn. One very good point is that the difficulty is not increasing continuously like in most puzzlers, instead, some levels are sometimes more easy than the previous ones, and I never been stuck or felt frustrated. Knowing that the next level can be easier is very motivating. When finishing the game you will be granted with a 100% achievement.Apart from that, the graphic design is a total success with its colorfull look, animations are smooth and very fun, maybe one bad point is that the screen resolution is locked, but it's really not a problem. The game is also divided in 5 worlds, each one with his own graphic design, mechanisms and music soundtrack (variations on the main theme). The game was made with Adobe Air (which is a very solid engine for such games), and it was designed first for touchscreen (I imagine that a tablet version should exist, I didn't check), but works perfectly with the mouse as well. There is also a parental lock if you want to remove the gore and let your 5yo kid play (it's a fun game for kids too).If you're into puzzle games, don't hesitate one second.9/10			"

												a very well made math-based puzzle game, with really cute, beautiful graphics, and nice relaxing music to calm your nerves, as you move sheeps and pigs and wolves around, slicing them up, burning them up, and even blowing them up, just to satisfy the count necessary to clear stages.all that being said though, some puzzles do get tricky, and requires quite a bit of brainwork (or at least some trial and error) to get past. although i never did try it with parental controls on, i reckon, it could be fun for kids too.
