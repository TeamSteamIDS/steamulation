												First, let's talk about Steam release.This compilation includes the original 2 games of the series. You may seen other games which have numbering from 3 to 7, but those were made by other publishers and aren't exactly official, from what I know. (Most of them are quite ugly and didn't bring any evolution/revolution to the formula of the first game)This Steam release is a simple and flat ""put game as is"". This can be blamed on that new publishers have no access to the source port or other materials. Thus you will not find any trading cards, achievements, widescreen or any optimisation at all, not even Steam Overlay work in this one. On good side, the game should still work on modern computers.Now the games themselves:Neighbours From Hell 1 is point'n'click quest in which you control Woody as you make him sneak around the house, avoiding being seen by Mr. Rottweiler, and make traps, which usually involes first collecting an item in the house and then applying them to the object in house. Some traps may lead neighbour to another nasty trap. Oh, and tip-toeing around Neighbour's pets.Beating the game by getting minium requeirement of traps is quite easy. Beating it by finding and applying every trap in every level is simple as well.But what make the game the real crunchy puzzler is getting 100% rating on each level. To do this you are required not only to make use of every trap, but to make sure that Mr. Rottweiler get in as many of them in a row before he cools off from previous trap, resulting in him breaking down on each new one (with animation of him almost breaking his back). The timing, order of tricks and placement of traps which can be put in any room (items like marbles) to connect faraway traps is everything there, making you actually think and plan there.The second game then takes place outside of house on various exotic locations. Sneaking is no more, gone are guardian pets. System of multiple lifes were added, so you aren't immeditly screwed when Neighbour sees you for the first time. And this time your life is made harder by a sudden appearance of mom of out bully, who keeps an eye and fists for you as well. Shame that she mostly spends her time either sleeping or shopping.This time around getting the golden statue, which is equalient to what 100% rating was in the first game, is much easier, as Neighbour rage now stores on a meter that can stack ""breakdowns"" from other tricks and it cools down much slower. So it's a simply matter of making trap ahead of neighbour path non-stop, with no real thinking. Instead the game concentrates more on the figuring out tricks themselves and their activating, with some tricks working as part of ""combo"". Still, no real puzzle.Now, the games are overall quite fun, with great music which fits to the game goodly and the joyful graphics that use prerendered 3D assets, which are greatly animated. It especially shows with a cartoony characters that the second game is full with. My only complaints would be same repeating breakdown animation for Mr. Rottwell in the first game, which was varied nicely in sequel, and how underplayed neighbour's mom is in Vacations, who could be less passive.OH, and one of more important things: If you are fan of the slapstick humor (and slightly black one), then I am sure that you will be holding for your belly in this game from laughter.

Neighbours from Hell Compilation is a collection of short adventure/time management games - Neighbours from Hell and Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation - developed and produced by JoWooD in 2003-2004. They are the kind of perfectly silly games that you'd try during an initially boring afternoon with a mischievous smirk on the corner of your mouth.Meet Woody, our main character, who has sworn to make every living moment hell for his despicable neighbor, Mr. Rottweiler in a 2D animated fashion. The whole concept of the game is based on a sitcom: cameras do follow Woody as he sneaks around to play juvenile tricks in ACME quality - like setting a banana peel on a slippery surface, drawing funny faces on family portraits or changing the coffee in your neighbor's pot with compost - on his nasty neighbor and dabble with which actually shouldn't concern him. On that manner, Woody is basically a human version of Bugs Bunny in plastic animations.The second instalment of the series is basically same, with some more characters, a different environment and mini games thrown around. This time, Woody follows his neighbor to his vacation spots to show some personal attachment. Is he obsessive, or what? Oh, and Woody has given 3 chances to complete his series of trickeries before his neighbor catches him this time. Graphics are slightly better, yet the main idea is same.In each episode of the show, you are given 5-7 minutes to follow your neighbor's pattern for the episode, discover and initiate a series of crude jokes and traps for him to fall for while avoiding getting caught sneaking around. The more you manage to lay the outcome of your tricks in short periods between, the better rating you get for the given episode - so your poor neighbor wouldn't recover from the joke before and lose his temper to display funnier poises.Neighbours from Hell is a cute, yet not very imaginative game with crass jokes. The concept is interesting, yet it is not particularly funny. Once you complete each episode with 100% rating, - which is real easy if you follow the patterns - there is no replay value at all. Go for it when it's on discount, and either spare a lazy afternoon to try and enjoy it or offer the idea to your kids in case you have any. Do I recommend it? Well, not particularly good but, hey! At least it's kid friendly... if your kid is into ACME humor, that is.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Sometimes you can look at the image for a game and know that it is not worth playing. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I received it in a Humble Bundle, and initially dismissed it. But when I actually played it, I found it enjoyable (despite the corny canned laughter/old graphics/sadistic torture.) Pulling prank after prank on your neighbour is not only satisfying but it's actually funny to watch. If you can pick this game up cheap, do it.			"

												Neighbours from Hell is one of my favorite childhood games. It's pretty simple - set up traps to annoy your grumpy neighbours. There are plenty of traps and all of them are quite funny. This is one of the games that you must play in order to like it, because at first you might think that it's not a good game until you play it. Only negative thing about this game, is that Steam overlay does not work in game, which sometimes might be a bit annoying. You'll also get Neighours from Hell 2 which adds plenty of fun levels.			"

												This game takes me back to the times in which originality was way more common in the gaming industry. Trying to come up with something new was the purpose of most of most of the studios and a way to get quickly noticed. It's a small and fun game which I recommend to anybody as it can be played by both children and adults. You can easily spend from 10-15 minutes just completing an episode, having a quick laugh. It's not a long game, it can be completed in a few houres, depending on how fast you learn the pranks in order to get a high audience. If you enjoy this and carve for more, don't forget the sequel is also on steam and it's pretty much the same thing but a bit better.			"

												I played the hell out of this game 10 years ago with my brother. We spent hundreds of hours on it. Lots of fun, it was one of the very few light hearted games we could play together.Okay I admit now that I'm replaying this game, I feel it's a bit lame and not as great as before but still, it was a super awesome game back then.The teenager-me would rate this game 11/10 but let's be realistic rather than just nostalgic.7.5/10			"

Pranks, fun, laughs, farts and pwns for only 9.99 bucks. This game it's like if you change to a world in which is 1th April every day.I remember way back getting into the disc boxes of my father and catch the demo of this gem for the first time. This is a really genuine game that surprised me on my childhood. I remember to play the demo over and over because there was no way to get this game from a retailer near my old home. In this game you play as a charismatic dude that needs to annoy his neighbors in the most humiliating ways possible. It take me a smile every time I hear the old dude screams. The game puts the player in a live-show at the shows of Paul. The star of the show and the one that needs to humiliate his pals on live-cam. It's just hilarious.This comedy is worth a try, no matter how old you are, this game will steal a laugh from your soul. Sometimes you need to annoy the old dude by putting soap into his bathroom floor, or maybe a dynamite on his birthday cake. The possibilities are limited, but the combinations are up to the player. It is the same thing always, the old dude gets humiliated, but the way in which the actions are performed is up to the player. Sometimes in bizarre ways, sometimes in really weird ways, but he always gift the player his screams. This is a game which you play by point and click objects. You have a scene in 2D and the player needs to search for objects around the area to interact with other objects, and perform an action. This action is to humiliate specific npcs in the game. But generally the old dude is the one that gets all the tragedy. Anyways, the game also allows the player to hide, because if the old dude, or another ""rival"" npc discover you in-fraganti. He or she pwns you on live cam. There is a score for each level. You get a percentage depending on how bad you humiliated the target. The player also gets a bar in which counts how many times you got the target beyond the line of awkward fury. The old dude gets his back hurt every time the player makes him really mad. Also, the player can combine the actions to make the target in constant madness.It is a really hilarious game and it is really fun. It is super old, but still is amazing today. Look at the trailer to see more about this game. It really worth a try.			"

												This game is simple at its core. Basically, you play as Woody, who takes it upon himself to make life hell for his neighbour. You do this by sneaking into his house (each ""episode"" or sequence of tricks starts inside the neighbour's house) and playing tricks on him, which can vary from putting shoe polish on his bath towel to using paint remover on a painting, to even something as simple as placing an egg in his microwave.It's a very simple game, but very fun.This game is part of a 2-pack, released on Steam via Greenlight. The game itself was released in 2003/4.			"

The levels are short and funny as hell (pun intended :) ) and the game requires a bit of effort on the intelectual side if you want to achieve perfect score and such. I know I don't have many hours on the game on steam but that's because I already finished it several times in the past and this copy came from a bundle :). If you like comedy I do recommend buying the game because you will have a laugh and let your inner kid out :) . Some who are more picky might want to wait for a sale though.			"

												I enjoyed this game a great deal more than I expected to. The play is about like this: roam through a level looking for items you can pick up and/or alter, getting a feel for the neighbors routine, setting up the jokes to verify you have them all, then maybe another play through to get the timing right for maximum impact. If you don't care about top ratings on the levels the both games can be completed in well 7-8 hours, however going for the top ratings will almost double that time.			"

												A very amusing, quirky little game. It reminds me a little of a crossover between a prank show and a sitcom. You spend the entire game making your neighbour's life hell by playing pranks on him. This can range from disabling his washing machine to sawing the legs off his sofa. You get higher scores by forming a chain of incidents together. His blood pressure increases to the point that he almost falls over hehe.There are only three seasons of the show which took me a total of five hours to finish but its dirt cheap and comes in a pack with the next title. A fun comedic game that gives a good many laughs for a modest price. Worth picking up.			"

Not ""good BUT 2d"", but ""good AND 2d"" if you know what I mean. If you don't know you're too young, well, 3d is not equal to visual beauty all the time and 2d is just ""old"" not necessarily ugly or bad. This game proves it. Additionally, it has a very original gameplay if you're sick of RTS RPG FPS.    I still recommand this game.			"

												Neighbors From Hell! A charming point and click game which, also happens to be one of my favorite game genres.To start off this review lets take  a look at the concept of this game. You play as Woody, a content young fellow who is terrorized by his dispicable neighbor Mr. Rottweiler. You start to skulk around his house as the star of a T.V show. Your job is to set up traps in his house to terrorize Mr. Rottweiler and enact your revenge. One of the things that I love about this game is the creativity of the traps and the strategy that's behind them. A lot of the traps in this game are clever and took me a while to figure out. Timing also plays a huge role, especially if you want a percentage of over 90% (Like me). It really does keep you on your feet as you have to be aware of Mr. Rottweiler. Also, there are no lives in this game. If you're caught, you have to restart the whole level. While these aspects have drawn me towards loving the game, there are some factors I can't stand. Mainly the immature humor. Now, listen. If done correctly, immature humor can trigger a laugh here and there but, in this game it feels a tad bit forced and monotonous. It doesn't ruin the entire gaming experience but, it's there and it does annoy me when I see it.Overall, I do reccomend this game. If you're like me and you're a huge fan of Strategy/Point and Clicks, you'll find enjoyment from this game right away. "

												I'm surprised, when I see this games available on Steam.Best games ever played when childhood.WHY ?Simply, you (as Woody) just set up traps for Mr. Rottweiler (The Neighbours) and make his life in hell !Easy, just control it with mouse to beat this game.Funny, when you see all traps work like a charm.

												My oh my, the feels!The second I saw this game on Steam, I couldn't resist buying it. And let me tell you, I don't regret a single second. Not only because it's always been a great game, but it was also ten times cheaper than the time I searched through every single video game aisle of each store in a gargantuan mall as a kid, just to find this game. It amazes me to see how this game can still be enjoyable after 13 years. The nostalgia I felt as I stepped into Rottweiler's home to give him hell... GOOSEBUMPS!All those feelings aside, even if you've never played this game as a kid, even if you're lacking the element of nostalgia, I'd say this game still is pretty fun. If you would enjoy a good ol' slapstick/physical comedy filled game, that is. Then I'd definitely recommend you to buy this game.			"

												I've played Neighbours from Hell back when it was released, or not long after that time.It's not a big game nor a big series but it is actually very good.I've finished both first games back then, I intend to play them again on Steam.I know that there are some other games after the second, but they're not from the same developer, and they look pretty bad, they don't have the same feeling, after playing the first and second game, you'll understand what I'm talking about.It's not the funniest thing ever, nor the greatest game ever but it's fun.If you're looking for a short, relaxing and fun game, this is for you.If you're looking for a big game to spend many hours on or even something challenging, then this is not for you but I would still suggest you to try it, even if it is short and pretty easy, it's pretty cool, it's not a big game, of course so don't except a game that you will play, again, again and again but it sure is a fun game that can be played once or twice in a while.8/10 for both games, both are special in my opinion and the developer should think about making more.

												Let me ask you a question.  Do you have neighbours? And do you have a particular type of a neighbour, that annoying and upleasant type, who rants because your parking is too noisy and your TV is too loud, but he hosts parties and kicks you in the face when you tell him to tone the music down? And have you ever dreamed about revenge? Ever thought about  breaking into his house and making his life as miserable as possible? Well now you can, at least in this classic title(s) by JoWood. Take the role of Woody, a young happy guy, who enlisted for a reality show about taking revenge on his annoying neighbour. Many people are confused about the genre of the game, I'd describe it as a stealth puzzle adventure. Check situation, do pranks, don't let him catch you. Sounds simple, but some levels are really challenging, and getting 100% score on each level is much harder than the casual and childlike look of the game would suggest. Both titles (NfH1 and NfH2) are tons of fun, challenging and enjoyable, and I recommend them to anybody who likes adventure/stealth games or just enjoys taking revenge on annoying neighbours.			"

												Neighbours from Hell, and its sequel, are a fun distraction for a few hours. The games essentially revolve around playing tricks on your neighbour, and navigating various obstacles while trying to avoid getting caught.Its not particularly challenging (although aspects of the chaining and timing of tricks can be a little complex if you're going for perfection), but it will keep you entertained for a handful of hours.Recommended on sale, or if you have kids and want to keep them amused.

												A cult classic from the oldies. This is a two-pack of short puzzle games, basically about playing pranks on your bad neighbour. The games are short and only mildly challenging. But it is a lot of fun and a decent 10-15 minutes time waster per stage. PS Don't skip on the credits when you finish Neighbours From Hell 2, there are some bonus caricatures of the early 'prototype' neighbour.			"

And that's how you do it!I could not believe there is still Neighbors from Hell (Böse Nachbarn in german) available, I played some years ago a game that was a good follow up on this concept and, damn if that game would debut on Steam it will be an instant buy. The game was Prank TV... sadly, I don't believe that this game still exists.The game is a classic casual game about pranks, and not getting caught pranking a really rotten apple of neighbor... Meet Mr. Rottweil (well, I just hope that no poor dog of the same race will be harmed by this game) a bad mooded, rotten and foulmouthed stinker in your neighborhood... He did several very, very bad things - like biting a neighbors dog, and now Wally is in for Revenge...You have to study his movement patterns to prank him with the highest rate of efficiency... and see him go balistic, well in pranking I am more the kind of George Hayduke type of pranker - if it doesn't hurt it's not a prank at all... So I am going very sympathetic with... Wally... of course.The game should be played as a casual game, and like good wine it should be savoured... don't play all episodes in one  run, it will destroy the experience and you will be missing a lot of those two games - especially the fun. Try to manage 100 % even though it's not required... but then again, it's fun... The game has some good 2D artworks, for a low budget game (even as it was created, it was low budget... I still have my original CDs in my archive...) some of the artworks might remind players to a famous comic artist out of north germany, responsible for commercial design of a gas company and... of course his own trademark... which already was theme of five regional very sucessful movies. Well, plumbers have their ways... don't they?			"

The whole concept of playing pranks on the terrible neighbour is great, from planning the tricks, to watching the neighbour's reactions. The only thing was that some pranks got repeated so many times it wasn't funny anymore, like the egg in the microwave one. But overall this game is fun and hillarious. Would recccomend.			"

The programm will be terminated.

PROS:+ nice art style+ original theme+ prank combinations and timingCONS:- very short game time- mostly ""kiddie"" jokes- no replay value- mini-games in NFH2Comment:I have finished the first game in just under 5 hours to 100% it in all levels. The same goes for the second game with the exact same game time. The art style is cartoonish/clay and fits with the theme of the game - TV show about pranks. I have to give it that it is original in it's concept, but that is about it for being special. The jokes are really focused for chlidren so as such I might not be the best reviewer. I found them okay at best but mostly they were simply not funny. The second game in particular is a bit tedious with the mini-games. After doing a level perfectly (which is easy in most levels) there is no point of playing it ever again. Overall both games are okay but mostly for people that like (corny) pranks a lot. I recommend getting it during a sale.			"

												This is the worst game I've played in quite a while.  The idea is that you have to sneak around your neighbor's house and prank him.  Yup, that's it.Pros:-Can't think of anyCons:-Overly simplistic.  You just click on stuff in the house to ruin it.-Very repetitive.  Not only are the missions all basically the same, but every time the neighbor catches you, you have to redo everything you've already done in that mission.  To beat a mission, you basically need to turn it into a ""speed run"" where you do everything in a certain sequence and timing.-Overly linear.  There's no creativity in the pranks.  You have to use specific objects on specific objects like a point and click game.  All the pranks are totally ""pre-cooked.""-Poor controls.  The whole game's challenge hinges on not getting caught, but the UI makes this frustrating rather than challenging.-The main character seems like a total♥♥♥♥♥♥  Why am I repeatedly pranking my sad, lonely neighbor in his own home?

												I have played the Neighbors from Hell compilation (which my family still calls ""Neighbors from Bleep"") a lot of times and enjoyed it when I was little. It has some problem solving to prank the neighbor. It is sort of a television show setting. To advance, you need to play all of the pranks. The compilation comes with ""Neighbours from Hell"" and ""Neighbours from Hell 2: on Vacation."" Both are built well and you can tell there was a couple years in between the release of one and two. When I found it on Steam, I had a HUGE feel of Nostalgia. Then, I took it upon myself to buy it. I still have the original copies, but they won't work on my computer from how old they are. Anyways, the game structures are nice. The puzzles aren't too hard to solve in the first. The puzzles are more difficult in the second. This game is a TON of fun. It is quite nice to have this game on steam now for more people to discuss.			"

												I have played the Neighbors from Hell compilation (which my family still calls ""Neighbors from Bleep"") a lot of times and enjoyed it when I was little. It has some problem solving to prank the neighbor. It is sort of a television show setting. To advance, you need to play all of the pranks. The compilation comes with ""Neighbours from Hell"" and ""Neighbours from Hell 2: on Vacation."" Both are built well and you can tell there was a couple years in between the release of one and two. When I found it on Steam, I had a HUGE feel of Nostalgia. Then, I took it upon myself to buy it. I still have the original copies, but they won't work on my computer from how old they are. Anyways, the game structures are nice. The puzzles aren't too hard to solve in the first. The puzzles are more difficult in the second. This game is a TON of fun. It is quite nice to have this game on steam now for more people to discuss.			"

												That game would probably be the ""Call of Duty MW"" of point & click adventures.First installment was fresh, action-paced experience. The second has expanded on the original idea.All further releases (generally, from russian copycat studios) have gradually turned the experience into♥♥♥♥♥♥I think, to this day the game, both visually and gameplay-wise, still holds up.

												Just before anybody says anything, YES, i know i only have 12 minutes played on this game, and YES, i have completed it. I got this game in a bundle before it was greenlit, as have a lot of people, but i played and completed it before it was released on steam, but i still added the key that i got after steam release. That aside, I enjoyed the game, took me about 6 hours to complete, as at first it took a while to figure out what needed to be done, and where to put what, etc etc. The game is short and sweet, the modes are hilarious, and you get so much satisfaction causing your poor neighbour pain and discomfort. 100% worth a play and it wont break the bank either. 9/10			"

												Neighbours from Hell is a classic point and click comedy game inwhich you take the role of a vengeful neighbour looking to get his own back against his vulgar neighbour who lives next door to him.Neighbours from Hell is a short and sweet game, if you want to pass the time without struggle or worry, with around 20 levels or so to keep you entertained. The base of the game is to explore your neighbours house for items and such you can use to pull off traps and pranks against your unsuspecting neighbour who fall right into them, the more you do this, the more his rage bar fills and if you can hit the limit, he'll blow a fuse and have a mini breakdown! Do this constantly for a nice combo and earn a higher rating on every level. Later levels get significantly more challenging as you'll eventually utilize stealth in order to sneak past your neighbours howling pets and unlock more rooms of the house to deal more cruel tricks and traps. It's pretty much as simple as that, it's a slapstick comedy game inwhich you play as a good guy turned cruel as your humilate, torture and prank your horrible neighbour...Now if only I could do this in real life against my vile neighbour...A classic and simple little game that I'd rate a solid 4/10.
