												I went into this knowing full well what I was walking into. If you've played Still Life, Art of Murder or Sherlock Holmes you know what kind of game this is. It's a casual puzzle game with story enough to make you want to see what happens. This isn't a game you want if you are a die hard on graphic quality. I would recommend this game to anyone just looking for a game to pass the time with.			"

												This game is a prequel to the “Dracula: Love Kills” (although “Love Kills” start contradicts the “Origin's” ending). “Dracula: Origin” has a rather beautiful design and interesting story with some nice variations of the classic Stoker's novel, although I felt a bit bored in the beginning and, at one point, thought of quitting the game completely.As to the puzzles, they are either too simple, or too difficult and rely heavily on trial and error and dialogue re-reading, which I personally found unconventional and inconvenient.Also, it's easy to miss items, leading you to often re-visiting of the same spots and circling around, moving the cursor carefully across the screen.As many of the puzzles do not follow a straightforward one path logic or any logic at all, this walkthough guide is highly recommended to save time and avoid frustration: http://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcDd/draculaorigin.htmI played it for the story anyway. Not the best puzzles and clues in the genre.My overall rating: 6/10. The sequel is much better.			"

												Such a bad, borring game.It's a straight forward point-and-click adventure game, but the puzzles are easy for the player to figure out; at least they are when the obvious solution actualy works.For example, you can't enter an area because it's dark. *use matches on lantern* Nope.*Use lantern on matches* Nope*Use lantern on dark cave entrance* NopeThe correct option is to light the matches and drop the lit pack at the entrance. Because ligthing all your matches and leaving them in a burning pile at the door makes perfect sense when you have a lantern.The other problem is that you will figure out the puzzle and the solution to whatever your doing before your character does. If you don't scrape away every pixel from that tombstone, he won't read it and if you enter the answer to the riddle yourself it just won't work. The player character is dumber than you, and you're not allowed to play smart.I paid about 99 cents for this game and still feel ripped off.			"

												Dracula Origin is a decent puzzle game.  Buy it on sale or in a bundle.  USE SPACE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN CLICK.  The game nowhere I could find tells you to use space to see what objects are interactive.  Once I figured this out the game got a lot more fun.  Some of the puzzles are fairly easy, some are quite diffiuclt, and one in particular is just insane.  I used a walktrhough for the last puzzle mentioned.  The graphics are decent and the interface is passable yet clunky and confusing at times.  Some of the puzzles use items in ways that nobody in the real world would ever use them.  Using a dead badger carcass as a wine tube for instance.  Sometimes I felt somewhat angry because logic went out the window on a few of the puzzles.  Being made to click through every item in your inventory to find the right one gets old real fast, especially when a more obvious choice is in your inventory.  Hrmmm...should I use the sword to break the lock or the throat lozenge?  Yeah that's right...the throat lozenge.......OVERALL:  5.5/10			"

												I didn't have to force myself to finish this game like I find myself doing with many adventure games. Something new was always going on and nothing felt redundant or stale. The puzzles in this game are good and makes sense. With enough hunting of clues, you can solve them. I recommend it for those who enjoy puzzle adventure games!			"

												Dracula Origin for me presented an interesting and enjoyable story in settings that varied greatly and  where both interesting to explore and well designed. The puzzels presented within Dracula vary in difficulty and complexity and the style of them also changes depending on the location you are in, this is a nice touch and keeps the game moving and engaging for the around 2 - 3 hours you are in a certain area. The story within the game follows a rather cliche plot, and ends abruptly however its enough to keep you going, however for an adventure game where story is usually a mian factor it is a bit of a let down. The sound design is great, with different background music  playing in different areas and ambient noise creating a creepy atmosphere which suits the overall theme of the game.  Overall Dracula Origin is a well designed adventure game and did as a whole keep me interested, I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a casual adventure game that does not last to long but overall tells a short creepy story with clever puzzels. For me $10 is a good price for fun experience you will get, however if you are not that into adventure games I would recommend waiting for a sale.  Overall 8/10. "

												Hell,I love this game!!!!Has hidden objects & really works my mind. It's nothing like those stupid games on Pogo.com my mother trys to get me to play. I really enjoyed this game & it's also goes with the few games that actually keeps my attention & interest well enough to play it all the way through.I've been playing games since a kid when Nintendo, Segs Dreamcast, even Atari came out on Doctors recomendations due to a consitration & focusing problem I have.So, even as a 37 year old it's still hard to find games to help with those problems when they actually can't keep your interest long enough.I will recommend this game especially for those who have the same problems I do.

												Good point and click adventure game.  Puzzles were challenging, the voice acting was decent, the atmosphere was perfect for a gothic vampire theme.  I appreciated how the puzzles reflected the game and weren't stand alone like in many other games; for example, you had to figure out the demons from normal animals or puzzles relating to dark arts.  The music was okay, it got a little repetitive when trying to figure out a puzzle.  My only complaint is I think they took out the see through top of the succubus from this game.  You can find it in a couple of screenshots, but after playing the game recently I think they just zoomed in on her face for that particular scene.  I was waiting to screenshot it myself! Censorship is kind of annoying.   The story was great too adding to the historical lore of Dracula in detail. Overall 7.5/10			"

												A 3D point and click game.Despite looking graphicly ok and sounding pretty decent, the experience of the game is lacking.The gameplay seems really dull when it comes to horror and action which is surprising when it has dracula in the title. You know the Daddy of all vampires, the guy who's supposed to be one mean scary creature of the night who will tear you a new one! yeah that guy's no where to be seen D:In fact it is the total opposite, you do not see dracula at all after the opening of the game until the very end. For the action and horror situations throughout the game, you say? Get about the same result from watching a lone goldfish in a small fish bowl. This game would struggle to scare a small child.Genral gameplay, however  is pretty good. The controlls are smooth and the interface is simple.The game also does have good challanging puzzles amongst some what good graphics and sounds, but this is not suppose to be just a puzzle game.Overall the game is dull and boring but has tough puzzles.so if your looking for a tough puzzle game, forget about buying that 2000 jigsaw of fruit in a bowl from amazon, waste your money on this game.  It will be about as boring and dull but you don't have to pick up all pieces when you give up 10 mintues in.  1/10 - it did manage to trick me into buying it so ill give it that.			"

												There is a number of problems with this game.First off, a thing many adventures used to pull in earlier times, the ""click every single corner of the map to find a miniscule object"". The moody pallete of the game, although good for the feeling of the source material, makes this even worse. A black veil on top of a tomb that could have been an aristic depiction of shadow? A metallic grey pulley in the ceiling with grey cinder blocks in the background. Yeah, not a lot of fun having to resort to a walkthrough to find those.The puzzles overall are good and the game's strongest point, although be warned it is old-school. You will find no instructions, hints or a skip button. It is up to you to decide if this is your thing or not. Personally I feel like that some puzzles would need at least some form of hint from the protagonist (e.g. the pentagram puzzle).The atmosphere is hit and miss, with the Cairo music being probably the worst. Even worse and probably the worse part of the game excluding ""hidden objects"" is some of the interactions. Need water that hasn't touched the ground? Just take some from a trough and boil it. Throw a jar of bugs at a bug-eating minion that ignores you completely might sound weird but can be explained to morality, if only you didn't set another minion ablaze later. Make a key out of a strange goo (don't ask) and pretzels in front of the innkeeper you want to trick and he is none the wiser or use a dead beaver as part of a funnel system. And the list of absurd interactions goes on.Unless it comes heavily discounted or part of a bundle, avoid. If you find it discounted, have patience, a walkthrough for the ""hidden items"" and want to have a few laughts, buy it, Frogwares has moved on to better games since, so at least you are helping them.

												This game was cheap enough that I didn't mind playing it through to the end, but that doesn't mean I'd recommend it. The production values are shoddy and it suffers from the fault of many a point and click adventure that it's all so linear you spend your time waiting for your character to catch up with your conclusions. There are also a number of counterintuitive puzzles and you have to spend a lot of time moving your mouse over every inch of the screen to find the stupid items.If you have nothing better to do, buy this one on sale.

												Walkthrough is needed with this game. I usually have no trouble with puzzle games but this is beyond frustrating. No window mode, so you can't shrink the window as you hunt for a walktrough to help you figure out a puzzle that you cannot skip. Very buggy and had to restart it constantly because things you needed to progress wouldn't appear and you are pretty much stuck till you find it. It might be becasue I am playing with Window 8.1 and had to rig it a little to get it to play but it really doesn't feel like it was worth it.			"

												Oh boy... Firstly and most dissapointing is how terribly the game deviates from the book which it claims to follow so if that claim is what lead you here... don't even bother. I cringe every time Van helsing mentions Goldaming manor as the lair of the beast.Van helsing himself is designed well but he seems to enjoy his own ""voice"" far too much. Frustratingly while working through the puzzles you will find no room for deviation. While they do infact require attention and a bit of brain power, many times it feels as though whether or not you have the answer doesn't matter because the teacher needs to see your working out.It is still elegantly designed but lacks a certain creativity, it's sad that the creators didn't bother to put their own interpretation on the style so I am going to assume this project was simply thought up to make money off of Stoker's legacy without actually wondering about what he was trying to say with his novel.Overall Playability: 5/10overall apperance: 5/10Writing: 4/10Puzzles: 7/10			"

(Dracula 2000, the original Bela Lugosi one)I've also liked different people's takes on Dracula. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for example was hardly true to the source material but still succeeding in making Dracula an interesting character and being in general an awesome game.This... this was not.They diverged from the traditional Dracula storylines, but never in interesting ways. The gameplay itself was boring as hell.I want there to be a good game about Dracula, I really really do. It could be awesome.

												Commits the classic no'no's of adventure games, illogical puzzles and overly-pricise puzzles (that's a puzzle that won't complete unless you've drawn, placed or down something in a very specific way yet is very open ended and comes with little to no guidance to insure you do it 100% right in the first place).Simply put I had to youtube the first puzzle (the map drawing one) and 4th or so puzzle because it was cryptic / random. If you have to do that so early so often it's the early indication of a poor adventure game I'm afraid. Of course if you don't mind / care about solving the puzzles yourself (a core mechanic in my opinion) it's probably still going to be a good game for you.			"

												Kinda boring. I played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes first from the same developers before, that was a lot more enjoyable and modern. In this one the player doesn't have a free camera and it was annoying. I admit I never read the original novel, but the game's story is bland (the thousandth iteration of damsel in distress - yawn) the characters are not even two, but one-dimensional. I can't say they put any effort in the game aside of the visuals. (One scene that stood out as particularly beautiful is the Viennese library <3) Overall my rating is 2/5, kinda bland, boring game, not engaging, but not overly horrible either. Some of the puzzles and situations didn't make sense (like when the solution of a scene was that the player has to set a person on fire. yes.)			"

												Came into this looking for an old-school adventure game with a Dracula flavour to it. The game was not exactly what I expected. It shares similarities with old-school adventure games but it has more of focused, puzzle solving approach then the inventory item hunt prevelant in most of the old Lucasarts games (which I love).Most of the puzzle are good fun. Some are a bit too obscure. The more on-rails approach to the game flow keeps the game more focused and keeps the story moving forward.The game can be a bit clunky but I feel the good puzzles, story and general atmosphere make up for it.

												Dracula Origin is an interesting take on the Dracula myth, brought to you by Frogwares, who are responsible for the relatively recent slew of (pretty good) Sherlock Holmes games (and for creepy Watson). This isn't quite on par with their detective-centric offerings, but it's okay, and unintentionally hilarious at several points.As the the title of the game would indicate, Dracula Origin explains how everyone's favorite vampire got into the blood-sucking immortality business, and why. A lot of globetrotting, in part to try and save one of Drac's victims, uncovers a trail of mystical entanglements and less-than-ideal choices made by several parties that unleashed the vampiric curse upon the world.There's not that much to say for the game, in fairness. It's a fun if not particularly memorable romp, with decent puzzles and nothing too frustrating. The frequent changes of scenery are a nice touch, and the story reads well enough, despite being a bit cliche. In some ways, I feel the game's core revelation kind of takes the ♥♥♥♥ out of Dracula, and one wonders if he'd be wearing a fedora and making whiny YouTube videos had either been invented in his time. And if he were real. i guess that's a sticking point as well.But yeah, it's okay. You could play worse.Here's what I was talking about re: fedoras, by the way. It's technically a spoiler, but the very description of the game spoils the same thing, so... eh.

												At times it made no sense. In general it's a good game, simple, and not very time consuming, but as someone who loved the Dracula story - I found this a bit lacking. Still, would have definitely played more. Dat ending tho.			"

												Nice game! It's an adventure game inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula.There are quite simple riddles and the story is quite enjoyable. Recommended if you want to spend a few days solving simple puzzles; if you like more diffucult games you should look for other ones.			"

												Good design, creepy atmosphere, compelling story, and challenging puzzles. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and dark adventure game. The Dracula legend is very detailed and thought out, the creators of this game put a lot of effort into the mysteries you eventually uncover. The horror is well done and managed to spook me out, some of the art design is really creepy and haunting, especially when playing alone at night.			"

												Dracula Origins is a point and click that does not have great graphics, has a great story and the puzzles are either too hard or too easy. I actually got stuck on a ""puzzle"" that I had worked out the answer to but they wouldn't give me the option of entering because I hadn't looked at everything. All in all, its enjoyable. Very intuative controls and melding of items and if your not sure what you may have missed, space bar is great. Get it cheap and enjoy.			"

												This game is all about f***ing puzzles. No scenario. No action. No atmosphere. The Original book written by Stocker is 1000% more fascinating then this annoying point&click peace of u know what. Dont try to buy it: u ll waste your time and money. If you are inspired with Dracula thematics, you d better buy The Path of the Dragon or Last last Sanctuary or smth like that. This game HAS NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE GREATE STORY OF THE LEGENDARY COUNT DRACULA!!!!			"

												So far, I have really enjoyed this one.  I am still new to this type of game so I was a little unprepared for the difficulty at first.  Thank you for walk-throughs.  I hate getting stuck. The best thing about this game, I won't be finishing it within a few hours.  I got this one on sale.  Money WELL spent.			"

												Una soberbia aventura gráfica de las de toda la vida con voces y textos íntegramente en castellano con una ambientación fenomenal que te mantendrá varias horas cavilando en cómo solucionar los puzzles que pueblan este gran juego para los amantes de los retos			"

												Picked it up dirt cheap. A slow paced, poorly acted Point and Click. HOWEVER!! Puzzle solving is really satisfying. From the makers of the Sherlock Holmes game I really enjoyed the puzzles, item inventory combining, detective work that leads to your conclusions. Reccomended if you want an enjoyable but slow paced (with some lame backtracking) mystery game.The story is ""meh"" as you play as Dr Van Helsing (Infamous Vampire hunter) pursuing Dracula as he targets young women for his desperate obcessions. It's a means to an end to keep the story going.I would love to see a sequel similar to Sherlock Holmes C&P.			"

												Love the story line. Requires you to use your mind and wits in order to solve the mistery. Suspenseful and a nice twist on the story we all think we know. Highly recommend this.			"

												A decent old school point and click game. There are some annoying puzzels (like having to know the keys on a piano) and the animation is a bit stiff, but the story is enjoyable. Its not Frogwares best but not their worst either. All in all if you like point and click adventures you should enjoy this.			"

												Came into this looking for an old-school adventure game with a Dracula flavour to it. The game was not exactly what I expected. It shares similarities with old-school adventure games but it has more of focused, puzzle solving approach then the inventory item hunt prevelant in most of the old Lucasarts games (which I love).Most of the puzzle are good fun. Some are a bit too obscure. The more on-rails approach to the game flow keeps the game more focused and keeps the story moving forward.The game can be a bit clunky but I feel the good puzzles, story and general atmosphere make up for it. A worthwhile experience.			"

												Tried this game out because I'm a HUGE fan of Frogware's Sherlock Holmes games. This one was a bit better than Dracula: Love Kills both in difficulty and storyline. It wasn't just a 'search for this object"" type of game. In many ways, it resembled most of the Sherlock Holmes games (Minus Hounds of Baskerville which resembled Love Kills) in that you had to look for documents and interview people while searching for clues as well. And this slight difficulty made this game more fun.Took me 9 hours to beat the game rather than the 4 hours I spent to beat the sequel so... I would say this is more worth my money than the second. (1+USD an hour for gameplay. hm...)			"

												Complete travesty. Excluding the well-designed backgrounds and the decent puzzles, everything is awful, the ghastly excuse of a Dracula storyline, the laughable characters, the god-awful music that will make you turn the volume all the way down, the low-rez cut-scenes...just skip it, escpecially if you're a Dracula fan.
