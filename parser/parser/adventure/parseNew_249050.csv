												Firstly, a TL;DR for the lazy reader:+ Great Art and Music+ Great lore, for those interested in the Endless setting+ Great design and interpretation of the rogue-like genre+ For 10 bucks, you can enjoy at least a solid 6-10 hours of gameplay and potentially dozens more.+ Multiplayer is finally fixed and well designed.- However, it is heavily team dependant and one player can genuinely kill three others by making rash decisions. With friends, this game should be a blast.- The game’s mechanics may not be for you, read section “Game Mechanics” for more info.- Some minor bugsRead More:Dungeon of the Endless follows the lore of previous games by Amplitude Studios (Endless Space & Endless Legend) and presents it this time, in a “rogue-like” fashion. The objective is simple: Explore the dungeon, search the rooms and then get the dust crystal through swarms of aliens into the teleporter for the next floor. The mechanics of this game are somewhat profound and relatively unique, based on a turn-like system that dispenses new events after a door in the dungeon is opened. This isn’t to be mistaken with the fact that the game is very much in real-time, players will have to make very quick decisions on defensive relocations, retreats and emergency use of skills/medkits. I imagine the most convenient mechanics comparison to be drawn here is to that of Faster Than Light. Game Mechanics:The biggest design component of the game leads me to warn potential buyers to possible disappointment- heed my word. Suppose the main feature of rogue-likes that people enjoy is the risk: reward decisions one has to make. This is tied with the subsequent “snowballing” of a character’s strengths and the increasing challenges; item collections in Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac. At first glance, Dungeon of the Endless may not meet these expectations, decisions to develop one’s character is often met with only simply a new ability or meagre stat boosts. This isn’t an inherent flaw in the design but rather, a choice made to cater to players having to combine all of the resources: Industry, to build modules for resources and defense, food for character development and medkits, sciences for researching better modules. A player that may only enjoy, say, the character development of a roguelike will be met with disappointment here as one cannot neglect the other aspects of the game in order to succeed- the very same reason why Amplitude has curbed the potential of characters clearing whole floors by themselves. However, when said mechanics are utilised properly the game truly shines. Players will find themselves scrutinising their floor’s layout, optimising where to allocate power and resources, what resources are most required, whether or not to save resources for the next floor, if characters should be replaced by newfound possible companions, the list goes on. Decision making is the core component of the game that gives it drive, anticipation of resources desperately needed, whether it be dust or a replacement for a fallen companion will lead players into a game that forces them to make decisions. Make no mistake, the game is balls to the walls difficult and will not hesitate to stomp on your carefully knitted floor plans whenever it gets the chance. For this, I commend the developers in creating a relatively fresh balance of mechanics in a recently inflated genre of “rogue-likes”. Multiplayer:Multiplayer is also quite entertaining with gameplay identical to that of singleplayer except with one character per player. This leads to less micro-managing and a larger pool of resources, making the game easier only when players can cooperate properly and plan ahead together. The biggest complaint I have about this however, is the lack of a save-multiplayer feature, thus games can often stretch out for multiple hours and leave players exhausted or unwilling to continue. Furthermore, the lack of a host migration system means that if a host leaves the game—you’re screwed. Amplitude must address these features as they are critical to the quality of gameplay and I find myself only playing alone or with a friend instead of with other players. Art & Music:Other than that, the only noteworthy mention of the game is its further development of the Endless lore, which I am a particular fan of and DotE does not fail to impress, new characters and revelations about the world left me relatively keen on the story of the game. Furthermore, secret character interactions are revealed when specific combinations of characters are placed in a party, leading to a more interesting play through and for the eager player, experimentation with compositions. This lore is accompanied by a pixel art style that is of an impressive quality and the usual stature of music that amplitude has impressed me with so far. Though these are subjective and you in particular may not agree with me.Final Judgement:For the singleplayer experience alone, I recommend the game for its listed retail price. On sale, it’s a must-buy. Though multiplayer bogs the game’s overall quality down, Amplitude is known to respond very well to player criticisms and I am confident they will address these issues. Overall a fantastic little game. On my first playthrough, I fought hard to get the crystal to the elevator and in my rash attempt to escape, left my other party members behind to get eaten by aliens. Made me think “Would play again”- and I did, a lot.Update as of 27th April 2015:- There is a save feature for multiplayer now, this was much desired and a great improvement.- However, the community has slowly died down. It is not impossible to find a match depending on the hour of the day, however there are far fewer lobbies than a few months ago. I would recommend searching globally and not just within your region when searching for a game.- Multiplayer overall works well now, however there has been observations of a recent bug that removes items from the characters of certain players whilst they return when traded to others. Hopefully this is fixed by amplitude.			"

Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Alpha 0.1.0. Please understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Alpha 0.1.0 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development. IntroductionRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving. If you have an interest in Rogue-like games and think that an intermixed concept of base defense is a good idea, keep reading. If you do not like traditional Rogue-like games where it is turn based, you might still like this since it is a hybred of turn-based and real-time with a pause feature. However if you do not like either concept of Rogue-like “permadeath” or base defense you may want to consider doing more research or finding something else. Also with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.This will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.Concept / FeaturesThe concept of mixing Rouge-like with base defense is interesting; it gives an interesting way to progress. Including Dungeon of the Endless uses real-time with waves verse the traditional turn based method.Right now the game has three available resource types, Food, Dust (energy) and Industry (tech). Food is used to recruit new members to your team, heal them and level them up. Industry is used to create defenses in powered rooms. Dust is used in two ways first to buy things from random merchants and to power rooms beyond the starting room with the core. Dust currently resets every level while Food and Industry do not.  Progressing in the dungeon you will have to make decisions on if it is correct to save Food to heal or on the chance to recruit someone or even to level someone up. The current max level is five and five makes a large difference verses a level one however it is expensive.The player will have to decide what rooms to open to since they will not have enough Dust to supply all the rooms at the start. When you have access to merchant the player will have to decide if they are going to give up Dust used for defenses to buy equipment or sell equipment for dust. Defenses can be used to also increase your income while exploring.Progression also at this time also includes finding chests and blueprints for building new defenses.The interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down. It also allows short-cut keys while building defenses, so you can hold shift and click to place multiple defenses instead of reusing the menu. The game also employs a monster wave system, where waves occur over time from unpowered rooms. Thus if the room remains unpowered monsters come from the vast darkness to kill the team.The overall objective is to find the room to the next level and then move the core there using one of the heroes to do so. You will find that the rooms begain to lose power while doing this and waves of monsters start to show up to stop you.AtmosphereOverall the feeling is deployed correctly for alpha; the story is short and sweet and not overly lengthy or bulky. Basically your team of two is on a ship and become stranded and must progress through the dungeon. The generated two characters the player start with have a slight background to have the player interested and give a hint on how they should be used to progress.   The graphics are a very nicely done pixel art format, with effects and seem to pay homage to older graphical related Rouge-likes very well. Personally I found the graphics enjoyable. Music was interesting and seems to fit well with the current atmosphere of the game however it may become bland unintentionally over extended play.StabilityOverall the game /did not/ hang or crash on older machines that lacked the graphics requirement. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was pretty efficient and was not a complete resource hog on the system. I also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run. While I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments. ConclusionI would currently recommend this to someone who is /interested and willing/ to try a Rogue-like combined with base defense which is implemented in hybred fasion of real-time and turn-based. This game will most likely have a very interesting development process from Amplitude Studios and I look forward to it.Work HistoryPosted: Dec 11, 2013 @ 6:09pmUpdated: Dec 11, 2013 @ 11:15pmSlight EditsUpdated: Nov 7, 2014 @ 12:28pmAdded Work History.None of the complied review text was changed.Changed text formating slightly.

												Early Access ReviewThis is what happens when your FTL crew crashes into Binding of Issac's basement.It's pretty pretty and painfully punishing, Endless is entertaining to say the least.Update, post-release review.This is a great dungeon crawler, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys resource and combat management, and beautiful pixel art.It should be noted that gameplay is not focused on direct combat control. The heroes can be told where to go, and each have a couple abilities that can be activated to assist in combat, but they will auto-attack enemies in the room. Although combat is real-time, progression is door-based (basically turn-based), with hero ability cooldowns, resource collection, and research, all on a per-door opened basis.I don't know much about multiplayer, other than each player controls one hero, up to four players.The developers are active in the community and even more on their own website. Thanks to the team for consistant updates and continued support for the game!			"

												Dungeon of the Endless wears a leather jacket, has a greaser pompadour, and smokes cigarettes in the bathroom. Old Man Tower Defense catches him.""You can't smoke in here,"" says Old Man Tower Defense. Dungeon of the Endless puts out his cigarette on the old man's face and steals his style.""Get lost,"" says Dungeon of the Endless, and Old Man Tower Defense shuffles back to his room at the old genres' home.4X Strategy Nerd is walking down the hall as Dungeon of the Endless walks out of the bathroom, smelling like bathroom soap and Camels. DotE shakes him down for his gameplay elements and stuffs him in a locker.After school, DotE hangs out with his friend Ritchie ""Rogue-Like"" Valens.""I wanna put a band together,"" says DotE.""Yeah? Watcha thinkin?"" says Ritchie.""I got all these things I stole from people at school,"" says DotE.Ritchie looks at these Tower Defense elements and these 4X strategy elements and wonders if it could work. He looks at DotE and sees that look in his face - if he could trick Principal RTS into eating fifteen cans of Spam to get people to believe in base-building and resource management again, he could do this.""Yeah. Yeah,"" says Ritchie. ""It'll take some thinking, but we could make this work.""			"

												This game is the prime example of the modern roguelike done right.Before playing Dungeon of the Endless, I've played a HUGE host of roguelikes from Angband to Tales of Maj'Eyal to Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. As diverse as the settings and gimmicks are, roguelikes have some things in common - as you get more and more powerful and you explore the world, the game tries to match your power with more powerful foes or new mechanics, and throughout the way the game tries to kill you when you make a wrong decision, get in a wrong area, or do a wrong step. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it gives a sense of challenge and a thrill that gives roguelikes its addictive charm.Most roguelikes also feature a huge number of mechanics and statistics that can be very daunting - for example, Tales of Maj'Eyal has at least six unique resources (health, mana, stamina, rage, hate, equilibrium), seven stats, at least 26 different types of damage, saving throws for physical, spell, and mind damage, resistances, resistance penetration, five types of speed (global, movement, spell, attack, mental)...you get it. The more unorthodox Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead has a complex crafting system, twenty-nine skills ranging from computer knowledge to tailoring expertise, and at least 102 feats for your character. All of this can be incredibly daunting to face for newbies and is a staple of the genre.Dungeon of the Endless, however, breaks from that mold. The concepts and challenges are simple: find the exit, bring the Crystal to the exit, defend the crystal carrier against waves of enemies. There are only eight statistics all in all, with each character possessing a set of passive and active skills that will be seen as the character levels up. The skills and statistics are simple to understand and make use of.Compared to most roguelikes, Dungeon of the Endless is relatively gimmick-free: there is one non-random gimmick about characters killing one another due to their relationship, which is incredibly frustrating but is easily avoided in your next playthrough (unlike unbeatable scenarios in FTL or some ""trap"" areas in Tales of Maj'Eyal). If you lose, it's not the fault of the game as it usually is in roguelikes - it's all yours. Maybe you didn't think about watching your carrier's back; maybe you neglected defending a certain chokepoint, leading to your party getting flanked and killed. Since you know it's your mistake, you can determine what you did wrong and how you can prevent it next time. Not only is it a new game every single time, but you learn and refine your strategy, and you buckle down and see if you can make it to a deeper floor with your experience this time.Dungeon of the Endless represents what a modern roguelike should aspire to be: a highly replayable game that provides a genuine, fair challenge that you can climb through and improve your skill in every playthrough.(I still like Tales of Maj'Eyal better. :3)10/10 gg			"

												A game where strategy is life, every pixel in the game is another reason to buy it.Pros+ Great level design, and characters ""Also has characters from tf2"".+ Lovely soundtracks, effects and animations.+ Very challenging rogue-like that requires thinking and fast responses.+ A lot of characters to choose from, each with their own abilities and equipment.+ Find, levelup and upgrade your characters using your resources.+ Randomized levels that brings out a lot of monsters and holds a lot of secrets.+ Several ships to unlock, each containing either a new game mode or gives perks and vices.+ Really addictive to play on single-player since its randomized and hard.+ Very fun to play with friends on multiplayer with a PeerToPeer system and up to 4-players.+ A lot of secrets to unlock, stories to discover and pictures to add to the gallery.Cons- It uses physx, so you might get some poor fps performance on old systems.- Multiplayer is really fun, but it sucks that if I join another host it will overwrite my previous save with my friends.- Same thing but for singleplayer, it sucks that I cant create a new game without overwriting my previous one.Example, I have a save in endless mode floor 15+ , and I want to start a new game to try out the other spaceship perks, but at the sametime I really don't want to delete that endless mode save ....And devs stated they're working on the console port so I dont think this will change anytime soon.Rating 9/10, Very addictive and so initiative, has a lot of content to unlock and so many things to achieve.Imo, its fun to play alone as much as its fun to play with others.I highly recommend buying the crystal edition, it unlocks a couple of new modes and just supports these awesome devs.			"

												This review was done with the Founder Pack version.Pretty fun game from what I've played so far. It's a tower defense dungeon crawler/RPG. For the stage the game is at the moment I think it's very polished and the artwork is fantastic. The game generates random dungeons so there is a lot of replayabilty.  Another thing that I thought that was neat was DOTE follows the lore of Endless Space (Another fantastic game, especially if you like a more simplistic Civ game in space). Which I think is a nice touch.   I'd highly recommend this game if you like FTL (Faster than Light). Pretty similar gameplay but in a dungeon and you have to protect your Crystal reactor. Which you use to power up rooms with open slots for upgrades for industry,agriculture and science. Dust much like Endless Space is the currency but also doubles as a fuel source in this game. Which you would use to power up the rooms or to buy items from the merchant. Also you can level up your heros with agricuture, instead of experience like Endless Space. I think it would have been cool to get Xp from slaying mobs but it is still early access so the developers may change that (The developer is very active with the community and takes feedback. They also have votes for changes in the game via their forums that you got from buying the game).   I'm going to play this game a lot more and would recommend it but to someone who hasn't played Endless Space (They use a lot of of the resources, tech trees and lore, that Endless Space uses.) or doesn't likes tower defense games. You should probably wait until it's on sale or when it's out of early access (As of right now there is only 3 levels).Founder Pack version notes:   This part of the review will go over the Founder pack extras that are included in-game and cross game. I'll add in the other in-game items and extras once they are released (Or if I even remember to :D). The to be released items and extras are the Ship Pack: The Library, the Hero: Josh 'Ntello, the Official soundtrack and Vaulterskins for Endless Legends (Game will be out next 2014).   At the moment you get 50% off for Endless Space and the expansion pack (This is an awesome game, a more simplicated Civ game in space with tons of lore), 2 community badges on the Amplitude forums (So you can feel special over people with no badges, just kidding) and The Vaulter faction for Endless Space. The Vaulter faction for Endless Space is a bit disapointing for me at least.   I had a chance to play today and they do have nice stats and nice abilites but the ships were disapointing and also that there was no introduction video for their faction, like other factions have. They're really similar to the United Empire ships. Unlike the the Piligrims ships where you can see the differences in ship design there is little to none with the Vaulters. They just seem to be reskined United Empire ships like with the Sheredyn faction. Where as it's understandable with Sheredyn faction sense they're still close to the United Empire and were the Emperors  personal guards. But other then that, as of now the Founder pack was worth it (My opinion). Hopefully they will redesign the ships and add a introduction video in a future update.   Founder Pack and can be a hit and miss for some and would recommend that you buy the Pixel pack instead, if you're unsure. Amplitude have been known to have an option to upgrade for Endless Space so it's possible that you will be able to upgrade later but at the same time it's a ""Founder pack"" it may be limited time only.Update: Now that the game has officially been released, a couple of things have changed. See below.- Currency is now randomized (FIDS) and is not just Dust. FIDS is Food, Industry, Dust and Food.- Science is now used to update modules and you research via Endless Artefact.- Updated the intro movie, main menu and some parts of the Hero UI. (I like it)- Soundtrack has been updated.- You can now save items in a backpack now, that are not in your heros inventory for the next level. (I was waiting so long for this)- Ships can be unlocked now, by completing certain conidtions in a successful playthough.- Heros can be unlocked now, by meeting them in a playthrough and meeting certain conditions.- Monuments also have been added which give random buffs or debuff for a  random duration.- And a multiplayer mode has been added but have yet to try it.- You have to click exit to move to the next level.- Loading screen to next level has been changed.- 13 levels to complete a playthough. Unlimited levels, if you use the Drill ship. (Unlockable)- Steam cards and Steam achievements have also been added with DOTE's release.My thoughts; game is amazing now that it has released and awesome updates to the DOTE. Updates will probably be continued just like it's sister games ot the Endless Universe.			"

												I had a review for this before. But that was when it was in early access.Now this is a review for the game now it has been released.You should be buying this already. Hell, you should have already bought it.Here's the deal. Do you like tower defence? Do you like roguelikes? Do you like dungeon crawling strategy type games? If the answer to all three is yes, then I can imagine your trepidation at hearing that this game combines all three, as I was nervous too. I mean there IS such a thing as too much of a good thing, and too many cooks spoil the broth, and sometimes many great things added together do not make an awesome thing...But in this case you can lay your fears to rest. Dungeon of the Endless is an incredible game, so much fun, brutally difficult and very rewarding. It requires quick thinking, strategic planning, and a buttload of blind stupid balls-to-the-walls courage at times.The BAD parts of this game is that the view is very zoomed in, and there are only two states to the view. Zoomed right the hell in, or zoomed right the hell out so it looks like a map screen. This DOES make things slightly awkward, especially if you have split your party to explore a particularly large dungeon, or if an attack comes from various areas of the map.Secondly it's unforgivingly hard, even on ""Too Easy"" mode. The game lies. Too Easy is still brutally hard. You will lose party members. You will get two floors with a new team member unscathed, only to have them die suddenly and unexpectedly during the rush to get the crystal to the next floor before you can unlock him or her fully.Thirdly the pixelly graphics may not appeal to some. To me, personally, they are amazing, I love them. They've got a lot of charm, BUT I recognise that it isn't always everyone's thing. It CAN also make combat extremely confusing. Granted you don't have to directly target any enemies, but it's still difficult to watch lots of things at once.Finally the control system takes a little getting used to. It's simple enough to navitage everything via right clicks and left clicks and such but getting used to the UI and how it does equipping and everything is .... well it feels slightly counter-intuitive. An ability to click-drag items about would have been nice for example, and a quicker way to open/close inventory/stat panels too...Now for the good stuff:Music? Really nice. Not too epic, sadly, but not annoying at all, or obnoxiously loud and grating, nor does it overwhelm you. The devs know when to use what music and it's very apparent that in that aspect their sound design is definately on the ball.Gameplay mechanics? rock solid. Resource management and building, turret defence/augmentation placement, power management and placement, the Risk/reward nature of opening just one door or many doors for the added XP/loot multiplier at the risk of being overrun by swarms of enemies, the various different types of enemies and their priority targets, the sheer volume of characters and skills and strengths... The pure joy of opening a door and finding a merchant or item box and being able to equip something awesome is amazing. Finding cool little things like Steles or Research Artefacts is also great fun.Also this game has an amazing, rather dark sense of humour. Characters make quips as they traverse between levels and as they open certain doors, they talk to each other, they crack jokes... The item/skill/module descriptions as well are ALWAYS worth reading too for a good chuckle.As for a game that's come through Early Access? Incredible results. It's come out so polished and refined, and so full of meat and bones that it's become an even greater game for all the feedback the fans gave it. This is well worth your money and absolutely a lot of fun.Just be sure to prepare yourself for inevitable demise.			"

Early Access Review
								General synopsis of the game:This game is actually surprisingly deep once you figure it out.  It tricks you into thinking its just a roguelike dungeon crawler.  And if thats how you treat it, you will not last past the first floor.  It centers around exploring each level room by room, and once you locate the exit to the level, moving your power source to the exit.  You have to place your heroes tactically (at choke points basically), and build defenses around those heroes to harden their key positions around your power source.  This usually leaves only one hero remaining to explore.  Enemies spawn in random unpowered rooms you have discovered.  So, sometimes one of your heroes may get overwhelmed, and you will have to take advantage of the handy pause feature to make sure one of that hero is not getting totally butt-r***ed.  And, if he is, then you need to figure out which hero you can send to reinforce him.  Or, you can activate one of his, unique to each hero, cooldown skills.  Which will give him a temporary boost in combat.  Or, you could order him to run away.  Fleeing is always a viable option in this game.  The in-game currency revolves around entering new rooms.  For each new door you open you get a set amount of resources and/or currency which allows you to build extra defenses, hire another hero, level up your existing heroes, research better defenses, heal your heroes in combat, power new rooms (to set up new defenses), or buy new gear for your heroes.  Once you have opened a door, you cannot close it.  So, you have to be careful not to expose a flank route to your power source by brainlessly opening doors.Thats kind of it in a nutshell.  I obviously recommend it, even in its alpha stage.  It has not crashed once for me, and is pretty content rich.  I can't wait for the game to be content complete.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is probably the best rogue like dungeon crawler that I'll ever play, because it takes the genre and adds a tower defense mechanic to it with a science fiction theme. The object is to explore randomly generated floors all while defending your crystal. The crystal gets used to power rooms that you'll place defenses and harvesters that bring in extra science, food and industry for every new door that you open. Once you discover the exit, one of your party members needs to lug that crystal from the elevator to the exit as the floor floods with enemies. Any party member not in the room with the exit gets left behind if you chose to exit without them.Your characters will defend a room automatically and fix any damaged equipment if there's nothing happening. You only need to have your people in the right room at the right time. Its a fun and casual way to play the game. If someone gets too low on health, you can click a medical bag near your character's card to use food for more health. Some difficulties even replenish your health for each room or wave of monsters that you clear. You can spend food on each character to level up. The more rooms of a floor that you clear out, the greater chance of enemy waves attacking. There are still rooms full of enemies, but its the waves that make things a true challenge. These waves will spawn in any room that isn't powered. Your foes can't go through doors and they'll only spawn in rooms you've uncovered so its best when you start a new floor to choose one door and work down that path instead of opening all four doors to each elevator.You've got your choice of four characters from the start and plenty to unlock as you progress. You can find new recruits and purchase them with food, but that doesn't mean they're unlocked. In order to unlock them you need to have and keep them for at least a floor. The game lets you have a maximum of four per party and it can be difficult juggling them, because you can only control four at once. Under normal circumstances, I have three of them guard the crystal and explore with one.Dungeon of the Endless has an amazing multiplayer that gives each player one character. Its a much easier experience. You pick a server locally, with your friends or even global. Then select who you want to be or let the game chose randomly and hop into a game. Once it starts no one else can join, even if a player drops out. When a character dies, they can't be revived and this goes for single player too! Instead you'll need to find a new character in the dungeon and recruit them. If you have more than one character under your control, you can pass them to another player. If you play global, its just as smooth as someone in your own region. The only issue that I have with the multiplayer is when the host leaves, the game ends!The controls are easy, right click to move. That's it. Right click a door to open it and watch your character go to the door. Right click to interact with something. Right click your character icon to open their stats. Of course there are still hot keys and you can scroll the screen or focus in on your character. If you ever need to see the map, mouse wheel back to see the entire dungeon along with icons where the players, enemies and highlights are. Even see unopened doors in red. Its all streamlined, then mouse wheel forward again. Again, its super easy, a joy to play.Along the way you'll find merchants to sell you things, but the game doesn't bog you down in equipment. Most characters have two or three equipment slots. There are science crystals that you spend science to research upgrades. You'll need to wait a while and open more doors before the research is complete, so don't spend science to research then exit the floor immediately. The recruits and merchants you find will also be attacked, so you'll need to defend them or they'll die.There are plenty of things to find throughout the rooms: treasure chests, capsules to unlock at the cost of industry and even things that give you science, industry or food. Everything takes a second or two to unlock. Even doors take a while to open, but once they're open they can't be closed. An odd thing about the game is when you open a door, you've commit to walking into the room beyond it. So if its full of enemies, you will still walk in. Even a room full of enemies doesn't feel like a threat, you can still fallback to a room full of turrets that you've setup.As for placing defenses, you can't just dump a bunch of turrets into a room, you need empty modules in a room to place modules. Some rooms don't even have any modules available, but 90% of them do and the trick is powering the rooms. You've got a limited amount of power your crystal can generate. If the crystal takes damage, it can power fewer rooms. Of course exploring will find more power to beef up your crystal and charge more areas. In terms of defenses, you've got health, defense and weapons. Defense things such as holograms that will attract enemies. Weapons like turrets, Tesla and sentries. New things can be unlocked at science crystals.Once you find the exit, its best to deactivate some of the powered rooms in order to power ones along the path. After they're powered setup defenses, because when you pick up your crystal every door opens automatically. So every undiscovered enemy is activated, but more pressing than that are the waves of enemies that spawn.Instead of classes, there are characters. Each character has their own stats for speed, damage, health and so on. Every piece of equipment can change those stats slightly. Things will boost your speed while lowering your damage per second. Some characters use swords, others have a pistol or a gun. Characters all have their own defense needs, some rely on armor, shields or devices. These characters all look and feel unique to be and play as.Dungeon of the Endless does have only fifteen floors before you'll need to play again from the start. So there is an end game for anyone that needs a goal. Its just reaching that fifteenth floor that is a challenge. Floors become longer, more difficult and dangerous, yet still doable.Since the game revolves around a sci-fi setting, the premise is simple, you've crash landed in your escape pod. Why am I telling you that now this deep into a review? Because its never an issue in the game, the only time it is an issue is before you start, you'll select your escape pod. After going through the game, you'll unlock different escape pods, each with its own perk. There are a few different difficulties, very easy and easy. I assume that you can unlock more, but after 8 hours into the game I still have two difficulties.As for the graphics, they're simple and pixelated, yet still drip in atmosphere. Dungeon of the Endless is a dark and eerie sort of beautiful with a futuristic alien twist. The music gets relegated to ambiance and near chip tune music. Its barely a memory in my mind even after 8 hours of playing.With everything said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your time for fans of both dungeon crawlers and tower defenders. This isn't a genre for everyone, but what's here is addictive, engrossing and easy to play.			"

												My experience with Dungeon of the Endless has been mainly ""struggle and frustration"" so far, but because the game is just so ridiculously hard as in it requires a lot of managing, planning, and some luck, every attempt makes you delve more into the depth of the game. Simply opening doors without much thoughts will ONLY lead you to bad endings.Lists below are what I believe to be the game's good parts and (rather than saying bad directly) parts that left me unsatisfied.Good parts+ Simple - collect and manage resources, survive the enemy waves, construct towers to help your heroes, RESEARCH: these are all you need to know to ""endure"" the challenges until you get the grasp of more details+ The simplicity is what makes the game really Fun as well! Its easy to get into and rogue like element makes every round different from each other+ Interesting characters to choose. Later into game, you would prioritize operator (for extra resource production) over other characters, but IT IS WORTH exploring other types too! They have their own unique taste of skills and playstyle.+ To be able to level up and equip heroes you love and enjoy playing so that they can be even more stronger and sometimes.. a little bit OP under certain circumstances+ Different dungeons to choose, finally managed to finished the first? Here comes the second with even harder (subjective) which may require different strategies+ THE JOY OF BEING ALIVE at the end of each round. Seriously, after dying so much times and failing to clear due to stupid mistakes, this relief makes you go on in the game+ Ridiculously hard sometimes - greatly recommended to those who enjoy challenges out thereBad/Unsatisfactory parts- Lack of multiple saves system, basically you are stuck in one game to either beat or be crushed- Hard to play in a co-op game, as in barely any room to join (playing with 3 other friends instead is generally recommended rather than waiting)- After awhile, you can notice some heroes are plainly just more ""useful"", balancing is left to be desiredSTILL the game is just amazing, I really did not expect for me to have this sort of intense fun when I bought the gameTherefore, I would like to rate the game 9.5/10! :)			"

												Dungeon of the Endless was a game that I was avoiding. Tower Defense wasn't my ""scene"" and the pixelated (albeit stylized) graphics didn't grab me either. However, many of my gaming friends at ""Octopus Overlords"" were raving about it, so I eventually gave it a try. And I'm glad I did. In the game, your crew of heroes must explore a floor of a spaceship to find the exit. Then, they must transport the generator/crystal to the exit to progress to the next floor, and ultimately exit and win the game. What really hooked me were the RPG elements built in to the game, where you can upgrade and customize your crew members, also outfitting them with weapons and gear. The random nature of each floor and the included encounters/events/surprises appealed to me too (but then, I'm a sucker for Rogue-like games). Lastly, as a gamer with a family, it's nice that each floor makes a satisfying, quick play session - convenient for when real life calls. (There is a ""Save & Quit"" option if needed mid-level).  And I haven't even gotten to the point where I've unlocked all of the ships and crewmembers to use. Drawbacks: The tutorial is short and not entirely helpful. I had to check the wiki for clarity on some of the game basics. (i.e. - Opening doors are the ""turn"" mechanism; You manually choose to level characters from their inventory/stat screens;etc.).  I haven't attempted multi-player, though it seems people are reporting problems at this date. (The developers are continuing to address this with patches.) I've not encountered any technical problems, on my mid-level gaming laptop. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's surprised me with how much fun it has been, once I got the hang of it. To win me over to a genre that I usually avoid is high praise, in my opinion. My last thought (again, shared by an Octopus Overlord member): ""Easy"" level is hard. ""Very easy"" is normal. Don't be afraid to start there.			"

												So many puppets, so many strings... And once we've lifted off, who cares if they figure out who was pulling them? No one on the ship will return to Mazen. Our future lies among the stars. The Dungeon of the Endless Dungeon of the Endless is a hard and unforgiving game. It teaches its gameplay mechanics by making you die a thousand times over. With each run you'll find yourself in a different situation, can't find the elevator exit, not enough dust to power another set of rooms, not enough industry to create much needed modules etc. It's an addictive game. Each playthrough has twelve floors, which get much and much harder with every floor. So many puppets A few hundred condemned criminals find themselves shipped on the prison ship ""Success"". Only for the ship to be shot by a nearby planets defensive system. A few escape pods flew off towards the planet, and crash deep inside an old facility of the Endless. The game has an roster of nineteen heroes, which are all very unique and fun to control. You start with two heroes and you can recruit two other random heroes you find deep inside the dungeon. With the big roster of heroes, you'll easily find a favorite. Each hero is balanced by his/her/its strength, defense, speed and DPS. The heroes are all set in three different factions: Prisoner, Crew or Native. This will also affect your group, heroes can have special conversations in the elevator rides in between the floors and they can have special buffs if heroes from the same factions are present in the room with each other. So many strings Dungeon of the Endless has rouge-lite elements like FTL and The Binding of Isaac, RPG elements with its leveling and skill system, and tower defence elements with the modules that you need to protect yourself with. It's a weird combination of genres, but it works so amazingly fine. As said before, it's an addictive game, you'll die many times because of its hard and unforgiving nature. But sometimes it feels unfair and based around luck. You could've made this floor easily if only you choose the upper path instead of the path to the left. This is what I think every time I die, but that gives it just a little bit more of that addictiveness. Conclusion Dungeon of the Endless is a true gem. A game that you see or hear little to nothing about on steam, but deserves so much more attention than that it gets. With a giant roster of great heroes, and a perfect mix of genres that you would've never suspected to even get mixed. The game can sometimes be based around luck a lot, making runs very unfair at times. That being said, Dungeon of the Endless is definitely worth your money. That is if you're up for a big challenge. 9/10  "

								Just a beautifully realised game. Start with 2 random ""heroes"" and explore a randomly generated dungeon while building modules to increase your resources all the while protecting your generator from your crashed ship. Find the lift on your level and get on to the next one. The pixellated art style is gorgeous and appealing, this game is a joy to play!			"

								I've been dissapointed by a lot of Early Access games.  This is most certainly not one of them.  If you're a fan of either Rogue-likes or Tower Defense then you're going to enjoy this game.  The Alpha is currently very short (only the 1st 3 levels of the dungeon) and has lots of features still to be implemented, but it's already a blast to play.  I can't wait to be able to play with all the currently locked features.			"

												Great combination of rogue-like and tower defense gameplay creating something very original along with a great art style. I would say that the game is amazing with one big caveat -- it's not balanced at the moment. The game's primary resource: Dust controls how many rooms you can have lit up or safe from enemy spawns. However getting the resource is entirely too random and it's the main game ender at the moment.Not having enough dust will leave you with multiple rooms that will spawn enemies and there is no way for you to cope even with the best defenses or heroes in the game. Until the developers do something to fix the balance, Dungeon of the Endless is a great but frustrating game that has limited replayability because of it.			"

												Co-op? Strategy? Rogue-like? Yes please.There are so many wonderful aspects in this game that make it what it is and all of those details add up to a fantastic final product. There's just no debate about it being one of the best games that I have in my inventory, and it only gets more stuff as time goes on.You are the survivor of a crashed escape pod from a prison ship, and you have crashed so far down, the entire game is a quest to navigate to the elevators on every floor and make your way back to the surface with your pod's power core. Every door you open is one turn, so you have the time between doors to think and strategize how you are going to proceed. You build generators in build-nodes and collect resources from those generators with every door you open, however you also have to build defences as every door you open could have monsters and every unlit room that you've already discovered could spawn additional monsters if you're not standing in it.So, the game is a balance of character advancement and combat with turn-based building strategy and resource management. At high levels the game gets pretty intense, but you always have time between doors to cool off and rethink how you're doing things. At least, unless you let them break the doors open. It's quirky, it's pretty, it has a sense of humour, and a great soundtrack. And best of all, there's a variety of ways to play, from over two dozen heroes to stick in your party, to a host of different defences and support modules. Every randomly generated dungeon brings its own opportunities and perils as you deal with whatever the gimmick of your ship's power core is.Dungeon of the Endless can be a challenge, but it's fun even if you lose, and there's a lot to be said for that. But, in my opinion, it's only fun if you have a party. So find some friends and play it like a Friday night board game.			"

												I had about 40 extremely entertaining hours in this game. This game is one like no other.The Soundtrack is beautiful and fits perfectly. The overall sound is pretty haunting and convincing. The main title is a beautifully crafted piece of music.The Pixelgraphics work and they are charming.The User interface is pretty minimalistic and still more than enough. It is easy to understand, which is important because the player has to focus his mind on the actual tactic.Semi-turn-based. This game is basically a turn based game. But at the same time, it is not. Because it is missing one thing that many turn-based games can't avoid: Waiting. In many cases, you will not have to wait alot. Because you can always do something. Research, buy and sell, upgrade, plan your upgrades, plan a new route and so on.It forces you to think and that is what I love the most about it. You will never have enough of everything and your enemies will constantly grow in numbers and in strength. So every turn is important. You will have to count in order to know when you will be able to research or build what. You will have to plan routes and prepare for hordes that might attack your vulnerable resources. You will have to understand the hero class you are playing and how your whole team would benefit the most of your actions. There is so much to plan and seeing it work out afterwards is extremely satisfiying. The moment you hope your route to the elevator is safe and you fight off hordes of monsters, never knowing if the teammate that carries the objective will make it is awesome. Thats another important point:Satisfaction. If you don't make it, you were not prepared in most cases. But thats not the end of the story. If you die, you will still be present, can manage your resources and support your team and if they manage to find a new hero, they can hire it and give you control over him. So, this game shows you without any mystery, that you have to work as a team. You depend on each other. And if two people of the team die, the rest wont get far. If somebody simply opens the doors in a rush because of missing patience, the whole team will have to deal with the consequences and mostly, be punished. But, you will always know what you did wrong. And that is great.So, now that I have said all that, I will mention the worst downside of this game: The multiplayer seems to be dead. Every now and then, I check if there is an open lobby, but all I see is emptiness. Don't get me wrong, you can basically play this game alone, but the real experience lies in the teamplay. So, if you would want to try this game, be sure to look for a group on steam or elsewhere, so that you have some people with you. It is alright in singleplayer, but the real game is in the multiplayer part.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is unlike any other game. It is a top-down real-time tactical squad-based tower defense RPG roguelike, which does not make any sense as a concept. It is also, somehow, very fun and vey hard and gives all the feelings of reward and tension and loss that a well-designed roguelike game should. On top of that, Amplitude puts an exceptional level of polish and awesome UI design into this and all their other games, more so than almost any AAA or indie titles I've ever seen.The game plays a lot like FTL on a dungeon layout rather than inside a ship - you command your units to a certain room or door and they'll set about doing whatever task they can, but it's also topped with an equipment, level-up, and skills system that gives layer of individual investment in your heroes similar to 2000-era Infinity Engine RPGs. Within every floor of the dungeon, you're also gathering and investing resources into a sort of base-building system, using build-nodes and a power grid to either auto-generate more resources or to actively help your heroes in defending rooms. It all takes a lot of getting used to, but once you get enough of a grasp on all the systems to work towards understanding them better, they come together in a really satisfying way.The soundtrack is very FTL as well (perhaps too FTL-like, even), noticeable but not overbearing space-y background tracks that feel fitting for whatever situation you're in. There's a large amount of flavor text across equipment, research, hero dialog, and other things like that, and everything I've seen of it has been generally informative and often surprisingly funny. The humor isn't the overt RPG-parody style of something like Dungeons of Dredmor, but more simple and under-stated in a way that's appropriate to the style and setting.The one complaint I have so far is that there seems to be no way to move multiple heroes as a unit, at least not that I've found. I very often want 2 or more heroes to stay together or all get into one room ASAP, but my instinct to use click-and-drag style group selection does not work. It's kind of flow-breaking to instead select people one by one and then issue each of them the exact same movement command, and it makes breaching new rooms as a group or falling back to a different position more cumbersome and take a bit longer than it should. A very minor interface gripe in an experience that has otherwise been awesome. (**EDIT: Nevermind most of this paragraph - there is a way to set groups and quick-select those groups. But I still think click-and-drag selection would be the ideal.**)Bottom-line short-form summary: This game is fun, and I have never played anything like it and maybe never will again. I'm not capable of recommending anything more highly than that.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless (DoTE) is a strange mix of genres that works surpisingly well. Part tower defence, part squad management and part roguelike.DoTE presents an interesting dilemma for the player; should I open this door? Ever door you open has the chance to make your escape to the next floor harder. Every room you don't run power too, and very rarely will you have enough power for every room, has a chance to spawn hordes of aleins who want you dead. You can slow their assault by building towers in powered rooms. You must also choose which resources to generate so you can afford more towers, tower upgrades or character levels. Everything in DoTE comes down to a simple choice: how hard do I want to make this for myself? All of this, with a helping of humour and increasing difficulty results in very rewarding risk/reward gameplay.There is a wealth of characters in DoTE, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Their combined flavour texts makes for an interesting narrative and the various interactions between the characters in the post level screen is a very nice touch and makes the world feel alive. You will rectuit additional squad members  the deeping you dive into the dungeon, but you will have to decide who to sacrafice in order to create room for them as you can onyl have 4 squad members. Even unlocking new characters for future playthroughs has a risk/reward aspect to it as you must dive at least 3 floors into the dungeon with your new compainion before they are available to you for other playthroughs.    The only downsides to DoTE are in the multiplayer. At the time of writing this here are my issues:    You cannot create private multiplayer matches. This has resulted in me kicking many people (sorry!) when I only wanted to play with a friend.     You cannot trade items between player's characters outside of selling the items to the shop keeper and having them buy them.     The game tends to drop connections often and you cannot rejoin a game which effectively ends it.     You cannot save your progress in a multiplayer game and a game of DoTE can take a few hours so make sure you have nothing else you need to do before you start a game up. I hope that the devs iron out the technical issues so that multiplayer can be a more enjoyable experience.In conclusion, I would highly reccomend this game despite its flaws in multiplayer. If you like rogue-likes and tower defence games you should definitely try this one out. It is a steal at only $14 (CAD) and some of the most fun I have had with a game in recent memory!TL;DR: Rogue-Like, Squad Management, Tower Defence. Very fun. Very cheap. Broken multiplayer. Go buy now.			"

												<edit>  In light of the comments on this one, I feel I should word my thoughts a bit better:  My entire feeling about the game comes down to one idea - I like my rogue-likes to be hard; I like randomness to play a large factor; but I don't like RNG that takes the entire possibility of victory out of the players hands - _especially_ when a single run takes 2-3 hours.  It makes the rest of the game meaningless; there's no strategy to an unwinnable floor. </edit>My library is full of rogue-likes and I have hundreds of hours spent playing them, but I have a hard time recommending a game that a) leaves up a lot to chance while b) having extremely long completion times.   The number of times I made it to floor 12 only to lose because I got a double door-breaking rino spawn that I couldn't address because I can't control which enemies my character attacks was just too damn high.  It's not the deaths that are so bad - it's that it takes 2-3 hours to get through a run and to have it end because of nothing you did is just infuriating.The run that finally turned me against this game was a run to floor 12 and there was not a single room in the 12 that I was able to check that had a place to put down a major module.  I had 700 industry saved up just to make generators and 4 characters at level 12 / 13 and there was nothing I could do.  I couldn't kill the swarms before they got to my crystal, and while I killed many of them, when you have 15 dust, you will lose that game of attrition.			"

												We were going to die.	Up until the instant that door opened, there had been hope, there had been an inkling of a chance, we would make it through this last floor, we would escape the facility and finally be free. Maybe the floor's exit would be in there, or it would lead to a hallway leading to the exit, or something, for God's sake every other area of this floor had been opened, it had to be in here...	It opened to a hallway with three doors... upon opening it, the dozens of unpowered rooms surrounding us burst forth with monsters, crawling in from every corner of the icy hellhole we were trapped in. We fought desperately, exhausted out abilities, lost countless turrets to the hordes that door had unleashed upon us, and what did we unlock for our efforts? The opportunity to open three brand new doors, to watch our defenses wither and die at the hands of the disgusting hellish bugs that lay behind these doors, there was no doubt, there was no lingering hope, no desperate chance... the team was too battered, our turrets and defenses worn ragged, the next wave would surely kill us.	Squidward was the first to admit it, that we were going to die. I had tried to fill my team with optimism, but when he called it like it was, there was no denying it, the next door would kill us, so many monsters would spawn that we'd be overwhelmed, and die within seconds. ""We're out of food, Handsome Burger's barely got any health left... I think this is where we all say our goodbyes."" he typed, the text lingering on the screen in brutal silence. Burger responded promptly, ""It's been an honor, bois."" ""Amen to that."" I chimed in, all the while desperately wracking my brain for a solution to this impossible problem, trying to plan some kind of escape route or fullproof defense in my head, there had to be some way to change this, fate may be a fickle mistress, but this was beyond unfair, it had become a downright impossible run...	No. Nothing was impossible. Defending the next wave, perhaps, but with so much of the map already revealed, it had to be in one of the three...	""Guys, don't open anything yet, I've got an idea.""	""Um... sure, ♥♥♥♥ it, what is it?"" Squidward remarked.	""We open all three at the same time.""	""You know, we could just abandon this one, not sure I feel like watching us die after all this.""	""One of them has to have the exit, we've checked everywhere else. We open all three, we see the exit, I run the crystal there, we escape.""	""What if they're all hallways, or empty rooms? Have you seen how this game has ♥♥♥♥ed us so far?""	""Guys, we can't defend the crystal from the next wave, but if we throw up enough neurostun modules and slow them down a bit, we can outrun them to the exit. This is our one shot.""	""♥♥♥♥. I wish you weren't right...""	""Let's do it.""	We took our positions; Squidward, Burger, and Gray each stood before a door, and I sat beside the crystal, throwing what little indus I had left into neurostun modules along the path.	""Ready?""	""Ready.""	""RIP in pepperoni.""	They activated the doors, and an eternity passed as they yawned open, my fingers hovered over the mouse, ready to desperately right click the crystal to freedom.	Dead end.	Dead end.	Hallway with a door.	""OPEN IT NOWE,"" There was no time to spell check, the waves were coming, the map was filling with a wall of red dots, Burger triggered his slowing ability, and the neurostuns did their part, but as slow as the wave was, that didn't keep it from being pant-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly big.	Squidward sprinted for what had to be the last door, and as it slowly opened, and as the fastest of the creeps burst into the crystal room and rabidly dove for me, I prayed to RNGesus for one last chance at freedom... that we could be free from this god-forsaken facility, and that we could taste the sweet clean air of the surface world that awaited us just behind that final door.	Three more doors.	♥♥♥♥ this game.(This game is worth $20. It costs $12. If you're a fan of strategic roguelike gameplay, you should buy this, sale or not. Don't freak out about DLC, just buy the pixel edition. This game doesn't shame you, there's no question mark heads eternally gracing your roster, it only shows who you have in your game, which is an incredibly respectful way to handle DLC in this day and age. If you come to love the game as you play it, the DLC's worth grabbing, but in multiplayer, if the host owns it, you can play it, so don't sweat it, and come hate this ♥♥♥♥ing game with us! :D)			"

												I've tried to like this game, but it just doesn't get it quite right. To begin with, the tutorial is lacking and the game gives you little in the way of instruction. You basically have to die over and over in order to even work out what it is you're supposed to be doing, and even then, to really understand how to play the game ""correctly"" you really need to read a guide.Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) is a merge of two types of game. It's both a turn-based and real time game, and it is both a tower defence game and a roguelike hero/RPG game. This is actually quite a novel idea, and at times it works really well and makes for compelling gameplay, but where it gets let down is the difficulty scaling, and how punishing it is when it doesn't go well for you, and this is due to the mechanics of the game. To understand why, you need to know a bit of how the game plays.It's a top down game featuring a maze of connected rooms. Each turn you open a door, which reveals a new room to add to your map. When a door has been opened, it switches to real time so that you can battle any monsters that may appear. Monsters get randomly generated in any room that isn't powered, and rooms are powered by a resource called Dust. Rooms that are powered can contain turrets and other defensive buildings. You get Dust by opening doors - it has a random chance to appear.The starting room contains your crystal, which when attacked, causes you to lose Dust. This means that the moment your defences start to fail you lose the very resource that prevents monsters from spawning and that powers your defences, but since the mobs increase in difficulty each turn, as soon as your crystal starts getting hit you find yourself in a downward spiral.There is also some benefit to leaving rooms unpowered since you can earn Dust by killing, so there is a balance to be maintained. If you always power as many rooms as you can, you can find yourself without enough Dust to power rooms in the future, but if you leave too many rooms unpowered, you get overwhelmed. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.In a good tower defence game you would alter your defences according to how they stood up to the previous wave. In this game that just doesn't work, due to every unpowered room randomly generating a mob, there are so many random variables involved that you can go from the previous wave barely doing any damage to the next wave completely wiping you out. And as said before, if you do manage to survive such a wave, you'll be in a worse position to survive any future ones.Two of the other resources are Food and Science. These are accrued each turn according to how many of a certain building you have. You need Food to level up your heroes, and you need Science to research new buildings. But they have a secondary use to heal a hero or to reset a hero's skill cooldowns. But this suffers from the same problem as the Dust, in that as soon you find yourself needing to use those resources to keep your heroes alive, you've already lost. The fact that you needed to give emergency heals to someone or reset their skills suggests that you were being overwhelmed, which means next turn you will need to be even better prepared, but you now have less resources than you had in the previous turn, and are in a downward spiral.In a roguelike, random events should be difficult, but if you survive them your reward is the fact that the run continues. In Dungeon of the Endless it often ends slowly, but it's obvious that the game is lost because your resource management has been vitiated and your defences ruined. You don't feel the ""I was so close, next run I can do it"" urge. You feel dejected and just close the game. Starting another run feels like a chore.This is compounded by the fact that a run can take 6+ hours, and some floors are impossible due to the randomly generated layout and rooms simply being indefensible, or randomly getting no dust on a floor, or random events that disabling the only places you could defend from.In FTL you might find yourself up against an enemy that you cannot beat. But you can flee. You might find the rebels caught up to you. But you can fight them and get to the next sector. You might make the wrong choice and lose your best crew member. It makes things more difficult, but your existing crew will improve and you can find others. You might find yourself with a severely damaged ship, your oxygen system down, and your dwindling crew suffocating. But with the right decisions you can turn it around. It's ultimately about decision making and risk management.In Dungeon of the Endless you can do everything right and then after 5 hours be presented with an unwinnable situation. But you play on, to watch the inevitable demise now that everything is ruined through no fault of your own.In The Binding of Isaac your success is heavily dependent on loot generation and your own mechanical skills, but this is fun and addictive. You don't feel cheated, you feel like you could have done it, and you try again, looking forward to the novelty of which items you'll get this time.There is no novelty in Dungeon of the Endless. In fact, once you've worked it out the game is quite shallow. There is essentially one optimal strategy of how to explore, where to leave certain heroes, and where/what to build.Perhaps Dungeon of the Endless tried to do too many things at once, because it's neither a particularly good tower defence game and nor a particularly good roguelike. Tower defence games are about funnelling dumb enemies into your most powerful towers and getting them to stay there. DotE breaks this by handing you layouts and rooms that do not allow you to do this. Roguelike games are addictive because every run is different, you never know what item you might get that greatly changes a run, and deaths feel like your fault rather than the game's. DotE breaks all of this. The items are all very similar and don't change a run, progression through level ups and upgrades are slow and imperceptible, and all runs are played the same.It's a real shame because the gameplay is actually fun and when it works it works, but at other times it all falls apart and leaves you with no recourse. If there was a neutral option I would give this game that because I do like some things about it, but I don't think I can recommend it given its flaws. "

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I went for 10 hours straight when i got it and still want more. I Got the founders pack because its actually fricken awesome. This game has so much replay value, Its very well thought out and gets pretty tough. The rpg element is just as awesome as the tower defence, it blends together perfectly. I wasnt even a fan of tower defence games that much but this game is just great. Once you start getting some items and a party of 4 it gets really fun. It has really cool music in it as well! 10/10 from me. Im also trying to think of bad things about it but I just cant! :D*This is an update to my review*Dungeon of the endless is still fricken awesome.			"

												So I closed all the doors and the lights inside my house. Then, my 3 year old son and I were flying on a huge spaceship but something hapened and we had to use his bed as an escape pod. We barely made it out and made a crash landing into a mysterious complex...We opened the first door and sent dust from our escape pod battery to power up the light. It was quiet... but the next door we got attacked by some kind of bugs and sentient crystals. It's a good thing i brought a nerf shotty and that my son had his trusty foam sword because the adventure could have ended there but we prevailed! Little did we know, we were far from finding an exit and further we went into the complex the more and more creatures were coming at us. Lucky us, we had found another survivor inside a box. It was a friendly unknown beast and it was helping us, for what purpose? we don't know. So after having a lot of fun opening all the doors and some lights and fighting off monsters with our new imaginary friend, we found what hapened to be an elevator. We went up to the surface and found a glass of milk and fresh chocolate chip cookies. Tummy filled, we repaired a radio we had picked up earlier and sent a signal in hope for a rescue team to come an pick us up.... we hope someone gets our message!...10/10 would crash land an escape pod into my house again!

												I took a flyer on this game while it was on sale because it looked interesting and I wanted to play something different. 600hrs later; this is easily one of the best games I've purchased. If I had to describe Dote, it is a Turn Based Strategy/Tower Defense with some RPG elements sprinkled in. DotE is pretty straight forward: build a team, protect the crystal, and survive for 12 floors. Sounds easy? Perhaps you should try it.			"

												This game. THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GAME.I have stopped counting how often I ragequit because I ♥♥♥♥ed up an otherwise perfect run on one of the later floors. But I keep returning because I KNOW it can be done and can be done perfectly and that almost everything that goes wrong is due to a mistake I made.There are so many little nuances and tactics, character skills, items and modules - it's amazingly fun to find synergies and different strategies. There's really a lot of content and hidden background info to find, which makes the price asked very moderate.The flavor texts on everything are an entertaining read and this is probably one of the 3 or so games where I actually go ""YAY!"" when something in the ""sticker album"" that shows art and bits of background story is unlocked. Also the art is absolutely perfect, pixel-perfect so to say.Almost 25 hours of playtime right now and I'm so not done with this.			"

												This game has a really unique feel to it.Challenging, but mostly things that can be foreseen to a certain degree. You do not control the combat directly.  Your character fights whatever is near them and you just tell them what room to go to. Lit rooms do not spawn monsters.  Every time you open a door (you've ended your 'turn' by doing so) there's a chance that the dark rooms may spawn monsters.  If players occupy those rooms, they will not spawn there when the door is opened.  The monsters are basically trying to get to your spawn point -- this is one part tower defense.After you've cleared a path you feel confident about and feel like you've gotten enough loot/XP from a level you have one person slowly carry the crystal to the exit.  Everyone has to be there when they hit it or you're dead as dead can be!Very interesting game.  If you're looking for some weird challenging planned dungeon crawling, this is for you.  It will take a few runs to really understand what's going on and then it clicks.			"

												(Note - I have a lot more hours than shown as I have played a LOT of this game in offline mode)This game is really fun. The art is great, the music is IMHO very good, and fits great. The mechanics are solid and fun to play with. Progress feels like it moves at a good pace, and there is a nice dual-progress system in that you have your in-game progress of leveling up heroes and building the team up, getting new tech, stockpiling resources and getting items for your heroes, and then you have your between-game progress with starting hero and pod unlocks.Overall I'd strongly reccomend. Its a great game that makes you think a bit (but not too hard!), punishes you fairly for bad decisions and helps you learn your way, but it isn't brutal on you (especially with the ability to pause at will with the spacebar). Its quite a departure from other Amplitude games (i.e. its not a 4X) but they've done this really well and I would 100% reccomed this game			"

												If you don't feel like reading the entire things here's the summary:As with any game, keep in mind that this may not be the right combination of elements for you. I'd say if you enjoy tower defense games, roguelike mechanics, science fiction settings, and a subtle sense of humour, there is a high probability that you will enjoy this one. If you get easily frustrated or like strategy based only on skill, without an element of luck, perhaps this is not the game for you. Personally, I love this game. It has all the right ingredients for me, and it's quickly become a favourite. I can't praise it enough.Good points:+Solid design and game mechanics.+Beautiful pixel art.+Immersive soundtrack and sound effects.+Great characters and subtle humour.+Endless replayability. Every game is different, and every combination of heroes and items will make you rethink your approach.+Good time versatility: you can either pick it up for half an hour or half a day. Though a complete run will require several hours to complete, once you know the game mechanics it's relatively easy to pick up a game partway through.+Relatively frequent updates. In a time where far too many games get abandoned in Early Access stage, finding developers that actually listen to the players and release updates seems such a rarity!Possible caveats:-I have not tested the multiplayer(The general consensus seems to be that it still needs some work. Same with some crashing issues. The developers seem to be aware and working on it.)-Difficulty spike towards the later levels. Even the easiest settings can be very, very challenging. This may make the game feel unbalanced.-On that same note, bear in mind that you require both skill and luck to win the game. These points are not a problem for me, I've played old school roguelikes and this one feels pretty forgiving in comparison, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. A bad combination of items, heroes or rooms, and your late game may become nearly impossible. A good one, and you can win with much less effort (though a certain degree of skill is a must, and you will still be punished quite severely for acting foolishly or carelessly).I do like that element of luck, and find that any frustration vanishes fairly quickly in the face of the next challenge (a rarity for me these days, as I don't have much free time and seem to have grown old and grumpy when it comes to frustrating games). I  find luck a perk, rather, something that distinguishes this game from other roguelikes, and I think the immersion really helps, in my case. -Some extra content is unlocked separatelyI'm making a note of this because I've seen some nasty comments around. There is a special edition of the game (crystal pack) that unlocks an extra character and ship, but if you want the other extra character and ship you have to buy the special edition of Endless Legend, as well. I believe that the developers plan to later unlock this content, but are giving this option now for early supporters of their games, which I think is a fair strategy. I think this is much preferable to standard DLC, in any case. Your opinion may differ, so I think it is fair to give a warning.(Edited to correct a sneaky typo!)(Update November 2016: yep, still playing and loving it! :) )			"

======================================Dungeon of the Endless (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:Dungeon of the Endless is an exceptional roguelike with high quality design and polish, variety, challenge, and fun.======================================Pros:+ Aesthetic: Gorgeous pixel art, animations, and visuals.+ UI Design: Extremely appealing and functional.+ Audio: Great music, great ambient sfx, and crisp clean UI sfx tie in with the visuals perfectly for great immersion. + Gameplay: Strongly prominent elements of resource management and tower defense in a roguelike dungeon crawl? Yes.+ Variety: With no expansions 21 characters and 5 pods give you plenty to look forward to, experiment, and play with.+ Online: Being able to play and coordinate with friends locally or from around the globe is a nice treat.+ Developers: Special shoutout to a devteam that has spent many an hour supporting, expanding, and patching their game well after launch.Cons:- Progression: Feels like later floors conspire against you; making you spend a lot of resources to get few back, making the last couple of floors feel like a mad dash.- Friendless: When playing alone, there's a micromanagement aspect that can make the game more difficult for you.- Endless Inventory: Just kidding, it's limited, so if there's no shop, you're probably going to be sacrificing.Neutral:± Nothing: There's few cons, let alone neutral aspects to DotE.======================================Introduction:Hey there and welcome to this review of Dungeon of the Endless; likely the first roguelike of its kind, fusing together elements of tower defense with direct hero control with a healthy dose of resource management and dungeon crawling!Gameplay:So, as stated, prominent features are direct hero control, resource management, dungeon crawling, and tower defense. So in order:Direct Hero Control: You can have up to 4, and you right click to move, left click to select. Attacking or opertating (increasing efficiency of a structure at the cost of staying in the room for successive turns) is automatic, but requires you to be parked in the room you want to do it in. Most heroes have at least one active ability, which will display under their avatar at the top right of your screen. Click them anytime you feel they are best used. Various mechanics such as operating, the ability for your character to spawn block enemies in unlit rooms, and more make it so that you will often have to keep very active tabs on who is where, doing what, and when to change it. This can make the game much more friendly to those playing with friends, as you won't have to keep track of 4 heroes, their abilities, where they are, where they need to be, and constantly select different ones.Resource Management: There are 4 main resources: Dust, industry, science, and food. Dust is for powering rooms, allowing you to make your path through the dungeon safe, or unsafe, at your choosing. Dust is the single most valuable resource going forward, as unpowered rooms can spawn enemies when you open new doors. It is also required to keep rooms with machines functional, so if you want to keep getting your resources from your generators every turn, they have to be powered. Industry is used as a resource with which you build things, so I would say it is of second highest importance because if you can't build new generators on each floor, you won't be able to get many resources at all. You either have it or you don't , pretty simple. Science is used for research, done in specific rooms if you discover them and spend the science to research from one of the available options, which can differ from naturally found research pods. Last comes food, an important but often dismissable resource that enables you to not only feed your character to heal them in an emergency, but to level them up. While doing both of these at times can be critically important, not having food isn't always the end of the world.Dungeon Crawling: So every floor has a random amount of rooms, which can be powered or (mostly) unpowered, have heroes for hire, additional resources, shopkeepers, and various other surprises. As you explore more and more of a floor, you will require more dust to power important rooms while also trying to balance powering the most inconvenienent places for enemies to spawn in on you. Dust can come from newly explored rooms, machines, and killing enemies. There are also items and passive as well as active abilities that can increase your dust gain. There is an emergency generator machine that you can build to power a room and help with gaining dust, so research this technology asap if you find it. As you explore more of a dungeon, you will find yourself having to make decisions and sacrifices. Do you keep the sword for that awesome character you hope to find and unlock or the healing item for an emergency? Do you keep the piece of armor that protects you more, or lets you gain more dust? Can you afford to let that hero operate this machine, or will that place you in jeopardy? Essentialy, the dungeon crawling aspect of DotE is about quickly responding to new discoveries and how they may alter your priorities. If you can't tell, DotE is a very tactical experience.Tower Defense: So yes, I'm sure you now have it firmly in your head that you can build generators to spawn resources every turn (door opened) but that doesn't cover the wealth of options. No, not just that emergency generator you need to find and research immediately, but also a shop for the shopkeeper to be relocated and operated, and various offensive and defensive pods that can be used as traps or buffs for your heroes that will be fighting in specific rooms. There are many otions here from direct attacks, slows, disables, health regen, offensive ability increasing pods, etc. You have to plan ahead and not place these wastefully, as you are not only limited in amount, but the landscape of the dungeon may change unfavorably as you open more doors, leading to a hole in your defenses you can't patch either due to lack of industry or lack of dust to power a room.So. Can you utilize your resources and cunning to keep your heroes and structures safe as you uncover the whole floor? Do you make a mad dash for the end, knowing you no longer have the ability to sustain yourself? Or do you ultimately run out of options as you slowly die, trying to hold on for hope of a lucky find that will save you and let you get to the end and escape the dungeon?Good luck!Graphics:The graphics in DotE are absolutely beautiful. From the sharp  minimal UI, detailed pixel art, fluid and distinct animation, great color palette or beautiful digital paintings that serve as loading screens that may become some of your favorite new desktop backgrounds your eyes will always be entertained and enthralled. Seriously, the bar has been set high.Audio:On the other hand, the audio is just as good. Haunting music and crisp decidedly placed sound effects tie together very well with the graphics and gameplay to create a cohesive whole.Conclusion:Just buy the damn game. Unless you hate challenging games, roguelikes, or the stress of micromanagenent, you'll love this.======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												This is how Early Access should work. Now I only bought this game two weeks before release, but at that point it was already more polished and complete than most on release and now that is is officially out I am blown away by the quality! I just love this game for the randomness, but usually that isn't enough for me what makes this game special is every game feels like a new story. ""Does this group have what it takes?"" I find myself asking, ""Is luck on my side today?"" sometimes I find my way through the maze and beeline to the exit, (happened on floor 10 kinda scared me because its so damn huge and I found the exit so fast couldn't even power half the rooms on the way to the exit) and the writing for the characters is awesome! Sure they don't talk much but the descriptions, plus the few intertwining stories that you may or may not hear in the elevator really flesh out the characters to a point where I find myself making up relationships between them that might fit, or thinking about how much they must hate having to work together and I will even make up friendships between heroes that end up working together throught multiple floors. (sometimes i can even encorperate one of the ""canon"" stories into it and it just feels great) On top of all that. is an amazing game that doesn't really have any peers (at least to my knowledge) sure it feels like FTL or Space Marines or what have you but it combines them all in such a way that it creates something revolutionary. I see this as almost a difficult story generating game, where the goal isn't to win but to create a good story.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I've only spent a small number of hours exploring Dungeon of the Endless, I can honestly say that I am both impressed with the state of the game already and eager to see what's in store for future updates. The visuals are already quite pleasing and polished. I love the music and the sounds fit very well with the visual atmosphere. Gameplay is frustrating at first but picks up quickly as you get the hang of the controls and figure out clever ways to survive for longer periods of time.Unfortunately, this game is still in progress. As an Early Access title, there is much left to be done with the game before the official release. Although compared to other Early Access games, this one shows a higher level of Dev-Love than most. If you have been considering buying early but haven't decided yet: get it.Nurse Deena Ratchet has been killed. Let the tears flow.			"

												This game is a hidden gem. Complete diamond in the rough. My best friend bought this for me, and I would have never anticipated the amount of joy it has brought me. It's another game from the Endless trilogy, that's an amazing combination of tower defense, dungeon crawler, and turn based roguelike games. It also has an amazing retro pixel look, which is very aesthetically pleasing. I've honestly never played anything like this. My only complaint is that I didn't anticipate it to be so highly addictive. I am currently suffering from ""one more door"" syndrome. There is no cure. In all seriousness, I cannot give this game enough praise or recommendations. At this point, I will buy anything Amplitude Studios creates. 10/10			"

								This game is shockingly fun, and I've done nothing but die repeatedly while having a great time. I'm not a fan of tower defense, but this deftly mixes TD with roguelike elements, RPG elements and squad-based gameplay. LOVE IT. Seriously, LOVE IT, and I'm not even a fan of Endless Space. ;) Get this game if you like roguelikes, squad-based games, or tower defense. It's really great.			"

												This is a unique cross between tower defense, 4X, and rogue-like game.You have 1 to 4 heroes that explore a random dungeon consisting of rooms separated by doors. Every time you open a door, monsters spawn in all the unlit areas of the dungeon and try to attack your heroes and reach your base. You can stop them by attacking with your heroes or building defenses.After the wave of monsters is done, you are safe and may build or upgrade your structures. This phase plays a lot like a 4X game where you must manage food, research, and industry. Each room can a certain number of structures of various types, and some rooms contain existing structures.Your heroes themselves level up and gain skills as they would in an RPG. Death is permanent and when all your heroes die, you must restart the game from scratch.There is a huge amount of replayability here due to the random elements and number of ships and characters you can choose. A typical game can take 3-4 hours.As with roguelikes this is fairly difficult game, particularly if you play it on the harder difficulty (there are two difficilties, mislabelled ""easy"" and ""very easy""). If you enjoy difficult games, you should like this a lot.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

												Dungeon of the Endless is a bold new take on the roguelike genre, including tower defense mechanics and strategy RPG elements. It may sound like a strange mashup, but it just works. Like the other Amplitude games, levels are generated procedurally, so expect 'endless replayability'. Add awesome pixel Art, and the usual great music by FlybyNo and you got a gem. One you shouldn't miss especially given the ridiculously low price tag!

												FTL with tower defence. Excellent concept, brilliant execution. This is a great time sink that combines elements from various games, yet manages to be original and different.Buy this, it is another example of an indie game having more depth than AAA titles. Not even in the Xcom titles or in FTL did i feel so attached to my crew members, each death spelling certain doom. You will restart a lot.11/10			"

Doom?You’re not sure how long you’ve been roaming these halls now, working your way forward and upwards, through myriad savage encounters with sentient rocks, bugs, slimes, demons, and other cavernous creatures.All you remember is that the escape pod of your prison ship crash-landed on this desolate planet a good time ago, straight into the lower levels of some kind of Endless underground facility, and your ragtag band of crew members and prisoners has been carrying the ship’s generator from elevator to elevator till now, powering up doors and automated defenses along the way.Some friendly species, equally trapped as you and craving liberty or fortune above all else, offer their services for Dust, the mystical nano-elements that go for currency around these parts.Amassing enough of this Dust substance attracts all kinds of nasty critters, but it also recharges the generator, and even provides the means to build food, industry and science stations, who in turn give you another slim fighting chance against said critters on every floor you pass by.And chances are more slim than ever. You see your comrades in arms fall around you, and nothing can get them back up. But you keep pushing, using all of your skills and resources to survive the next onslaught, until you reach the next door. What will come next? Friend or foe? A powerful artefact, or the exit maybe?And then what? If you reach the surface of the planet, how will you survive Auriga?This is the Dungeon of the Endless.This… is your past.http://www.mush-room.be/startgame/endless-enjoyment/ "

												A unique defense game that requires strategy, patience and attention. It may seem to be becoming repetetive until you switch your roster and ship tough. Nonetheless i still enjoyed every minute of it. Great music and art style imo. character dialog and bios are worth reading aswell. Multiplayer is unfortunately reserved to playing with friends as i have seen little to no public rooms. The rogue-like randomness is not as big as in other games but still noticeable. Ultimately i can recommend this to anyone who likes these kind of games. 30 hours of fun are guaranteeed here for a very reasonable price.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best roguelikes I have ever played! Maybe it's the soundtrack, or artwork, or the lore, or Amplitude Studios. Maybe I'm just straight up being a fanboy! This game really breaks away from the ""standard"" of roguelikes and brings more to the table (in my opinion) than any roguelike out there. Since the game is now in Beta, it still has a few kinks to work out. However, the upside to that is Amplitude Studios's dev team! You post on their forums and they'll get back to you ASAP! They will try to provide solutions or take it into account and try to resolve the problem! So, if you're looking to support a great indie company, have a blast with a fresh roguelike, and work with an excellent dev team, then this is the game for you!			"

												This game slowly eats time. Just thinking about the premise of the thing... it makes me feel wrong. It makes me feel like I know something that shouldn't be known. It tugs at parts of my mind with cold, worm like appendages, always reminding me that it exists. The game that should in no rational way work, or be, but it does and is. I'm certain it takes part of you with it, into its absurdity, because it leaves you sitting there wondering what you've been doing after something closes to your desktop. Because this game shouldn't exist. I refuse to accept the hours noted, the moments of blurred confusion in which I'm staring at my monitor realising two hours have passed without my knowledge. I refuse to accept this thing, this ungodly creation of some terrible, irrational reality, exists. Sometimes I just black out at my desk. And that can be normal for people, I've read about it in books. And when my hands start to shake whenever I go to open a door, I just remind myself that I've been drinking too much coffee.			"

												This is a somewhat interesting combination of RPG and Tower defense. I love this game and do not regret getting it. Spent too much time playing it and can assure you – this game is not easily beatable. It supplies tons of excitement and would be a fun thing to geek on alone, in the dark. Devs definitely have been working on this hard with updates flowing regularly, this should tell you – they take their work seriously. Not just a money scamming, riches promising DayZ-like scammery.  If you are looking for a game that lets you take your time planning your move and at the same time provides tons of escalating action, this is the game for you.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game for anyone that is looking to kill some time. It's definitely worth the money. I bought this during early access, and am usually hesitant of buying unfinished titles, due to some scoundrel developers taking the money and running with it, leaving gamers with a half-finished product. But Amplitude has a very good track record of not only finishing what they started, but also continuing with support well after the title has been released. This game is no exception. Just when I thought the game was finished, I stopped playing for a bit. I came back to this a week ago, only to find they added a bunch more characters, and new options when starting a new game. So a big kudos to them for being a developer that really puts the work into their games.Now on to the game.It's simple, yet complex. Keep your guys alive, get out of the dungeon in one piece. But you can't just rush every level, or else you will skip out on collecting a lot of much needed resources and research opportunities. Opportunities you will desperately need later on. Open too many doors at once, or have a lot of unpowered rooms, and a swarm of enemies will come your way and end your game quick. It's a fine balance between greed and fear. Try to open one more door, to try and get just a bit more resources before going to the next level, you could be hammered with 5 waves of hell. But if you skip out on it, it might hurt you in the long run.Since dungeons are randomly generated, and so are things like weapons/armor/item/artifact locations, there is an element of luck to it. But once you get the hang of it, you can make it through most playthroughs even with some bad luck.There is quite a bit of lighthearted humour from the characters in-game, which is right up my alley. From a woman who thinks she's a spider, to an overcompensating midget with a huge sword. They all have their quirks. It's not so much a band of heroes, as it is a group of unlikely misfits. You might even recognize characters from other games, such as Samus Aran..... errrr... I mean Sara Namus...The game plays a lot like a turn-based tower defense. First you decide how to set up your defenses and production, then you begin the action phase by opening a door.  That's when it goes from ""Okay, everything seems to be coming along fine, all hallways seem to be covered"" to ""CRAP! DON'T ATTACK THERE! THAT WAS MY FREAKING GENERATOR YOU JUST TRASHED YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!""All in all, as far as bang for your buck goes, I'd rate this title a 10/10. If you like cheesy humour and tower defense, don't hesitate to buy this game. You won't regret it.edit: Don't feel ashamed if you cried after losing on easy mode..... We all have....			"

												Wow okay. So a while back my friend got me to buy this game and play it with him. He had just picked it up, and wanted a team mate. We quickly discovered that ""Easy"" mode is anything but easy. But because we are MEN we vowed never to try ""Too Easy"" mode, and to eventually beat ""Easy"".64 Hours of playtime and 90 attempts later, after countless guides, meta-game planning, and honing our teamwork, we finally beat the first pod on ""Easy"" mode last night.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is hard. But there is just something about it that keeps you coming back for another♥♥♥♥♥kicking, over and over. I'm gonna break down everything there is to love about it.- The artwork is adorable and combined with the music the game really does a great job of creating a cohesive aesthetic.- The strategic options are insanely expansive, there are so many different plausible strategies.- The game not only has multiplayer, but embraces it, giving you great tools for working with your friends, including resource sharing, character and item swapping, and you can unlock pretty much everything in multiplayer mode.- Completely unique gameplay, really never played anything quite like it.- Tons of characters to unlock, and each one feels special.- one of the characters thinks she is a spider and crawls around like a maniac eating bugs off the floor and if you don't love that then we aren't friends.The game is not for everyone, though. The combat is simplistic, it's more of a macro approach, commanding your hero where to fight, but not how to fight. It fits a really small niche really really well. If you like rogue-like strategic potato-chip gameplay, this is the one for you. If you spend your free time at work creating excell spreadsheets mathing out the most effective resource generation strategies, this one is for you. If you reallym like getting into the nitty gritty of a game and being genuinely enjoyably challenged by it, this one is for you.I leave you all with this; beating Easy mode with my friend was probably the highest and more emotional moment I have ever experienced while gaming, and I am not being hyperbolic. It was probably enhanced by the shots of Kraken we had taken in anticipation of losing in the last few floors, but still. Absolutely fantastic.			"

												I had about enough of rogue-like games but Dungeon of the Endless is a whole other animal. By going down the RPG-road, taking a hard left at the tower defense genre and bringing this clevery package to a full stop at classic strategy games like dungeon keeper, DotE arrives at a unique place. It´s high difficulty, motivating character development and stage design grants the game a rare pull that keeps you coming back for more. Beautiful pixel-art, a haunting soundtrack and a good sense of humor round up what was easily one of my most enjoyable experiences this year. Don´t miss Dungeon of the Endless!			"

												after almost 150 hours in this amazing game, probably my favourite game. I finally got all the achievements. The first 30 or so hours were really frustrating and annoying but i could see the potential and that the game was balanced and fair and that every mistake i made was a learning experience. Once i got the hang of things i never lost a run. And then the achievement hunting began. And there are some difficult ones lol. Never one to look for help i tried hard to come up with my own strategies and finally prevailed and conquered them all. To all the newcomers trying out this amazing game, give it time and keep playing. It's the most unique and satisfying game i've ever played in my life.			"

												Possibly the closest a game comes to mechanical perfection, Dungeon of the Endless can be both brutally difficult and extremely rewarding both in a single turn. Forget what you know about tower defense or rogue-likes, or any of the other genres this game is thrown into. It's a unique mish-mash of ideas that somehow works, and works very well. There is a lot of great character and humor infused in the game without it ever distracting from the core experience. The visual design is beautifully stylized with a pleasantly minimal UI design. It's also an absolute blast to play co-op with up to 3 other friends.Just be ready to fail a lot early on.			"

Product received for free
												*Recieved as a gift, but would sure pay its price, worth it*Highly recommended game if you're into indies, and a mix of tower defence with rogue-like elements. The game offers you a ""Too easy"" difficulty which I skipped and went directly into easy thinking ""Meh, how hard can it be?"" Only to be devoured by waves of diverse monsters on the 2nd floor. The characters are diverse, each with their pros and cons that fill multiple roles into a team of 4, there are also 4 characters from TF2 which I absolutely love being a veteran of that game. Multiple ""modules"" to build from which offer resource income, support, defensive and offensive towers. Think tower defence, resource management and beautiful atmospheric monster hunting in a space ship with odd characters and lovely backgrounds.			"

												It's pretty difficult. If you want to play a interesting original roguelike, this is a good choice.Pros:-Resource system that actually works.-Multiple heroes.-Different types of buildings/turrets to build.-Unique art style that fits the game well, the menus and loading screens are designed nicely.-Immersive soundtrack.-Unlockable ships that offer different playstyles-You will die.Cons:Online multiplayer is very unreliable. (at least at the time of my review.) every game I played players disconnect halfway through a floor or just lag out. Long review versionYou delve into a dungeon with 2 heroes and go through the rooms clearing monsters and collecting resources. 4 resources - dust (to power rooms) science (for research) Industry (for building) and food (for leveling up and healing heroes.)The more rooms you open up, the more dangerous the dungeon gets. The limited resource dust is aquired from exploring and killing enemies. You have to manage this resource to power rooms so you don't get overwhelmed. (Enemies spawn in unpowered rooms.) which makes it a time crunch to find the exit. You have to actually plan your actions and adapt to situations accordingly.Along the way, you find equipment, and other heroes that you can recruit to your party. If you make it far enough with these heroes, you actually end up unlocking them, which is a nice feature.For the price, I think this game is great. I bought the normal version which is $12.99.If you like roguelikes and don't mind dying alot, you can get a quite a bit of replayability out of this.			"

												Take the procedural dungeon generation of a roguelike, the looting and hero-building of an action-RPG, and the research and development of a tower defense game and you'll start to get an idea of what ""Dungeon of the Endless"" is about.  You might still hate the game, but it won't be for lack of creativity.  I could probably spend a lot of words explaining the game's mechanics to you, but I'd be talking all day:  At its essence, Dungeon of the Endless is about guiding 1-4 ""heroes"" through a series of dungeon floors.  To transition floors, you must use a crystal to power the elevator.  But the crystal is heavy and fragile, and everything living inside the dungeon wants to kill it above all other things.Along the way you'll encounter new ""heroes""--some of these individuals have histories with one another (for better or worse) and each represents a unique set of potential skills in getting the hell out of the dungeon.  You'll also find an anachronistic mix of equipment--swords and machineguns, textbooks and jumpsuits--for outfitting these characters.While heroes will be your primary way of interacting with the dungeon (and the only way to get the crystal from one elevator to the next) you will also need to research and develop a whole host of ""modules"" that bolster your defenses against the dungeon hordes while your heroes search for the next exit.  There are modules for generating new sources of science (needed to research and upgrade new modules), food (needed to level-up heroes), and industry (needed to actually BUILD modules), modules for killing different kinds of creatures, modules for defense and healing, etc.  Suffice to say, your heroes probably won't get very far unless you're actively researching and developing new modules.There's also a fourth resource simply called ""Dust"", which is required to power rooms.  Modules only function in powered rooms, and powered rooms prevent monsters from spawning in them.  To keep your defenses functioning and your heroes from being mauled by monstrous swarms, you'll need to carefully route and re-route power to rooms as you explore each floor.  But for as complex as the game can be, there's an efficiency to it that makes it easy to learn but challenging to master.  There's no obligatory grinding, or dead-end research trees to waste time on, or useless skills to invest in.  You can rush through each map as quickly as it takes you to find the exit, and ignore research or heroes (at your own peril).  Everything that exists in the game has a valid role or use, with few (if any) ""traps"" to watch out for.  And that's nice, frankly, because you'll be experimenting with a lot of different strategies and dying a lot in the process.  Speaking of dying, there are a few issues with the game that may sour opinions.  For starters, dungeons can be downright stingy with Dust--the aforementioned resource that powers modules and rooms--later on in the game.  If you're not prepared for the chagrin of the RNG, a Dust-shortage can rapidly spell disaster.  Fortunately there are numerous solutions to this scenario, including Emergency Generators, Shop modules, and hero-specific skills and items that promote Dust collection...but most of them require at least a little foresight.  I don't think it's a huge issue, but some players may disagree.There's also one enemy that really doesn't work well with the game's mechanics.  It has a chance to spawn in later rooms where it mutates into a powerfully ""tanky"" and immobile monster.  Although it doesn't pose an immediate threat to your heroes, it must be killed for the game to consider the wave ended.  As a result you'll frequently have situations where everything's dead except for one (or more) of these things, they've already grown into their final form, and now you've got your heroes on rotation, taking turns whittling its health down and stepping out of the room to heal.  Alternatively, you've got to break defenses and rush out to kill them as quickly as possible...but then your (wounded) hero has to kite the inevitable horde of angry creatures back to a powered room and hope it doesn't overwhelm them.  Neither scenario really adds anything to the game.For the most part, though, Amplitude--a company known for approaching things a little differently--really delivered on Dungeon of the Endless.  It's not a perfect recipe but it's incredibly novel and, between the variety of unique heroes, loot, modules, and ""ships"" (game modes), there's a significant degree of replayability in a compact package.  The average player will find it to be thoroughly challenging while rarely feeling cheap or unfair.  Then again, the RNG is not always forgiving.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a gem of a game that mixes RTS, Tower Defense, Roguelike, RPG and resource management. It sounds messy, but works pretty well. Your objective is to protect the crystal, explore to find the exit of the floor and take the crystal there. You gain more resources for each door opened, and each door means more monster and loot.At a first glance, DotE looks like a very simple game, but as you play you'll discover a lot of depth and new strategies. There's a lot to unlock, including pictures for your album, new heroes and new ships (each ship adds new rules to the game). Each playthrough is randomly generated, so you'll never play the same game twice. This adds a lot of replay value.Dungeon of the Endless quickly became one of the best games I've ever played. I can recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience.PROS:*Very fun and addictive*High replay value*Great visuals and good optimization*Beautiful, immersive soundtrack*A lot of possibilities*Hard but fair difficulty*Satisfying to playCONS:*Bad tutorial*It's hard to tell what's going on when you're in a battle*To own all ships you need to buy the Crystal pack and Emperor pack (from Endless Legend)---I rate this game a 8.5 / 10			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless gives the system of Tower Defense a really interesting perspective.The core: every tower defense has it and the goal always remains the same, protect it and do not let it be destroyed. But what if you need to transport the core to an exit point after finding it? This is what gives this game a really interesting system to it.Basically, you start out with the core, two people to start exploring and so called ""Dust"", which is currency and the life of the core at the same time. 10 dust is needed to power a room after exploring it. Powering it will result in being able to build structures in it and make enemies not be able to spawn. Opening doors will give you resources to build things, level up or heal your team. You gain Dust by exploring further and killing enemies, which allows you to expand your base in the course of the level. Your crew is the key to getting these resources as you can place members next to built resource stations to increase thier gain per opened door, also they act as moveable turrets to keep enemies away. If all of them die though, the game's over.As the goal is to take the core and find the exit, it is important to power the right rooms, place your guys right and build the right structures. When you think you're ready for the heat, take the core by letting somebody pick it up and run for it, if the carrier dies though, it's also game over. When the core leaves the beginning of the level, enemies will spawn non-stop in every room that's not lit. Every room the core passes will not be powered any longer as the energy's not connecting to them anymore.So far it seems like a really dynamic game and like a fresh idea to the genre, and for it's early Alpha stage the game still seems very finished when it comes to the design and the systematics. I am looking forward to the content as it's added to the game and happily recommend it to everyone that is into these kind of games.			"

Early Access Review
 JOURNAL ENTRY #1  - So it appears a dual-gun wielding man and a sword wielding woman have crashed landed on this ship. The room I am in seems like a generator room with a bright yellow cube. I figure the woman should proceed first as she wields a sword which'd be better at close range and then I can send in the man to attack from a range. This worked efficiently and I managed to gather to enough resources to level up both my characters a few times.  JOURNAL ENTRY #2 - Warning symbols appear all around the generator room, I figure my objective is to protect that for now, so I use the woman's special ability which lets her move significantly faster to get back to the base. I make and it is swarmed by multiple enemies. My gunman follows and I use his special ability which buffs our damage in the room. We manage to fight off the enemies and return to exploring the ship. I now come across what I imagine to be an escape, so I grab the generator core and run using the woman's special ability to get out faster. We escape and that's floor one done. JOURNAL ENTRY #3  - After upgrading my characters a few times and equipping them with the new gear found, I continue using the same strategy as before. After reaching a shop I spend a lot of money on new equipment for my characters. Bad idea, I now have no money to spend on health. Enemies appear in the next room so I send the sword wielding woman in to fight them and send the gunman back to base. A wave comes and I manage to fight them off, but I forget about the woman who sadly gets overwhelmed with enemies and dies. After two more waves I finally find the exit and escape. Alone.  JOURNAL ENTRY #4 - Alone on the next floor, I begin searching for the rooms, I find the exit almost instantly and figure it's my best interest to escape now so I can get a good score. I grab the generator and head down. JOURNAL ENTRY #5 - This is where things start to get difficult. I begin by upgrading my character and saving enough money for healing. I start searching the rooms and each is a struggle. I narrowly survive each room and gather enough money to heal regularly. A wave is now incoming. I prepare by heading to the base. Enemies flood in from 3 directions and I fend them off the best I can. Eventually I'm overwhelmed and just like my partner, I die.This game is fantastic fun, it has gameplay like Faster Than Light with elements from The Binding Of Isaac, give it a try!			"

Review for solo-play :This game is a strange beast.It's surprisingly addictive, but it's ultimately shallow : the strategy is pretty basic and it's mostly based on knowing what's coming next. This knowledge is acquired by dying & dying again.I beat the game using a trick to backup & restore my save. Looking back on my run it feels very empty and meaningless without any special event nor excitement ; there's only the stress to be crushed by a horde of enemies coming unexpectedly without any warning... :-/The game is ultra-repetitive, even with only 1 run of 12 levels ; it splits like this :- Levels 1-3: learn the basics- Levels 4-6: rolling easily, except for mistakes coming from the annoying interface- Levels 7-11: running low on Dust, which means we have to use towers more & more to stop the big waves of monsters- Level 12: rush to the exit, as there's almost no build slot anymoreLuck (or its absence) matters way more than skill. I did & re-did many times some levels, doing more or less the same thing, only to win easily thanks to an efficient layout.The Tower Defense part is dim in the 2nd part of the run, and totally negligible in the 1st part.And the length of a full run (around 6-9hours) is just too long for starting all over again every time you die.In a close concept, I'd highly recommend FTL which succeeds everywhere DotE fails (except it's not Coop ;-) ).Pros :- Very unique set of rules & mix of concepts- Very intriguing at 1st- If you get into it, decent replayability with new modes offering slightly different rulesCons :- Luck matters way more than skill- Strategy is actually pretty basic- Highly repetitive- No special event- Only 2 difficulty levels : ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" ; and ""Easy"" ain't easy, it's more like ""Hard""... I guess the developers of this game must have a high esteem of the quality of their humor. They shouldn't.- Pixel art is a total mess : it's nearly impossible to see what's going on when there's a ton of enemies crushing in the same roomDebunking the Steam Store Page Description :exploring an ever-expanding dungeonNo, the dungeon doesn't expand.all while facing waves of monsters and special eventsNo, there's no noteworthy special event (the only one I can think of is the EMF that disables your towers for a couple of rounds ; that's not exactly super exciting).Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)No, they don't have psychoses (ie: it's not Darkest Dungeon ;-) ).Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guardsNo, this doesn't have any influence on the gameplay (except maybe for the small ""trust"" bonus, but who cares about that?).Each door is a danger; prepare yourself and your team for anythingIt's only monsters. (Again.)Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layoutsWhich are all pretty basic.Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about AurigaMight be another proof of the great sense of humor of the devs : there's a little animation with meteorites falling on the planet surface with our team looking at it. The End.			"

												A fantastic rouge-like if you don't mind sitting down for a few hours (or taking breaks between sessions). Campaigns can last anywhere from an half an hour to 4~5 depending on your skill level. It can be brutally difficult and has an unforgiving mix of luck and strategy, but the sense of success after gambling your whole game on a single door really is something I wish I could find more frequently. The art is fantastic and never feels redundant especially with the random level layouts. The soundtrack really is something else, too!			"

												(This review was very close to the beta entrance.)Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike-dungeon crawler game. But... it it not exactly ""Fantasy"". It is more like... ""Sci-fi"".Consider your mind blown.Pros:+ Gameplay is fun if you like exploration and strategy (which I do).+ Replay value is pretty good.+ Handling resources makes this game challenging.+ Pixel graphics are amazing (good job devs :D ).+ GRRRRREAT soundtrack if you like light-ish dubstep.+ No two replays are the same. Random events are common.+ Humor. The best.Cons:- Story. The plot is REALLY interesting, but they don't build on it enough in my opinion.- Repitition. March of 2014 I stopped playing this because of boringness, but it has really changed from then.- It takes a while to unlock all the gamemodes.All in all, if you like The Binding of Isaac, I recommend buying this.

												WoW... this game surprised me a little. There are 2 difficulty. Easy and Very Easy. If you think it's simple you got tricked. Instead of Easy and Very Easy it's actually Hard and Impossible. Took me 7 trys to get the hang of it and finally finish the Easy on prison ship. You gota give them credit to make a basic TD game into something much much more. Graphic is a little more to be under par but it's good enough once learn the ropes and fully understood the concept of ""keep as many room lighted as possible"", ""heavy Defense at chock point"", ""Focus Hero attack"", ""Learn to Operate"", ""Learn to Repair"". Soon you will be drawn into the game and forget the time.Getting most of the achievements are easy and i was able to get about 7 on my first victory but getting all achivments needs a lot grinding and many different replays with each different ships. Got a strange bug that i complete the game with 4 hero but i was only credited for 3... I would defintly recommend everyone to get and try this game. Do not give up when you play the first few attempts, keep on trying. You will jump out of your chair cheering when you complete this game for the first time.			"

												Now, I haven't played this game as long as some people, but I have to say that it is one of my favourite games I've played in a very long time. A quick run down of the Single Player mechanics (Multiplayer is basically the same thing, except you control one hero from the start but you can have 4 people start)From the start, you pick two heroes. These heroes have four stats: Speed, Health, Strength, and Wit.Speed helps you move around the rooms faster, but most heroes who have the highest Speeds tend to have the lowest Health and Strength. Speed is also used for moving the crystal around for when you find the exit.The Crystal is what you have to defend with your life. It acts as your power source for the rooms you encounter, and if it gets destroyed, it's game over. You can only pick up the crystal after you have found the exit.Health lets you tank rooms which have the lowest defenses or if you need to hold a choke point. The heroes wth high Health tend to have high Strength as well, but low Speed and Wit. You'll normally want to place these heroes in rooms that aren't powered, whether that's because you don't have enough Dust to power every room, or if it's because you want to conserve your Dust for the rooms that you're exploring.Dust is what you use to power your rooms, and it's gathered by the Crystal. If the Crystal gets damaged, then your Dust count lowers. When it hits 0, you've lost the game. Dust is collected from three places- Opening doors, killing monsters, or operating on a Store module that has a shopkeep in it. I'll get into modules later, but the only definite way to 100% get Dust in every single room is by operating on a Store module.Strength is what determines how much damage you'll do to enemy monsters. High Strength heroes tend to be the most diverse, allowing for high Health, high Wit, or high Speed, but if a hero has two high stats, the other two are going to be extremely low. These heroes are the ones you want opening doors.When you open a door, it will generate your Industry, your Science, and your Food, as well as having the chance to find Dust. Opening a door will also spawn monsters that you'll have to deal with, lest they will kill your heroes and destroy your Crystal. There are also certain things that you can find when you open a door: Cryo pods, Heroes lost in the dungeon, a Dust generator, and a Crystal which allows you to research different modules. These all have a random chance to occur, and if you find one, then you won't spawn monsters. I don't have time to go into every detail about each of these things, but just know that they're there.Wit determines how much of a certain resource you'll gain when operating on a module. That's pretty much all Wit does for you in the long run. The higher your Wit, the more resources you'll generate when operating on the module that corresponds with that resource. High Wit heroes are important, though. You'll understand why when you start playing.Modules are how you generate more resources, and there are three of them to start out. Industry, Science, and Food Generators, each of them generating more of their respective resources, and they cost indurstry to create. There are also Minor Modules, which you can place on the small module location, and they can serve a multitude of purposes, too many to explain, but you start with a single one, a ""Prisoner Prod,"" the weakest of the attack modules. To get more modules and to upgrade them, you're required to use Science on a research Crystal.So what about food? Food is used to level up your characters and heal them on the way. Levelling your heroes causes their stats to go up, but it also raises the costs of your healing.There are two modes: Easy, and Too Easy. Don't let this go to your head, Easy is extremely difficult and should only be played if you're experienced with Dungeon. You should play Too Easy first to get a handle on everything, and it'll save you a lot of time and energy if you do.Easy starts you off with less resources, less resources generated from opening doors, more costs for healing and placing your modules, as well as less module health.Too Easy starts you off with more resources, more resources generated from opening doors, less costs for healing and placing modules, and more module health.That's about it for now. There's a lot that I still haven't covered, but the rest of it can be explained by playing the game.This game is a lot of fun but it's extremely difficult and requires a lot of patience and time to complete even just one game. My average winning games take about two and a half hour on Too Easy, just a heads up.Kick some♥♥♥♥♥and don't get lost heroes!			"

												Wow. I wish I had an option somewhere between yes and no. This is fun, but ultimately it is almost entirely ruled by a random number generator. I had a good time figuring out the mechanics, but after the fifth dungeon where I was only offered terrible upgrades (a mixture of hero oriented and tower oriented upgrades which did not play well together) and received almost no dust for opening doors in a highly branched and un-linear environement (thus being unable to reduce mob spawns or place defence effectively) I got pretty frustrated. I suppose that's the nature of ""rogue-likes"", but even Angband would allow you to regenerate a level if you got dealt total crap (assuming you could find an up staircase). In this game, if you get dealt awful it will follow you until you die (probably somewhere around level 6 or 7). It's the biggest failling of this game. Sometimes (frequently?) you will be handed a pile of steaming crap. In other rogue type games, part of the skillset is being able to recognize this and bailing appropriately. In this game, one bad level will follow you since your resource totals persist over levels, mobs get increasingly harder as you descend, and there is no going back to earlier levels if you had to bail due to terrible RNG. If there had been some option to redo a very unlucky level, I'd give this a yes. As it stands, your only option is to go deeper and there were many, many games where I knew I was done for well before I actually died. If the developers had offered some way to mitigate this, I would give this an unhesitanting thumbs up. Unfortunately, they didn't.			"

												A relentless pseudo-turn based dungeon crawler, with no end of challenge. The game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties: Too Easy, and Easy. Don't let these difficulty titles fool you, they're a lot more daunting than they seem. The dungeons are unforgiving, one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon. The already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon. The greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isn't the monsters, it's the random number generator. What's in the next room? Monsters? Dust? A much needed damage-per-second, or utility hero? Maybe the room will be empty. Who know's what's in store for you in the depths of the Dungeons of the Endless. This game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler.			"

												DotE is a hardcore roguelike where you have to gradually explore a large ship crashed in space. You unveil rooms one by one whilst levelling a large variety of characters. You start with two and can have a maximum of four all of which will have different upgradeable skills, uses, and equipment. It soon becomes apparent that this is more of a tower defence game than anything else and one which takes a fair bit of getting used to. I didn't like it very much at the start but if you can push through the obligatory constant deaths of a tough roguelike then you will unearth a decent tactical game with a large ammount of replay value. Not being a huge fan of roguelikes myself I was surprised to find myself both engrossed with, and mildly addicted to, it. It is very reasonably priced despite often being offered in bundles, as is its DLC, making it excellent value for those who persevere with it.			"

												This game is a blast. Think dungeon keeper as a rogue-like but with only a few units, and heavily influenced by RPG mechanics. Basically, you start out in a randomly generated dungeon, and your goal is to find a room with the exit. All rooms can be ""powered"", which means enemy monsters will not spawn in them, and allows you to build all sorts of defenses, offenses, and resource generators. Whenever you open up a new room, it is counted as you taking your turn. Once you take your turn, enemy monsters will spawn in rooms that you do not have enough resources or ""dust"" to power up, and try to attack either your heroes or your crystal which is like your ""heart."" If all your guys die, or your crystal's dust reaches 0, you lose and have to make a new game. It gets increasingly tricky to balance everything as you get into later levels, so you'll die a lot at first.Pros:- Randomness makes each playthrough unique.- Even though your heroes just sit there auto attacking enemies, you have to constantly watch their health bars and be ready to use active abilities or micro them to another room. It can get a little frantic.- Music and sound effects are great and totally pleasing.- Strategic placement of modules and traps is rewarding.- Self-Powered Rooms.- Heroes have a decent amount of variation and customization.- The art looks cooler as the game progresses.Cons: - There could be a little more variation in random occurances in rooms. After a little more than a few playthroughs, I had seen all the random room events. Off the top of my head I can think of many more which wouldn't be hard to implement, such as ""Trade a hero permanently for 50 food?"" or ""Trade 30 science for 20 dust and 20 industry?"" Very simple things to spice rooms up a little more.- Multiplayer has given me and my friends a lot of headaches. I keep trying to play with people and I get disconnected, or I get de-synced. I haven't been able to get past a couple levels without something going awry, so I have nothing else to say about the rest of multiplayer.- Slightly lacking in variation of mobs. I was hoping there was a ""boss"" mob or randomly generated super enemies. After one-two playthroughs, you won't see any different mobs unless you got further than you did the last time.Misc:- For all the RPG elements in the game, it's weird they didn't include critical hits. At least I haven't seen any. "

Early Access Review
								As a fan of both Tower Defense games and Rogue-likes I have to say this game is fantastic! It's not that much of a tower defense game (even though it has strong influences from the genre, like waves after waves of mobs and module/tower building) as it is a resource-management and a survival game.This game is step-based, meaning you have to open doors in the dungeon, and after each door is opened you gain resources depending on how many active modules you have and an action phase starts where mobs rush to your crystal room. Game is real-time during the action phase, but it can be paused to plan your strategy accordingly.There is a lot of depth in this game from things like:- many heroes, all of them with stat progressions, levels, abilities and personalities- many constructable minor and major modules, that offer effects to your rooms, heroes or resources- research system, that allows you to unlock module tech by spending science- item system that lets you tweak heroes in various ways (each hero can hold 3 items in special slots)- though monsters, most of them with special effects - interesting progressive dungeon rooms, with good visuals, and many bonuses to be exploredBonus points:- great minimalistic artstyle- soothing soundtrack- great gameplay- future potential as the devs continue to develop it- devs are great and they are updating the game frequently- endless hours of fun- challenging gameplayBad points:- can be too difficult- still in early developmentI really recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge and a good old rogue-like, with a modern feel.

Posted: November 8, 2014
												This game is really hard to place. It has a great art style, and brings new ideas to the table when it comes to the roguelike genre. Here's the kicker: it's not balanced. This might require some explanation.You start the game off with 2 heroes and they gain minor stat increases and activated abilities by leveling up. To level up it takes food. Your ability to get food is based on the number of rooms you can power using dust which drops off monsters. Now it seems pretty straightfoward that you should unpower rooms in order to accumulate more dust from monsters, but if you spawn more monsters it gets harder every time you open another room. Also, if you unpower rooms you can't accumulate income from the modules you place, and the turrets and support modules won't work in that room. So you want to be saving up industry, food and science but you can't do that if you unpower rooms. Dungeon of the Endless actively punishes the player for doing well, making it more difficult to push their advantages. It also becomes extremely deadly when the player is behind on item upgrades, industry and dust. To me, at least, that is the polar opposite of how a roguelike game should be balanced. It's just not fun!Each run of this game takes a TON of hours to complete. There's 12 floors in a run and if you want to succeed you really need to open nearly every door per floor. It's the only way to get resources, so you have to! The game gets repetitive really quickly in this way. I really wish they would trim down the floors per run. It would feel more roguelike increasing the enemy diversity you encounter per floor. Another problem is the number of enemies the game spawns negates the level of effort put into art design. Have fun watching a pixelated sword flash inside a mob of 40 pixelated enemies which would like awesome if there were only a few but endless is definitely the correct term for the number of enemies spawning.I also have found the concept of using heroes in a turret defense, but placing more weight on research and turrets quite confusing. They have spent considerable time developing these characters and putting them in the spotlight but discouraging gameplay revolved around leveling your heroes quickly.I'll mention briefly all merchants were bugged on release, however the devs have caught on and said it's being fixed in their next patch. Unfortunately the bug made the game virtually unplayable as your items could get stuck in your inventory, and merchants are the primary source of upgrades for your heroes. Multiplayer seems tacked on, much like Risk of Rain's multiplayer which is still quite buggy. Most community posts concerning multiplayer have been negative. Honestly I don't know why roguelikes are even including multiplayer it's really not the point!Unless something BIG happens to change the game balance I simply can't reccomend Dungeon of the Endless. The experience has been more frustrating than fun, albeit some interesting concepts.			"

It's definitely worth the value.But if you want more cotent in the ame, you're going to have to download some DLC. Some of it is free but others aren't (unfortunately).In the end, my rating is this:8.5/10. Would rage again.			"

												A unique entry to evergrowing roguelike genre and one of the best I’ve played. Dungeon of the Endless skillfully merges both turn and real time based strategy in a way I’ve never seen before. It strikes almost a perfect balance between luck and strategy. It keeps you on an edge but is fair. Things can be chaotic but there's a logic in that. Dungeon of the Endless is rich in playable characters and game modifier accompanied by pleasing visuals. Because of that, I name it a top tier roguelike.Final score : 8/10The good :-	Addictive with “just one more turn” syndrome-	Pleasing presentation-	Unique gameplay-	Fair and balanced but also keeps you on your toes-	Variety in simplicityThe bad :-	UI is not as informative as it should be-	Equipment and gear is not as numerous as in other roguelikes-	Humor is kind of meh-	Lacks a story			"

												Shortly after I finished Dungeons of the Endless (DotE) on ""Easy"" difficulty, I went back to playing The Witcher 3 for one of the expansions. I had played 105 hours of DotE, so I laughed when I saw that I had played 111 hours of The Witcher 3 (only 6 hours more!).DotE is just that good. The only game to which I can make a direct comparison is FTL: Faster than Light. Both are roguelike, both involve exploring a ""dungeon"", and both require you to make decisions regarding which heroes should be stationed in which rooms. The classic ""risk vs reward"" theme applies in both cases.But I stopped playing FTL after about 25 hours. Whereas I hit a wall with FTL's difficulty and gave up; with DotE I couldn't help but throw myself at that same wall over and over again. Although the ""Easy"" difficulty can be brutal (nice troll on the developers' part), the game does reward experimentation over time.For example, do I start with heroes that focus on fighting, limiting the research I can do on better modules? Or do I begin with heroes that have high ""wit"" (i.e. - ability to help generate more resources). Or do I try to balance the two? Or as yet another option, do I have one or more heroes that focus on generating ""dust"", a crucial resource in the later levels?This extends to things like......leveling: do I try to level up my heroes evenly? Or just focus on my fighters?...research: do I concentrate on offensive modules (turrets, mines, etc.)? Or defensive ones (defense buffs, life steal, etc.)? And how much of my research should go to making the modules that generate most of my resources better?...exploration: do I keep opening rooms on the current floor, getting resources with each door but risking a huge monster onslaught? Or do I just run for the exits?If you Google ""Dungeons of the Endless strategy"", you will find helpful answers to these questions. But I would encourage you not to do that. For me the fun was to see how far I could get without consulting the Oracle (I mean Mr. Google :D). Eventually I did have to look at the DotE wiki for some character tips, but it was still satisfying finally making it through ""Easy"" difficulty without reading a full-on walkthrough.Unfortunately I cannot comment on the multiplayer, but I have to imagine this game is a blast to play with friends. Whether you have people to play with or not, check it out!			"

												Now here's a game with some choice meat on it. Dungeon of the Endless is a sci-fi rogue-like/dungeon crawler/RTS/TD hybrid where you control a team of explorers trying to escape an underground dungeon that they crash landed into from outer space. You create a team of varied heroes, who all have different feats and strengths to climb this dungeon floor by floor. Each floor is randomized every time and to clear each floor you have to explore unlit closed rooms for an exit to bring your power crystal to the next floor. Each room you open gives you resources to either level up your crew, plant resource generators, or create towers to help defend you against monsters. Here's the catch, each unlit room has the chance to spawn monsters which will fight your heroes or ultimately attack your power crystal. You can light up each room by placing a hero in that room or by using a resource called dust, which can be collected by killing monsters or found randomly in unlit rooms. If your crystal is destroyed, or your heroes all die, you lose the game and must start a new randomized run from the ground floor.The game plays like an RTS, in that you control your heroes from a top down perspective with only your mouse. It feels like an RPG because you can level up and collect loot for your crew, and you can also pause time by pressing the space bar. However, it is crucial in your survival to learn the TD aspect of creating minor towers to help you defend your crystal. Finally the perma-death ""everything goes away"" along with the ""everything is randomly generated"" gives it that touch of rogue-like that everyone loves these days. This game is the true definition of a hybrid if I've ever seen one.Fair warning, the game is HARD. There's a strong difficulty curve when playing on what I can only see as a developer joke of a difficulty labeled ""easy"". It is not easy, you will die and you will die a lot. But like other rogues, the game has that patented addictive element of ""just one more floor"".Multiplayer is currently busted, so I can't really comment on it. There's lag spikes, desynchs which cause disconnects with no reconnect feature, and no item share functionality. If you do get a game working without disconnects, the co-op is pretty great. But do not get your hopes up, as currently it's a problem 90% of the time.However as a single player experience, this fairs very, very well. It's definitely a new favorite of mine to spend time with. Between the simply gorgeous art style, the very good soundtrack, and the interesting mish-mash of game elements that somehow just work, this game is an insanely good time. Highly recommended.			"

												One thing I certainly have to say for Dungeon of the Endless is that it's awfully hard to describe. You're basically in a ship trying to move a crystal from one floor to the next, killing enemies that spawn in unlit rooms which try to attack the crystal. The caveat being that you don't have enough power to light ALL the rooms.  Within that framework, you can make yourself better at killing enemies (leveling up or finding items) or research and drop some defenses and machines to help you do it. Playing the game typically comes down to thinking in advance about what could happen and taking chances. Should you build something that, over time, will help you research more defenses, even if you may not spend much more time in that particular level? Should you risk hanging out across the map maximizing food production, if your gun will mean the difference in whether your teammate is able to defend the crystal (or themselves).  These tense decisions keep the game engaging.			"

												It's a weird mix of games that I don't really play, specially the tower defense..But it's surprisingly fun and interesting! When you first start playing it has a ""Very easy"" and ""easy"" setting which to me translates into ""Not too bad"" and ""Oh god that person died immediately this is easy?"" but I'm not gonna say I'm the best at this sorta thing.But anyway! Basically, you crash deep in the ground, need to go up, need to protect your crystal, move crystal, enemies go woogy boogy, reach top, then yay you did it! But then there's Endless Legend which is like a continuation of the story, then something or another space. Basically stop reading this nonsense and just play it.			"

												Fantastic approach to dungeon crawling with some unusual gameplay mechanics featuring semi-turn based tactics and micro-management.I could call this game 'a mix between a party dungeon crawler and a tower defense' but that wouldn't cover all this game has to offer. You start off selecting a 'crew' which is to land inside a planet's randomly generated dungeon. Your crew is consisted of 2 to 4 heroes, which have their own skills, stats, intentory, background story and dialogue. Upon landing you explore the dungeon by opening doors to other rooms, which are hidden in a fog of war, until you open them. Every door opening counts as a turn. Each turn you gain resources, which you can then spend on: building modules which generate more resources or assist your heroes in various ways; constructing turrets and such in rooms you have already visited and sent power to; shopping for equipment and leveling up your heroes. Your ultimate goal is to find an exit/elevator on each floor and to deliver the 'crystal' you start off with in a first room to the elevator. The catch is: every 'unpowered' room you discover has a chance to spawn monsters every time you open a door. Every monster will then proceed to attack your crystal, reducing your 'dust'(A currency, required to power rooms which also serves as crystal's HP) until it's depleted. Also as soon as you take your crystal off its place - there is no turning back, monsters will spawn in every room and begin attacking you until you reach the elevator.Your progress is not limited to just leveling up your heroes and giving them equipment. Tons of random events occur in a dungeon, which offer you to hire new heroes in your party, trade your resources for a powerful equipment and research over a dozen turrets, modules and other ways to defend your crystal as you proceed through the floors.The game features a great amount of unlockable content. Characters, starting setups and an artwork gallery. Its replayability is totally on the highest of levels. Especially considering that every piece of equipment found inside a dungeon is generated with random stats.Game also features a multiplayer mode, which adds more tactical depth since you can divide the roles and do whatever you wanted to but lacked a partner controlling a character in a singleplayer mode.TL;DR : A great party dungeon crawler with a randomly generated floor structures, deep tower defense features, unique and interesting pre-made heroes and a great replayability value because of the unlocks. Also music. The soundtrack is very good.			"

 TL;DR  A 2D hybrid strategic tower defense game with resource management elements where you guide your hero towards the surface of the dungeon as you protect the crystal that is your only hope of salvation. Comes highly recommended to fans of tower defense and rough-lite games since death is permanent and every level is randomized.Game DetailName: Dungeons of The EndlessDeveloper: Amplitude Studio [Endless Space, Endless Legends]Genre: Tower Defense, Resource Management, Rogue-litePersonal Score: Hard but is cushion enough to never blame the game but instead each mistake is yours alone. What is Dungeon of The Endless? From Amplitude Studios, maker of such fine strategy games Endless Space and Endless Legends comes a game that does not match their portfolio at all, Dungeon of The Endless; a rogue-lite 2D dungeon escaping game with a dash of tower defense and resource management where every resources count and the RNG hates you.Despite being their first foray into this genre they took what works and throws out what doesnt and in the end we are left with a compact,clean and functional game where the RNG actually adds level of fun instead of pure hate and grind. Read on. Short Intro You are a prisoner sent to a new world where it shall be your duty to colonize it but just above the planet your prisoncraft explodes plunging you straight towards the planet below and stright into the bowels of an Endless Underground Complex.Will you escape towards the surface? Or will you perish along with the others? 1:Graphics 2D retro style graphics that is from the 90s style not the horrible 80s one. That means delicious looking bits of colourful pixel where it is detailed enough for us to know what we are looking at yet vague enough for us to assume a little bit.Included within the game is an album that fills up as you accomplish objectives showing short bio about the characters and monster as if it is written by a mysterious omni-present being. Beautifully done stuff overall. 2:Music And Sound Fans of the Endless series rejoice for once again Amplitude has included within your game directory the soundtrack for the game as they have always done. Melodious and well crafted music flows along as chiptune version of their usual fare brighthens up your day in the dark dungeons or in situation where all hopes are lost, carries you forward to the next game. 3:Gameplay You start the game in your chosen escape pod with 2 heroes inside and as you progress through the game, more escape pods for your future session that has their own pros and cons to consider although the starting pod is the most balance thankfully.The gameplay is fundamentally about you defending a crystal as you open doors after doors that each count as a turn and watch in horror as your supplies dwindle, the monster kills you and a myriad of other things. The crystal serve 3 function, providing you with dust so you can power up rooms and make sure nothing spawns there and as the power souce you need to escape from the current floor you are in once you found the exit. Its destruction means the end of the game session and even minor damage can easily set you back in precious Dust which does not carry over to the enxt floor.Protecting your crystal are heroes that you control up to a maximum party of 4. They can be hired with Food if you happen to find them in the dungeon and you start the game with a few of thems. Each hero are vaguely divided into several classes with the hard hitting bruiser and the fast speedster serving as an example. Conversely their class type also reflects upon their stats and equipment allowed. A trickster type simply would not be able to carry weapons with them but they serve as an important utility with their myriad of skills.As you open doors which serve as a turn indicator, monsters and other random events can happen to you and without spoiling things the theme of the floor often reflects on the danger that lies behind these doors. Enemies are divided into several sub-types that have different priority with an anti hero monster will target the hero, an anti-crystal will go straight for the crystal and boss enemy will destroy everything in their wake. They only ever spawn in dark unpowered rooms but considering doors and room outnumber your Dust resources by several magnitude you often find yourself being swarm by them the moment you open doors.To help you with that the game allows you to build modules and turrets to help lessen the diffculity a bit. Turrets and modules uses your precious industry point and science point to for both research and building purposes. Many types of turrets do not attack but give buffs and debuffs instead but sad to say any turrets you have built will be lost when you reach the next floor. Modules make you industry, science and food points respectively but their cost goes up as you place more but more efficient module can be research.... at the cost of more resource point. Industry point serves as your base building points and the occasional random room where you gamble it for goodies, science points are spent at artifacts room for researching new modules and turrets and lastly food points are used to heal, level up and recruit more heroes. But the little wrench in the whole things are the merchants, randomly spawning in rooms they demand one of your resource point for items that are useful for your hero but the thing is they will sometimes charge in Dust , your most precious resource used to power up rooms to stop monster spawn.More heroes are unlock along with new escape pods as you play through the game. Conclusion  Once again Amplitude Studios produce the same minimalist game with the same great quality soundtrack as they have always been known for and it sure is great. Death while harsh is still cushioned confortably by the game so even the loss of 2 of your heroes does not spell doom for your game session. Overall a great rouge-lite game.Final Verdict: Do it. Buy it. Tips!  Industy point is your greatest weakness early on, try to upgrade its module and carefully watch where you are spending but by late game you are swimming in dough.Merchants sell items.... they also buy. So while you can only save 4 junks to carry to the next floor it might be wish to hold on to them should you find a merchant who can buy it from you.The most badass hero often gets targeted first otherwise the game defaults to first come first serve in regard to the enemy ai so use it to your advantage.Easy is misleading, choose Too Easy First to familiarize yourself with the game.Lastly my name is Chlorique Queas and thank you for reading my review of Dungeons of The Endless.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												A mashup of roguelike, tower defense and RPG that works shockingly well. Rock solid mechanics, lots of strategic and tactical decisions to make and a buttload of content. Easy to learn, hard to master, impossible to put down once you get into it (seriously, you know the ""just one more turn"" syndrom of good 4X games?

At higher levels, the slightest mistake (or just bad luck) will send you to your death. 9/10 - Would die again.			"

												Very solid Towerdefense/Dungeon Crawler hybrid. Players pick between a roster of characters that they may expand upon while exploring the dungeon floors, and try to delve to the final thirteenth floor (in all scenarios but special start condition). Sessions tend to be very long; unless you get extremely lucky while attempting to rush.  Online sessions have saves incase you want to break it off and continue at a later time due to these long sessions, worth a pickup while on sale, as well as the Rescue Team DLC to add some new characters with some nice unique skills.

												Decisions, decisions. Every one of which could put you in a slightly better position, dramatically worse position, or end your game completely.DotE is a very unique experience that combines RPG-roguelike, tower defense, and resource management elementals into a single game - and somehow it manages to do so quite well. Every turn you have to weigh your options: Should you spend food to level up a team member? Should you hold on to it in case you need it for healing? Should you spend precious materials on defenses before you open the next door? Should you even open the next door at all? Maybe it's better to head for exit while things are relatively safe.. Research new defenses?.. Research better resource production? Maybe you should just hold on to those research points in case you happen to run across a merchant who uses them as currency.. Maybe you should head north.. maybe east.. Maybe you should cut the power to one room and risk monsters spawning there next turn in order to power another room and make that section safer.This game is a constant struggle with choices.. and more often than not you don't know in advance which is the better option in the remote or even immediate future. But you'll have fun learning as you go and slowly ascending further and further up the levels with each game (Except for the ones where things just go horrible wrong - Which will probably be most of them)			"

												Just noticed this on sale and have to say it is most definitely worth the price!!!  I'm a big fan of games that rely more on original content than super beefy graphics, and game like this are exactly why.It's a totally new twist on the tower defense genera.  It's addicting and challenging and the artwork gives the game an atmosphere that honestly hits the spot for me.  You have a variety of characters to choose from to start, as well as encountering and unlocking new ones along the way.  Each has bit of a back story.  Nothing over-thought, but each entertaining in themselves.  There is even a bit of a back story that unfolds between certain characters when you play them together.  You have three seprate types of resources to collect.  You do this by building modules which produce these resources evey time you open a new door in the dungeon.  These module, like the others, can be upgraded along the way.  Food is used to heal and upgrade your characters.  Science is used to unlock and upgrade new modules to build.   And a mechanical resources is used to build new modules.  It's definitely worth your resources to invest in modules that produce mechenical resources to begin with.  Modules are build on nodes, each room having a differnt number of nodes, some having none.  In order for the nodes or modules build on nodes to function the room must be powered.  Rooms are powered by ""dust"" which is a resource you collect by exploring new rooms that can also be lost if the enemies reach your crystal and damage it.  Use the nodes to build modules of various types that defend agains enemies that have a chance of spawning in unpowered rooms each time you open a new door.  This makes it important to strategize the order in which you open doors and to distribute the power to each room in a way that hopefully gives you some degree of control over which direction the enemies will attack from.  Your heros also attack enemies authomatically.  You can control them as far as telling them which room to be in, as well as equiping them with special items, clothing/armor, and weapons.  In some cases they can gain the ability to repair modules or be assigned to increase the productivity of resource producing modules after staying in a room for more than one (door opening) turn.  Protect your crystal, and your characters, build modules to defend against monsters and produce resources,  and find the exit elevator for each floor.  Once you find the elevator and open the remaining doors on the floor to collect as many resources as possible, choose one of your characters to carry the crystal to the elevator and have them, the crystal, and all of your charactrers in the elevator room to click the escape button and move to the next floor.  Steam says I've only spent just over 19 hours playing this game, but I'm certain I've played it much more.  For some reason it doesn't seem to always record my hours when I'm in offline mode.  In any case, should you decide to pick it up, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  There's tons more to unlock that I haven't gotten anywhere close to accomplishing yet, which means it's a game I will likely be coming back to off and on for years to come. "

												I got this game because it looked like it would provide me with a lot of fun for while I'm relaxing and away from work. Well, it did...except the more playthroughs I completed the more stressed out I got. Let me explain: The game is a rogue-like/tower defense mix that provides glorious, wonderful, random fun and it slowly gets harder and harder in a good way as you make ur way through the 12 levels of the dungeon to escape and win. The thing is, when you get to the last few levels, the fun starts slowing down and it slowly starts to feel like ur working again. The diffuculty is ramped up so much, even on very easy and I feel like I have to follow a guide on specific tactics in order to beat the last few levels and there isn't much room for choosing from the huge variety of options the game provides you. In my first few playthroughs I had so much fun...trying out different things, discovering different things, and did stupid stuff just because it was fun. In my later playthroughs, it was just stressful money saving, building, and preparing for those last few levels because the resources you save earlier on can the experience you earn will carry on with you to the later levels, and you will need every bit of resource or experience you can squeeze out from the earlier levels because it gets really really hard. I found that after awhile, I couldn't even enjoy the earlier easy levels anymore after having the knowledge of what's to come. This is a problem for me because this happens even if I choose the very easy difficulty. This wouldn't be a problem if they saved the stressful end-game for the harder difficulty levels and let me have my random mindless fun on very easy. If I wanted to have stressed out, intense, sophisticated planning, sitting on edge of my seat every time I started the waves, I would have picked very hard difficulty.I love the art and the game mechanics and the randomness to death but I can't recommend this game anymore because I feel like a game like this should just provide non-stop fun. That's just my humble opinion and some people may actually want to get this game for the challenge it provides. I've seen the insane amount of changes this game has gone through and the devs have my respect for their willingness to adapt. In short, I'm too worried about saving up for the last few levels to actually enjoy this otherwise glorious game.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a treasure of a game. It's slow and methodical, and yet I always get tense as I go further in and try to escape the depths of the dungeon! There's so much customization in the game, you can build however you want to build and play however you want to play. It's a seamless blend of turn-based strategy, roguelike and tower defense and I haven't found anything quite like it since. It's so engrossing that you forget you have other obligations sometimes! Thus, for the Steam Awards 2016, I nominate this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award!			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of The Endless is overall a great game for being in such an early state.  With just 7 of the 30 characters and only 3 levels of madness to play through so far in it's Alpha State, it is truly a fun take on a Rogue-Like Dungeon-Defense game! I am already greatly anticipating the next update of content to gingerly explore door by deadly door!

												Now that I have beat 2 pods and played 20 hours, I feel that I am experienced enough to write a review on this little gem. Does this game give a tutorial? Yes... but it is very minimalistic. Even the tutorial says that you will learn the rest by simply dieing repeatedly, and learning from your mistakes and/or experiences! If you are easily frustrated or want something casual I would maybe stear cleer of this one.  It's not a game that you need to set aside a couple hours at a time to play. You can save whenever you want, and once you get the hang of it it's not all that ""hardcore"". Once you learn your basic skills and get some confidence be carefull it is very easy to become over confident and this will lead to a quick and painful death! Dungeon of the Endless is not impossible or insanely hard however it is very punishing. By punishing I mean that even a little mistake will cost you a hero or two, or some serious dust! So place your turrets carefully, guide your heroes, tread lightly, and escape that pod!			"

												I refunded this game not long after getting it. No, not because it's a bad game, it has an awesome concept don't get me wrong. I refunded it because it was not my type of game.For someone like me used to instant rewards, this game just wasn't my style (irony is I love pixel art styles)As much as I like strategy, I have little to no patience. The game is also pretty difficult, so combine the patience it takes to get from ""here to there"" then maybe failing and having to do it all over... Ugh. So as much as I would like to say I don't recommend this game, that's my personal opinion, and I can't give a bad review for a game that's good. So I recommend this to people who actually pay attention to what they're buying (Look at the genres). This is a hardcore, patience-requiring tower defense game. If I wasn't corrupted by FPS games, I might've really enjoyed this game.			"

												Every now and again a little bit of magic happens. This game is one of those little bits of magic.In a nutshell Dungeon of the Endless is a hybrid realtime/turn-based, procedural, squad survival strategy game, with RPG elements, resource management, research, building, maintenance, permadeath, humour, and a large roster of unlockable characters to play with. Quite a bit in that nutshell right?Generally when game designers try to create hybrids it all goes horribly wrong and you end up with something that's mediocre at best. That is not the case with Dungeon of the Endless. After 20 hours of trying to rise above the deceptively simple challenge of fighting my way to the surface through 13 floors I have come to the conclusion that this game is flawless. I cannot fault it. Everything just works and feels right. It is simply a gem of game design.Five stars from me. "

												Simply put, it's a rogue-like squad-based strategy game, but it is much more than that. This amazing indie game features elements of tower defense, RPG, 4X Strategy, dungeon crawling, and brings it all together in a unique experience.It is similar to FTL in that it is addicting and you can replay the game multiple times with drastically different experiences (different team heroes, sometimes you find the exit right away, others you comb through the entire dungeon), and you progress by unlocking new (characters and) ships, which unlock new modes.The normal difficulty is actually quite hard already, and if you unlock the Sanitary ship it is the real Hard Mode (which is basically impossible for new players lol). Try your hand at it. You will be pleasantly surprised :-)EDIT: I would not buy this for the co-op multiplayer mode, unless you have friends to play with. Public matches are filled with leavers, and since the game lasts 3-5 hrs to complete, its not reasonable for 4 strangers to stay that long for 1 run.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a complex and unique tower defense roguelike. It's an addictive mix of resource management, risk taking, and hectic realtime repositioning when things go wrong. It's also a complex and challenging game, even on the easiest difficulty setting.The good:- Strategy matters a lot- Challenging, even on easiest setting- The Endless universe shared with other Amplitude games is coolThe bad:- Floor generation is too random, especially in the later levels. A good roguelike should punish the player for their mistakes, not for bad luck with level generation- It does get repetitive fairly quickly, even with a big roster of heroes			"

												Seen a video of this game posted by Quill18, finally a company capturing the incredible visual astetics old games once had, and the gameplay seemed enjoyable as well, I was sold.Game has just enough strategy to have a nice learning curve, i enjoy it a great deal and think it would be one of my go to games when i want to burn a few hours on a run for practice. It requires some understanding of basic ""economy"" principals learned from game like starcraft, in addition to that you are required to make some resonably logical albit a little casual decisions, if you apply all that you are set to win very easy(the lower of two difficulties, other one being ""easy"").

												Dungeon of the Endless is a game of resource management, calculated risks, and careful positioning... as well as frantic re-positioning when the monsters inevitably overrun your defences. Each door you open grants resources that can be used immediately or stockpiled for later floors, but every room you reveal and can't afford to power becomes a spawn point for monsters. Before long you've created a sprawling maze of dark and dangerous corridors, and you're desperate to find the exit. Finally, after one too many close calls, you'll stumble across the elevator to the next floor. And you'll think, ""maybe I should open just more door...""			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a terrific blend of RPG, RTS, TBS and Tower Defense elements that forces you to evolve not just your gameplay strategy, but your thinking paradigm as you advance. It also carries the inevitable 'pondering a potentially deadly situation' and 'permadeath punch' of a true roguelike.The core mechanic is exploring a dungeon level to find a rare resource 'dust' in order to power rooms to carry your crystal from a central location to the 'exit'. Dust is always in short supply, and so you will find yourself forced to leave rooms unpowered. Unpowered rooms allow a variety of incresingly powerful monsters to spawn, who will attack towards your crystal.You can use module slots located in each of the rooms to power either major modules (which give a resource boost); minor modules (which assist your chracters) or turrets, which defend the rooms. Balancing these out will be key to  a successful run. After you're done placement, you choose which door/room to open next, and a wave of monsters spawns from the unpowered rooms. If you survive, you major modules produce resources, allowing you to build more... and you either open another room, or make a break for the exit with the crystal. Deciding when to quit the floor becomes a critical strategic decision with a well-balanced double-edged risk vs. reward mechanic: milk a floor for all the resources it's worth and risk being overrun enitrely, or cut loose and make a panicked run for the exit?The characters trying to escape are varied and range across a variety of skills and playtypes, and finding a combination that plays to your micromanagement style (or lack thereof) is one of the game's brilliant design features. Especially when a key character dies and you're forced to substitute them with someone you're not as comfortable with/have to learn, or make do without.A lot of love has gone into the level and character design, and the pixel art is terrific. Sadly, the music from the launch trailer vastly outstrips anything in the game itself (and is also not on the soundtrack, for some unfathomable reason).This is a great game to experience core elements of different genres at the same time, without getting bogged down in the trappings of each (it allows the player a great deal of freedom in how to approach the game, at least initially). Highly recommended, but also fair warning: this will not be an 'easy' win for the casual or AAA gamer--mistakes come swiftly and are fatal.btw: The music from the 'Rogue Life' trailer for the game is the track 'On and On' by Tom Hillock. You can buy the album off Bandcamp. You're welcome :)			"

												Great game, with some glitches.. However the game is sooo good that you dont really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them. No joke. Thats how good it is.. Seriously though i really hope the developers polish this game up and fix alot of the issues with multiplayer. Having no save function in multiplayer means having to commit to atleast 3-6+ hours. Which isnt ideal... another huge problem is no reconnectability.. soo if you DC, it's curtains to you and your 3-6+ hours of time spent. There are also a small amount of flat out glitches in the  game.. like somtimes you cant buy or sell from a merchant. Or sometimes your cant equip your items..It just makes things more difficult sometimes.. Its funny though, even though ive been ♥♥♥♥ed over countless times by those glitches, i still play because its just that good. It almost feels like they want it to be, not only hard in game, but also hard IRL.. playing in co-op requires TONS of teamwork, and having no voice chat funtions in-game, no reconnectability and no save makes it feel like they dont want you to play with friends.. Even though this game has its issues i cannot argue with the gameplay. The amount of strategy needed in this game is absurd.. The kinds of ideas and decisions you need to come up with to make it out of your first shuttle is rediculous. Its not just hard because all the mobs are diverse and all priotize their attack on different things.. its not just hard because it requires you to spend resources efficently.. its hard because it forces you to think and prepare for any little thing that might happen.. Its like having a knife fight with RNGesus. The graphics are classic 32bit style, extremely well done.. the lighting is amazing and the effects are extremely pleasing to the eye.The soundtrack is amazing.. it gives you chills while youre playing especially in the most tense moments. This game is a master piece and deserves to be in everyones library. 10/10 = Single Player8/10 = Multiplayer (FIX YOUR BEAUTIFUL GAME... PLEASE)			"

Unique mix! - 7/10Introduction:'Dungeon of the Endles' is really something special and it's hard to describe, what it really is. Throw the following genres: tower defense, strategy, RPG, economy management, dungeon crawler and a tiny breeze of gambling into a mixer and have a delicious juice. I'm not sure how to describe the result, so just let us stick to the name 'Dungeon of the Endless.' The game acts in the 'Endless Universe' like 'Endless Space' and 'Endless Legend'. Unlike the other 2 games is 'Dungeon of the Endless'no 4X game, but if you have already played an Endless title, then you will notice, that the game shares the same background story (most notably races) and the typical ressources like Dust, Food, Industry and Science, which is pretty great. The Endless universe is awesome and it's really adorable to see, how AMPLITUDE Studios is handling it and how different AND successful games of the same universe can be.Before you can start your journey you have to choose a capsule and your starting hero(es). Why a capsule? Because your spaceship will blow up and you're forced to make an emergency landing (story at store page)! There are several unlockable capsules to choose from and each provides a different challenge. Your objective is to defend your energy crystal, to find an exit in form of an elevator and to finally carry your crystal to the exit (which will summon endless hordes of monsters), stage after stage (most capsules have 12 random generated stages) until you have reached the surface...alive. You don't navigate your characters directly, instead you can send them from room to room and they automatically engage in combat, once they've reached the target area. Skills, levelups, healing, research, building and vendor actions are completely under your control. To find the exit you'll have to open A LOT of doors. One newly opened door = one turn. You will gain ressources (Industry - needed for modules, Science - needed for research, Food - needed for healing + lvlup, Dust - needed to light up dark rooms) according to your production rate. You never know, what's hiding behind a closed door. It can be a group of monsters, recruitable people, monsters, a vendor, monsters, resources, monsters, research stations, monsters, the exit or nothing. More monsters can only spawn in dark rooms after every turn. They don't have to, but they can. You can switch the light on for 10 dust per room, but you're only able to light up a room, which is next to an already powered room and the power supply always has to be connected all the way to your crystal. Usually you're not able to light up the whole stage and this is the point, where the real fun begins. You have to spread your power and make decisions, where and how you want to put up your defenses and how to move on with your exploration. There are very different types of enemies. Some will hunt your people, others are magically attracted by your crystal, some prefer to simply destroy all your modules and others...oh god how I hate them...want to open even more doors, which can lead to a total apocalypse. Luckily you can research and upgrade loads of different modules to increase your production and defense, but usually you will have a hard time, which will force you to grind and open more doors. It will become an addiction, even if you don't really need more at the moment, but more is always better, right? Right. And then the moment will come: stage 10, 11 or 12, everything is fine, just one more door and boooom, hell on Auriga, 2 hours wasted, AGAIN. So keep in mind: one single door can lead to a massive escalation. Don't become to greedy, especially if you've already found the exit! Pro:unique and interesting game conceptlovely artstyle and animationsunique and very different charactersfunny elevator conversationsrandom generated levelsdifferent capsules provide interesting different challengeshigh replayabilityit shares the same fictional universe, ergo references, and resources like it's the case in Endless Space and Endless Legendloads of different modular unitsit makes fun with friendsaddictiveContra:it could need a higher number of different itemsitems like armor or weapons don't change the visual lookmore possible conversations would be niceonly 2 difficulties and even the easiest one can become very in brutal in the last stages oftenmultiplayer has still some connection problems -> Devs are working on itno save function and midgame join option in multiplayer (your game is doomed, if one of your friends disconnects or you have to go) -> Devs are working on itConclusion:The game has triggered a door addiction for me. I could wander all day long through my home and open doors, close them and open them again...so satisfying, aw yeah. On a more serious note: the game is pretty great, addicting and the blend of different game genres works surprisingly well, which turns the game into something purely unique. My experience in single- and multiplayer was very good. However, the multiplayer has still some flaws like connection problems and no save/load function, which can ruin the fun sometimes, but the devs are aware of it and are working on it. If you're merely looking for a great multiplayer experience, then you should definitely wait for the update and keep your money in your pocket, BUT don't forget about this gem of game. If you prefer to play alone or don't have any friends (please insert 'forever alone meme'), then I can really recommend it to you. There are some things, which could be improved in my opinion and along with the multiplayer flaws I have to give 'Dungeon of the Endless' a 7/10 for now. The game deserves a 8/10, once the multiplayer is really finished. It's still a great game!7/10 ...just one more door----------------------~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion? Feel free to make a comment. "

												While a degree of luck will lead you to a quick success, a certain amount of strategy and planning of resources will be necessary for the long haul. Dungeon of the Endless is addictive in its simple concept, but also has many layers underneath its core design as a rogue-like tower defense game.For 13 dollars and with the newly released online multiplayer, it promises its worth and delivers.

												""Oh, this seems simple enough.""""The enemies aren't *that* tough.""""If I keep this up, I can escort the crystal to the end of the floor easily.""~EXIT FOUND~""I should probably move the crystal.""ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSERoguelike that appears to be a mixture of FTL's pause based gameplay, tower defence and a few other interesting elements.Pseudo real-time, in the sense that combat happens dynamically but resource generation is gated to 'turns'. A 'turn' is triggered when you open a new door, and once you open all doors on a floor (unless there is some other way to generate resources outside of discovery and 'turns'), you're at an impasse until the next floor.The visuals appear retro in their pixelated designs, but are exquisitely intricate. Shadows move dynamically, lasers illuminate the environment, lights glow eerily in darkened rooms; it's really something to lay eyes upon and it looks spectacular in motion.I'm yet to complete this game on what I think is the highest difficulty (labelling everything with variants of easy doesn't distill much confidence), but I've had a blast doing it.It doesn't take much time for a single playthrough (even less so if you're terrible at it like I am), and it is cruel but rarely unfair. Be ready for the monster house that you unleash with the removal of your crystal.Only real gripes with the game are minor ones: the fonts used in the menus does not align with the visual aspect (modern vs retro), and anyone that has played Endless Space is going to notice the FIDS icons used to denote the currencies for research, levelling up and construction in all of their crisp glory which clashes wtih the game's general aesthetic. I get that the Endless (currently at a trilogy: Space/Dungeon/Legend) games are linked (which I think is cool), but it's still a little jarring given the overall style of DotE.All-in-all, I love what I've played of this game thus far (Steam game time is not 100% accurate as I have spent some time playing this on my daily train rides to work), and look forward to continuing to fail miserably in the future. Well worth it for the cost.			"

												After having played this game for over 500 hrs, I have to conclude that this is a bad game.===Edit for the comments section:I spent a lot of time on the game, but that doesn't make it good.  It means that there was a lot of content.  Walking simulators can have a lot of content, Fallout 4 had enough content to fill several hundreds of hours but it doesn't mean it was a good game.What I believe makes a good game is challenge, with which Dungeon of the Endless does not give.  It attempted challenge, and did well, but a game can only be a challenge if it is not impossible.  With which Amplitude Studios hasn't addressed some edge cases that make the game so.I played the game thoroughly for the 90% case of winnable scenarios, the idea is good, the execution is just something I can't condone.  Please understand.If the game is only 90% winnable, it's a slot machine.  Not a game.And just as we can waste many hours on television or a slot machine, or reading clickbait articles.  The amount of time we spend doesn't make it a game.===A lot of Love went into this game, and I did like it, however it has a few glaring flaws that have not been resolved and I don't see them being resolved in the future.Amplitude Studios shares it's notoriously buggy programming, with simple issues like forgetting that an array starts with 0, causing very reproducible bugs.  Perhaps it's because they're spread so thin among several clever but poorly implemented games.Bugs aside, the problems are rooted in gameplay ..  But first, what the game does well.===Also, like Amplitude Studios, Dungeon of the Endless mashes up several genres together and does it miraculously.  If it's one thing I would like to credit them for, is that they aren't afraid to innovate and then put it into game form.  This studio is what the indie scene is all about.  Bringing truly new ideas into existence.+ The Cast, all the Prisoners, Guards, and Natives are beautifully illustrated and designed.  Animations are so immersive and dear to me, and the back stories are interesting and tease of story.+ Good meta gaming for deciding on doors together.  The game is a board game sometimes, sometimes it's a timed board game, sometimes it's a moba / tower defense.+ Great unique ideas.  Leveling up is based on Food, not how many mobs you kill.  Science is used to Research or to replenish your character's skills.+ A lot of random conditions make for stressful challenges, all of which can be arguably survived, some of which you can win.  Stress is good, it means you're being pushed to a limit+ Monsters are very varied and each have unique abilities.  None of the mobs are simple variations of HP and attack.  They all behave and target different things.===- However, where it suffers truly is in gameplay.  Like Dungeon of the Endless, the game is rather flow-chart-esque.  Random Scenarios don't really ask for varied solutions.  It's like being faced with an Apple and an Orange, but they both do the same thing. What's the point ?- There is no targeting mobs ..  At first this disappointed me.  Then I recognized it as part of the game.  Something that felt unique and perhaps confused for innovation.  After beating the game several times, and trying out several things I realize it as a glaring flaw.Imagine so, you have a character with a gun.  Yes ?  Guns are good at shooting things at a range, which it does.  However, your character is dead set on shooting ( at a range of course ) a mob he's predisposed to target all the way in the back.  So he runs into crowds of melee monsters just to get in range of shooting a mob that poses no threat.Effectively making ranged combat useless.Or perhaps, you've got a Dozer + Hurnas combination ( A testament to the game, I've memorized all the monster names and abilities )  The hurnas do a lot of damage to heroes, and the dozer attacks major modules ..But if you've got heroes in the game, they won't kill the Hurnas while it's killing them ..  The heroes will tap away at the Dozer which has more HP while they get killed by Hurnas.  That may be part of the game design ..  But it's awfully unimmersive.It's just bad game design, plain and simple.A possible solution would be to toggle the types of tactics characters use, it doesn't have to be true RTS, just choose things like ..  "" Target Anti Module Mobs "" vs "" Target Anti Hero Mobs "" and etc.  Maybe even make a little game of it ..- There are monsters that render your heroes entirely useless.  Which seems neat, and would seem to be asking the player to be challenged by having to build towers.  But there are also monsters that render your towers useless too ..And here is how this design flaw got past QA ..You see, in the game, there are random items that allow you to circumvent this issue.  Like an item that allows you to be cloaked from monsters so that you don't get targeted, so you can take out the monsters that render your towers useless ..The problem is ..  This item is completely random ( which is an example of a poor use of RNG ).  Effectively, you CAN be placed in unwinnable scenarios.  This is a big Rogue-like no-no.It's easily confused for "" difficulty "", but there's no challenge in it.  Because there's no win scenario.  You essentially get to choose whether your heroes die valiantly or your crystal gets destroyed.This issue would also be arguably circumvented if you could pick up your crystal and go but ..  You can't pick it up until you've found the exit.  So there are situations where you simply can't win.- I have played with all the characters in and out ..  There is no balance scheme whatsoever.  All of them basically fit into four categories : Nuke, Run, Operator, Combat.  Some characters can fulfill three of these roles at the same time ..  Some characters literally do none of these well.

Dungeon of the Endless tho is realeasing and it feels complete and is defently a game that I feel Great about supporting. The sound design is awesome and I love how unless you have an overarcing stragety with your resources your going to fail while at the same time you have to wing a bunch of descions on the fly.

Thank God we have Amplitude; what did the human race do to deserve them?P.S. ""Easy"" mode and ""Very Easy"" mode may be the only difficulty settings in the game, but they're both baying to mat their fur with your blood.			"

												A cross between unique style defence game that requires strategy and some nice little RPG elements. It can start to feel seem slightly repetitive but changing over characters or researching new tech all of a sudden changes your play style sometimes you also may not have a choice if one of your characters dies via perma-death.The rogue-like randomness is not as big as in other games but still noticeable. Nice music and interesting character backgrounds and dialogue. Worth a try for those who are into tower defence or rogue style dungeon crawling with a sci-fi feel, but be warned it’s unique in its own right and may not appeal if you’re heavily into your tower defence or RPG and it doesn’t do either extensively or in detail, saying that it’s a thumbs up from me!

												Awesome roguelike!  Heavily FTL inspired, but with roguelike dungeon exploration, squad combat, tower defense mechanics, 4x resource management, permadeath, and mad horde survival when escorting your crystal to each floor's elevator.  This is a pretty wild mashup of genres!  Everything feels just right.  No gimmicky mechanics, no useless fluff.  Ship and character options look to offer a ton of replay value.  Graphics and music are beautiful.  In a sea of bland forgettable roguelikes, this is everything I've been looking for in the genre.  If you are a fan of FTL, or roguelikes in general, don't overlook this gem!PS. If I could find any fault, the tutorial doesn't explain all of the mechanics.  Only takes a few minutes to learn though.  Do yourself a favour and watch a quick video tutorial on youtube.  You'll find more enjoyment if you know the reasons for your frequent death ;)			"

												Awesome game. Very challenging, totally unique and fresh. Here's some tips. Learn how the game works. There is a ton to take in, but the game is so addicting it only takes one session to learn all the hidden rules. Think 32 bit arcade Dark Souls Co-op.A tip on movement. If you need to gain some distance from an enemy to fire ranged shots. Click to a different room, (away from mobs) than reclick the room that you and the mobs are in and you'll turn back around and start firing.Criticism: Game is likely at it's funnest when playing with competent friends. However, there are a few functionalities that put a direct negativity to multiplayer.1: Not being able to save the game while in multiplayer is dissapointing. I agree it shouldn't be so simple as ""oh lets save a 3 player progressed game and I'll just finish it later by myself."" But we were at it for 3 hours and only got to the 7th level of the 12 levels on the first dungeon. Now the idea is kind of cool to do it all in one sitting, which if you can do, that'd probably be best. But some gamers are workers too, and might not be able to commit 6 hours for on session game. What I'd like to see is a ""group save"" function, where the save file is only accessible if all involved players are present.2: Keeping criticism 1 in mind with how long the session can last and how you can't save, you also can't re-join any game you somehow DC from. 3 and half hours of progress then ""poof."" Gone. You lost the hero you almost earned, and your mates will have to try and carry on without you. This happened to me and it was extremely dissapointing (because this game is extremely good.) After surviving hordes and hordes of some of the most difficult mobs, no one wants to die indefinitely to server problems.3: It's far easier to earn new heroes playing solo, since in a party of 3, there can be only one more hero added to the party and can only be controlled by a single player and only that single player will earn  that hero. Which from a different perspective may seem like ""only the ones who earn the hero get the hero"" but to me it's just a reason to not play multiplayer, which this game shouldn't be doing. In summary, embrace the multiplayer. Make it a bit friendlier. Other than that, awesome game. 4/5 stars.One more thing. The 32 bit art in this game is gorgeous.			"

												Strongly recommended!TL;DR: Get this game. Very few weakpoints listed in the pro/con section. I made a video featuring a last man standing amateur tournament with 18 out of 20 playable characters, added to this review.Dungeon of the Endless does a lot of things right, taking the positive aspects of various genres andsurprisingly manages to mash them together without creating a big pile of crap. Not only is it fun to play, easy to pick up and hard to master, it also offers a great deal of replayabilityand nice community.PRO/CONI won't go with a full pro/con list here, let's focus on the very few cons.-- A few (currently 2 out of 20) playable characters need to be purchased separately and cost way more than what would be reasonable. Josh N'tello is included in the Dungeon of the Endless Chrystal Editionand Kreyang in the Endless Legend Founder Pack, an addon for a different game of Amplitude Studios.It has been stated on the forums that the Kreyang-situation will be adressed at some point in the future.-- Some footage from the trailers isn't actually included in the game or simply outdated, like the overworld view with the Necrophage Nibblers, or Max opening a door that takes a lot longer to open in the actual game.-- While the game features coop-mode, at this point in time it lacks a savefunction (will be added) and also offers a different and in my opinion not as enjoyable experience because of the missing pause-feature, which is an essential part of the singleplayer mode as you can issue orders while pausing.-- The secret hero of the game is rather a gimmick and in my opinion way too weak in comparison to the other heroes. -- often slowpaced, heavy focus on strategy and ressource management, also permadeath. Stuff like that isn't for everybody.That being said I thoroughly enjoy the game and can easily recommend it. Not sure about the chrystal edition because of the unreasonably high price, but that's something everybody should decide on their own, I got it anyway.I also created a video featuring a fully edited last man standing amateur tournament of almost all playable characters, where I not only shoutcast but at the same time explain the basics of the game in more detail.

												Amazing game. Play it with friends.The good:- Music, characters and art.- The game always manages to surprise you.The relative:- Games take a while (2-4 hours), slow paced, repetitive.The ugly:- You will lose games to bugs (can be frustrating when you are 2 hours in a run).- Random people in coop.

												If this game were a female, I would marry her.Seriously, this game is something special. A blend of beautiful pixelated graphics, fantastic music, addictive gameplay, and replayability galore. As one of it's trailer perfectly describes, it's a ""pixel art, old school, squad-based, adventure, tower defense strategy dungeon rogue-like roleplaying game"", and not to forget that it has MULTIPLAYER. Boy does it mix everything well.I'm getting ahead of myself, but if you get one thing out of this review, it's that this game is exceptional.WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME? GAMEPLAY - What you have here is a game that is: a Tower Defense, an RPG, a Dungeon Crawler, a Rogue-Like, and a Micro-Management Simulation. There really isn't a game like it that manages to put in so much stuff and not be overbearing. Each map is randomly generated and progressively harder/bigger with every floor, so each run through you get a new riveting experience. 10/10 gameplay, no joke.  ARTSTYLE - The pixel art in this game has not been matched by anything, and that is saying something, because I'm a big fan of pixel art. The dungeons look magical and mysterious, as if they've been keeping secrets and history for hundreds of years. Additionally, the transitional art (although, admittedly, limited) is also very beautiful.SOUNDTRACK - The OST is top-notch and probably one of the few OSTs I can turn on in Windows Media Players and just listen to for fun. Everything feels ever-so slightly off, but it is the lack of conventional sound that gives it it's uniqueness.CO-OP - It is a well-known fact that co-op can salvage ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games and make them enjoyable. Apply this principle to a fantastic game such as Dungeon of the Endless, and you get an absolute blast out of playing this.WHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME? NOTHING - This is one of the few games (so far Invisible, Inc. has been the only one to match) that has nothing really bad about it.WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME? CRITICALLY UNDERAPPREICATED - I have a feeling that this game is like the youngest brother of Amplitude's games. It is perhaps the most charming of the three, but Endless Legend is simply more popular and Endless Space is getting it's sequel, while Dungeon of the Endless just sits there, waiting ever-so patiently.This, in my opinion, is a must-own game. It is a gem that is overlooked and it absolutely deserves your attention at full-price, with or without DLC (although I strongly recommend buying all the DLC as well). This game, in the future, will be regarded as a classic.9.5/10 "

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, best money you will spend on a game. 10/10 replay value, 10/10 satisfaction after winning.Dungeon of the Endless has not only great 32bit art but also amazing sounds and gameplay in general. This game has everyting a gamer would love, little bit of rpg, big chunk of tower defense, and big scoop of strategizing. There are just so many things you have to keep in mind, so many trials and erros, and the fact that it's all randomized each time you play is just pure genius. Yes, indeed you also need some luck due to the fact that it's randomized, but that's what makes this game THE game. Even though it's so frustrating at times it just makes it that much more satisfying to finally beat it, it is so challenging that you don't want to try the ""too easy"" option, it brings out the inner gamer competitiveness in you (seriously don't puss out and do ""too easy""). At first you may go ""WTF this ain't no RPG man you cant even control the damn heroes the way you want!"", but as you play the game you will realize how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were.This game IS RPG, maybe not the RPG you are normally used to, which is what makes this game so unique! Just that hint of RPG, the roles of heroes that you need in a group, the dream team, it just makes my inner nerd so HARD.You seriously have to put your soul in this game, you have to figure out every little details to fully enjoy it. It is so simple that it's complicated, this game will test your limits and to break those limits you will have to use everything you learn and know about the game to beat it every.single.time.In all, to me the best part of the game honestly was the ending scene, it has no fancy cinematic or anything at all, just one mother♥♥♥♥ing epic cutscene, it makes everyting just so worthwhile, too epic, so majestic. It just makes you want to beat it again with different heroes. DO NOT get this game if you are impatient or if you do not have good game senses, I guarantee that you will probably stop playing after couple hours. It is a VERY hard game so I recommend you play with at least 1 or 2 really good friends that you can communicate with at all times, or else you are going to have a bad time. COMMUNICATION IS KEY (you can trade all resources with other players at any time, don't hoard resources if you don't need them, ask for resources!)-You can trade resources by clicking your resources at top left of the screen-        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SOME TIPS: Leaving a hero in a unpowered room makes it so that it's ""slightly lit"", which makes it so that mobs don't spawn from that room. THIS IS KEY TO WINNING, so make sure to place them strategically after each waves and such before opening any more doors. Never get the same module updates as other players, pick a role and stick with it, DO NOT get greddy. It is also important that you play this game like any other RPGs, pick a tank, dps, support. I recommend having 1 range dps, 1 tanker, 1 runner (fastest movement speed for crystal run at the end of floor), and a operator with high wits for that extra resource boost when operating major modules.I also recommend getting Tear Gas and Smoking Gun for offense because with those 2 combos you will melt the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of mobs with ease. (Tear Gas is ♥♥♥♥ing dope, that defense reduce so sexy as hell)Every other minor modules are not really necessary to beat the game, other than Autodoc Shards for heals really late game. What I did was have a room full of Autodoc Shards as a back up ""healing room"" for emergencies or for fighting bosses that appears late games.Prisoner Prods are also good for cheap defense for early games and such, upgrade them ASAP for easy wins early floors.Although not necessary to win the game it will be a lifesaver to have the Emergency Generator major module for late games when dusts are rare as ♥♥♥♥.         ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are still some annoying glitches such as not being able to buy or sell♥♥♥♥♥♥to the merchant, which can be a HUGE pain in the♥♥♥♥♥esp late game, but bear with it and just play the game through. This however is easily fixable during a solo play by saving and quitting then just continuing the game again (for some reason this fixes everyting, yay :D). Still a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since you obviously can not do this during a multiplayer game.With this in mind you will have the best chance to beat the game, it will still take incredible amount of replays to get it just right, so be patient and hope for the best.BUT SERIOUSLY BUY THE GAME AND PLAY IT, ENJOY!P.S. no you can not trade items with other players sooo don't be hogging all the chest you come by.

												Another great game from Amplitude.  The lore ties into their other 2 games (Endless Legend, Endless Space), and there is a feeling of awe as you discover bits of the lore.This game is basically a 4x-towerdefense-roguelikelike. The resource management has a lot of similarities to a 4x game and you sure have to explore/expand/exterminate and to some degree exploit. To really optimize your play, you have to consider some TD elements: wave management and turret choice (and Hero location) is very important, but the feel of the game is very roguelike. Failed runs feel like roguelike failed runs. Sometimes the RNG is against you but you always think you could have found some way out.			"

Early Access Review
								I was a little hesitant to buy this game at first, it seemed a little ambitious, but then I played it, and Holly crap is this thing good!Dungeon of the Endless is phenomenal. With its rogue like elements, always keeping the tension flowing. (even during the first floor!) The sections of RPG like stature, and not to mention the brilliant flushed out strategic thought, is compelling. You will die A LOT! But, surprisingly, you don't get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Everytime you start a new floor (level) it's competely different. So each time you die, and restart, it's like you're playing a new game.Very few games are quite this flabbergasting. Dungeon of the Endless is a must-buy, and if you like RPG's, Strategy, Tower Defense, you name it, this game has you covered.			"

												I'll admit, I was skeptical about this game at first because of the ""tower defence"" in the description, even with the beautiful pixel graphics. After playing it for several hours, I can say that skepticism wasn't warranted. It may have some aspects of those types of games, but don't udnerestimate it.With quite an extensive amount of content (unlockables) and replayability (procedural generation) I can see myself sticking with this game for quite a while. One major gripe, though, is the inability to save in multiplayer; when playing with other people you're in it for the long run.Just a warning, even on Very Easy, it's tough and unforgiving. It's a game of planning, strategy, and reflex. Good luck.			"

												This game is far FAR more entertaining that it seems. It's a rougelike, dungeoncrawling, tower defense, all in one. You select you party of up to 4 characters, level them up, build modules, explore floors of this dungeon and try to find the exit and keep rooms powered while still protecting your Generator (crystal) from monsters that spawn in unpowered rooms. Every time you open a new door, theres a high chance for a new wave to appear. This game was well worth the $15 dollars, and the $7 extra I'll use to upgrade to the Founder pack.			"

Posted: March 23, 2015
												Introduction:DoTE is an interesting take on Tower Defense, coupled with what should be turn-based RPG, Rouge-like squad combat.Initially i was gonna give this one a pass, considering i dislike the turn-based aspect. But here the combat itself is done in real-time, so i thought id give it a go.The only turn-based aspect to this title, is in essence; the opening of doors. Once you open a door, you are commiting your turn. Resources wont generate in real-time, instead they will increase based on each turn (door opened). Though i may have very little experience in the case of turn-based games (never played FTL, for instance), i would say that this game is as close as ill get to enjoying one.Graphics:The pixel art style here is done very well, especially on the characters. The environments are nice too, each varying style of floor have their own theme. Though maybe they are slightly *too* static, in places. Admittedly there are some animated effects that compliment rooms, like blinking rats, candles and toxic/electro-magnetic 'aura's' (which in the case of the last two; play into the game mechanics).Idle and movement character animations were very well-done and add a lot of flavour to the style. I was hoping for more variation in attack animations for each Hero, though. Yet at the same time i will say that they are more than adequate. The UI/menu presentation is of its own style and its non-obtrusive and easy on the eyes. Players are given the option between a large/small UI/HUD based on their own personal preference.Audio:Whoever did the music, has really nailed the atmosphere for this game. Probably one of the best aspects to this game, i think. The sound effects themselves are adequate, nothing bad about them, nor is there anything overly impressive about them either. There is no spoken dialogue, yet there are text based conversations between Heroes.Gameplay:To put it simply; its turn-based tower defense with real-time combat. You move, in real-time, your group of up to 4 Heroes through a procedurally generated dungeon. Enemies/monsters wont have a chance at spawning until you open a door, so its important to plan before opening too many doors. You can place Minor/Major modules (Automated Weapons/Resources) which is where this game gets its Tower Defense tag from. To expand on that, the player is constantly having to choose between risk/reward. For instance; do i save my resources for the next floor? Or do i increase the amount of weaponry (Minor Modules) i have in this current floor, to aid my Heroes? Its quite risky hanging onto your resources and hoping your Heroes will get the job done, on their own. Yet if it pays off, come the next floor (or many after, due to an overabundance of resources), if you manage to succeed. There have been many times where ive lost a Hero or two, because i attempted to hoard my resources. This is by far the most challenging aspect of the game for me. As im constantly trying to ensure i use 'just enough' Minor/Major Modules to keep my neck above the water, so i can bank enough resources for the next floor.The combat itself, which was an important aspect for me buying this game, doesnt give you direct control of your Heroes attacks. Rather you have real-time control of their movements and their attacks are automatic, if in the same room as enemies.A wide variety of strategies can be deployed based on your Hero setup and/or your preferred play-style. This gives the player the sense that he/she can beat this game in a variety of ways. Which is a good thing. For instance, you could level up your Heroes and Tactical HUD Modules to increase their stats and effectiveness in combat. Alternatively you could research Minor Modules which come in the form of base defense weaponry, focus on accumulating more science points and upgrading those weapons further. That wont necessarily increase your Heroes stats in combat, but will increase their chances if they occupy the same room.Both of those strategies will require quite differing tactics in order to succeed. I tend to use the latter and got as far as attempting to hoard enough resources so i could afford the former. That lead to my eventual death on the 11th floor.Narrative:This game definitely has its own edge in humour. Which is mainly played out through small story arcs that happen between certain Heroes if they are grouped together. Some of the dialogue/bio's got a few chuckles out of me alright, especially the midget who is obsessed with his disparity in height, so much so that he has worked his muscles and upper-body strength to the point where he can wield over-sized weaponry. Inbetween levels, in the elevator, he said something to another Hero that made me lose it. Ill omit that considering i believe it belongs in the game, not this review. ;)If certain Heroes are grouped together for enough time (ie. levels/floors), their dialogue will eventually lead to an end in their story which will have either a positive or negative effect on both of them. This gives the narratives a purpose, as in, its not just tacked on. Its complimentary.Overall:A solid offering. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i ended up enjoying this game. Initially i was very aprehensive as i really dont like turn-based games, but i believe that DoTE should appeal to both fans of turn-based games, and those who arent but have an interest in tower defense with squad based combat. Ive clocked like 33 hours so far and i havent beaten the Dungeon yet, so in regards to longevity i do believe this title should fulfill that aspect for most people.Personally i dont really care for rating systems, so i wont attempt to do one here. +Recommended. :P			"

												This game is a rogue-like strategy with multiplayer, it also has a few Tower Defense and RPG-elements which add nicely to the game.*If you dont care about your first run, skip to the pros/cons* So what happens in a nutshell your first time:You dont know WTF is going as you got put into with 2 characters you dont know.You open the first door...♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters are attacking me/core and how do I light up this room?Apparently resources are used for building, healing and leveling your character. Wait there is more then 1 tab which I can build from?You continue to find more monsters and some loot to equip for your characters and find the exit.You are like: ""How do I continue?"" and after a while you find out that you can pick-up the crystal from the start and go to the exit to the next floor. But as you try to do that and forgot to lit up some rooms with your dust you get swarmed by all monsters that spawn from the ""Exit event"" and die.Pros:- Fun to play after you found out how to play- Strategy elements are really needed to win the game- A run on easy can take up to 3-4 hours. Which you can split up into multiple segments by save and exit.- Multiplayer can cause ultimate chaos for you (and your friends)!- Unlockables, every char you have to survive a few floor with before you unlock them and to unlock each new ship you have to win the game with the last ship you earned or achievements! - Game get regurarly updated with some new content and its bugfixes.Cons:- As of now the multiplayer still has a few bugs if the host or someone who joins times out for a few seconds, which makes the one who joined invisible for the host (however this can lead to some exploits like double loot from a room)- You need to learn how to play the game before you can actually start enjoying it.- If RNG isnt on your side in the later floors you can get f**ked real hard and fast.- Micro-managing can be a pain in the butt.Conclusion:Dungeon of the Endless can be a endless pain if you dont know what you are supposed to do. But as you progress and start to learn more as you go on this game is endlessly fun. Every run is unique due to the random layouts on each floor. You can have a floor with no monsters and then your next floor nothing can be lit up. RNG decides a lot in this game which is a good and a bad thing. If I had to give this game a score it would be around a 8/10			"

												A very good surprise ! Based on the trailer, i was expecting a basic roguelike or a ""roguelike-like"" (like FTL or Binding of Isaac). So i was expecting something interesting, but not very original. But it turns out Dungeon of the Endless is a completely unique mix of roguelike, tower defense and ressource management.The game asks you to explore a dungeon with a group of 1 to 4 heroes. But each time you open a new door, it starts a new ""turn"". At the start of each turn, each dark room may spawn monsters. You have to clear all the monsters of that wave to ""end the turn"", and get automatic and full healing of your heroes. When the turn is over, you're free to build more stuff, change the inventory of your heroes, etc. The game is in a suspended test until you feel ready to open a new door.I talked about building stuff, because that's the second part of the game, the tower defense aspect. Your heroes do not have to face enemies all by themselves, you can build offensive and defensive structures, that will hopefully stop the monster waves. You have many available buildings, so figuring out the best way to lighten the load for your heroes is of critical importance.The last part, the resource management, comes from the fact that 3 buildings are here to produce 3 resources. Industry is what you have to pay to build. Science is what you have to pay to research new technologies. Food is what you use to heal and level up your heroes. The last ressources is gained automatically but is in very short supply: Energy is what you use to power a room. A powered room is automatically lit, and therefore can't spawn monsters, but also is required to build structures. A structure doesnt work unless it's in a powered room.So, with a limited amount of resources, and building spaces available, you have to figure out how to maximize the resources you currently need and also prepare for the future, as the latter floors will be deadly. The goal of the game is ""simply"" to reach the exit of each floor, until you get to the last floor and can finally escape the dungeon.As i said, Dungeon of the Endless was a very good surprise, i wasn't expecting that. Once i got the hang of the system, the game became very addictive, it definitely has that ""One more turn"" aspect that all turn-by-turn gamers know well enough. You always want to open one more door, until you notice it's 2 AM and you should have been to bed a long time ago. It's hard to leave the game when your in the middle of a run, and want to know what will happen to your crew. Somehow, i've logged more than 30h in my first week of play, even though it felt like half that, because i was so engaged in the game.Dungeon of the Endless also manage to be fairly accessible. Though it doesn't explain all its mechanisms and you will have to figure some stuff out it offers two difficulty modes ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" (yes the developers are cheeky) to cater to different groups of people. Too easy difficulty should please people who aren't too familiar with roguelike mechanisms, or people who just want to enjoy the game without having too much trouble. Easy difficulty is definitely 2 steps above that, and should please people used to roguelikes, or games such as FTL. Moreover the game has good replayability. First you get many different characters, who are all interesting to discover, unlock and play with. Moreover you will be able to unlock new ""Escape pods"", which change the game rules, and therefore the playstyle you will have to use. One pod gives you stronger heroes and weaker buildings, one pod is the opposite, and others pods mix things even more. Some will even up the difficulty quite a bit for those looking for a greater challenge.An interesting twist is you can also play the game online, with others people, which change the rules a bit and will also increase the replayability.To sum it up, Dungeon of the Endless has a pretty artstyle, a unique and interesting gameplay, a very diverse and well made cast of characters, and has good replayability. Definitely a big thumbs up for me !			"

												I love strategy games, my friend likes rpg leveling and equipment, another likes resource management, and one more likes tower defense.  This game combines these elements in such a great way that it doesn't take away from any genre it is pulling from, but it enhances all of them.  I love the gameplay, and on solo mode you can challenge yourself, unlock characters, and try new strategies.  But the most fun I have with this game is playing with my friends, everyone can chose a unique role on the team or you can all run around in chaos (though you won't get as far).  You get the real time feel of fighting enemies and using abilities, but with a turn based twist that allows you to strategize and collaborate with your teammates between waves.  The rouge like elements are just icing on the cake, allowing for massive replayability and devising many successful and unsuccessful playstyles.  I definitely recommend you give this game a shot, especially if you have a group of friends who are interested in playing as well.  It took me one play and I was hooked.			"

												TLDR: buy it.Dungeon of the Endless is a pixellated tower-defense roguelikelike.  It's got all the resource complexity of M.U.L.E., but a fairly interesting tech tree.  The items are not quite varied enough...I see the same ones over and over, and despite flavours in quality of the item, the perks are the same and not quite enough of them.  Biggest problem is crashes.  The game crashes regularly for me and wipes my progress.  I've had several games that I felt were winning, but I have yet to reach the end before the game crashes and takes the save progess with it.  So I can't comment on the ending of the game.  I bet it's great, but at the rate of failure I'll never know.  Even with the reliability issue, though, it's a clever game that's a lot of fun in short burts.  Definitely recommend. "

												Game-play is an engaging cross between Role Playing Game (with hero level ups and hero to hero interactions and back story) and Tower Defense. The album element is akin to both ""in game achievement"" and further immersion in the game's universe and back story. Tower defence elements and, in particular, dust/energy management make for significant floor layout strategies. Humour runs rampant through character dialogues and item names and descriptions. Somehow this game manages to blend not taking itself seriously and yet being a serious game to play.One part Original Rogue, one part Deadspace/Doom (re. creature vibes), one part nostalgia (Other endless references, graphics, game style et al.). I have found this to be highly entertaining and it will easily be a ""go back to"" game even when finished/fully unlocked.			"

												   Usually i dont like tower defense games.  But this game add a little something.  For me, the old pixelized style of the game and the unlockables ( ships and playables characters) got me hooked from the start.     I recommend this highly.  Sure at the start the difficulty is kinda high ( too easy and easy mode ...really XD) But just take the time to learn the mechanics of the game and you' ll love this game.

												This is a tricky one to review and I have just started to scratch the surface of it, but here it goes.First of all, the story: you are forced to flee on an escape pod before your starship gets destroyed, and after you crash-land on planet Auriga you find yourself in a depths of a multi-level dungeon, from which you have to escape with the very few resources you have at your disposal and whatever you can find in the ruins, fighting monsters in the process.Don't let yourself be fooled by the pixel-art graphics (which are beautiful if you are into this kind of thing) and think that this is a simple game. It's not easy at all (despite the fact that the initial difficulty levels are labelled easy and too easy) and you are going to die, a lot. The music also has a chiptuny, retro-style which fits well with the graphics assets.The game style is a very nice blend of RPG, tower defense strategy and roguelike games. There is a constant feeling of uncertainty and fear, since stuff happens whenever you open a door: you might find new loot or something/someone else, you might trigger a mighty horde of monsters coming for you, your resource nodes, defences and/or your energy crystal (which, if it breaks, leads you to a game over). Resources are scarce so you will have to think well how to spend them; moreover, the fact that the dungeons are procedurally generated means that such a strategy will have to change whenever you restart the game.During the game you can research for new weapons (both static defenses and items for your heroes) and for new, better resource nodes.To me, it feels like a board game (a feeling that is enhanced even more in multi player) that changes every time you play; the board game closest to Dungeon of the Endless I can think of is Munchkin: whenever you open a door, you don't know what you will get. Riches? Monsters? Even worse? Nobody knows, but -- unlike in Munchkin -- at least your companions won't turn against you. :)If you like roguelike or tactical games with strategic elements and you're a fan of sci-fi settings in general, I highly recommend you Dungeon of the Endless.My vote: 8/10Update 20/12/2014: Upped my vote from 7.5 to 8 as the game is really growing on me. I've died countless times already yet I keep coming back for more.Update 27/12/2014: added a Munchkin reference, for those who know the board game.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is still in alpha and that needs to be noted when looking at it. the game is fantastic. it is a rogue like game and if you like going down random generated dungeons then this is your game! each play through is diffferent. i never seem to get the same items or blue pronts so each playthrough is completelly different. some games i will rely on towers heavely others more on my heroes, its all luck and adjusting to your situation.be sure to handle your heroes well. light up a room ro two ahead for a Tower Defence style. or build up a heavily fortified room and some tough heroes. recourse management is key. tech or food? which one is more important. use the merchant and not expand? there is a lot of different ways to play and i havent had a repeat at all.    the game has some kinda koocky twist in everything. form the armor, items, and heroes. they are a kinda odd bunch.the game has improved alot from the first couple patches and it keeps getting cooler and cooler. one sucessful playthrough right now you are looking at 2 hours give or take. cool world, simple to play. basic controls, random generated everything. the community is a little small for now, but realy nice and always willing to help or give out pointers. the Devs are awsome and they interact alot on the forums with us. they take input and give alot of updates. there are some minor bugs, but they are hard at work fixing them and are up to day with us. realy awsome community for sure.I recomend this game, it is simple and oen cant get lost in over complexity. there is more features to be added in the future to! how awsome is that!? buy it while it is on sale. the direction this game is going has so much promise.

												Dungeon of the Endless is a fantastic game that combines Tower Defense Gameplay with Rogue-like Mechanics. Essentially you start in a single room on each level you begin on. There will be doors which will lead to other rooms - which can contain resource, items, characters, interactable objects, the exit, enemies, or just nothing. Using Dust you power up the room and can use it to create defenses, resource gathering equipment, or strategic gear. Eventually you'll run out of Dust and won't be able to power up rooms - that is when the fun begins since when you open up subsequent doors, unpowered rooms may spawn enemies for you to fight.You play the game with a group of crashed landed prisoners, crew members who manned the ship, or natives from the planet. You can have up to four at once in your group, and they are what open doors, collect items and resources, and kill enemies. You'll need to keep them alive as without any characters left you will lose the game. Permadeath is also a thing - so losing a character is a permanent thing. However with the exception of one game mode, you can pause the game at anytime to plan your moves.There is a heavy emphasis on managing resources - kind of 4X styled. You have Food which you can use to heal or level your characters; Industry which lets you build up your Tower Defense items; Science which lets you research and obtain new tech to build new Tower Defense items; and of course Dust which is ultimately what keeps you alive.You see, Dust is really the nature of the game. If you run out of Dust - which happens when your power source (a Crystal) is attacked, you lose the game. At the same time, Dust is needed to power rooms - but you only have so much of it so you'll have to be strategic in what rooms you power.Your characters that you can have in your party or meet in your game all have their unique traits (and flaws). As you level up your characters they gain powerful abilities and permanent buffs (or sometimes debuffs). It will be key how you manage your characters as some are useful as straight up killers, while others are more supportive, others will be best used as resource gathers, and some are just useful for running around in general.The goal of the game is essential to escape with your crystal to each exit of the level, and proceed to the next level. When you get to the end of the dungeon you escape to win the game. Later levels will feature different and harder enemies then earlier ones - but in some shape or form you can see the same enemies from level 1 to the final level; albeit in elite forms later on, but still the same enemy. Care needs to be given when fighting enemies, as much like your characters they all act differently.I wholly recommend this game, even if you aren't necessarily a fan of Tower Defense or Rogue-like games. Dungeon of the Endless has a little bit of everything in it, making it an extremely unique game among many.			"

												Its pretty good.This games Difficulty will constantly tests your ability to assess a situation,  manage the resources at hand and to apply a solution to your problems and emergencies as they develope. This game is absolutely merciless at times, And if you think you're gonna just gonna stroll in and win the game your first time, you are dead wrong.Anyone who complains that the game isnt fair or is too hard just hasn't learned how to play it yet;  And No, that is not a bash against inexpirienced players. Keep playing and over time, you will learn what is smart and what is not.The game is deceptively involving, and sometimes even the simplest action may require some thought/debate, having a sort of 'butterfly effect' later. a single playthrough of the game can clock in around 3-5 hours.Recommended for those who love a hell of a challenge, especially when you play multiplayer.Oh, and if you're wondering, this game is definately not Pay to win. the DLC are fairly balanced in every respect.EDIT: Somthing i forgot to mention that IS a downside... There is virtually no Multiplayer community, and the little that is there is quite toxic to the community, being quite elitist.For example...Had a room where I did somthing somone didn't like. He decided to just leave (thats a VERY big deal in this game) and yes, he did give us his supplies/hero, and i could've respect that if he hadn't lashed out and pretty much insulted everyone in the party.Found the same guy a little whiles later. Naturally he sneered at me, but instead when he (predictibly) tried to leave, he didn't give out his hero or supplies. On purpose. I imagine he had a laugh of it.If ive got a piece of advice for when you play this game, its put your lobby on 'friends only.' because searching publicly is almost as rewarding as snorting glass dust.

												Rock-solid rogue-like dungeon crawler with tower-defense element!  I think a brief description of the game might be the best way to help you decide if it is for you:In Dungeon of the Endless, your goal is to ultimately lead a band of unique characters out of a dungeon.    To do so, you must open new doors in each floor to find the elevator that takes you to the next level.  As a part of the game mechanic, the opening of each door counts as a turn.  Similar to the beacon jumping in FTL, everything happens within the turn is executed in real-time.  The dungeon is dangerous and unforgiving place!  Research and build towers to help you survive.  Don't let the name fool you!!  The dungeon itself is not endless; it only takes 3-4 hours to finish a successful run.  However, finishing your first successful run can be a different story!!  It took me more than 30 hour to get there, and I wish you better luck :-)			"

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing struggle, an endless struggle. But it's a really good game and I like it better than FTL since the game is less relliant on rng and more on 'make the best out of the worst situation'. I say this because this game is backbreaking hard. We play hard games because theres more satisfaction in beating them, easy games are boring. But i've been playing for hours trying to get past the fourth floor and there is only two difficulties 'too easy' and 'easy'. This pretty much translates to 'easy' and 'prepare to die'. Great game once again, it's really cheap on steam now. I heard there isn't much difference between pixel edition and crystal edition so spare yourself the money. 8/10 Great.			"

												     What I love about Amplitude Studios and their 'Endless Universe' is that all thier games (thus far) take place in it. Endless Space takes place among hundreds of star systems, while Endless Legend focuses only on one planet-Auriga, at a specific (and unknown) time in galactic history. Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) connects Endless Space and Endless Legend-Amplitude's other games. It explains how the Vaulters, as well as many other factions, first appeared on Auriga long before the start of Endless Legend.      In any case, gameplay is fun, interesting and addicting. It's a mix of tower defence and turn-based strategy; each door you open begins the start of another 'turn'. As you gather your team of heroes and adventurers, each with their specific traits and uses, you begin to become more and more attatched to them. Additions such as conversations between your chosen characters at the end of each level make it really feel as if members of the group are intracting with one another. GUI is pretty plain and straigntforward. One small quip I had with the game is that your hero party maxes out at 4; I felt like I could've had a lot more fun with 6 or 8 members. Probably just me, anyway. If you're a fan of the Endless universe, this game is pretty much a must-have. If you're not, well, this seems to be a pretty good place to start .This is coming from someone who has has minimal experience with rouge-like style games, and prefers his games to be a bit less pixelated.

												I tried very hard to enjoy thisI bought it because it looked great and I got a FTL-y vibe and was interested in playing a more fleshed out tower defense game. However it has not grown on me after many hours. -there is virtually no reward for defeating monsters, only a small chance to gain 1 dust which is not kept between floors. even the large special enemies in the last floors yield nothing at all. you have to spend science and/or food in combat and you risk damage to your structures/heroes, so combat quickly feels like an undesirable chore and even a risk that discourages exhaustive exploration later on.-my first experience with the character story interactions was that the quick blue girl outright kills my fat rambo tank dude. This crippled my team in combat and the only thing I got from it was like +10% attack and -5% defense on the blue girl. I haven't seen any other interactions that are that bad, but the rewards are always something with almost no impact at all, which brings me to the next problem:-everything is a drop in the bucket. leveling and equipping your team, improving structures and farming resources - all these things progress painfully slowly, the best you can hope for is to very slightly improve your crew on each floor and still break even on resources. only rarely do you get something satisfying like a new weapon or ability from a levelup that affects your game right away. everything else is just about very slowly accumulating tiny bonuses. they do add up eventually, but it takes hours to reach that point. Winning is slow, but losing is slower. when you lose something important like a character or resource structures, the game slows to a crawl. you'll have to spend more resources for cooldowns/heals in combat, you might lose structures, you might lose dust. much like the incremental progression, your defeat in this game will be excruciatingly drawn out - the more ♥♥♥♥ed you are the more ♥♥♥♥ed you get, you will scrape by with 2-3 characters and make it to the elevator but you know exactly that you have no chance to beat the game anymore. Genuine game overs don't happen because you will just throw the game and start over instead of wasting half an hour trying to get as far as possible.-the tower defense aspect is very weak. there's only one turret available at the start, new ones must be researched with resources and cost 200-300% more to construct than the basic one. you will notice that it is not possible to ""funnel"" enemies the way I know I love to do in tower defense. if you get lucky with the layout you might be able to defend several paths to your core, but never all of them - the core itself cannot house any turrets, you would have to build turrets all around it which is just too expensive and not even reliable as they are quite weak and fragile when unattended (anything you build can be destroyed by enemies). overall turrets are expensive and unflexible, they will often be useless because half the enemies will use a path they don't cover.TL; DRcombat is a chore, progression happens extremely slowly with barely noticeable unsatisfying increments, tower defense works out poorly due to the need to fight enemies in multiple rooms, setbacks like loss of a character or dust are a huge bummer you will not recover from and will snowball to kill you very slowly, RNG is mostly frustratingthese concepts and mechanics are the only things I have a problem with. the audio is ok, characters are cool, visuals are great. if you like spending hours slightly increasing and decreasing numbers, this game might be for you.

Dungeon of the Endless.. ..or: How will I die this run? And why do I restart every time? But first let’s take a look at this gem which keeps me nailed to the screen for hours. DotE is the third ""Endless"" Installment from Amplitude. You don’t need to know the other 2 and you don’t need to have played them. The story is simple: A Prison Space Ship crashes into an unknown planet, releasing its ""cargo"", prisoners and guards. Here they are, our newborn heroes. We should call them anti-heroes, because they are all pretty messed up, brutal, sociopath, misanthropic but at the same time, funny. If your humor is coloured black as mine is you will laugh a dozen times. Every hero has it’s own background, special abilities and some of them have a special connection, which you, the player, shall unfold. The game delivers everything in wonderful pixel-art, combined with a chilling, sci-fi soundtrack, so... How to play? This is the core of this game. It is a mixture of tower-defense, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and RPG. These 4 components fit together in a very unique, yet pretty awesome way, I would call it ""easy to learn, nearly impossible to master!”. Your task is to protect an energy-producing crystal, starting in a random stage, trying to get it to the exit. While this sounds simple on paper it gets pretty hard in reality. You start with 2 heroes, whom you pick just before entering the dungeon. Getting deeper into the dungeon you may or may not meet other heroes. First thoughts: Which one should I pick before entering? A Melee with good attack and defense? A ranged one? Or an intelligent contender, caring for your modules, producing more resources. Speaking of resources and modules. You are crawling through the dungeon, room by room. Every opened door rewards with ressources: Wisdom, Industry, Food and Dust. Industry is used for building stuff, wisdom to research new modules, food to heal or level-up your heroes. Dust is special. Your crystal needs it to produce more energy, because every room needs energy if you want to install modules or turrets. And you will need turrets. Not only resources but monsters will await behind every opened door. And to make it even harder, every room not getting energy from your crystal will possibly spawn new mobs.

Research is important to utilize your defense with different turrets, answering the mixture of monsters.Big Text, Quick Facts: Pro:Different heroes to choose from and unlockMultiple turrets + modules to strategize withHeroes can be equipped with different (funny) weapons, armours and gadgetsRandomized game + unlockable modes guarantee hours of re-playabiltyGreat (but unforgiving) AIPixel-art (if you like it) Con:It is very difficult, sometimes the first stage will be your lastYou will die a lot. Although this is not really a con this game doesn’t suit everyone.Story is fun but don’t expect too much of it.Level-design gets repetitive sometimes.Some heroes simply seem to be underpowered compared to others. Summary: Dungeon of the Endless is one of my all-time favourites already. It mixes different genres and what comes out is a brutally hard, yet unbelievably satisfying pixel-art gem. Although the background story could be better explained I like the way some heroes react and team-up with each other. There are some hidden stories I’ll let you find for yourself.You don’t care about dying a hundred times? You want to laugh about stupid item-names and weird dialogues? You want to build your turrets, equip your heroes and defend that shiny crystal? Hesitate no more, go get it. 9/10			"

												I bought Dungeon of the Endless way back, as it hits the Steam Store. There it was way more simple and unpolished, but the developers have done a great job in updating it contantly and working together with the community to create a really outstanding rogue like game with beautiful art stile, epic soundtracks and a challenging gameplay. It even got a multiplayer that changes the way you play the game, cause you share your resources with other players and communication is the key to victory. I might be ""fanboying"" a bit, but this game has really close to zero flaws for me. Maybe the multiplayer could get some more polishing, that is all what I have to complain about. The best way to get an idea of the rpg/tower defense like gameplay is to watch a gameplay video of it, in my opinion. One of the few games I would recommend to anyone, really outstanding development and outcome. Pros: - art style - soundtrack - challenging gameplay - unlockable characters - co-op multiplayer - different game modi through different starter shipsCons: - rare graphical bugs - multiplayer needs some balancing			"

Early Access Review
								So it had been a while since I'd played Dungeon of the Endless. Last time I'd played I had to stop because I kept getting beaten by my lack of power and supplies, mostly due to my own foolishness. I then ceased playing for a few months. Just today I looked at the title and instantly remembered the love I had for the characters even with the little back-story that you get about them. Upon loading up the game I was amazed at how much more there was. I fell back in love with it, and even though I only made it a few floors that round, I was still dumbfounded by the shear beauty. The amount of effort that has been put in this game to make it what it is. This game is worth the time and the small amount of money that it cost.			"

								Dungeon of the Endless is a rougelite spin off of the 4X stratgey series Endless Space, A lot of people on seeing Dungeon of the Endless (here on called DotE) may compare it to The Sword of The Stars spin off The Pit (If you haven't already I implore you to check out The Pit as well!) but besides being spinoffs of 4X series they are very diffrent games, where as The Pitt was a rougelike purists dream DotE is a rouglelite mixed with tower defense and RPG team managment. Although the game is in a very raw early acssess state one can see where the dev team is heading, in the TowerD part of the game you power up a limited number of rooms in the dungeon making paths to rooms that could modules to assist you in clearing the dungeon. After the room is powered you set up in the room an array of turrets and relays that will buff your party in combat against enemies that will come from new rooms and waves that may spawn from unpowred rooms, and if the room contains a slot for it you may place a module that will collect resources for you to use (the end game plans to have 3 but only two are currently avalible). The resources are used to build, trade with merchants, power rooms, or to hire and upgrade heroes, the third as of yet unimplamented resource will allow you to research a tech tree and upgrade buildings. The combat side of the game is a party based RPG where you move your party in real time either using them to explore or boost modual output. You can pause the game at anytime so as to give you time carefully layout plans as things can get quite tense as your heroes are not super powered space marines (at least not at the start) and will be mobbed and killied quickly if not managed properly. Overall in its raw form DotE is a fun experiance brining new ideas to both rouglites and tower defense and I'm egarly awaiting to see what the the devs will breakout in the future.			"

Geek Citadel - Dungeon of the Endless Review 
A Video of 
By: Geek Citadel

			Dungeon of the Endless is the perfect mixture of RPG and Tower Defense. Website: http://www.geekcitadel.com Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/geekcitadel Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/geekcitadel Twitter:...		


I admit that I’m not a big fan of Tower Defense games. I don’t see the appeal but somehow Dungeon of the Endless drew me in. Maybe it’s the Rogue-Like tendencies and the dungeon crawling aesthetic, but I was instantly intrigued by what this game had to offer. You play as a slew of heroes who have crash landed inside of a strange dungeon. The goal is to explore and defend your ships' power generator as you  head to the next floor. Does Dungeon of the Endless accomplish the combination of tower defense and exploration well? Let’s find out in this Bullet Point Review!What we likedPixel Perfect – The visuals in Dungeon of the Endless excels at providing a fluorescent sci-fi atmosphere to lose yourself in. The sleek pixel animations of characters and minimalist level design convey a truly splendid artistic wonder.The Sound of a Journey – Without a doubt the wispy tones of the soundtrack carry the heroes on their way to adventure. It’s a euphoric tickle of the ears that saturates us in unique and calming melodies. It reminds me of a few Chrono Trigger songs, and that my friends is high praise!Engrossing Exploration – The combination of RPG elements, Rogue-Like mazes, and Tower Defense feels just right in Dungeon of the Endless. Each door leads to a room that is randomly generated on each play session. The use of a power grid structure to illuminate the area and fortify a room is fanciful fun. Hunkering down to begin hoarding resources and plotting your escape is highly addicting. I always wanted to see what the next room had in store, even if it only lead to more monsters.No don’t open that door – Opening doors count as turns that activate enemy waves, complete research, and restore skill based moves for the heroes. It's an interesting take on turn-based strategy.Smart Automation – Combat is an automatic affair but it isn’t the type to frustrate you with dumb A.I. routines. The heroes will not allow enemies to stand on the other side of the room and destroy the precious generator. They make sure to keep all essential hostiles dealt with, so that you don’t have to break out into a rage festival.Tons of characters – The heroes aren’t necessarily deep characters in terms of backstory, but each of them have specific skill sets, designs, and animations to represent their personalities. It feels good to find a new survivor in the dungeon and bring them into the fold.Bring some friends – The Multiplayer allows up to four people to go online and survive some dungeons together. It copies the single-player fairly well, and gives each player their own resources for surviving the harsh monster attacks.What we didn’t likeWeapon bug – Players can only pick up 4 heroes in the Dungeon, and. the only way to recruit new heroes is by dismissing the one currently in the group. The problem is that any gear removed from the dismissed cannot be placed on the newly recruited hero. It can’t even be sold to the merchant and basically clutters up the inventory window until the next dungeon is reached.Selecting Characters – Multi-tasking can be in a pain the butt when you’re playing alone. Not because it’s difficult to move the heroes, but because you can’t always easily select them. The character portrait highlights are not easy to see, so at times a hero will be highlighted that you didn’t wish to move. Maybe a patch can allow us to scroll over the heroes to select them in Real-Time Strategy games.That looks familiar – Even though there are tons of variations on rooms, the areas begin to look extremely similar really quickly. This tends to be a problem with Rogue-Likes in general with the need to focus on indoor grid design. It can bog down the exploration experience when one place looks a little too similar to the last.Multiplayer Flaws – Dungeon of the Endless allows for players to reach 12 floors before completing the game. Players can stop and save anytime with one player, but Multiplayer does not have the option to save. This cuts down on the idea of exploration because games can take hours to complete. Also, items in chests are not distributed to multiple players. This would not be an issue if you could trade or door loot for a dungeon companion. Lastly, players can invite players to join a game but the option to create a private much does not exist.ConclusionThe story is a little light but that’s typical of the genre. What you have instead is a fun time waster that quickly becomes addicting. Searching around for various characters, stacking resources, and exploring for loot is a blast! We recommend you go out and buy Dungeon of the Endless. Find four friends and explore the endless mystery that awaits you.			"

												This game has so much potential, but just misses the mark due to some poor difficulty tuning and some lack of polish.The game starts with ""Easy"" and ""Too Easy"" difficulties.  ""Easy"" is properly ""Normal,"" or perhaps ""Hard.""  The strategic elements are really intriguing, and I like having characters that can equip items & level up.  The tower-defense-lite elements, mixed in, are neat too.  The soundtrack is nice, if a bit bland.But (regrettably, like many games lately) the RNG elements are poorly balanced.  In this case, the imbalance centers mostly around the ""Dust"" aspect.  ""Dust"" is some kind of energy source, and you use it to power-up the rooms that you explore.  You can voluntarily power and unpower rooms, to manage your ""Dust,"" which is strategic.  However, you accumulate dust very randomly, mostly by opening doors to new rooms.  Sometimes, +10 dust.  Other times, nada.  Powering rooms via dust (or rather, leaving them unpowered) is a double-whammy: your defenses won't operate in unpowered rooms, and enemies randomly spawn in unpowered rooms, always seeking to attack  your ""crystal.""  You don't  need to power the crystal room, but yoiu can't place any ""towers"" in it, either.  Monsters attacking your crystal will then cause you to lose dust, usually rather quickly.  It really boils down to the fact that a couple less-than-fortunate dust-related events, and the run will quickly spiral out of control and becomes irrecoverable.  Unlike some of the better rogue-like games (e.g., Binding  of Isaac, or Rogue Legacy), death provides you with nothing to show for it. At the end of a long run, there's very little impetus to start over.   "

												This is a fun little 2D side scrolling, survival game. The graphics are not great, but I found it interesting trying to keep multiple NPC's alive, while searching for the exit to each level, protecting your energy crystal, and killing waves of enemies. Shops, Upgrades, Research Stations, all allow you to better yourself with new and improved gadgets, weapons and armor, as you ascend level after level. Worth the buy.			"

								A really really promising roguelike, with tower defence esque elements. It's really fun and has some interesting ideas, resource management, RPG character progression, randomly generated levels, and a decent difficult curve from what is available so far at least. It has a quite nice pixel-art style too if you're into that. That said, it is very much in Alpha right now and doesn't have much content (There's only three floors available). If you're looking for a GAME to play a lot of, and not an ALPHA to support, this is probably not the game for you. However even if you don't buy it do keep an eye on it, if they keep adding content this game will be great.			"

												An interesting mix of roguelike, turn-based strategy, and tower defense, Dungeon of the Endless crash-lands a group of futuristic adventurers into an abandoned facility on an uncharted planet.  Each floor of the facility is broken up into rooms, and opening a new room begins a ""turn"" in which monsters might spawn, skills recharge, and resources are generated.  When monsters attack they make a beeline for the player's escape pod, which must be defended with strategic placement of the controllable adventurers and turrets placed in between waves.  As a roguelike no two runs are ever the same, with different dungeon layouts, characters, and items completely changing the best method of survival.  The game even offers online multiplayer with each player controlling a single character; a simple change that makes for an enjoyable collaborative strategic effort.  Now, Dungeon of the Endless is NOT for everyone, as the high level of strategy, planning, and resource management required for a successful run (not to mention the possibility of bad random chance ruining said successful run) makes for a very slow and methodical game experience that can feel more like staring at a spreadsheet than a dungeon.  That said it is an expertly-crafted game jam-packed with content and possibility for the aspiring chess master to sink their teeth into.			"

Early Access Review
								A surprisingly deep strategic dungeon defense game with excellent pacing, sense of progression, and replayability. Premise: Your spaceship crashland on an unknown planet. You find yourself burried into an unknown facility, trapped, with only the hope of find an exit out of this treacherous dungeon. WIth a team of heroes, you must plan a strategic escape by moving your ship's powercore to elevator. Along the way, without knowing where your destination lies, you must open doors to dark rooms populated with monsters, hazards, or if you are lucky, treasures, recruits, resources and special events. One of your main decision lies in using the game's main currency to power rooms, preventing monsters from spawning. You also have to allocate resources to build defenses, improve your hero, and invest in long term tech growth. ===Review===*Note: this is a beta review. Gameplay:+++ Great balance betwen Macro and Micro management. Macro involves resource allocation, where and when to power/unpower rooms, tech progression, defense placement and combination. Micro involves allocating heroes to point of defense, creating chokepoints, using abilities, etc. This is a huge plus because at any given point in the game, you will always make meaingful decisions for which you can be rewarded or punished.+++ Great Pacing. Pacing is determined by opening a door, which begins a new round: you gain resources, monsters spawn, you fight, etc. You can open as many doors and at whatever speed you wish; in doing so you dictate the flow of action. There's definitely as sense of joy as you become better at the game, especially in regards to making efficient decisions and this becomes every evident in your pacing.+++Customizable experience = Replayability. You can choose heroes and your spaceship in this game, which modifies the starting and persistent conditions of the game. For example one of the spaceship in the game changes the number of starting heroes from two to four and boosts their damage, but disables certain resources/defensive structures. +++ RNG = Replayability. Many factors are random as you progress through a level, such as what items you find, when/where you find merchants, which/when recruits you find, what special events occur, which monsters spawn, level layout, etc. --- Uneven difficulty. Do not make this mistake of using difficulty metric from other games. EASIEST difficulty = NORMAL,  play on easiest difficulty to learn game's mechanics. But once you've learned the mechanics, you'll find that easier difficulties take away from the play of the game, as abundent resources, weak monsters invalidates the need for better strategy.Strategic Elements:+++ Monsters have differentiated goals. Different monsters will prioritize different targets, be it your heroes, resource producing structures, defensive structures, NPCs. As such their pathing is different. Learning such differences adds depth to  the game.+++Well defined Hero roles. Most heroes in the game are specialized, which means that for any given situation you'd prefer some heroes over the rest due to their stats and abilities. This is good because your hero composition matters. +++All Hero stats are relevant. This is impressive because 99% of games out there get this wrong. +++All but one building in the game is useful. --- Why is this building in the game???--- Need more environmental hazards, such as cloud of slowing.  I feel like this aspec has so much potential, as it makes certain locations more strategic. ---Needs more NPC types to protect. The merchant is great for the game since the bonus of keeping him alive is huge. But the game would be better if there are more NPC types that offered different benefits. Interface+++ Clutter free--- Skills need more information--- Need customization hotkeys --- Why is the Inventory window separate from hero window Visuals+++Great color pallete+++Stylized characters --- hard to tell towers apart if build in very close proximity---hard to tell some lower tier offensive buildings apart from others due to their small sizeTheme+++ Interesting character bios+++ Flavorful naming schemes--- Wierd assortment of obsolete technology and futuristic technology for item choices.  Verdict:Without a doubt, this game is worth a buy if you are interested in the defense genre.  Though it's hardly fair to pin this game down to any one thing in particular, as you'll find many elements from different genres that will add to your enjoyment, be it strategic planning/resource management, hero building/progression, basebuilding/defense, and a small slice of MOBA-esque hero micromanagement. In the end, all these things would be meanlingless if they didnt add up to a cohensive whole, but in this case, they do, and the game shines because all the parts ultimately add up to form a more intricate and interesting whole.

Early Access Review
								I'd be hesitant to offer a recommendation on a work in progress (something the game advises youf upon login), but this game really got its hooks into me from the first play through which is probably reason enough to give a recommendation. Let me first be clear though that the current version only offers 3 levels and so this is akin to paying for a demo with the promise of more to come.The simple premise of opening doors and dealing with the consequences offers a surprising amount of variety given the fact that the events are randomly generated (or so the advertisng seems to make me want to believe), and the presence of resources that must be managed effectively. I consider this second element something of a boon as any kind of game where you build a base (mostly Real Time Strategy, but this 'Dungeon Defense' can fall into the same trap) will immediately set me to designing the 'perfect base' which takes a lot of time and tends to keep me from enjoying all that a game has to offer. Of course, if you happen to like doing such things, there's no sandbox mode, so keep that in mind.In the present [0.1.1] version you must be mindful of Dust, Industry, and Food. Dust powers rooms and, if it falls to 0, marks the end of the game. Industry allows you to build improvements that do everything from improve your production to offer defense. Food heals, hires, and levels the characters you have under your control (starting with 2, maximum of 4). Resources (including character health) are restored when entering a new room, and so some element of guess work is involved in best preparing yourself for whatever the next room will bring.Success, as far as it can be measured in such a game, is achieved by picking up your crystal - the heart of your base - and bringing it to an exit once it is discovered. Easily the most tense moments of the game are created by the waves of enemies that attempt to prevent your heavily encumbered crystal holder from accomplishing this goal. Assuming the crystal makes it to the exit intact, you'll be presented with the next dungeon with whatever resources you had previously (as you might suspect, and I learned the hard way, committing all of your resources to achieving this goal is ill advised).There are possibly two considerations a potential buyer might want to be aware of before jumping in with this title. Similar to the publisher's previous title, Endless Space, fairly significant elements of the game don't seem immediately clear to a first time player, even after considering the tutorial. For instance, I assumed a character's level automatically increased by collecting food (it doesn't), and it took me until the second play through to both discover how to accomplish this and equip the items I was hoarding in my inventory. Fortunately, this title has very simple controls and so it is not unresonable to assume that most players would be able to figure these things out eventually, but this process of discovery may not to be all players' tastes.Second is simply the question of value. Is the game worth your money, and if so, does the Founder Pack confer enough benefit to justify the slightly higher expense. The game itself is definately worth it, and I myself went for the Founder Pack. FIrst, consider that the majority of benefits come from owning previous, and anticipated, games by Amplitude (and so you are likely to already be an owner of these games, though my copy came with a 1/2 coupon off for Endless Space and its expansion, so if you're not an owner, you have a good excuse to become one). The other major benefit is the participation in the G2G program. On this front I would caution that I was a long time owner and player of Endless Space and have not yet taken advantage of the points I have earned for that title. I also encountered difficulty when attempting to use these credits (resolution pending). So if the G2G content alone is the reason for upgrading, I would suggest going with the Pixel Pack. That said, as an owner of Endless Space, I don't regret my decision to go for the Founder pack.All told, I think this a very engaging title that is simple to pick up but doesn't go stale. Even in its unfinished state, it's a nice looking game with a wonderful soundtrack (another feature it shares with its predecessor Endless Space). I'm really looking forward to what the developers have in store as they complete their work on the title, but I absolutely feel like I got value for the money I spent even in its early access form. Check it out if you're looking to try something new.			"

Early Access Review
								Its challenging and interesting. With game elements such as Tower Defense and Turn-Based/Real-Time components, the current alpha will take some thinking to get through, even if it is only a few levels.The goal of the game is to explore the ""Dungeon"" to find the exit point. The exit point isnt for your characters, but rather an Artifact that you must protect and transport. The Artifact isnt solely for the Capture the Flag purpose, it must be defended whilst you are exploring the dungeon, since all damage done is taken out of an important resource that can only be gained through exploring, killing enemies and selling items (from what I have discovered).By Turn-Based, we can classify the turns as the opening of a new room. You build up your defenses and manage resources/heroes in real time, with no chance of being attacked. As soon as a door is opened, there is a chance of gaining loot, meeting a character, or initiating a wave of aliens. The aliens may not only come from that room, but other rooms that you have opened that have no line of sight. So by using the free time, you prepare your defenses for the eventuality that the aliens come. You move your characters in Real Time and can build structures during alien waves (albeit at a slower rate) to defend.When you are completing the goal of transporting the diamond to the end point, it triggers an All or Nothing alien swarm spawn, with large, endless waves of aliens preventing you from completing the final goal. Yes, you may get the diamond to the end, but can all your heroes survive? Their deaths will carry on to the next level, and you need all hands on deck. Did you use too many resources levelling up/healing or building structures? The leftovers also carry over to your next game. The graphics are not really an issue. There is a factor of fun I really enjoy. I am not sure if multiplayer could be incorporated into this game, uunless it is a coop - pvp fight against the aliens, cooperating or fighting to get the artifact to the exit first. Many hopes for this game that it turns out as well as i had fun playing it.			"

												Dungeon of Endless is a fantastic rogue-like game. the pixel art style in games is getting old, however it doesnt take away from this title. Starting out with 2 heroes ,you must travel through a maze-like dungeon consisting of, I believe 12 levels to reach the exit.  Along the way you must build machines at way points you find ,to produce industry,science,and food. these are all used to build defenses,level up your heroes.and unlock technology. Finding items along the way to equip in your heroes inventory is rewarding.Finding and unlocking additional heroes along the way is satisfying as well. Traversing the dungeon is done by unlocking doors, each door unlocked may reveal a treasure chest, merchant,monsters,heroes,resource bonuses, Dust,or nothing. Dust is collected by opening some rooms and by defeating monsters. Dust is required to power a room. you can only buid machines and defenses in rooms that are powered. Some rooms are powered by themselves,however you may not power a room if it is not  connected to a room powered between it and yout starting point. Thhere is a technology that will allow this, but the cost is expensive. You will rarely have enough Dust to power every room. Unpowered rooms will spawn monsters that will attack you ,your technology or your crystal. The Crystal is always in the room you start in. once you find the exit, one of your heroes must carry the crystal. Of course carrying the crystal will severly cripple that heroes speed. you must defend the helpless hero as he/she makes thier way to the exit room. once there any heros in the exit room with the crystal may exit that floor and continue to progrees the dundeon, While you take unspent resources with you ,finding Dust seems to diminish as you reach the final handful of levels. The levels and items are procedurally-generated ,making  for worth playing again and again. Leveling up your heroes is fun and unlocks new abilities. I had a bit of a hard time learning the game. I did have to watch some play throughs before understanding what was really required to be successful. Once you grasp  the resources, how to get them, and what they are useful for  the game actually plays quite simple. While it plays simple Dungeon of Endless is hard and tense at times. You will die often and have to start over, however unlocking new heroes for your next playthrough is rewarding even in defeat. 4/5			"

												Imagine FTL crash-landed into Dungeons of Dredmor, and you could begin to explain Dungeon of the Enedless.  Sort of.  Amplitude has merged serveral genres into one in DotE (roguelike, 4x, squad tactics), and with stunning results. Don't let the mix of genres intimidate you. I'd never touched the 4x genre before, and found the basics of the game easy to learn.You begin by choosing two party members as your escape pod crash-lands in a hostile environment. The goal is to get your crystal (i.e., what powers all of your rooms and strucures) to the exit of each floor.  As you navigate your way through 12 levels, you will find a variety of equipment, teammates, and problems to solve (namely: how to keep your crystal from being detroyed).Each door opened constitutes a new turn, and that's when resources (industry, science, food and dust) are gained. Industry allows you to buiild, science can be spent on researching new modules, food levels/heals/recruits heroes, and dust powers rooms. Because rooms are powered by dust, you'll want to watch how much you have, as unpowered rooms will spawn enemies on most turns. Enemies will navigate toward the crystal in the most direct path available, so plan your defense as your explore.Choose your party members wisely, use their strengths to your advantage, and be careful about opening that next door. Some heroes are faster, tougher or more potent in combat than others. Some excel at a single role, while a few are flexible enough to do whatever the case calls far. Knowing when to man a defense and when to retreat will be important. A handful of heroes have the ""operate"" skill, allowing you to buff whatever major module they're manning. Make sure to pause often in combat -- it can save the life of your teammates when enemy waves become overwhelming. Death is permanent, so don't be stingy.Your heroes aren't alone in this, however, as you can build and research new structures (Major and Minor modules, both offensive and defensive) to help you succeed. Major modules are mostly for gaining resources, while minor vary from standard turrets, defensive buffs/debuffs or even healing teammates on enemy kills. Keep an eye out for how to gather as many resources as possible, as they will prove vital to success. You can't take your built modules with you, but you will retain any resources accrued.As far as sound and visual design go, DotE is a pleasant and consistent 16-bit palate.  The visuals are highly stylized and consistent, and the soundtrack will keep reminding you of tunes that could just as easily be from SNES titles or FTL. Thanks to unlocking new characters, difficulties and escape pods, the game is chock full of replayability. Online co-op should further bolster the game's lifetime, but I haven't had any experience with it to comment on.It's not as frustrating (read: unfair) as FTL, but still challenging enough to leave you feeling satisfied... even on the ""Too Easy"" difficulty setting.  Highly recommended.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless (DotE) is said to be a merge of dungeon crawler and tower defense, with random level generation and RPG elements. But is it really so? Let's find out.The game starts with two characters chosen from a pool of sixteen (many of them locked at the beginning) on a crashed spaceship. Their only source of energy is a crystal they must protect at all costs, and their objective will be to escape the ""dungeon"" where they have landed. The dungeon has twelve random generated floors, each of them considered a level. On each level, you explore the rooms in search for an elevator to take you to the next one. But it's not enough to find it. Once you find the elevator, you have to carry the crystal there.Both in the exploration and the transport phases, monsters will attack you, but in different ways. Here comes a key element of DotE: the dynamic combination of real-time and turn-based gameplay. A new turn begins each time you open a door. At this moment, you receive resources and monsters spawn. From this point, you control your characters in real time to fight the monsters or build new defenses. When you take the crystal to carry it to the elevator, the game becomes full real-time, with monsters spawning continuously until you reach the level exit. Or die.The game takes elements from different genres. First, you have a party of up to four characters. You start with two and recruit more during the exploration. Some will die, and death is permanent, so you'll need to hire replacements. Each character has three item slots that can vary from one to another, in which you can equip stuff found on chests or bought from merchants. They also have a particular level system: you don't level up by fighting monsters and getting experience points, you level up by spending food (one of the resources avaliable) on the characters. Higher levels lead to better stats and new abilities, both active and passive. Characters are different enough to have different gameplay styles. Next you have the resource system. There are four resources in this game: industry to build things, science to research new things, food to heal and level up your heros, and dust to lit rooms. Lit rooms allows you to build things in them, and also prevents monster from spawning. You can increase your production in any of the first three resources by building modules, but dust is only obtained when found through the dungeon, and resets at every new floor. There are also a lot of minor modules to build. From stat bonuses to plain offensive towers to enemy mind control modules. DotE comes with two difficulties: ""very easy"" and ""easy"", which in fact mean normal and hard, respectively, and also some pods that determine certain gameplay changes, like no health regeneration in exchange for better heals with food. This, in combination with the different character choices and research decisions, help to increase the game lifespan. In my opinion, this is a highly original game, an unique combination of genres with an identify of its own, and probably one of the best indies of the last year. It's hard and it's punishing, and many gameplay aspects are left for you to discover for yourself, but beating it is really rewarding.			"

Early Access Review
								Awesome game, of course still in beta, but has great replay value. The concept of the game is simply keep your crystal safe and along the way you collect dust witch is needed to power up the next dark rooms, you get dust by defeating the mobs, you also have to set up defenses and you get great loot from chest like blueprints or armor/weapons and you can upgrade your player stats by collecting food. You might also find a vendor or an extra crew member to help in the fight but will cost you dust. I am only about 30 hours or so but still a great fun game for a cheap price. I hope they add multiplayer or local multiplayer, but no mention in the forums, they have stated that they wll update the game every 2 weeks but have not stated what they have planned.			"

												In Dungeon of the Endless, you play as survivors of a spaceship prison, destroyed while in transit.  Your escape pod crashes in to a dungeon, and your objective is to clear all twelve floors and get the hell out. You start with two squad members, and can pick up more (to a max of four) as you go along.  The gameplay itself is very in-depth, and would require a windy explanation.  There are plenty of reviews that have done that, so I'm going to keep it short and let you know just what kind of game this is.Game elements that Dungeon of the Endless does well:Roguelike (with permadeath)Tower Defense (a variety of towers that you'll need to complete each floor)RTS (with pause, research and resource management)RPG (character leveling and equipment)Squad-based CombatEach of those elements exist here, and they're all handled perfectly.  The closest thing this game has to a failing is the weakish story, and limited dialogue.  Some of the dialogue is a little poorly written, as well.  The characters are crazy cool, though.  And there are lots of them to unlock.  Don't buy it for the story.  Buy it because it's a jack-of-all-trades video game that masters every job it sets out to accomplish.Warning:  This game is hard.  The two main difficulties are Very Easy and Easy.  In 70 hours of gameplay, I've managed to win twice.  On Easy mode.  And I've loved every second of it.			"

												Truly bizarre game, but one that works really well. This is a strange combination of tower defense, a roguelike, and Gauntlet; it sounds strange, but it's great fun to play. You have a team of heroes whose job it is to find the exit to the level, and get your power crystal thingy to that exit without it being destroyed. Sounds simple, but there's a lot of hidden complexity here. You can use your crystal's energy to power rooms in the dungeon, which stops creatures spawning there, but there's never QUITE enough energy; you need to decide which rooms should be powered, which rooms can be allowed as spawn points, where to position your heroes so they can stop monsters spawning, defend against those that DO spawn, protect the crystal, reach each other if they need help, gain extra supplies by 'operating' machines, etc. Each hero has a unique combination of abilities (and items you might find) which can help them specialize into particular roles.Sounds tedious, maybe, but it's fast-paced and fun. And extremely @#$@ing frustrating.cheap + fun = well worth a play			"

												Absolutely brutal, but (mostly) in a good way.  Will keep you opening doors for hours.DotE is essentially a Tower Defense game, albeit one with a couple of central conceits that combine to make for something quite a bit more interesting.  You play as a set of 2 heros chosen from a fairly sizable roster, each with unique stats, skills, strengths and weaknesses, tasked with taking a McGuffin from Elevator to Elevator whilst waves of monsters that spawn every time you open a door try to either kill you or destroy said McGuffin.  Opening doors also generates resources, each of which is seperately produced and used for specific tasks, all of which are important in their own way.  The game is a constant balancing act between building generators to get more resources vs. building defenses to keep them from being destroyed, leveling up characters whilst keeping enough food on hand to keep them alive, funneling monsters to choke points without getting them over-run, and positioning your heroes to deal with oncoming waves as you open doors in search of the exit.The fact that the dungeons are randomly generated - along with the massive number of unique heroes to choose from - greatly extends replayability.  Unfortunately, monster spawns have also been partially randomized, resulting in occasionally running into floors that feel downright unwinnable.  The game WILL kick you in the balls on occasion, but because of how much the game depends on strategy and approach it hasn't left me feeling cheated more than a handfull of times in several hundred playthroughs.Definitely worth picking up.

												The game, Dungeon of the Endless was made using the Unity engine and was developed by Amplitude Studios,and goes for the price of 19.99 US Dollars,The game came out in october of 2014 and is planned to have a xbox one release later this year (2015).The Endless Dungeon is a Strategy,Dungeon Crawler,Tower Defense game.You play as a crew that crashed there ship on to an unnamed planet after the crash of your ship you have to go through the many floors of the vessel until you beat that ship,once you have beaten a crashed ship you move on the next one and so on. In each ship you come across a crystal,that you have to protect it and in order to go to the next floor you.As far as gameplay goes you have to set up several sections of industry, science,food,LAN for the ship.The industry lets build up turrets for your defence against the plenty of hordes that will come.The food generators let you make food that you heal your hero with.The science produces as in the name more science which lets you upgrade the other modules.The LAN module Adds 120%/140%/170%/200% to all module's defense.The last main module is the Tactical HUD which adds 18%/21%/23%/26% attack power to all heroes on the floor.There is also a multiplayer so instead of contolling two charaters by yourself you can work as a group of four (Maximum).A few disclaimers,The standard price for the game is 19.99 as said earlier but I wouldnt reccommend buying it for that much,The most I personally be willing to pay for a game like this is around 10-15 US dollars.I personally purchased the game for 6.49 US dollars for the Endless Sale where all endless games were going on sale.Another slight problem with the game is the elevator at the end of the level on my first multiplayer game on The Endless Dungeon i had grabbed the crystal and went to the elevator and traveled up by myself to the next floor my team was left behind.Overall though I have enjoyed my time playing this game.I would reccommend if you are a fan of indie games,old school pixil graphics,and tower defence game.My overall rating for the game is a 85/100.

								Quite a worthwhile purchase for $10. I'm having a good bit of fun with 0.1.3 and can't wait for further development. Wondering how science resources will tie in.Its an intereting hybrid of tower defence and dungeon exploration with RPG elements. The graphics are highly stylized which provide an odd but not bad feel to the game.Note that mobs won't spawn where you have powered rooms. Control click to power or unpower a room. So this allows you to have powered room chains generating resources that don't require any defence. Mob will also only spawn from explored rooms. So you need to be careful how you explore. Explorer fully down room chains. Don't create unneccessary directions where you have to setup a defence. That said, full exploration of a levels 1 and 2 make level 3 easier since you can level your characters and accumulate resources.			"

												Excellent!! Can't recommend this highly enough! If you're a fan of FTL or things in that vein, get this. It's dungeon exploration where every new room counts as a turn, while you're having to protect an ""energy crystal"" in the center of each floor (tower defense, place traps/weapons/defenses/buffs) while balancing resources and leveling up your characters and their gear!Each floor progresses by eventually finding the exit and having to carry the ""energy crystal"" across the floor through waves of enemies to plant it in an elevator to power you up to the next level. Permadeath for your heroes. So addicting and fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless has been one of the most pleasant gaming surprises I have had in the last months. I usually don't trust early access games, and honestly, I am not too fond of pixelated graphics, but after reading the different positive reviews from other gamers, I decided to give this game a try.And what a nice surprise it was, up to the point that I have decided to make my first review in Steam to support these developers and their game. As you might have read, this game is a mix between roguelike and tower defense games. Though they are two very different genres, the gameplay is so smooth that they blend together seamlessly.The difficulty is hard, but fair. You are going to die a lot, but you will learn something new from each run. Everytime you play, you will perform better and better (or at least learn new tactics or approaches). The randomization of the levels and heroes makes this game replayable many, many times. However, this randomness can also provoke that some of the levels are more difficult (or easier) on every run. Overall, I really love this approach, as makes every game very different from the previous ones.In spite of being an Alpha, the game is very playable, and in about 6-9 hours you will be able to finish the 5 levels that are currently developed. However, you will probably come back for more runs.Pros:- The gameplay is a blast, even in this Alpha stage.- Excellent blend of tower defense and rogue-like games.- A game that makes you think and choose wisely your actions. One mistake can doom your run.- Very nice art style.- Randomness makes this game very replayable.- Distinct and interesting heroes.- Nice difficulty level which makes every advancement very rewarding.Cons:- Pixelated graphics. It is something personal, but I don't like them very much. However, as I priorize gameplay over them (and the art style is very nice), it is a minor complaint.- Randomization can make a level very easy, or very difficult (it is a good thing, but also a bad one). For me, it is also a minor complaint, as I love surprises...As you have seen, I don't think that the difficulty level is a Con. I prefer the game being difficult (or at least having that level adjustable), because I think that games should not be a walk in the park.Very nice game, and definitely recommended! Thumbs up for the devs, and I am eager to see the new surprises you have in development for us in the following patches!			"

												A unique roguelike that skirts the boundaries between tower defense and RTS, with systems and energy management systems that all work together to create a challenging game set in the Endless universe that continues to get expanded with lore and crossover references that make the unvierse feel cohesive and connected even though the games take place eons apart from each other. A squad management systems allows you to recruit new party members as you go and level them up, forcing you to decide between new unlevelled prty members as you find them, and the team you've started the game with and invested points into. You need to carefully balance your team between members thta are good at combat, good at scouting, and good at taking care of the modules and towers you place down to help you when fights get overwhelming.On top of this, the game sports excellent multiplayer at the expense of taking away the pause function - but with a second or third or fourth set of eyes, you shouldn't need to pause. Right? ... right? (no)The music and dungeon ambience and aesthetic are fantastic as well, giving the right environment to crawling thorugh all of these old abandoned facilities and parts of the planet as you try to escape, and shutting down everthing but one sepcific route as you try to carry your Crystal through, FF: Crystal Chronicles style lightnig the way, gets incredibly intense and nailbiting. There's also unlockables available about all crew members and monsters to draw you into the world more and learn more about them.And all of that is just on the basic default space-pod, which has no modifiers that change the way the game works on a basic level. There's more that change how every run works as you unlock them, and an Endless mode to see just how far you can go.Great game, and the only reason I haven't  played it more is because of a billion other games to play.

								Think FTL, but better, and different, but still hard as balls. You Start DotE with two randomly chosen heroes and your generator in your crashed ship, with a door to a randomly generated dungeon.Open the door, explore the dungeon, build modules to collect resources, use resources to level up heroes and build turrets  that attack, increase defense, heal or cast status effects. Discover merchants and buy better gear, blueprints for better turrets. Find new heroes and recruit them to your team. Find the exit to the next level and get your generator there safely to escape.At this stage in the Alpha there are a few features locked, and as far as I can tell there is only 3 levels available but that is more than enough, because you will die. You will die A lot. As I said, think FTL. Other than that, it's fantastic. Look gorgeous and plays great, honestly had you told me this was the end product I would still have bought it and played it for hours. 100% recommended!			"

												An enjoyable RTS / Tower Defense / RPG hybrid with roguelike elements that will sink in your head for days. The gameplay is original, yet extremely challenging even on the lowest difficulty, the art-style is gorgeous and minimalistic, and there is tons of content just thrown at you at every turn. It's also story-lite so there's no walls of text thrown at you constantly.The game has a steep enough learning curve, only giving you a short tutorial on the basics, requiring you to figure out things for yourself. You start with two heroes, but eventually you will unlock up to two more hero slots as you find them in the dungeon, with a total of 16 different heroes available to choose from. Resource managing is key in Dungeon of the Endless. If you want strong characters, you'll need to build food modules, if you want tons of laser cannons to stop wave upon wave of enemies, you will need machinary resources. And if you want access to additional modules ranging from decoys, lasers, bombs, then you'll need to gather science resources.(Here is the part where I explain how to play this game, making it even more confusing.)The game has a unique ""turn"" system, designated by a door, i.e. when you open a door, a turn will pass, giving you resources based on modules you have built. Anything can happen during these turns. A wave of monsters can surprise you, power can go out, you may uncover a buff crystal or a research post, or a shop where you can spend a specific randomly chosen resource on some neat stuff.The objective of the game is to find the exit in the dungeon, allocate a hero to carry the crystal at the start of the level, and escort them to the exit, while of course, being bombarded by enemy waves. Rooms can be lit up using ""Dust"", the primary resource in the game. It's collected from enemies and certain rooms when opened. Dust is also the crystal's health, so if attacked, you will lose dust, thus losing power in rooms.Lighting up the rooms stops enemies from spawning during turns and the ""final"" phase, but also allows you to place modules on the dungeon floor at the cost of machinery resource.The game is perma-death, so if your crystal is destroyed, if your heroes die, or if the hero carrying the crystal dies, then it's game over, and back to level 1 again. There is a number of different ""pods"" you can choose from, all with various difficulties and requirements, so there is plenty to mess around with here.There is so much more to this game, including levelling up your heroes, learning new skills, abilities, picking up or buying/selling items, weapons, armour and accessories, triggering random events and most importantly, taking a whole bunch of risks. It's one of the most perplexing and gripping games I've played in a long time and you should buy it when you can. (There is multiplayer, however I haven't got around to taking a stab at it yet,  but when I do, I'll update this review.)			"

As for the Multiplayer though there eare quite a few problems but to be honest the Multiplayer has only just been introduced and the game isn't focused on the Multiplayer stuff.This game is perfect for playing alone, taking your time, saving and coming back to it whenever you have the chance.9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Let me state something that may seem a bit funny.  When I saw DotE hit Steam as Early Access, I hoped for a new dungeon crawler like Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight, and others.  What I got wasn't really what I was looking for and I put it down and did not touch it.  Fast forward to months after the purchase.  I decided to load it back up and give it a chance, due to the fact that I was starting to really get into rogue likes.  I didn't understand it, but I kept pushing myself to learn what makes this game work and if I can like it.  I started to understand and I started to like it, but I was terrible at the game and put it down again because of how bad I was doing.  Fast foward now to the present where I absolutely adore this game.  I finally understood the idea of modules, currency, dust, what stats do.  I'm still bad at it, but it's due to my skill and not for the fact that I originally hated it.  The art style, music, controls, mechanics, etc; everything here to make Dungeon of the Endless a fantastic title.			"

												I've played several games with my mates and we've had such a great time. Our enjoyment diminished quickly however, when we encountered the terrible issues in the multiplayer system Amplitude Studios have implemented. You seriously can't rejoin the multiplayer match if you disconnect from the game, which can happen at any time. There is some serious polish missing that doesn't seem to be on the developers minds. I've read forum posts and dev updates that acknowledged the multiplayer as far back as in 2013 and there still isn't a fix in place. I'm very concerned that the developers haven't been able, or just avoided solving this very important issue. It's the only reason why I'm not recommending this game.The rest of the game is just a blast to play, but is ruined by the fact that your progress can be ruined at any time after doing a run for over 3 hours. Just disappointing			"

												So let my start off by saying I love this dev, unabashedly.  I think they're great.  I think Amplitude is fantastic and I will still buy any game they come out with.  This game is terrible to me.What is there to do in this game?  One simply right clicks and then awaits the result.  I don't see any real depth to this because I'm just sitting here watching my heroes do their hero things and the RNG spawn mobs wherever it feels like spawning them.  There is no actual gameplay, it's just the power of your right click against the RNG.I don't leave very many reviews at all, but this one was a special kind of insidious.  The reviews are great, and I think for the hardcore roguelike player this game might have a lot to offer.  However, I work a full time job, I've got family stress, I'm in my late twenties.  I can't enjoy a game that makes me die repeatedly to learn what I need to do anymore.  At the same time, this game that makes me die repeatedly just plays itself.  There's no story (like Spelunky), no uniqueness (Curse of the Necrodancer) or class replayability (Risk of Rain).  It's just a little game, but god it's not worth the frustration to me.I refunded it.			"

												This game has the ability to make time pass very fast. I'm thankful to the pirating community for being able to try this gem of a game before I bought it. I don't have the best computer so it's a gamble to purchase games, and living in a small town without any place to work has made game purchasing hard as of late. So when I was working I made sure to pick this one up to have support the authors. That's something all of you should do, if you pirate a game and enjoy it, then buy it!         Anyway, this game is best described as a tower defence roguelike dungeon crawler. I'm not always in the tower defense mood, but when I am I am glad to have this game to go to. My only grief is the same grief I have with most tower defense games. Once you figure out a working strategy the challenge vanishes. Thankfully there are other game modes to play with, some of which don't allow me to do my winning strategy. (Boy did my heart sink once I figured out the strategy to just breeze through the game though)        I recently got caught up in a nearly 16 hour straight gaming session with this one (which is when I figured out my strategy) and got a little burnt out and probably wont be playing it again for some time. I'm still glad to have it in my library and if any further updates come alone to freshen things up a bit more I'll certainly hop back into it.        Oh, and one more grief is the online play. It's best to play with friends that you know already and to communicate using skype or something. I've never finished to the end on any online play, someone almost always drops out after the second floor, if not the host dropping everyone immediately after game start. I once made it to the eighth floor with someone online. But what started with 4 became 2 after the third floor. If there was a way for the resources to be divided up among the players or something different than the current system it would help a lot. I've had games that quit immediately because someone used up a resource right away or built a module that made the host upset. All and all, unless you have friends like I said before, just don't worry about the multiplayer.           In all if anything I wrote sounds appealing then go for it! Especially if it's on sale. I really need to stop getting inspired to write a review right before I go to bed. I've been nodding off while writing this and forgetting what I just wrote. So sorry if this is a bit jumbled.

Posted: April 24, 2015
												An intriguing blend of tower defense, rts, and dungeon crawler, that suffers the foibles of all three.The art style is crisp and reminiscent of FTL, while bringing tidbits of lore from the Endless Space universe. Meanwhile, its cast is relatively new, so there's no worries for those who aren't a big fan of the 4x game Dungeon of the Endless is deriving its lore from.Gameplay largely functions in an RTS micromanagement style. Where in an RTS you may be controlling dozens of units in multiple control groups, Dungeon of the Endless plays in a more hero-themed style, controlling only up to four characters at a time. Multiplayer games allow players to reduce the number of units that must be micromanaged, and a four-man band can each have one player, allowing for very simple or very complex micro scenarios.Main stumbling block of the game is the newly implemented multiplayer. Because turns are based on doors opened, and because certain things, say, research, demand a number of doors to complete--and because there are a limited number of doors in a floor, and increasing threats in deeper floors--playing with new players is an experience in frustration, as they will be compelled to progress turns through a desire for exploration--whereupon overwhelming numbers of enemies can spawn.Additionally, DotE suffers from an overdependence on a turn-based resource pool, and thus the management of 'build orders'. While the build order/research dynamic works fine in an RTS, where you're in a technology arms race against an opponent in a sportlike setting, the opposite is the case in a team-based dungeon crawler. Since as many as four people can be in the same party, there's often a pressing urge to 'do' something, when the gameplay demands the players instead take their time and plan for the whole group. Depending on the player personalities, this can lead to an 'Armchair General' type of situation, where one player makes the decisions, while the rest either simply nod and follow along, or stand around waiting to defend against spawned monsters from unlit rooms. Not helped by this is an ""Operating"" mechanic on many of the characters, which incentivizes players to hold their ground and utilize a resource building to produce extra resources, instead of exploring seperately. Essentially, every move through a door is a collectively agreed-upon move for the team, or else resources dwindle, and monsters become overwhelming.Some of the spawning mechanics probably need a little tweaking. As much as a roguelike should encourage preparation, improvement, and memorization of what threats do what, Dungeon of the Endless has a bad habit of rolling the dice on what kind of enemies will pop up on a floor, and some combinations are downright diabolical given lack of dust, a resource that itself is RNG-limited. For instance, one run with a friend spawned massive hordes of yellow enemies that attack the floor crystal, reducing light levels--but the floor also spawned rapidly dashing enemies that FLEE combat, to bust open far off doors, to allow for more monster encounters to occur. Making matters incrementally more difficult, the floor also determined it would spawn an enemy that debuffs the PCs attacks, making juggling all three issues together impossible, for our group. While this is of itself forgivable for a normal roguelike (teaching the player that one particular threat must be seperated and singled out, or that preparing the right technology can avert a wipe), the fact that such a well-synchronized set of monsters can spawn en-masse on the roll of a die after hours of gameplay, and without much warning, does not mesh well with a tower defense/rts style. For layman's reference, imagine if Plants Versus Zombies threw hordes of Gargantaurs and Bungee Zombies at you, before even warning you that the upcoming waves would have them, or even showing you what one did, before sending dozens your way. There is potential for a similarly devastating scenario, in later floors of Dungeon of the Endless.All in all, it's a fun and new idea, and I'd love to see it refined into something different. Imagine a more straight-forward dungeon crawler that used this real-time, multiplayer mechanic, without the resource climb. Play this game for how it pieces together some diverse, disparate mechanics functionally and attractively, but don't be too disappointed when it starts to grow repetitive in that old, wave-after-wave, tower-defense way, or just pisses you off with an all-in ""zerg rush"" via AI mob spawns, that makes you want to take a break from it for awhile.

The visuals, music and sounds are all top notch and add to the great boiling pot that is the gameplay. With  a mixture of 4X, Tower Defense, Rogue-like, and RTS all in one great package. It is a great price and is a good lead into the other games in the same universe. Thank you for such a great game Amplitude!Still can't stop playing.			"

												Very fun and addicting rogue-like game with mechanics reminding me of X-COM as well as many other games including KotoR, DragonAge, and even FTL. The pre-set controls are a little clunky but there is the option to change them (which I will do eventually, maybe). Other than that, a very beautifully crafted game with a lovely soundtrack. I would say get this game meow if you are a fan of any the above mentioned titles or would just like to torture yourself because like watching your characters die. Due to, as in many titles branding the name ""rogue-like"", you learn through your failure. Good luck out there if you decide to get this game, and if not, do yourself a favor and add it to your wishlist to see when it's on sale and pick it up.			"

												WARNING: So here we are, Dungeon of the Endless. A very different game from Amplitude studios; who specialized in 4X games (Endless Space, Endless Legend). And while this game has multiple elements of those previous games and 4X games in general, if you are looking for a 4X Game, this is not your pickup. If you are looking for a good rogue-like, a good tower defense game, or a mix of both and some 4X elements, this is the best pickup for you on the market.Settings: The settings are useful and helpful, as everyone has their own preferences. Overall positive. This goes for the UI of the game as well.Story: There is little direct story in this game, such as in The Binding of Isaac, but much is hidden in the lore and different unlocks you find in the game. These will not be further discussed, because spoilers.Gameplay: Time for the meat of this review. The gameplay is relatively simple. Your characters progress through rooms on twelve different floors, each floor progressing in difficulty. There is always a chance for monsters to spawn, and you will fight them. But the big part of the game is the four major resources that come into play. Here they are:Industry (Gear Icon): Industy is used to build things (notably modules): They can generate other resources, or defend rooms.Science: Spend science to research new modules.Food: Levels up/heals your heroes.Dust: Does not generate per floor, but is picked up. Used to light rooms.If a room is not lit, monsters might spawn in that room. So yeah. You're going to need some defenses. There is a crystal in the starting room, once you find the exit, you must take that crystal to the exit. You can't leave until the character CARRYING the crystal enters it. Once the crystal is picked up, in every dark room monsters will spawn.Elements: The rogue-like element is pretty obvious. The 4X elements of resource management and production, and how to spend them is super important. But tower defense is pretty simple. Build things that help heroes, or hurt monsters, so that they can't get to your crystal. When the crystal is hit, you lose dust. When the crystal dies, you lose. When all the heroes die, you lose.Difficulty: It is an odd game in difficulty. At the start, there are two difficulties: Too easy and Easy. Too easy after a few games to get the hang of things becomes too easy. Easy is brutal, and requires you to scrap for resources, mangage them incredibly well, and then most likely die to some fatass punching your crystal.Replayability: Yes. It has proceduraly generated floors. And it's a rogue-like. Never heard of a good rouge-like without replayability.Conclusion: This game isn't often what people are looking for, especially fans of previous games by Amplitude. But this is a fantastic blend of multiple genres, including the dying tower defense games, and the somewhat bland 4X games. This revitalizes these elements in a unique blend that requires the player to be smart, quick to adapt to situations, good with spending resources and leveling the hero, which brings some RPG into the game, and not getting too frustrated when that fatass kills your crystal three games in a row because you didn't upgrade those claymoar mines on floor seven to get a HUD module that no matter what you do keeps getting destroyed halfway through the floor because you haven't saved up enough industry or science to buy or research better protection, and now one of your heroes is dead because there wasn't enough food to heal her, and oh my god it's Midnight. I need to sleep. Well maybe let's have one more go.			"

								Dungeon of the Endless first caught my attention with its quirky art style and RPG elements. It was only then that I realised this is a game set in the same universe (loosely) as Endless Space - another favorite. At this point the game is very much a limited demo, but it teaches its core mechanics well. Once they implement technology trees and science, this will be a great little rogue-like meets tower defense meets tactical management game. Recommended.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is one of my favorite games. I have put only a small portion of time into it but from what I have experienced it has been amazing. The visuals, music and sounds are all top notch and add to the great boiling pot that is the gameplay. With  a mixture of 4X, Tower Defense, Rogue-like, and RTS all in one great package. It is a great price and is a good lead into the other games in the same universe. Thank you for such a great game Amplitude!Still can't stop playing.			"

												WARNING: So here we are, Dungeon of the Endless. A very different game from Amplitude studios; who specialized in 4X games (Endless Space, Endless Legend). And while this game has multiple elements of those previous games and 4X games in general, if you are looking for a 4X Game, this is not your pickup. If you are looking for a good rogue-like, a good tower defense game, or a mix of both and some 4X elements, this is the best pickup for you on the market.Settings: The settings are useful and helpful, as everyone has their own preferences. Overall positive. This goes for the UI of the game as well.Story: There is little direct story in this game, such as in The Binding of Isaac, but much is hidden in the lore and different unlocks you find in the game. These will not be further discussed, because spoilers.Gameplay: Time for the meat of this review. The gameplay is relatively simple. Your characters progress through rooms on twelve different floors, each floor progressing in difficulty. There is always a chance for monsters to spawn, and you will fight them. But the big part of the game is the four major resources that come into play. Here they are:Industry (Gear Icon): Industy is used to build things (notably modules): They can generate other resources, or defend rooms.Science: Spend science to research new modules.Food: Levels up/heals your heroes.Dust: Does not generate per floor, but is picked up. Used to light rooms.If a room is not lit, monsters might spawn in that room. So yeah. You're going to need some defenses. There is a crystal in the starting room, once you find the exit, you must take that crystal to the exit. You can't leave until the character CARRYING the crystal enters it. Once the crystal is picked up, in every dark room monsters will spawn.Elements: The rogue-like element is pretty obvious. The 4X elements of resource management and production, and how to spend them is super important. But tower defense is pretty simple. Build things that help heroes, or hurt monsters, so that they can't get to your crystal. When the crystal is hit, you lose dust. When the crystal dies, you lose. When all the heroes die, you lose.Difficulty: It is an odd game in difficulty. At the start, there are two difficulties: Too easy and Easy. Too easy after a few games to get the hang of things becomes too easy. Easy is brutal, and requires you to scrap for resources, mangage them incredibly well, and then most likely die to some fatass punching your crystal.Replayability: Yes. It has proceduraly generated floors. And it's a rogue-like. Never heard of a good rouge-like without replayability.Conclusion: This game isn't often what people are looking for, especially fans of previous games by Amplitude. But this is a fantastic blend of multiple genres, including the dying tower defense games, and the somewhat bland 4X games. This revitalizes these elements in a unique blend that requires the player to be smart, quick to adapt to situations, good with spending resources and leveling the hero, which brings some RPG into the game, and not getting too frustrated when that fatass kills your crystal three games in a row because you didn't upgrade those claymoar mines on floor seven to get a HUD module that no matter what you do keeps getting destroyed halfway through the floor because you haven't saved up enough industry or science to buy or research better protection, and now one of your heroes is dead because there wasn't enough food to heal her, and oh my god it's Midnight. I need to sleep. Well maybe let's have one more go.			"

												Fantastic rogue like dungeon explorer. Best with some friends but fun solo as well. It's simple to learn but to make it even on the very easy setting you need to strategize and plan every room opening in the later levels.  My main complaint is the time it takes to run a full game is very long expect to play for 2-3 hours per session. If you get it for $10 or under it's a great value.			"

Early Access Review
								The last patch for this title, as of this writing, was 0.5.2, so things may have changed as you read this review.Even if things have changed however, this is still a very solid recommendation. I had this game on my wishlist from the first time I saw it, and struggled with whether to get it or not as I have been burned by other Early Access titles before. But this game blends several genres together beautifully; roguelike (or roguelite, depending on how picky you are at naming it) along with tower defense and turned based role-playing.The story is pretty barebones at this point; you're on a prison ship, and it gets shut down and overrun by monsters, and thus you have to escape. For some reason that isn't explained, you need to take a crystal (presumably a power source?) with you. The crystal serves as your ""base"" hit points, along with a power source and currency. You start with two heroes out of three to start with, and as you progress you can unlock additional heroes by means of first finding them at random and surviving three straight floors with them in your party. Each 'turn' is the opening of a door. In between you can build modules to provide one of three resources (food, science, industry) or specific modules to attack incoming enemies, increase attack power, defense, or even debuff enemies. This is where the tower defense element comes in because you have to manage the resources you have to make sure the crystal is properly defended, and your resources aren't unlimited. Once you run out of rooms to open on the current floor, you're out of resources.The roleplaying elements come from finding equippable items, and using your food resource to level your heroes. Combat isn't involved, as your hero and the enemies take turns swinging, and while you can heal them mid-battle with food, that's about as involved as the combat gets.The roguelike/roguelite elements come from the fact that each floor is randomly generated, so you don't know what enemies you'll find, where the exit is, where any additional heroes are (f any), etc. Also the fact if you lose, that's it. If you meet the criteria to unlock a hero they will be available upon starting a new game but that's it. I should also point out that the only thing that carries over between levels of the dungeon is the hero's equipment and levels. It sounds complicated, but it's easy to figure out after spending some time with it. The music and sound is fitting, not really exceptional, but the graphics are very pleasing to the eye. But in this case it's the gameplay that sells the same. It's very good right now and should only get better from this point.			"

												Very cool game. I didn't expect as much depth to it as it had. It was also freakin' hard! The first dungeon has 2 difficulties, ""Too easy"" and ""Easy"", which really rather felt like ""Normal"" and ""Hard mode"". I haven't managed to clear it on Easy yet (so, ""Hard mode""), but the too easy variant was indeed pretty easy to beat. I never ended up bothering much with the other dungeons, I tried them but in the end the original dungeon was the most fun.There's lot of variety in the game. You can go at it from a lot of different approaches (Tower-Defense style or rather Hero-Defense style for example) which isn't explained in the game but you figure it out on your own, or through YouTube videos.Multiplayer mode adds in a lot of fun and really enhances the game. You have to decide together with someone else which way to go, what to build, which stuff to research and how to spend your resources as efficiently as possible. Also you cannot pause in multiplayer, which saved my life very often in single player mode. That makes it a lot more challenging, but since more players can watch over things it's well-balanced.Multiplayer mode does have one big downside: it's messed up resource system. It would've been more fun if resources were either shared or something else. Now each player has their own resource pool of which the income is based on a formula that goes (normal resources gained/amount of players), rounded up. Usually I ended up passing all science resources to one player, that would do all research and then I'd do all production so they'd give all industry resources to me. Every round. Super annoying.All in all, definitely a fun and challenging game. I'd recommend it to others, both single- and multiplayer. It's easy to pick up, hard to master, and throws a serious challenge at you. It's definitely worth the price, compared to what you get.			"

												The complexity of a Four-X game with the  brutality of an old Arcade game, plus Tower Defense. You wander through dungeons opening doors until you find the exit.When a Hero dude/dudet opens a door, monsters spawn in dark rooms and go to ""the Crystal"" (which acts as a power source for lit rooms) with the intent of destroying it. You can place modules in lit rooms to defend them from monsters parading towards the crystal thing. Modules cost resources generated by opening doors; some Large modules increase the resources gained when opening doors. When you survive 12 floors, you win.That's the beef of the game. The rest is details, but that's where the puzzle/experience of every game is too, even 4Xs. This game's beautifully modular design makes tiny DLCs feel revolutionary. It's awesome.Not reccommended for Pixel-Art tourists; you'll be savagely eaten by the game's mechanics. If you're patient, you'll like it though.			"

												At first with the presentation and the graphics I wasn't sure to test it.  Then I went in it because I also do bitmap art these days.  I was delightfully impressed in the free week-end.The learning curve is pretty intuitive in comparaison of the over complicated tutorial and 1Gig heavy game it was pitted against.  In the same time it is just enough complex to had made me growl the very first 4 times I tried to clear the first level because I didn't figured out yet how to use the towers/turrets.  Once that is understood, you can start to scheme so much for how you want your game to go and level out your characters, it is amazing.  And yes... another of those game without survivability with saves at each 2 seconds at the will of the player.  The character dies and the game is over. It reminds me of Hired Gun with a totally different angle and mission. In fact a single mission.  But good luck to beat the game I am pretty sure once at last level it will be a heavy tower defense labyrinth to get trough.Each character have different specialities and texts and must cooperate to get alive to the surface.  I do REALLY like it!Addendum:  As I looked back with nostalgia with the time I've spent on this game, I recalled that just at the end of the free week-end I've learned how to level up my characters and also, the multiplayer coop is also great.  ^^			"

												This game has the ability to make time pass very fast. I'm thankful to the pirating community for being able to try this gem of a game before I bought it. I don't have the best computer so it's a gamble to purchase games, and living in a small town without any place to work has made game purchasing hard as of late. So when I was working I made sure to pick this one up to have support the authors. That's something all of you should do, if you pirate a game and enjoy it, then buy it!         Anyway, this game is best described as a tower defence roguelike dungeon crawler. I'm not always in the tower defense mood, but when I am I am glad to have this game to go to. My only grief is the same grief I have with most tower defense games. Once you figure out a working strategy the challenge vanishes. Thankfully there are other game modes to play with, some of which don't allow me to do my winning strategy. (Boy did my heart sink once I figured out the strategy to just breeze through the game though)        I recently got caught up in a nearly 16 hour straight gaming session with this one (which is when I figured out my strategy) and got a little burnt out and probably wont be playing it again for some time. I'm still glad to have it in my library and if any further updates come alone to freshen things up a bit more I'll certainly hop back into it.        Oh, and one more grief is the online play. It's best to play with friends that you know already and to communicate using skype or something. I've never finished to the end on any online play, someone almost always drops out after the second floor, if not the host dropping everyone immediately after game start. I once made it to the eighth floor with someone online. But what started with 4 became 2 after the third floor. If there was a way for the resources to be divided up among the players or something different than the current system it would help a lot. I've had games that quit immediately because someone used up a resource right away or built a module that made the host upset. All and all, unless you have friends like I said before, just don't worry about the multiplayer.           In all if anything I wrote sounds appealing then go for it! Especially if it's on sale. I really need to stop getting inspired to write a review right before I go to bed. I've been nodding off while writing this and forgetting what I just wrote. So sorry if this is a bit jumbled. It was written by a very sleepy man who for some reason, decided now is the time to share with the world that I like this game! Keep up the good work game making team guys who made this!			"

								Some new for a change, by its own, each part of the game is not new to anyone - the tower defense, squad mangement, leveling system, etc. - but altogether bring a completely new experience. I don't now if the game need more updates in the difficulty aspect, but as for now it brings challenges that most other games don't even try.It may be difficult at first, but the strategy that you develop as your heroes die, and the many unlockables this game has (a must for me), makes it an extremely addictive game.

												Horrible, unbalanced, irredeemably broken, counter-intuitive game design that doesn't work. Yes it's ""unique,"" but so is a bicycle with cubes instead of wheels. Does that mean it works as a game? No it does not, contrary to what the♥♥♥♥♥♥eating lowlifes at charlatan blogs like RPS might tell you.I was initially drawn to this game because of its intriguing promise of a tower defense dungeon crawler. ""How the heck would that work?"" I asked myself. DoTE's answer was: ""lol it doesn't, but thanks for the money."" What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is your classic Emperor's New Clothes situation. 90% positive reviews, naturally, because none of the brain surgeons writing reviews for this abomination wants to be the first to ask why the Emperor's strolling around in the nude. The RPS monkey ♥♥♥♥ers gave it a rave review based on ten minutes of cretinous button mashing at a trade show so it can't be bad! If your first instinct is to dismiss this as a cracked design due to its many fatal flaws immediately apparent to even the most casual connoisseur of game design, allow me to say you would be perfectly right in saying so.What's wrong with it, you may ask? Where do I begin? It's a mix of real time and turn based which may strike you as totally counter-intuitive at first. Oh, and you can pause. So... why is there an RTS component again? Presumably the developers didn't have the imagination to create a turn-based TD game and instead forced RTS onto it because of the conventional wisdom that all TD MUST be in real time. Just like all shooters must be in first person, herp derp. But I'm getting away from the point. This isn't necessarily a fatal flaw in the design, even if it is incredibly clumsy. The fatal flaw is introduced in the interaction between the game's janky real time combat and the permadeath system. As you might expect from a game advertising itself as a ""roguelike dungeon crawl"" this game has permadeath, which is fine. The problem is in how easily your characters (in whom you're compelled to sink huge amounts of resources. Did I not talk about that? There's no XP. Of course there isn't! Instead you have to spend the Food resource to level your characters. Because every game has to have that FIDS resource system crammed into its design.) die with ZERO warning. You can look away for a split second to build some towers or some♥♥♥♥♥♥and one of your characters will be dead when you focus on them again. Great game design. They aren't incapacitated or require reviving or anything, they are immediately DEAD when their hp goes down to 0, effectively ending your run. Contrast with the clever character permadeath system from something like Darkest Dungeon.I could go on with other similarly horrid examples, but I'll spare you. Broken, non-functional, non-viable, vomit-inducing game that should've been aborted in the prototype stage, but instead astonishingly made it to release. I keep trying to find some good in it but come up empty handed at each attempt. And finally, the lazy hipster pixel graphics as the icing on this particular♥♥♥♥♥♥cake. Last time I give this studio any money, and I've already given them plenty.			"

Dont worry you managed to launch a escape pod and escape death... for now.Your only option once landed with 2 survivors is to open the door out the unknown... with a minor hope of a ticket somewhere away from this dangerous place.Economy is split between Four things.Food to level and heal your heroes.Science to remove cooldown on abilites or research new modules that will make your journey easier (to make it possible that you might survive without good luck or being veteran to the game)building material (dont recall correct term) That you build modules that increases one of these three or many minor one with offensive defensive or boosts to the room you build them in.And finally we have Dust... Your best friend. Without this materia darkness will consume the entire level. Also the merchants love Dust since it is also the currency in this game. So will you spend some dust to buy a new weapon or armor? Or will you light another room so unknown lurkers cant spawn there to attack you that might occur when you open up yet another door into the unknown? The option is yours, but know this; To many dark rooms will for certain mean a bigger fight once they come... And they will come for either your blood or powercrystal (your dungeonheart where dust is stored).There is currently a bunch of diffrent unique heroes(more being added all the time), you start with a few ones, all being unique. But during your journey you will run into outsiders, good and twisted characters, all ready to join you up to a party of max 4. Keep them alive for 3 levels and your permantly unlock them for your next round... which open up the game depth even more. The levels is randomized, however the number of doors isnt. (currently)This game currently in beta, the devs got a very clear structure of what they want to do and they have frequently updates for the game.  You shouldnt be to worried about this game not being finished or ending up as a mess.Currently the game is fun enough and with more content being added it refreshes the replay value of the game.I highly doubt you gonna regret getting this game. But if your in doubt, do more research or wait until complete.Personally I recommend this game.			"

								Talking about the Alpha early access. For me this game has great potential, is simple to understand but hard to master, is based on fortune, but you have to think and foreseen what will be the consequence of your next action. Find the safety or open that last door? Maybe the reward will be gorgeous. Or maybe will be the death.Can't wait for the next upgrades!			"

								After having finished the Alpha, I can fully review this piece. It is a difficult one to get into, and requires some helping hand from lady luck for your plans to succeed. And you will need a bulletproof plan out there. For comparison I'd throw in Space Hulk. Sure, SH doesn't include upgrades like this, but the cramped room design is familiar and you're always on the defense. All in all, the game is actually really nice to look at and to play. So get your strategy goggles on and give those hostiles harder time than they give you!			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a really kickass RPG/rogue-like Dungeon-Defense game. It's very fun with multiple people but there are a few issues, you see, to unlock a character (even in multiplayer) you have to hold that character in your control for 3 floors after finding them, but only you unlock them. The only other issue I've had is that every time we get to around Floor 10-12 the game auto-crashes or will freeze, or the elevator simply wont trigger, so at this current point it is unwinnable for me or my friends. Maybe we're the only ones with this issue, but i've come to doubt that. Other than the previous listed issues, Dungeon of the Endless, like its' other games, kicks total♥♥♥♥♥ fun gameplay, cool items (and item descriptions) cool characters with great backstories, good OST, and most of all, Endless Fun.

												Pretty fun RPG/RTS/Tower Defense/(???) game that manages to stand out in spite of the ongoing roguelike fad. Nice production values and art direction. It's hard as nails, but you get the hang of it eventually. My only complaint is that the multiplayer is tacked on, and you spend most of the time standing still and talking about who's going to buy the new technology or open the next door. This game did not need multiplayer. Unfortunately, right now it's either that or have hundreds of entitled kids whining about no multiplayer on the forum.			"

I mean, this game managed to mash up so many elements into a very simple, yet vast and enjoyable game.If I would ""add"" something to this game it would be weapon upgrades or crafting, but the game its already good as it is.

												Amazing game. Simple concept, defend yourself and your resources while trying to advance through oncoming waves of enemies. Dungeon of The Endless is a great mix of turn based strategy with tower defense mechanics. It's an oddly addicting game that will have you saying, ""just one more floor"", again and again. This is especially fun if you have played a bit of Endless Legend as the lore carries between the two. Unlocking heroes and new ships is very addicting and well worth the price. Multiplayer is great and probably the highpoint of this gem; getting a great team of heroes is the most amazing feeling. I can highly recommend another title from the masterminds at Amplitude, they have gotten it right yet again.			"

								WHat is there to say about DotE?Its good.! Its a Roguelike, its a Tower Defense, It uses Exploration as a limited resource. Only other game I have seen pulling this of was desktop dungeons, and that was allways a tense fight there.The graphics - Lovely. Its all Pixel graphics, but they still look so Good. I mean, It is Pixels, but then again they actually look like something other than blocks.Gameplay : It takes a little getting used to, but a lot can be found out in a few sessions of trial and error. still think this needs a Tutorial and/or First Time Tutorial floor, but you can only deliver what you have and since not all systems are 100% done and are subject to change, building an extensive tutorial wuld be a bit in vain. But the system at all is simpleyou build stuff, you open a door, you see whats inside - Monsters, Relics, Survivors, Loot - and you gain resources from your built stuffI also love how they got an EXP-less Levelling system. Thats what one of the resources is for. You give them enough food, and they Level up. But the limited building space, the limited Dust to activate rooms to build stuff in them and the fact that you have 3 resources you have to take care of make this game a really hot decision sometimes.Sound - The music is Gorgeous. Need I say more? I love me some good music in gamesOverall - for an early access game it is quite good and delivers a lot of content already. a good bunch of loveable heroes, a hard make-you-thing management system and most of all, tons of Rougelike Try againsy fun, since the game may end up playing the ""Diablo 2 Wheel of Skills"" with you and your building/resource decision(To explain the reference, Diablo 2 was a Clicky RPG with a multitude of classes and different skills. However, most builds that bring you through the game just fall short at the final boss. Means you could breeze through the game with a necromancer summoning skelettons wreaking havoc, but on the final boss they will be killed of way before they reach him. Not to forget that he one hits you as average necromancer. That boss was the ""Is your Skillset viable?"" moment. And no, the only way to respec was to use a trainer/Savegame editor. If you didnt want this, its start the game from scratch )			"

Early Access Review
								Review written as of 0.1.1:This game is definitely in alpha, and, as a warning, only 3 stages of the game will feel VERY short. It only took me a couple hours to experience just about all of the in game ""behind the door"" events, level up all the different heroes, and unlock all the different structures currently available. Ordinarily I would not recommend this title for the average buyer, since there is so little content existing at the present moment. However, as an owner of Amplitude Studio's previous title, ""Endless Space"", I know this developer as a consumer-oriented, professional studio that sets deadlines and pushes themselves to continue creating content for their games well past the ""we could just abandon the game, take the money, and run"" phase. I have lots of confidence that the content will continue coming. You will just have to be patient for crucial game elements like the whole research system, all character abilities, the full character roster, DEAR GOD MORE FLOORS PLZ AMPLITUDE, etc...The graphics and colors of this game are very pleasing to the eye, and shadows look great. FlyByNo is an AMAZING in-house composer, and his work on this game is just as great as his work on Endless Space. I do not know who does the writing at Amplitude but whoever it is, they put such flavor into every tooltip, every item description in all their games that you'll find yourself reading every word that finds its way onto your screen, no matter how dull you may expect the description for an item like ""T-Shirt"" to be. The founder edition comes with 50% coupons for Endless Space and the new Endless Space expansion (since buying the Disharmony expansion was in my plans already, this practically offset the cost difference between a Founder's Edition and Pixel Edition alone) for a total of about $20 in savings. The Founder's Edition itself costs $20 normally ($15 on sale now) so if you were actually thinking about buying Endless Space and it is not on sale, you may as well buy a Founder's Edition of Dungeon of the Endless and apply the discounts to maximize your Steam Wallet.In short, this is a fun and unique game with lots of easily visible potential that it doesn't live up to yet. If you are not confident in this developer's ability to deliver content steadily and stay committed to their titles, you will likely feel ripped off for the amount of content currently available and I'd recommend waiting for an official, non-early release. Otherwise, you'll enjoy this, but slowly, and you will wish there was more content available just because you're so enticed by what already exists.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless, to put it simply, does everything right.At its heart, Dungeon of the Endless is a relatively generic hero-based tower defense game. You defend your core node against spawning armies of increasing difficulty while building modules to defend and support your heroes. If this was all Dungeon of the Endless was, it would really just be another Kongregate tower defense game.However, the mechanic that Amplitude chose to focus their core gameplay on is exploration, and what a glorious implementation it is.  I've always been a fan of games that use exploration as a resource mechanic. I enjoy puzzle games and this one simple mechanic can turn nearly any game into thought-provoking puzzler.The premise of the game is simple. You're on a ship and you crash land. The only thing salvageable from your ship is a power source. You need to protect this power source and drag it through each of the levels until you reach the top and can be rescued.Of course, it's not that simple.Dungeon of the Endless uses a resource system comprised of industry (for building things), science (for learning how to build things), and food (for keeping your dudes alive and leveling up). You gain these resources by opening doors (exploration). There is also a concept of Dust as a resource, which you find in some rooms or from some monsters. By allocating Dust, you can light up different rooms in the level. Lighting up rooms does a few things: powers your devices in the room and prevents monsters from spawning. However, you don't have enough Dust to light every room, so it becomes a puzzle of what rooms to light up and/or occupy to minimize the spawning enemies. When you do find the level's exit and you plan to try to move your power source to it, the fun truly happens. From every dark room, enemies constantly spawn. The person carrying the crystal moves at half speed, so it's up to everyone else to defend that person until they reach the exit and your team can leave the level.Speaking of your team, you start with two dudes. They all have different abilities and different stats. Over the course of the game, you can use food to level up your guys (up to a max of level 15) which helps their stats, gives them new abilities, etc.All of these concepts work completely and are executed flawlessly. There is a sense of constant panic and dread when you're exploring, particularly when you're short on resources or dust. You want to spend resources to improve your team, but want to save some for emergencies. If I have a complaint about the game is that it's a bit too easy. Once you understand the fundamentals of the game and have a good strategy, it pays to just keep repeating that strategy for the entire game. However, the developers very intelligently added a variety of ships that change the rules of the game. This is where the future challenge lies.One of the best titles in recent memory. Well worth the low price.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a beautiful mash up of different genres that is really hard to identify.It is a rogue lite, tower defense, survival, resource management game with a bit of rpg thrown in, let me elaborate more.You begin the game after you choose your starting party of two people, these characters are the survivors of an attack at your ship near a mysterious planet. You choose a pod your heroes escaped in, which dramatically changes the rules of the dungeon, and off you go in your emergency landing, deep inside this strange complex. From there on, your only chance to escape the planet, is to carry your crystal from the damaged pod up to the surface. You have to use elevators to do this, they effectively mark the start and the end of each level. The game consists in exploring every floor searching for the exit, but also for resources, merchants, weapons, other survivors or who knows what your next objective might be. In the meantime, your dust reserve is used to power up the complex while you explore, because dark areas spawn monsters, and monsters have a nasty habit of wanting to break your crystal... so what do you do? You build minor modules to protect the path you carve in the complex, you build major modules to help you attain resources every door you open, you research new or upgraded versions of the modules you can build and onward to adventure. As for your heroes, every character has his set of skills, level up progression, statistics and possible equipment slots, which promotes customization and adaptability. The game has two levels of difficulties, one is doable, the other one is pretty tough.Of course the game has tons of replay value, everything being randomized except items, modules and heroes, every room and branching is randomized so there is no chance you will have the same game twice, even the merchants sell not only different stuff, but even accept a random resource for trade. The multiplayer is great but I suggest grabbing a friend since this a highly strategical game, more than an action one, but I've met my fair share of reasonable people online.If that wasn't enough, we are talking about the Endless lore, the same you find on Endless Space and Endless Legend, which is really cool if you're fan of the work Amplitude is doing, even the resources represent the FIDS system from the game (Food, Industry, Dust, Science).Overall I had a blast with this little title, I wasn't even expecting much but it became one of my favorite indie rogue like titles really fast. Not everyone appreciates it though (like one of my friends) though I still can't understand him, this game has everything one could ever hope for, it's original and cheap too!------------------------------------------EDIT : My nominee for The “Just 5 More Minutes” Award, since I always relax and sink in this more time than I realize.

												A unique combination of roguelite, dungeon-crawler, and tower defense. Definitely worth a look. I love the graphics, and the music even more. If you own Endless Space and/or Endless Legend (Amplitude's other games), then it's worth it to buy the upgraded editions, as there's some unique content available by owning those other games. If you buy the upgraded editions of those games, you'll get added content for buying Dungeon of the Endless! None of it's essential, but some of it's fun.I've played over 50 hours of the game and have unlocked all but 1 character, and only half of the pods (the 'ship' you start in--various pods alter the starting conditions and change the rules throughout the course of the game). There's plenty of content, and the formula works well enough to provide hours of gameplay. For some real fun and chaos, just add friends! You can't pause in multiplayer, and with 4 players, everyone controls their own character, making coordination vital and extremely fun, especially if you can get some voice chat going (which is easy now that steam's voice chat is pretty damn good these days.)*One thing to be aware of: You do not directly control the actions of your characters, nor do you directly engage in combat! You click to open doors, interact with NPCs and objects, and move from room to room. The characters will automatically attack enemies based on certain priorities. You can activate your abilities on command, but that's it. When I bought it, I thought you controlled your characters like in Diablo or League of Legends or Dota, but that isn't the case and I was majorly turned off. But I quickly discovered that the more hands-off control lend itself very well to this game and quickly picked up on it and started having a blast!9.5/10, would recommend. I subtracted .5 only because there are a couple minor annoyances regarding controls: I wish you could assign all your heroes' abilities each their own keybind. As it is, you have to select that hero and then press a key (or click an icon) to activate the ability. It's fine in singleplayer when you can pause it, but in MP when you're controller 2-3 heroes at once, it can be a pain in real-time. "

								Unlike a lot of ""Early Access"" games, v0.1.1 of Dungeon of The Endless feels like a relatively complete game.  It's stable and has a great mix of overall game mechanics that work well to produce a coherent game.  To try to describe this game in conventional terms might just confuse you.  Yes, it has aspects of roguelike games, real time strategy games, role playing games, tower defense games, and board games.  Personally, I think of it as mostly a board game with each ""turn"" divided into a time before you open another door, which will reveal treasure, a merchant, waves of enemies, blueprints, or something else - you never know!  Then it's a mad scramble reminiscent of a real time strategy/tower defensive hybrid to keep everything upright until the next turn.  When deciding who to level up or equip with gear, that's where the RPG aspect enters the picture.This board-game like mechanic can be a good thing because it introduces a lot of interesting choices.  If I assign my hero here, will they be able to make it back to where they need to be if enemies appear there?  Do I spend my industry points on producing more industry points, producing things I need, or do I try to scimp on points now so I have more avaialble to use on the next map?  Do I invest my dust in that great piece of equipment, or is it more important that I power rooms?  These choices are clever in that many of them are just comprimises; there's often not a ""right"" choice, just a good guess at what might work out in the long run.  I like a game that makes me think.  Yet, Endless Dungeon is rarely ever overwhelming, just rich with important choices to make and requiring you pay attention when your heroes are fighting so they don't get slain needlessly.  It's quite remarkable they consider this quite-playable product such an early version.  True, you're limited to just three (four?) random map levels per game (which you can exhaust in an hour), there's not yet skills on the heroes, the tech tree systems isn't in yet, and so on.  Yet, the game is more complete than many $15 titles I've bought.  Amplitude studios seems to know what they're doing, and if they call this version v0.1.x, then it's clear this game should be of staggering, epic proportions if they see their plans through to completion.

												 Dungeon of The Endless definitely will be one of my top 10 favourite game all time. The game is pretty clean and simple but is very challenging, it is really tough and will rekt us upside down. One had to strategize the next move, manage the resources and and secure thyself with defensive structure for what may come. DoTE definitely does a stunningly impressive job with the in game graphic and OST, after spending countless hours of venturing the floor with the pixelated graphic and BGM... it was suprisingly immersive and beautiful. This game had a pretty depth learning requirement and excellent strategy are in order to be able survive and escape from all the floor. I had to sayeth it was not an easy task either. In here I strongly recon new player either go through some guide or play in a multiplayer games with more season player in order to learn how and know a few tips and trick about Dungeon of The Endless before you give up this piece of gems. When I first bought and played this game; I was like ""Oh boy...I land myself another crappy 75% discounted game and needed refund again...."" How wrong was I?!! After giving another trial at some time later in a multiplayer run It was unexpectedly fun !! Intense and so much amazing !! Too bad the player base of this game is really-really low and is much more harder to find player to play in multiplayer, so from time to time I'll just single play Dungeon of The Endless in offline mode and sometime I'll browse in forum to l00k for companion to escape and journey the amazing DoTE together with. This game will take your another 5 minute more than what you had ever expected. Grab your copies today when Dungeon of The Endless is discounted, even is on 50% is totally worth it. Worst case scenario...""Oh boy...I land myself another crappy review game and needed refund again...."" "

								What a wonderful roguelike comboed with tower defense.  Even in Alpha this is as stable and playable as Endless Space was on release.  Amplitude had my trust after Endless Space which is why I risked an Alpha purchase.  Not disappointed.  You start with two heroes.  They have skills, inventory and slots of weapon/armour/tool.  Each room you clear gives you the next wave of resources which you can use to level your heroes, build or research.  You can have your heroes man stations that you build in each room to vary your resource income if you can do without them.  So you have to manage your heroes and incoming enemies.  That's the basics of it.			"

												Pretty addictive. It's a fairly unique combination of genres - I'd call it primarly a resource management/tower defense game with roguelike elements and some RPG mixed in rather than a roguelike with TD elements, but that's just me.+ High replayability - unlockable ships (influences how you start as well as your strategy throughout) unlockable characters, randomized maps, loot and research opportunities makes each playthrough different.+ ""One more turn/game"" appeal - whether I was trying out a recent unlock or simply trying to correct the mistakes I made last game, I found myself wanting more.+ Challenging without being unfair, tactical without being overwhelming - this game can slap you into the dirt, but when you lose it tends to be because of your own actions rather than RNG. And while there are enough mechanics in play to make the game interesting and intense, you won't find yourself lost. You die, you do better. You die, you do better.+ Good sound/music. Not much else to say.- Ugly. If you're used to roguelikes you'll be expecting this, and if you're like me you'll get so immersed that you'll forget it's ugly entirely. But, when hordes of enemies are streaming in and you can only recognize a few distict shapes in the pack, you'll wish it was just a tad better. Still, very minor.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a top-down roguelike dungeon exploration & tower defense game with many unlockable elements set in the Endless game universe.The player uses a squad of up to 4 characters to explore a multi-floor dungeon one room at a time while protecting a power crystal. Like other Endless games, the four resources are Food, Industry, Dust, and Science (FIDS). With each door opened, more FIDS accumulate, but dangerous monsters may spawn. Players eventually discover a dungeon floor exit and carry the crystal to a new dungeon floor, continuing on until the game ends at the 12th floor.Characters may be discovered in-game and unlocked after completing a certain number of floors with that character. Characters have different strengths as might be expected, including attack power, defense, movement speed, and ""wit"", which in this game translates into better module operation bonuses. Certain secret combinations of characters lead to different in-game events.Food, Industry, and Science increase in a predictable fashion with each door opened, but Dust is less predictable and cannot be saved between levels. Dust may sometimes be discovered in new rooms or obtained after defeating monsters.Rooms adjacent to the crystal may be powered (or ""lit"") subject to a limit based on the current amount of Dust. Lit rooms do not spawn monsters. Given enough industry, different ""modules"" may be built in a powered room based on the characteristics of that room--not every room can hold a module, no room can hold more than one ""major module"", and different rooms have different limits for ""minor modules"".Items may be discovered in new rooms and are bought and sold for FIDS at merchants which may be discovered in new rooms.A special Research module may appear in a new room, allowing for Science to be invested to unlock new modules or higher levels of existing modules.Modules may be removed, for example removing an unneeded Research module to make room.Like any great game, Dungeon of the Endless presents the player with many interesting choices, for example:- leave a room dark to spawn more monsters and the chance for more Dust, or light the room to reduce monster spawn and provide room for modules?- invest Industry in FIDS-producing modules (longer-term payoff) or defensive modules (immediate payoff)?- spend Food to recruit a new character, or save Food to see if a better choice is available later?- take the exit as soon as it is found, or open a few more doors to try to gain more Food, Industry, and Science for the next level?- invest Science now, or remove the Science module in favor of a different major module?Tactical elements include: positioning of characters when unlocking a door, character movement between rooms during combat, activation of special abilities, healing (which takes Food), and resetting abilities (which takes Science) in combat. Combat may be paused for easier micro-management, but some players will find it more fun to do without pausing (there's even a Steam Achievement for beating a dungeon without pausing).			"

												The matches in this take at least 3 hours, so be prepared before starting one.This game is really hard to learn how to play, and it punishes you for lacking experience at it.The difficult settings ""too easy"" and ""easy"" just add more into the fact that it is mocking you at your fail attempts.This game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Its hard, but once you get it it starts to get really challenging. Playing with more friends is kinda necessary, since its ♥♥♥♥ing hard to do it all by yourself.DAT SOUNDTRACK SON! Oh man, that elevator song. UN UN UN - UN UN UNUNUNIts roge like, its challenging just right, and its fun. Might take you a while to escape the 'its ♥♥♥♥ing impossible' part to the 'its really fun' part tho.The DLC add little content to the game, so you don't need it, but if you turn to really like this, then it will pay off.If you are reading this review during a sale, stop wasting your time reading and start wasting your time playing.

								Most people that enjoy FTL will enjoy this. In FTL the thrill is getting to the next beacon. Seeing what the game throws at you, and trying your best to handle itIn DoTE? What's behind the next door? If the proposition of sick anticipation for the next sadistic amalgam of chaos that you might find behind that door excites your inner masochist then this is the game for you!Dungeon of the Endless is an immaculate blend of genres---so much so that it feels like something brand new. The consortium of rpg elements, tower defense, procedurally generatred levels, and tower defense are all wrapped superbly in Amplitude's signature UI. Speaking of the UI it is sleek, clean, cripse, and effectively delivers you all the information required seemlessly. While the game is far from complete there is more than enough difficutly and challenge involved. A meaty roster of characters and several difficult floors to plow through. The randomly generated nature offers much replayability, all the while Amplitude contineously injects more content!			"

												I've really enjoyed this game so far.  It's just as other reviewers have described: an offbeat 4x+rogue mashup with good graphics, music and gameplay.For me, the downside is that it's already getting a bit repetitive, which hurts the replayability.  I'd love to see a short game option (fewer levels), or even an option for a single random ""hell"" level.  Something I can play in a fraction of the time it takes to clear the standard 12 levels.

No matter the characters I start with I can never get through the game. I can't even beat level seven on easy, and there's only two difficulties, easy and very easy.But damn is this one of the best games I've ever played, definitely worth playing, definitely worth the price.

												This game is hard, relentless, unforgiving, incredibly fun, addictive and has tons of replayability.  I personally think this game is a hard to learn, hard to master type game.  This game is not for the weak-willed who seek handholding, checkpoints or walks in the park.  Dungeon of the Endless is a tower defence game that draws RPG, rogue-like, dungeon crawling and resource management elements.  You start each game by picking 2 heroes out of a 24 (with all of DLC and unlockable characters) member cast.  Each hero has different stats that help your team in one way or another (Speed, Power, Health, and Wit).  Your objective is to look for the exit of the floor, which leads to the next floor.  Each floor gets progressively harder and harder the further down you go.  To ""win"" or complete the game, you have to complete all 12 floors.  You start each floor in a single room and have up to 4 different directions you can go.  Each room you enter has a chance to spawn dust (used to powers rooms) as well as: other resources, merchants, treasure (that can be worn for bonuses or sold for resources), other heroes to add to your team (for a max of 4 heroes per team) and/or monsters!  For each room you enter, any room you do not have powered by dust has a chance to spawn monsters in it.  You will eventually come to a point where the minority of your rooms will be powered and lots of monsters are spawning.  This is where strategy and micro-managing your heroes comes into play.  You have to find the perfect setup where you can defend all your modules and your crystal, without your heroes dying.  This will require quick thinking, quick calculations and quick action to make sure you can defend all directions without losing modules, heroes or resources.  If you lose (from either monsters taking your crystal down or losing all your heroes), you do not start from where you left off, you will need to start from floor one again with a new team.I’ve read a ton of negative reviews saying this game has way too much RNG to be recommended.  You can definitely be ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG in this game, but 90% of the time you have that bad of RNG, it’s definitely winnable if you just play your heroes and defence right.  The feeling of conquering an insanely hard floor after getting some bad RNG is pure bliss.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging game or a completely new take on tower defence.  You will lose NUMEROUS times before you finally win (on Easy at least), but that first victory is one to remember.  If you’re looking to start playing this game, I’d highly recommend checking out the let’s play link below.  This video really helped me understand the basics when I was first starting out.

								This game just proves that you don't need a powerful graphic engine to make a potentially great game. The interface is intuitive and the style is rich enough to give you an artgasm. The game itself has a fairly easy objective - get your dust-filled crystal thing to an exit. But don't be fooled by the simplicity, the game can be punishing. When you take the crystal out of its notch, be prepared to face continous waves of enemies. It's difficult in a sense that it'll force you to utilize anything at your disposal in favor of just making a run for it. It's a game that will test your attention as well as your ability to make tough strategic choices.If you're sick and tired of shooters, consider picking up this game. It's colorful, easy to pick up and incredibly easy on the eyes.			"

												As a recent release, I  have found this to be my favourite game so far this month, the gameplay is unique, and a good combination of genres.The music is wonderful, the characters are different and offer a variety of combinations of skills. The only negative thing I'd have to say about this game is the multiplayer, at times can be very unstable. If this is fixed in any coming updates I'd have no complaints about this game. The difficulty is just right, and rewarding and I can't wait to see if we get even more brutal difficulties to truly test our sanity and endurance. Some would say the dust generation is unbalanced, but I find it just right, of having to choose between fully exploring or just blizting it before i lose any (more) characters. To any of my friends who even reads this, you totally gotta get it for such a cheap game.			"

												Loving this game so far. I have both Endless Space and Endless Legend, and I think they both show promise, but ultimately aren't quite 'there' yet. But with this game, they've taken the world, the lore, and the feel, as well as some of the concepts (resources) and applied them in a VERY different package. This is part RPG, part tower defence, all fun!Graphics style works, and the game has a feel that is reminiscent of the wonderful iPad game - Sword & Sworcery. Pixel graphics that really work, a wonderful, atmospheric soundtrack. Really solid.And the game play is wonderful (albeit hard - i'm playing on the easiest setting and still finding it a real challenge to get a decent strategy). You'll need to be a little patient, but use those defences and you'll get there. A wonderful example of how a simple concept, well executed, can be delightfully engaging. Well done dev team, well done!			"

												This game has a neat little combination of features that is kind of a mix of dungeon crawler and tower defense. It's fun to pick up and play for a bit or to try and get all the way through a run. The art is pixel, and when you see the more functional and attractive art of their other two games on offer here on Steam it makes you wonder why they chose to go with such a terrible look. I can live with that, I've always been a proponent of fun gameplay over shiny graphics.Unfortunately the multiplayer seems to be hampered by bugs. When a player quits out I am normally left locked out of the game. The game just doesn't hold enough appeal for me to attempt ot grind away in single player. For this reason alone I can't recomend the game. I have finished only about half of my attempts at multiplayer, and that's probably only becaused I died so early on it didn't have a chance to glitch out on me.			"

												Very enjoyable roguelike with tower defense elements. Enough tower/hero types to keep you engaged for more than one playthrough. More difficulty options would be great, as ""Too Easy"" is exactly what is implied, while ""Easy"" can be pretty brutal at times. The option for 4 player coop is great, although the coop mode requires a bit of polish before I would recommend it. Coop has no ability to save your game, and with a full playthrough requiring a few hours of gameplay, you better make sure you set aside some time. I recommend playing at least a game or two on singleplayer, as this will allow you to unlock some characters before trying multiplayer. Also, the game had a few connectivity problems where players lost connection with each other about an hour in (In our case, two players maintained connection, while two players lost connection, while still able to view each other's movement. Some sort of host desynch...)Overall, worth the $13.			"

												Just picked this up on the Holiday Sale. I've been a big fan of Amplitudes games for awhile now, having spent a whole bunch of time with Endless Space and not enough time with Endless Legend. Their games are clean, polished, and they've done a wonderful job of world building with the whole Endless thing.Only one session down with DotE so far and I know I'm going to be hooked. I'm a sucker for tower defence games but the way in which they put together this game has brought the genre to a new level. Great design, both gameplay and visually, make this stand out for me. I look forward to spending many, many hours with this title.			"

												Outstanding game design, unique, immersive, challenging, the very definition of a gem.Do yourself a favor, don't spoil yourself any further and dive into it.UPDATE: I found a couple of bad things to say about the game, figured I'd share.- A bug preventing you to equip items sometimes, save and exit, reload, fixed.- The different game modes you unlock after beating the game are a bit lacking, the general idea is to remove some features and give it a different name. This hurts the game replayability quite a bit (compared to what I expected) but it's still worth the money.			"

												The title is wrong, as these dungeons are not endless. Unless play it in endless mode... Yeah.Well, it's a roguelike rpg dungeon crawler with tower-defense elements. You crash into some shiттy place and you got this cristal, right? Well, you need to carry that cristal all the way to the elevator, which you have to find in a first place, as you have no way of knowing what will expect you in the next door. Maybe it's loot room, maybe it's full of enemies, maybe there is another character inside that you can recruit for your group, maybe I'll go and fцск myself... You just don't know. And thats the fun part of this game. Get your group, explore the dungeon and try to get to the end. I suggest to reinforce your path to the elevator with turrets of all sorts, as things will get really bad really fast once you remove the cristal from the previous spot. This game has a good price-replayability ratio and it's a wise purchase, if you are a fan of roguelike games or tower defense ones. Fun to play it in coop with your friends too. I give it 8 of 10 and now I am going to cry myself to sleep. Have a nice day, anonymous reader.			"

												Before buying this game, keep in mind that, unlike what you might think from the description, this is not a very complex rogue-like. While there are elements of tower defense, resource management, and levelled characters, there is little learning curve, meaningful decisions, or stat mongering in the game.In short, it's much closer to a mobile game for PC than it is to NetHack. Which is absolutely fine, just something to keep in mind before purchasing.POSITIVES:- Immediately accessible from the first level- Meaningful replayability via different starting conditions and Endless Mode- Enjoyable world characterization - Crisp assembly- FunSOMEWHAT NEGATIVES:- Fairly easy. I beat the hardest starting difficulty in three tries, and each scenario in one or two- RPG elements are a little dull- Individual levels often end anti-climatically- Exploration lacks variety- No voice actingBOTTOME LINE:This is a great little game that's perfect for killing idle hours. If the description intrigues you, it delivers. (But just don't expect a game of great depth.) A sequal would be fantastic.---PLEASE NOTE BEFORE PLAYING:This game comes with a free DLC that adds four Team Fortress characters to the game. This is pretty fun when you're used to the game, but it ruins the atmosphere to run across a Heavy or Pyro during your first couple playthroughs. I'd reccommend unchecking the DLC box on the game's page in your library before launching, and turning it on after a couple hours to see if you like it.			"

												This is an amazing game.I've put over a hundred hours in so far, and there's no end in sight. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME HIGHLY ENOUGH!!! It's still being supported and actively expanded by the developer, which is always nice. The latest expansion pack with the Rescue Team is still a mystery to me. I haven't explored all the content, or discovered the storyline reasons for each character's presence. But I expect good, high quality content, which is what I've received with this game so far.My only issue with this game is that it's STILL buggy as hell. It WILL regularly crash on you and/or devour your saves and leave you with only a fading memory of those 11 floors you and your buddy put in on Easy mode, escaping death by a fingernail's breadth. Then *POOF* the game takes a crap on you. This WILL happen. I personally think the game is worth putting up with this stuff, but I can see why it would put some people off. All this being said, this game has many hours of fun dungeon delving for you to enjoy. The randomization is sometimes cruel, but overall the game is reasonably well balanced. Some characters are quantitatively better than others, pure and simple. But there's enough variation in the character skills to make trying each one out something you'll want to try. Especially with the expansion content, there's significantly altered mechanics.Finally, PLEASE play this game in multiplayer a couple times. It's a fantastic experience that you won't forget. You and up to 3 friends will be pitted against the dungeon together, which is what friends are all about. When you do this, I recommend that you learn how to manually back up your own saves. It's just too painful to lose a game to a corrupt save, or a de-sync glitch, or any number of other things. Just don't use it to cheat, please.This game is one of my top five favorite plays right now. I recommend you try it too!			"

								""Dungeon of the Endless is a pretty interesting game, certainly one I look forward to playing more of. It is in Alpha as I write this and must say I am impressed not only with the design but the over all polish for an alpha. A game that introduces a dungeon crawl-esque gameplay tied into a tower defense is certainly an intriguing combination and as you begin to play you realise that yes, they certainly can go together in a rather intense strategic fashion. Looking forward to more features and I tip my hat to the developers for including the community as they do so often, and have proven so with Endless Space.""			"

												Fun, simple, but very hard dungeon exploration/survival/tower defense game. You have maxium of 4 heroes that explore dungeon level by level, trying to find elevator to the next level. Dungeon is built out of rooms, and uou open up doors which represent turns. Each turn you gain resources that you use to build modules and towers, research new things, level up and heal heroes. While exploring, you encounter hordes of monsters spawning out of darkness, which will try to kill you and your core, which you need to protect to get out of the dungeon.Like all Endless games, this game as well is meant to be replayed again and again, with different settings, like characters or core-mechanics that you unlock by playing the game.For a casual scrub like me, the game is definitely too hard on easy difficulty, but challenging enough on ""Too Easy"" difficulty.Even though I haven't been able to beat the game on easy difficulty, I recommend it. It looks good, it sounds good, and it's fun to play. There is also multiplayer which is big bonus for a co-op fan like me!			"

												It's time to toss in my two cents.At first I was like - Dungeon of the Endless gets me some free stuff for other games I own from Amplitude Studios, and I get to support them. Cool.Then I played it and lost a lot. I suck at Rogue-like games. So I put it away.A few months pass, and a Steam friend of mine invites me to play with him via MP (he's in France). 5 hours later, and I see the allure, but I still suck in SP. SO, DotE gets shelved again. A few more months pass and I need to write a Friday eXcurision for eXplorminate and here is the product (http://explorminate.net/2015/09/11/friday-excursion-dungeon-of-the-endless/). That results in me playing the iPAD version, and I finally learn how to play the game.So, how is the game? FUN. But it's hard, and brutal, but if you plan ahead and prepare, you can do fine on the Very Easy level, which is actually normal to hard. Easy is anything but, and don't get me started on the hard mode (you need a special pod for that). On to the review!!!You start the game as a survivor of a crashed escape pod on Auriga where the Endless were conducting experiemnts on live subjects in a crazy torture lab/arena. THe planet is like Mortal Kombat world and this is where the combatants are made.  Anyways, as you try to escape the labs to the surface, you face monsters and random events every time you open a door...  Why do you open doors? to search for the escape elevator. Each time you open the door, you get resources that you can use to upgrade your heroes, power and buildup your rooms, and investigate tech to further your modules.You repeat the above for 12 floors until you find the exit, and all the while, you'll be attacked by hordes of monsters.Let me repeat this point - the game is BRUTAL in SP, and equally BRUTAL in MP, but at least there, you get to lose together with your friends.I recommend this title, because it fantastic, and Amplitude Studios has just released a 3rd, that's right, count it.  1.. 2... 3... free dlc adding content.Have fun dying, I know I did.

Early Access Review
								Fantastic art direction - mediocre gameplay.A game that (currently) isn't the sum of its parts. All the elements are there, apart from something compelling to do when you play it. The concept is original enough, but the execution is in turns tedious, repetitive and unfair. Playing simply involves repeating the same actions, stage after stage, and hoping the RNG doesn't screw you too badly.Unlike true Rogue-likes such as FTL and Binding of Isaac, this is essentially a very pretty, but basic, tower defence game with occasional difficulty spikes, or loot drops, as its 'random' element. None of these are compelling like Spelunky's altars or shopkeepers, or FTL's story choices, but simple occasional resource gifts or monster waves.The problem here is that it misjudges what makes tower defence fun - accurately managing those resources. By tying those into the RNG (level layout strongly dictates your defences and resource gathering) your strategy is always a slave to the RNG, and can often be ruined simply by an obnoxious layout simply starving you of resources, or forcing you to defend more points than is possible.This makes the game a case of going through the motions, repeating an optimal strategy with little breathing room for experimentation, until you luck into a good run or are forced into an unfair loss. All 10 stages play exactly the same, but just get larger and contain more damaging enemies. Once you've finished stage 1, you've essentially seen the entire game.A shame, as every other element is dripping with style and polish, and the mixture of TD, dungeon crawling and Rouge-like works as a proof of concept, but unfortunately all you get here is simply a marriage of extremely shallow reprentations of all three genres.6/10			"

								With out a doubt one of the best games that I purchased this year.  It's a rogue-like and it can be hard and unforgiving at time but that makes it all the more sadistically fun.  The RPG elements including character leveling, equipment, and individual abilities unique to each hero, mesh well and ensures multiple playthroughs which can be very unique depending on which heros the player is using.  As your heros open doors of the dungeon they accumulate resouces which are used to build offencive and defensive turrets in rooms,  power rooms and constructed turrets or generators in rooms,  to level characters and to purchase turret and character upgrades and equipment.   The combination of managing all these elements might first sound complex  but the game does a great job at intragating all the features togather well in a way that makes sense and also makes you think tactically the further you get in the dungeon.    Though the game is stll in development  it  has been updated regularly in the six or so months that I have owned it and alot of new content has been added.  At my last playthrough there were eight levels to the dungeon implemented and over ten heros (though I have only unlocked 5 or so) with more being planned as the game is updated and gets closer to offical release.

								The core ideas behind Dungeon of the Endless are on the right track and the promise of content to come should turn this into a masterpiece.The curent look and feel of this alpha indicate a high level of care in the game's development - this is a surprisngly polished release and is very much playable (and re-playable). What I really liked:- The graphics are great (and I'm not a pixel graphics fanboy) - The dungeon generation has been unique and fairly unpredictable each time I re-rolled.- The heroes are well individualized and you need to adapt your strategy to accomodate their strenghts and weaknesses.- The gameplay can be challenging and unforgiving however it doesn't feel frustrating.- I haven't come accross any obvious 'spam this item to win' holes.- The 'chance' factor works really well with what the game tries to achieve and it forces you to re-think your strategy.- There's no redundant micromanagement of heroes.- No redundant micropositioning of turrets either.- Mobs aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.- No game-crippling bugs that I have encountered (and for an alpha this fresh, that's really surprising)- Game has potential to become virtually endless in terms of replayability (assuming things go well dev wise).What I didn't really like:- Some turrets aren't really useful enough, or rather can be happily ignored throughout the entire game without you missing their utility. I'm referring specifically to the turrets that grant hero bonuses to armor, strength, or heal the hero.- When the world becomes larger it can get quite tedious to manage heroes on oposite sides of the map. Perhaps a minimap might be useful.- Switching between heroes can get a bit wonky and it's not always terribly obvious which one you're controling.- The 'you found the door, there it is!!!!!' pointers are insanely annoying. The obvious:- Currently not a whole lot of content is available - early alpha.- Game won't be for everyone and you might hate it.All in all, I really like this game and hope it manages to accomplish what it set out to do without needing to get dumbed down or glittered up.

								If I could think of a game like this, I would say FTL...Of the little time i've played, its pretty fun right now.Just, really, really random so its hard to expect anything.What you do is search a dungeon for the exit, protect your crystal, and bring it to the exit.The thing is, when you explore a room, a random event may occur, like npcs, shops, or enemy encounters.In order to protect ya crystal, you gotta power rooms up with the crystal's energy (Which can some get gained by fighting. In rooms you farm resources, set up defenses, etc.But the ""Time"" based method in generating things and researching is by the doors you open.So once you open all of the doors, your somewhat dead and have to wait for waves of enemies to spawn.Also when your carrying your crystal, the rooms you have powered turn off slowly.But, if any doubt, try FTL. The game play is pretty similar.Overall, Great game, that needs more developement but is great at this state for tactical-ish turn based stuffz			"

Early Access Review
								With out a doubt one of the best games that I purchased this year.  It's a rogue-like and it can be hard and unforgiving at time but that makes it all the more sadistically fun.  The RPG elements including character leveling, equipment, and individual abilities unique to each hero, mesh well and ensures multiple playthroughs which can be very unique depending on which heros the player is using.  As your heros open doors of the dungeon they accumulate resouces which are used to build offencive and defensive turrets in rooms,  power rooms and constructed turrets or generators in rooms,  to level characters and to purchase turret and character upgrades and equipment.   The combination of managing all these elements might first sound complex  but the game does a great job at intragating all the features togather well in a way that makes sense and also makes you think tactically the further you get in the dungeon.    Though the game is stll in development  it  has been updated regularly in the six or so months that I have owned it and alot of new content has been added.  At my last playthrough there were eight levels to the dungeon implemented and over ten heros (though I have only unlocked 5 or so) with more being planned as the game is updated and gets closer to offical release.

								This game brings back so many great memories of playing ""the Dig"" and other old school pixel art games but really holds its own against any modern game. I couldn't stop playing and can't wait for more updates. If you like sci-fi and rpg with an in-depth strategy element holding it all together, I cant recommend another game more highly. Hits all the right notes.]			"

								The core ideas behind Dungeon of the Endless are on the right track and the promise of content to come should turn this into a masterpiece.The curent look and feel of this alpha indicate a high level of care in the game's development - this is a surprisngly polished release and is very much playable (and re-playable). What I really liked:- The graphics are great (and I'm not a pixel graphics fanboy) - The dungeon generation has been unique and fairly unpredictable each time I re-rolled.- The heroes are well individualized and you need to adapt your strategy to accomodate their strenghts and weaknesses.- The gameplay can be challenging and unforgiving however it doesn't feel frustrating.- I haven't come accross any obvious 'spam this item to win' holes.- The 'chance' factor works really well with what the game tries to achieve and it forces you to re-think your strategy.- There's no redundant micromanagement of heroes.- No redundant micropositioning of turrets either.- Mobs aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.- No game-crippling bugs that I have encountered (and for an alpha this fresh, that's really surprising)- Game has potential to become virtually endless in terms of replayability (assuming things go well dev wise).What I didn't really like:- Some turrets aren't really useful enough, or rather can be happily ignored throughout the entire game without you missing their utility. I'm referring specifically to the turrets that grant hero bonuses to armor, strength, or heal the hero.- When the world becomes larger it can get quite tedious to manage heroes on oposite sides of the map. Perhaps a minimap might be useful.- Switching between heroes can get a bit wonky and it's not always terribly obvious which one you're controling.- The 'you found the door, there it is!!!!!' pointers are insanely annoying. The obvious:- Currently not a whole lot of content is available - early alpha.- Game won't be for everyone and you might hate it.All in all, I really like this game and hope it manages to accomplish what it set out to do without needing to get dumbed down or glittered up.

												Amazing concept! The mix of RPG, strategy and Tower defense gameplay is very refreshing and (very, very) hard. Replayability is high even though a run can last up to 4 or 5 hours (I got to the middle of the game in about 90´minutes. On easy..) which is hard to achieve in the first place.

												I never predicted the fact that Roguelike and Tower Defense genres could go so well together. DotE is extremely addictive and fun for fans of those genres, it takes some of the best elements of both along with a really visually appealing take on retro pixel art. The only glaring flaws are the inability to save your game during multiplayer, and numerous current bugs involving loading and desynch in multiplayer. If they fix these issues then it'd be a contender for my personal game of the year.			"

												An endless journey from the depths of un-knowing cluster♥♥♥♥, to the peaks of 500-industry-a-floor victory. Dungeon of the Endless may fulfill a multitude of gaming genres, but in my opinion, it satisfies most in the learning curve, and the utter feeling of good, earned, whole-hearted progress. Your first time through will see you lose a few runs, then manage to get to level 11, then finally complete the game on Too Easy, patting yourself on the back thoroughly, having unlocked a few achievements. Are you finished? Alas, you are not. You look at your character list;""♥♥♥♥in L m8 so many damn characters tah ♥♥♥♥in jack around wit""And then you notice how badass Hakenshi looks, and then you realize how broken Lady Jolari is, and you see all of the ships and achievements you can unlock, and you're like;""Hot diggity doggy I'mma get me some achievements""So you end up spending a full day playing multiplayer, leaving your friends behind on floors for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, until finally, at last, you finish a run on the Medbay, because no one knows how to manage food resources. I came here for the pixel art and the soundtrack, both of which are absolutely marvelous. The gameplay in singleplayer far exceeds the multiplayer; the amount of control and strategy you'll slowly learn to control is incredibly rewarding; your first playthrough will have floor clears of around 15 minutes each, but by the time you get going, you can finish them in under 2 minutes (I've managed to get 59 seconds in a multiplayer Floor 3). 10/10 Graphics10/10 Audio10/10 Expectations10/10 Singleplayer8/10 Multiplayer (poorly optimized for shared resources, but not a huge issue)baller amount of characters yo and the DLC is ripe for pickin, though, Crystal Edition is a little pricey for what you get.

												When I first tried to play this game, I didn't like it. It seemed too complicated and I didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing. I let it sit for a while and then came back to it, and ended up loving it. Once you get the hang of the controls and a feel for how things work, it's a super fun and addicting game. The variety of characters to choose from and unlock and the range of ships you can play through all create different challenges that give it a lot of replayability. The characters are cool, the environment is cool, the music is good, the ambient sounds are creepy (but good). A solid game, would definitely recommend.			"

								This game, while having it's developers known for making the fair, yet chellenging, Endless Space, this game is kind of like this genre's version of that, just with less pre-game choices, or choices in general. It's like a very small 4X game. The mystery of what's behind the door isn't too good currently, with only a few things, Dust, Equipment, merchant, or a new companion. The managment levels in this game are incrediduosly high, so be careful, and choose your DOOR!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing.When I first got it, I hopped straight into a game with my friend (who also just bought it) and a random. I struggled to understand the game at first, but after 10 minutes I was hooked. I soon after played through quite a few times with my friend, causing the death of many heroes, and countless failures. But after my first successful run on ""Too easy"" I was extremely  proud. Two hours of epic battles, narrow escapes, and many lost heroes (let the tears flow) lead to a well earned victory. Several months later, I picked it up again solo. It's a different game solo. Although I feel the gameplay is much better solo, it's hard to learn from your mistakes. This game requires a lot of strategy, and I made the same poor choices over and over again. However, once I was finally able to learn from them and make my way through my first ""easy"" clear, it all paid off.This game is increadibly inspiring. The art style, along with the music, setting, and the ""all is lost feeling"" really get you into it. I find myself picking the heros that have cool stories, and look awesome over the heroes which I probably should pick to support my team. I love the lore connections and dialogs made for the characters. Everything in this game is unique, from the enimies to the merchant, to the rooms, and the maps. Sometimes I'll spend a little extra time sitting in the main menu, because I love the song that plays.Overall, I would say this is a game worth buying. It's a fantastic single player game, and pretty fun co-op aswell. It is, however, a little more expensive, but I feel like it's definately worth it. It's like buying a piece of art, that's also a great game. Looking forward to seeing more titles or DLC in the future.-Pooks			"

												The more I play DotE the more I think it's one of the best games I've ever played. Its simple, but nuanced to a degree not many other games can replicate. Once you start to understand the basic mechanics of the game, you start to see how many different ways there are to go about solving problems. It scratches the itch of both micro and macromanagement and  has been able to hook me longer than any game in a long while.It is a perfect game to just pick up and play for a few minutes or a few hours. Being able to stop and save in between any room is a great feature.If I had any suggestions they would be minor. I would love to see a module count number on the side of the screen somewhere.			"

												Take FTL style micro and put it into a rogue-lite (or rogue-like or whatever you want to call it,) game with tower defense elements and you get Dungeon of the Endless. Pick two heroes and a game modifier (the type of pod you crash into the dungeon in) and you can recruit an additional two heroes for a maximum of four (if your original two survive) characters with special powers that can level up and equip with items. You get resources by building generators for Industry, Science, and Food and protect them with a host of 'modules' you research throughout a dungeon. (and personal interactions in single player depending if you have two specific characters.) I bought the game on sale and the multiplayer was broken for about 3 weeks until they released a new update but now it seems to be working well for most people. So I guess keep in mind the game studio developing this game is busy with all the other games they are working on at the same time, multiplayer tends to still have an occasional bug. The multiplayer is fun but you need good communication at the end to succeed. Also if you happen to play the game please know this game seems to be taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of FTL by stepping up their naming of difficulties - there are two; ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy."" don't be ashamed at ALL to play on too easy, especially if you're on multiplayer with new people.

								Fantastic rogue-like strategy game, even in this early stage. As a few others have pointed out, this is a similar feeling game to Faster Than Light, and even seems to share a mechanic or two. I loved FTL (and still haven't beat it, lol) and I love this too. The game is hard, particularly in the beginning, but as you play you'll figure out effective strategies. The atmosphere (graphics and music) draws you in, it really feels like a dangerous underworld.

Early Access Review
								(As of 0.1.1)It’s tough, and probably needs a little rebalancing as to where things spawn and how much, but being it's in alpha I'm extremely impressed. I made it through on my 5th or 6th try, at least as far as the early access would allow (level 4 I think?). I can tell I'm going to love this game though. The two negative things I have to say about it are that occasionally it'll seem a bit unfair and loot will only rarely spawn that you can use if you don’t have a diverse team (something you can't choose). Once I started a new game died after I opened the third door. There was nothing that I could have done to prevent this and was a clear case of the game killing me instead of me dying. Many times, starting out, you'll find that any gear you stumble across is only good to be sold since neither of your two people can use a pistol, for example  (despite one of them being able to use machine guns...?). Whether the latter issue is problem with the loot drops or the gear system is subjective I suppose.All that being said though, I love this game so far. I love the genre bending mechanics and the not-quite-shadowrun and not-quite-fallout world. I love the art and sound. I love the droplets of story you get with each random party and each piece of gear you stumble across. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												This game is seriously well made, The aesthetic is well done and consistently good. Whether playing alone or with friends, you'll be faced with lots of different tactical choices. On top of that, each starting ship drastically changes certain game conditions adding a whole new layer of replayability.Conceptually  it's a very active tower defense with long brutal levels. Losing turrets is scary, losing a character HURTS. I like to think I'm pretty tactically competant, so when I say this game is hard, believe me.If you want a strategy/roguelike/tower defense that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ pick it up.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless has brought me back to my gaming roots from the early 90s, yet pulled me through a world of fresh new elements I haven't quite expreience fully.First, you crash land on a planet, and are plunged deep into the dungeon. You find yourself in a room with one other and a crystal. As you manage your way through the first floor you encounter monsters of various traits, merchants with certain goods, and science machines to advance yourself. Leveling up is achieved through the gaining of the food resource, and you can manufacture food, and 2 others. Once your reach the exit, you must bring your crystal with you and be challenged by al the monsters of the floor.I find after a few play throughs that DotE is a perfect game. Nothing more needs to be added to this little masterpiece, and nothing needs to be taken away. Well balanced, well designed, and a tough play, like games used to be!I challenge anyone new to this game to attempt to take this game on on easy mode.  Be prepared a force feeding of humility!!!

								Here's my elevator pitch for Dungeon of Endless:""It's a rogue-like, tower defense game with Left 4 Dead finales thrown in.""And it truly is an amagame of these things. It's like an rogue-like RPG in that you're exploring a randomly-generated dungeon and dealing with the enemies and other things you encounter there.The tower-defense element pulls heavily from real-time strategy and role-playing elements. There's a pretty meaty three-resource system that you engage. You build machines to generate more of the resources then use those resources to build all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons or to level up your heroes (each with their own unqiue attributes, powers and weapons to equip). Every time you open a door in the dungeon your machines produce the goods. There's also a chance of enemy waves spawning -- that's where the tower defense comes in. You need to build defenses to prevent them from running roughshod over your stuff (and eventually destroying your precious energy crystal). Smart, strategic exploration plays a big role here, creating choke points and making sure that enemies don't swarm you all at once is key to survival.Once you find the exit to the dungeon floor there's a final event where you must manually carry your power crystal from the start of the dungeon to the exit -- all the while fending off enemy's. That's where the Left 4 Dead allusion comes into play. These final runs can go horribly if you haven't powered and defended the path. Since I've been playing there's been constant adjustment to the economy and difficulty of the game -- this is the kind of fine tuning you want from a game that's in Alpha. But throughout I've had fun playing the game. Even when the tuning made the game insanely hard. Even when the game is broken Dungeon of Endless is fun.			"

The levels are never the same , so you dont know if your find the door in the next room or 15 doors later.Its tower defense, and a rts at the same time. you open a room, put power to it, build a node, the make a guy work on it for more resources. then u fill the room up with towers of different sorts. sending the other guys to open the next room to fight the monsters, then retreat to your friend at the node to stand off all the monsters that come from the dark rooms you didnt power.you can only unlock a hero if you meet them, recruit them and keep them alive for 3 floors, or complete the dungeon, making the game worth going back to, to unlock them all.you never get angry when you get killed you just start again.

												Some roguelikes like FTL are engrossing and addicting, others like Risk of Rain feel like a mouse wheel with no purpose.  Dungeon of the Endless is the best roguelike style game I've ever played.  It combines many of the emotional elements I love from other games, like Diablo 1 and Fallout with tower defense mechanics.  There are lots of details and a sense of progression that make me feel like I'm acheiving something, so when I die--and I die often-- I want to play again instead of find something more interesting to do.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Great game, devoted devs, buy now if you want to shape the game and experience the development.As of 0.6.1 i am enjoying this game thoroughly. There are enough characters and since adding 8 levels an indepth clear is currently around 3 hours of play. Though i have read aot of complaints and they fall into two categories too hard or no diversity. In respect to difficulty there are currently two options, easy and too easy. As their name suggests  neither option is very difficult. However if you play this game and do not consider that is a combinations of many game types and aproach it as one you will lose fairly quickly. Also, aproaching each level with no forethought or strategy will cause a loss aswell. It is of course a strategy game so those who lack it will not suceed. Furthermore, the learning curve is fairly easy and once you get the hang of it is a blast.In respect to a lack of diversity you have to remember this game is still in alpha. if you are buying a early access game looking for a full game experience then you will be dissapointed. The devs are pushing out consistent updates, much faster than alot of the other early access games on steam. They fix bugs very quickly and if a patch is game breaking they pull it so you can still play while they work on it. By buying the game now you can shape development by voting on their website.The game itself is quite simple. There are currently 3 resources industry, science and food. Industry is for building modules and major modules help produce those three resources. Minor modules are turrets support turrets and defensive turrets. Science allows you to resource upgrades for your modules and new modules themselves. food allows you to recruit new heroes after your starting heroes, level up your heores(current max lvl 8 due to 8 Floors) and heal them during fights.You use these resources to build a defense network so that when the exit of the lvl is found you can safely bring your crystal(the object that allows you to power rooms so you can build in them) to the next lvl. Each level gets increasingly difficult with new enemies and more rooms.Heroes: Heroes come in all shapes in sizes and currently there are four stats, and five weapons types(currently 0.6.1). Stats are health,speed,damage and wit. Weapon types are sword, spear, pistol, machine gun, unarmed. health is how much life you start with and how much life you get every time you level up. Speed is movement speed. Wit is comparable to an intelligence stat but is mostly used for heroes you can operate major modules(Operating is to give a bonus to their production rate or bonus it gives) by increasing the operator bonus. Damage is the amount of damage you do. All of these stats scale when you level the heroe and different heroes are more proficient in different stats.There is no heroe that is useless all of them serve a specific purpose and you can win by using any combination of them.Also, there are armors and support items, most with comical names or premises. Finally a great amount of thought has gone into this game from the item descriptions and the heroe backgrounds to the strategies that are available and to the details in each room. This ia a great product and i am highly anticipating the finished version. "

								This is a Roguelike focused on exploration, and incorporating some resource management into the mix. There is a lot more strategy in this game that your average roguelike. I find it to be enjoyable now (in the early access version), and there are many nice features coming soon. One of the things that got me interested in this was that it is based on the Endless Space universe, which I loved. If you are looking for a sci-fi roguelike made by a Dev that cares about, and listens to the fans, then this may be for you.			"

												This could be the single funnest game I've ever played. Highly recommended. I haven't been so excited to play a game in a long time.After playing it a lot, I did eventually get slightly bored of it. In particular the Drill mode kind of sucked the fun out of the game for me. Playing an ""endless"" mode is not as fun as it sounds at all, it gets EXTREMELY repetitive. Other than that, there are a couple annoying bugs. One in particular having to do with the achievements was annoying, where it gave me achievements and unlocked modes I hadn't actually earned. This leaves me wanting to either reset my achievement or at least try to really obtain the objective by myself, but overall it has soured the experience a little. I'm stuck not wanting to play the new mode since I haven't earned it, but then I can't work towards officially earning it either since I already have it.			"

								Dungeon of the Endless.... (Personal valuation 8/10)I must say this game may be an Alpha Version still - but it plays itself like a Full game.Random generated Maps and diffrent Characters each time make this game a great game to play when you are bored.But its not an easy one.The goal in this game is to bring your Energy-Crystal to the escape point, which will make you reach the next level - and thereby map of the game.Sounds easy? Wrong. The rooms you walk trough with your two start characters contain treasures, supplies or evil monsters which try to destroy your Crystal.Your Crystal can power rooms so no enemies spawn inside and so you can build defenses or generators. Every few rooms, some enemies spawn in dark rooms to attack your crystal.Will you find the exit and carry the crystal there, or will your enemies destroy you and your crystal?			"

								After crashing on an unknown planet, Nurse Deena Ratchet and genetically engineered warrior Hikensha began working their way through the ship to hope for an escape. Along the way they recruited a young burglar named Golgy Phurtiver who, incidentally, thinks she's a spider of some sort. Things were going relatively well - Nurse Ratchet discovered a woman in stasis, who was revealed to be a bounty hunter named Sara Numas. They did not know that they were effectively recruiting Hikensha's replacement, however, who died tried to defend another survivor from the alien natives. The party marched upwards, exploring for every resource they could. Another survivor was revived from stasis, but the mercenary (who dubbed himself ""Butcher"") was eviscerated by what can only presumed to be giant mutant slugs when making casual conversation with a merchant. The three survivors, Deena, Golgy and Sara saved the merchant from the rampaging aliens, and quickly cleaned him out of his wares in exchange for the Dust they were using to power their various defenses, just before they moved on up to a new level of what was beginning to feel like a dungeon. For real though, Dungeon of the Endless does a lot of things right for a... roguelike, resource management 4X, RPG, platypus of a game. And as they're apparently working on multiplayer, I could see this becoming a Thing.			"

												This game is the absolute perfect mix of Tower Defense, Strategy, and RPG, all mixed in with a bit of Beautiful Pixelated Graphics. The Gameplay is Smooth and Entertaining, Resource Management between you and your team is challenging, and Behind every door is the possibility of Life or Death.  This game could easily be played for hours with you and your 3 friends all shuffling around the rooms trying to not Screw up. In this game Teamwork and Communication is crutial and makes the game Entertaining. While you can play Single Player, I highly suggest buying this for you and a friend to play, it is about 10 times more fun with other people.  You have your 4 Resources, Food, Production (Which allows Building Defenses and Production Buildings), Science, And Dust.  Food Allows you to level up, buy items from vendors, heal in the middle of a turn, and even to hire new characters.  Science allows you to Research New Buildings and Building Upgrades, and also to occasionally buy items from vendors although it's more likely to see a vendor buying either Production or Food, And Dust allows you to power rooms for Defenses, Production, and (Most importantly) to stop Monsters from Spawning in a room. The Monsters are pretty Tough to say the least and can make you almost smash your keyboard into the wall which makes resource and power management more crucial to your sanity. To get through a Level you must find the exit and get both your Main Gem and your characters into the Exit Room. This game is Worth the Money and the developers are amazing for this game. If you have the money pick up a few copies for you and your friends			"

												This is a game that tries to mix some unusual set of mechanics into one game. I used to play this during early access and I could see the potential back then but it was far from balanced; it had one particular winning strategy that rendered most of the mechanisms in the game pointless.I'm happy to say that these days are long gone, the final version of Dungeon of the Endless is a very successful experimentation in game design that will keep you entertained exploring different strategies you never thought you'd use together in the same game.There's a lot of luck involved though, keep that in mind if that's not your thing. But luck is a factor in many games considered good, specially in rogue-likes. In these games the fun is like a good game of cards, you develop skills as you play the game over and over again until you know the best strategies for the hand you were given. And there are many cards and possibilities in Dungeon of the Endless. I totally recommend it.			"

								Dungeon of the Endless. Man, what can I say about this game? This game by far one of the most addidcting games in my game library, BY FAR. First to begin, this game is early access, yet there are slim to none bugs that I have come across. This game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, which means, if you die, prepare to throw something at the wall. DotE has an astounding amount of features, for being in ALPHA. This game hasn't even made it into beta yet, and look at all the features it currently has. Now you may be debating on which pack of DotE you should buy, and you may be considering buying the Founder Pack, and if you are, then go for it. Firstly, look at the features they are promising you upon release with the Founder Pack. Secondly, you gain access to the G2G voting system on Amplitude's website (this voting system is to choose what should be put in the game next) and ultimately decides the outcome of the game upon full release. And on an end note, you get to be apart and amazing community. BUY THIS GAME!			"

The levels are never the same , so you dont know if your find the door in the next room or 15 doors later.Its tower defense, and a rts at the same time. you open a room, put power to it, build a node, the make a guy work on it for more resources. then u fill the room up with towers of different sorts. sending the other guys to open the next room to fight the monsters, then retreat to your friend at the node to stand off all the monsters that come from the dark rooms you didnt power.you can only unlock a hero if you meet them, recruit them and keep them alive for 3 floors, or complete the dungeon, making the game worth going back to, to unlock them all.you never get angry when you get killed you just start again.

								This game is very simple in its design but is incredibly well thought out in its execution. Randomly generated dungeons, resource management, multiple player characters, there is an incredible amount of depth and tactical feel to this game. The graphics and soundtrack make for a rather nostalgic feel instead of being outdated or lacking in their preformance they throw us back to old school titles that we used to know and love. This game feels like the developers are taking their time slowly but surely perfecting it, a nice change of pace from the games of today. Indie developers seem to have what big game companies have lost they are putting their heart and souls into this project and it shows Dungeon is an incredible game even in its alpha stages it has amazing potential. Those of you who bought the founders packs or might have helped kickstart it i feel like your faith will not go unrewarded. I only hope that future versions of the game might include harder difficulties, and maybe some lines of dialouge between heroes nothing voiced mind you but a few texts expressing the characters state of mind feelings towards one another or just jokes or comments about the dungeons themselves would be interesting, expanding the lore might also be cool finding codexes or data logs strewn about that contain information on the creatures crew ship and planet would be a fun treat for people who love to immerse themselves into the game. Though changes like that would be nice the game already offers so much in its alpha stage that i only imagine the completed product will be nothing less than amazing I give the alpha version of this game a 9/10 and I would say that this is my most anticapated title pending release and i absolutley can't wait for the final version I recomend anyone who reads this grab the founders pack as soon as possible you will not be dissapointed.

												The only question I have is why I can't murder other heroes to loot them. The rest of my questions have all been killed out of me.I didn't think I'd like a roguelike this much. Maybe this and FTL have a secret hold on me. When it comes down to what you like about them, the challenge or the exploration, I think I like this game better as the challenge doesn't rely entirely on totallyrandom generation. Imagine if you could improve your ship in FTL without needingit all to come from shops or random encounters, but also gave you the options of directly influencing the parts of your ship with scrap, reinforcing the hull or weapons by themselves. That's what the heroesin this game fillthe gap on. Mixing it with tower defense makes this game engaging as you try tokeep heroes inbetween monsters and your crystal ala Dungeon Defenders, and executes it with the power sent to each grid. Managing these, your heroes and your defense network makes the game engaging.I would like to see more ships added. I enjoythe fact you can have certain gains and deficits granted by each pod, but if the developer doesn't make some whacky options available, or powerful ones, then the gimmick is short lived. I may be the only one who wants to see strange and fantastic options anymore, though. The excitement of seeing the doors open (as this is a door opening simulator, not a monster defense game as one would assume) is sadly reduced once you've run the gambit of monsters. I would like to see more happen.Gameplay: 9/10 Polished, well executed, and lacking in only the slightest of refinements. The stats lack descriptions and the tutorial hucks you in after a basic example.Story: 7/10 Must unlockthe characters and have them gab at one another for the story, but then again, that isn't what you came to do in this game, was it?Graphics: 8/10 Very pretty in game environments, monsters are varied but fit thesame subcategories, heroes continue to surpirse me in some ways. But the lit rooms sometimes offer little more than the dark ones did other than lack of gnawing death.Sound 9/10: As with games of this nature, sound effects are re-used oftenbut it doesn't grate the ears. Music is appropriate, well done, and generally pleasing.Overall: 9/10: Would open more doors.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is very hard to define in today standard of games.The best way I found to define it is that it has an old-school soul: the art is great, the music is extremely fitting and the gameplay extremely innovative.That being said, the game still has its down points, unbalance is one of them. (watch out for those jumping fat men, URGH I HATE THOSE GUYS *rage quits*)Only being recently released as a 1.0 version, you can't really say the game's development is done. The devs are still working on new content and posting about it frequently.Also, you might want to play it with your friends, and you can, with up to 4 of them over network.tl;dr : Innovative game with plenty of eye-candy, really hard sometimes, has co-op.

												Insanely fun and challenging take on rogue likes. Tower defense elements are fun and challenging. Balancing which rooms to power up and strategically covering both your expansion and the thrilling final escape to the elevator with your crystal. Upgrade tree is great branching out to offer different weapons, buffs for heroes and upgrades. Can certainly be frustrating when you've explored an entire floor and you've missed a few rooms and get rolled by strong monsters but that's the name of the game with roguelikes right? Learn through dying. Haven't played the multiplayer yet but really looking forward to see how that changes the dynamic.			"

Early Access Review
								One more door. Just one more door.I am not a huge fan of tower defense games, but this little rogue-like has me hooked. Beyond the simple build-and-defend mechanic at the heart of every TD, DotE adds a compelling risk-reward element in the choice between doubling down and heading to the exit with the resources you've collected, or opening one more door in hopes of finding treasure or an ally at the risk of multiple waves of enemies threatening to destroy everything you have built. Striking that balance is key to your survival.Dungeon of the Endless is still in its early stages, but this little monster has a lot of potential. More items, more enemies, more levels, more non-combat encounters, story elements, heroic side quests, and party management mechanics are sure to come, but I would love to see competing parties of survivors taking resources (multiplayer plix?), the ability to relock doors (albeit either as limited use item or heroic ability), and different environments (with more incredible music added to what is already a killer soundtrack).I cannot wait to see how this game develops. I am officially pumped.			"

												I really enjoy this game, the art style is beautiful and the gameplay hooks you in but i think the singleplayer is hard to manage. I think that the pixelated top down format works well for managing all your heroes when trying to survive the hordes of monsters swarming from unpowered rooms. The building and research systems keep you on your toes when an example would be you are forced to choose whether to buy more prods to keep away badies or get an industry generator to help you later on. The only thing that I have managed to dislike about this game is the single player, trying to order around 2-4 heroes on your own while building defense turrets, healing the heroes,and using their power ups can get overwhelming and complicated especially if you are not used to the controls. Overall this game is a brilliant game with an amazing art style, great upgrading and building systems. even though the single player is hard to manage it is fun getting frustrated at Dungeon of the Endless.

												Configure your troops, allocate your dust, build modules, and then open a door.  Sounds simple, but there are greedier and less greedy configurations.  You have to decide how many chances you want to take for more rewards.  Take more chances early and maybe you get wiped out, or play it safe and find out you don't have enough resources to make it when things get tougher.   Lots of fun, satisfying, meaningful decisions related to leveling, gear, module placement, resource expenditure.			"

								Well I had my first taste of it, I think this game is really fun. I was wanting a Tower Defense type of game...but wanted to find something that had other elements if possible. Well I randomly came across this and I liked the art style instantly...Few games actually interest me with the oldish pixel style but this sure did. Its pretty fun overall, my first playthrough I expected to get killed while learning the game but it is EXTREMELY easy to pick up and play instantly. I made it from start to exit and fully explored the first 3 levels and finally parished on level 4 as waves got quite a bit larger. Its fun, its not too easy or too hard. Theres items, abilities, and the ability to level up and heal your heros. Theres artifacts to research more tech which I love, theres multiple different resources to take advantage of in multiple ways...its just a fun game. So far I cant say too much bad about this title as I was craving a certain game, I saw this and got more than expected..nothing more, nothing less. Very Fun, and im happy this is only in Alpha, the good can only get better from here. I recommend this game if it is below $10 any day. gameplay, graphics(if the style appeals to you and it does to me), and randomly generated dungeons for extra replay value that could be limitless depending how much you like the game.

												This clever, nicely-paced game isn't quite FTL, but it's worth mentiong in the same sentence. FTL's basic gameplay is quite repetitive, but there are interesting choices to be made at the strategic level, as you find out what modules are on offer.  DOTE's basic gameplay has a fair amount of variation, but the number of viable strategies feels a lot more limited.  There's definitely a real learning curve, and unlocking character stories is quite satisfying.  However, DOTE feels much more like a series of tactical and operational puzzles than it gives a feeling of strategy.  I may be saying that because I haven't worked out the tactical puzzles yet (and am therefore blind to strategy) but there's a strong feeling of 'starting again' with each new floor that drains my sense of satisfaction and progression.If you like exploring mazes and unlocking things, you'll get a ton of enjoyment out of DOTE.  That's not quite my thing, but I still enjoyed it for quite a few hours.			"

												An engrossing adventure that I can't put down.  Each turn is a combination of excitement and dread as another door is opened.  Guide your chosen heroes to their gruesome death again and again.  Just when it feel like it's getting easier and you have control of the situation, the RNG gods will test your defenses and most of the time crush them.  Do you make the risky play or the safe one?  Horde resources and build stronger defenses?  Make a run for the end of the level or open another door in search of resources?  Beautifully polished with endearing graphics and captivating music.  Oozing character and dark humour.  HIGHLY recommended.			"

								There isn't much that hasn't already been said about this game. It really is as good as it sounds. And it is amazingly addictive; be prepared to find yourself sucked in for hours at a time if you're a fan of tower defense or strategy games in general. I've never been big on the tower defense formula for its own sake, but DotE sold me on the idea that tower defense can be fun. Of course, DotE offers much more than just tower defense; it introduces an economy-like system--if you've ever played a 4x strategy game, the system will look pretty familiar--that ties in with the tower defense setup (among other things) and at the same time rewards you for exploration and taking calculated risks, which is what the game is really about. On top of that, the game gives you a specific resource that can be used to power unlocked rooms and the defenses and production modules you've built in them but also doubles as currency; deciding to use it for currency instead of power always has consequences. If you like a challenge--the kind that requires a brain--Dungeon of the Endless will hook you pretty fast.The RPG elements add a surprising amount of depth to gameplay. You may not fall in love with any of the characters that make up your party, but you WILL be dismayed when you lose one, especially if you've spent any amount of time getting them kitted up--aside from the sinking realization that you now have one less defender. With different skillsets and weapon types, recruiting and keeping characters alive is an investment in your team-building strategy as different characters can complement each other in different ways (melee with ranged, for instance) and can also be put to work boosting specific segments of your economy to differing degrees depending on a proficiency statistic. Future releases promise even more layers to team-building, as inter-character relationship balancing (guards vs. inmates) and personalities will also play a role in pursuing (or avoiding) character combinations. Granted, the alpha is very short and misses out on giving you the chance to bring any long-term team-building strategies into play, and especially early-on you'll find yourself taking any character you come across just to keep your team's collective head above water. Having a really good team fall into place is more a matter of luck than planning. Hopefully later versions will realize the potential there.New players should be aware of just how short the game currently is. Dungeon of the *Endless* isn't really (endless, that is). Not yet. At only three levels it's a bit of a tease, one that lasts about an hour and a half even with obsessive exploration of every nook and cranny. I can hardly fault the developers though. They've told us what we'll find going in. The randomization of the levels (and recruitable character encounters) and the way the game still manages to throw curve-balls and stay challenging keeps me playing and giddily anticipating the masterpiece that this game will be if the developers deliver. The alpha is already amazing. I doubt we'll be disappointed.			"

												A neat and fun game that has many unique details in it, and yet it's definitely not flawless! I down voted this game originally thinking that the creators completely failed in their idea, but here I am more than a year later to come back to this game, enjoying it way better than I used to.Still I have to point out these things that are, in my opinion, not right:A playthrough takes way too long for a Rogue-like. It can take 3 to 4 hours to beat it. This makes trying out new chars and tactics a bit tedious. There is still quite a narrow range of strategies to have success in a playthrough.There is no proper tutorial.The multiplayer is a mess.(The gameplay is simply not compatible for multiplayer, you're better off alone)The thing that changed my mind are the free DLC and the welcoming tweaks to the balancing. Random scenarios are more common and more ""friendly"", so now you actually feel lucky from time to time. A mistake early on can be resolved later (it didn´t used to be like this). But hey, it costs between 12 and 20€ so I can forgive the mentioned cons.So I'm safe to say now that, if you are into these types of games, you'll get entertainment worth your money.			"

What do I rate it? A significantly high 7/10.Why?In brief; it's an amazing dungeon crawler with a tower-defense aspect seamlessly and cleverly incorporated into the fighting aspect of the game between each round of opening a new random door. You could trawl the floors for hours and spend even longer over-thinking your strategic moves between rooms. After the fourth or fifth floor, you begin to feel a familiarity building and the game slowly becomes a little repetitive. Discovering the same rooms you did two floors ago - like a treasure room, banquet surprise (food bonus), scrap parts (factory parts) and yadda yadda. So although the maps are all unique and no path is the same as the last map, you begin to build a familiarity with the small number of different custom rooms you could venture into, which to an extent, makes you feel like there's nothing new to discover and you've seen everything already. Just in a different order between the floors you take.Multiplayer is nonexistent online. I've tried searching for public matches and to no avail found any. So the multiplayer aspect would only be feesible if you had friends who also the game to play with and don't mind spending a vast amount of time on a playthrough that you can't save or return too. As of yet anyway. Overall...?Yes. It's a game that will entertain you for hours if you enjoy dungeon crawlers. Do not buy for the mulitplayer aspect, unless someone else owns the game and can be relied upon to play with you for hours at a time to even attempt to finish a playthrough. Atmospherics, music and gameplay is fairly good. Overal; buy this game when it's on sale. I wouldn't say it's worth the retail mark-up and it definitely needs a lot of rough edges smoothing out. Such as bugs and incomplete fixes. But a very promising arcade style game.			"

												A fantastic combination of tower defense with rpg and randomized elements. Each new pod you unlock changes the feel and play of the game to a great degree, making multiple playthroughs worthwhile, challenging and fun. Highly recommended.There is a definite learning curve, and it can take a few hours to get yourself going in a groove to get the feel for each unique escape pod's rules for success. The tutorial is lacking, but the guides aren't. If you're up for a challenge and the twoer defense and rogue like aspects are interesting to you, grab this. BE WARNED: the rogue-like aspects can mean you hit a floor you will need to play perfectly to beat, and you can lose a lot of progress for making a bad gamble. [and to some degree, the game can bone you with a punishing floor and there isn't much you can do if you get no dust (a type of currency) for like 9 rooms straight].			"

												If you like FTL you'll like this game.  It has elements of a lot of different types of games:  4x, Rogue-like, Tower Defense, etc.    The goal is to escape the dungeon floor by floor.    Each floor starts the same way, you and a power source.    You need to explore until you find the exit.   Then you need to plan a way to move the power source to the exit.   Moving said power source spawns a neverending slew of monsters.   Monsters spawn from unpowered areas so you can set up an escape route.   All the while you need to balance leveling your team (Food), researching modules (Science) and building defenses or resource generating modules.   I'm 0 for 7 on ""Too Easy"" so expect a challenge.

												I picked this up in a pack along with Endless Legend and Space because I wanted to get into a new 4x game. This game wasn't on my radar before and I didn't really expect anything from it. However what I found was a surprisingly addictive roguelike that borrowed elements from a dozen other genres put together into a deceptively complex whole. I've only beaten the game once on ""easy"" (actually the game's hard difficulty) but doing that took nearly a dozen attempts worth of familiarizing myself with the mechanics and each time felt unique and ""worth"" it.The game's art and music style are very nice and the heroes are interesting, if not in terms of personality at least what they bring to the table in terms of options available to you each run. I feel like they'd work well in a more fully fleshed out RPG setting with expanded mechanics.It would be nice if there was some kind of persistence between tries outside of which heroes you have unlocked to start with as I do feel that is a barrier to replayability currently. However even with that said I feel like this game is more than worth the admission price. One of the most surprisingly enjoyable games I've played recently.			"

												Configure your troops, allocate your dust, build modules, and then open a door.  Sounds simple, but there are greedier and less greedy configurations.  You have to decide how many chances you want to take for more rewards.  Take more chances early and maybe you get wiped out, or play it safe and find out you don't have enough resources to make it when things get tougher.   Lots of fun, satisfying, meaningful decisions related to leveling, gear, module placement, resource expenditure.			"

												This clever, nicely-paced game isn't quite FTL, but it's worth mentiong in the same sentence. FTL's basic gameplay is quite repetitive, but there are interesting choices to be made at the strategic level, as you find out what modules are on offer.  DOTE's basic gameplay has a fair amount of variation, but the number of viable strategies feels a lot more limited.  There's definitely a real learning curve, and unlocking character stories is quite satisfying.  However, DOTE feels much more like a series of tactical and operational puzzles than it gives a feeling of strategy.  I may be saying that because I haven't worked out the tactical puzzles yet (and am therefore blind to strategy) but there's a strong feeling of 'starting again' with each new floor that drains my sense of satisfaction and progression.If you like exploring mazes and unlocking things, you'll get a ton of enjoyment out of DOTE.  That's not quite my thing, but I still enjoyed it for quite a few hours.			"

												An engrossing adventure that I can't put down.  Each turn is a combination of excitement and dread as another door is opened.  Guide your chosen heroes to their gruesome death again and again.  Just when it feel like it's getting easier and you have control of the situation, the RNG gods will test your defenses and most of the time crush them.  Do you make the risky play or the safe one?  Horde resources and build stronger defenses?  Make a run for the end of the level or open another door in search of resources?  Beautifully polished with endearing graphics and captivating music.  Oozing character and dark humour.  HIGHLY recommended.			"

								For all those Warcraft3 lovers out there, who enjoyed tower and hero defenses just as much as i did:THIS IS YOUR GAME.Once you understood the mechanics of this game (e.g. powered / unpowered rooms or defense / roaming hero) it becomes quite addictive and very tactical.The cool part (compared to wc3 TDs) is that between your turns, you have endless time to improve your heros and roosm itself. PRO:-The variaty of items and champsis not as rich as in wc3 or dota, but added to the concept of tower defense you end up having troubles to decide which tactical way to go and which item/champ comps are suiting you best.-DotE is rarly based on random events (exept for the tech-tree and the item drop). At the beginning it may seem so, but then you havent understood the mechanics yet.  CON:NO MICROMANAGING-You have no control of the Heros, except that you can tell them in which room they should move.-You also have no way of building a maze.			"

								Dungeon of the Endless. Man, what can I say about this game? This game by far one of the most addidcting games in my game library, BY FAR. First to begin, this game is early access, yet there are slim to none bugs that I have come across. This game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, which means, if you die, prepare to throw something at the wall. DotE has an astounding amount of features, for being in ALPHA. This game hasn't even made it into beta yet, and look at all the features it currently has. Now you may be debating on which pack of DotE you should buy, and you may be considering buying the Founder Pack, and if you are, then go for it. Firstly, look at the features they are promising you upon release with the Founder Pack. Secondly, you gain access to the G2G voting system on Amplitude's website (this voting system is to choose what should be put in the game next) and ultimately decides the outcome of the game upon full release. And on an end note, you get to be apart and amazing community. BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This is a game that tries to mix some unusual set of mechanics into one game. I used to play this during early access and I could see the potential back then but it was far from balanced; it had one particular winning strategy that rendered most of the mechanisms in the game pointless.I'm happy to say that these days are long gone, the final version of Dungeon of the Endless is a very successful experimentation in game design that will keep you entertained exploring different strategies you never thought you'd use together in the same game.There's a lot of luck involved though, keep that in mind if that's not your thing. But luck is a factor in many games considered good, specially in rogue-likes. In these games the fun is like a good game of cards, you develop skills as you play the game over and over again until you know the best strategies for the hand you were given. And there are many cards and possibilities in Dungeon of the Endless. I totally recommend it.			"

												Rogue-like, ressources gathering, rpg elementa, hero control, micromanagement, tactical combat, tower defense.. arrg thats not even it, lets make this simpler.. You control heroes and progress through a dungeon of your choice, trying to reach the exit.On your way you will build modules to gather ressources to research new tech, level up/heal your hero and build defensive and offensive modules. Even on the easier difficulty the game will get harder and harder as you go. it can become quite addictive. The hero selection allows you to customise and build a team around what you need/prefer and the various 'gamemodes' represnted by the various escape pods, add a few different games options. The game is solid in execution and gameplay. Id think it would end up being too short, but as you go, you will play more carefully and take your time to progress, i ended up playing over 80h (i usualy get bored of most games rather fast). I did not touch the multiplayer yet so i cannot coment on it, but there is also that option.			"

												I can honestly say I have never quite played a game quite like this before.  It is part turn-based sci-fi dungeon crawler, part tower defense, along with its own aspects.  Procedural generation ensures a fresh game every time and as many have said, the game is VERY unforgiving.  Despite dying repeatedly initially, the game still kept my interest, if for no other reason that it IS so unique. Now that I have recently have had time to spend some time getting more involved with the game, I find it quite engrossing.  I own several other ""Endless"" titles and this one is very different and unique, but equally as well made.  I highly recommend this game, particularly to fans of strategy.			"

Posted: March 28, 2015
												It's an apt testimony to the skill and passion of the Amplitude folks that Dungeon of the Endless has become my go-to timewaster. The premise is simple: Your prison ship's been attacked and you've crash-landed on an uncharted planet. You and your motley band of inmates, ship staff and exotic natives must navigate the twelve floors of the mysterious dungeon you've found yourself in by finding the elevator on each floor and using the ""crystal"" generator from your escape pod to power it and move to the next level up. That crystal is also needed to power the rooms of the dungeon, providing a variety of resources conducive to your survival, but it is limited by its supply of ""dust"", and each room left unpowered has a chance to spawn a wave of hostile fauna whenever you open a new door on that floor.The gameplay is an elegant combination of roguelike, tower defence and classic RPG mechanics. It's both accessible and challenging, with a bit less of the luck factor of, say, FTL (you'll rarely be thrown into randomly unsurvivable situations) and more strategic decisions to make rather than a roll of the dice. While plotting your route through the dungeon, protecting the crystal is your primary concern. You'll have a range of modules to install in a dungeon, from resource generators to defensive weaponry, and as your power demand starts to exceed supply you'll have to get clever with which parts of the dungeon you keep powered and where you open new doors. Your heroes' abilities and attributes vary widely. Some are slow but powerful tanks, well-suited to holding a static position; others are technically-minded and can operate or repair the modules you build; others still are nimble speedsters ideal for responding to trouble spots or running the crystal to the elevator. Managing your heroes is therefore crucial to success.The understated soundtrack and the pseudo-pixellated, hand-painted graphics are both surpassingly beautiful, and taken with the game lore (which frequently ties in with that of Amplitude's other titles, Endless Space and Endless Legend) they create a truly unique atmosphere and sense of immersion. The heroes will treat you to some fun banter occasionally, and are great sources of emergent stories. The tale of how you brave robotic swordsman sacrificed himself keeping a horde of nasties from his beloved crystal carrier; or how two of your most dissimilar dungeon explorers form an unstoppable monster-slaying, best-buddy team; are experiences that remain with you long after their runs have ended. Some combinations of characters even have unique backstories of their own, which unfold as they ascend the floors with sometimes-shocking outcomes that I won't spoil here. Simply put, the game oozes personality.Whether you're a fan of the genre, or simply someone who appreciates an old-school challenge or a lovingly-made game, I can't recommend Dungeon of the Endless enough. Keep your eyes on Amplitude, because they've just had an amazing year. "

												Dungeon of the Endless is a tower defense game with rogue-like elements.  You control a squad of up to four characters as you try and make your way out of a 12-floor dungeon filled with monsters.  Those familiar with Amplitude's other games will recognize the resources you'll need to survive: industry for building, science for research, food for leveling up your squad members, and dust for powering rooms.  To generate these resources, you build modules, open doors, and fend off waves of monsters when they decide to attack your ""core"" (a giant crystal).  The rogue-like elements include perma-death (although you may find your dead character again in a later floor), random dungeon layouts, and randomness when it comes to opening doors.  Once you learn the game's mechanics, the game can get easy.  However, it is fun to play with friends and the ""unstable"" cast of characters makes things interesting as you learn about the lore.  The soundtrack and pixel art look of the game are excellent and extremely memorable.			"

I would recommend this for people who are fans of rough-likes like myself and are big on sci-fi set games because being on a ship/planet filled with alien like creatures can't get much more sci-fi.

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Great game, devoted devs, buy now if you want to shape the game and experience the development.As of 0.6.1 i am enjoying this game thoroughly. There are enough characters and since adding 8 levels an indepth clear is currently around 3 hours of play. Though i have read aot of complaints and they fall into two categories too hard or no diversity. In respect to difficulty there are currently two options, easy and too easy. As their name suggests  neither option is very difficult. However if you play this game and do not consider that is a combinations of many game types and aproach it as one you will lose fairly quickly. Also, aproaching each level with no forethought or strategy will cause a loss aswell. It is of course a strategy game so those who lack it will not suceed. Furthermore, the learning curve is fairly easy and once you get the hang of it is a blast.In respect to a lack of diversity you have to remember this game is still in alpha. if you are buying a early access game looking for a full game experience then you will be dissapointed. The devs are pushing out consistent updates, much faster than alot of the other early access games on steam. They fix bugs very quickly and if a patch is game breaking they pull it so you can still play while they work on it. By buying the game now you can shape development by voting on their website.The game itself is quite simple. There are currently 3 resources industry, science and food. Industry is for building modules and major modules help produce those three resources. Minor modules are turrets support turrets and defensive turrets. Science allows you to resource upgrades for your modules and new modules themselves. food allows you to recruit new heroes after your starting heroes, level up your heores(current max lvl 8 due to 8 Floors) and heal them during fights.You use these resources to build a defense network so that when the exit of the lvl is found you can safely bring your crystal(the object that allows you to power rooms so you can build in them) to the next lvl. Each level gets increasingly difficult with new enemies and more rooms.Heroes: Heroes come in all shapes in sizes and currently there are four stats, and five weapons types(currently 0.6.1). Stats are health,speed,damage and wit. Weapon types are sword, spear, pistol, machine gun, unarmed. health is how much life you start with and how much life you get every time you level up. Speed is movement speed. Wit is comparable to an intelligence stat but is mostly used for heroes you can operate major modules(Operating is to give a bonus to their production rate or bonus it gives) by increasing the operator bonus. Damage is the amount of damage you do. All of these stats scale when you level the heroe and different heroes are more proficient in different stats.There is no heroe that is useless all of them serve a specific purpose and you can win by using any combination of them.Also, there are armors and support items, most with comical names or premises. Finally a great amount of thought has gone into this game from the item descriptions and the heroe backgrounds to the strategies that are available and to the details in each room. This ia a great product and i am highly anticipating the finished version. "

								So I grabbed a copy of this because I loved Endless Space, am loving Endless Legend and thought Amplitude is a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awesome developer. This game proves everyting I thought about Amplitude right. I got home and knew I had to go to sleep but wanted to take Dungeon of the Endless for a quick test drive. I told myself, It's 2:40, 20 minutes and I'll go lay down at 3. I opened it up and was facinated. Its a frakking amazing game. I love the progression. I can see the rough edges, I mean its in alpha so its expected, But I'm really excited for this game. I finally closed it believing that it was a latest 3:15 or so and noticed it was 4 am. This game is captivating. I can't wait untill I have a few hours to really sit down and have a go at it. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing good that I didn't even wait until after I slept some to write a review.- Skiiwolf			"

This game is already amazing, with both replay value and some decent strategy/tower defense/RPG aspects woven together into a harmonious whole.  What's even better is that the creators are using player feedback on their already polished product to improve it further with every update unlike other games that push half-finished builds out and expect constructive feedback from their buggy product.  This game has restored my faith in the concept of Early Access, and I highly reccommend it.			"

												TL;DR || The game is a fun mix of dungeon crawling RPG and tower defense. Perma-death, random dungeon layouts, and a good selection of characters add to the replay value. Multiple heroes to unlock. Level 'em up. Gear 'em up. Meet new heroes while in the dungeon and have them join your party. Find ancient treasure. Research new tech. Die, lose it all, and happily start over again. The devs are a pretty swell bunch too!!!I think the art style is fantastic, and the same can be said for the sound design and soundtrack. The gameplay is quite fluid with a nice interface and can also be quite challenging with a good bit a strategy mixed in. Clear the dungeon room by room using your heroes, while setting up defenses to protect your ship's power core. Once you find the floor's exit, defend one of your heroes as he slowly carries the core to the elevator. You can power up rooms to prevent enemies from spawning in them and use that power to set up turrets and resource nodes; this helps you create a defensible path to the elevator, because once you touch that core, they don't stop coming.The developers are worth mentioning too. AMPLITUDE is hands down one of my favorite studios. They put out quality products and continue to provide support for their games beyond their initial release.If you'd like to see a bit of gameplay:

												This game is the absolute perfect mix of Tower Defense, Strategy, and RPG, all mixed in with a bit of Beautiful Pixelated Graphics. The Gameplay is Smooth and Entertaining, Resource Management between you and your team is challenging, and Behind every door is the possibility of Life or Death.  This game could easily be played for hours with you and your 3 friends all shuffling around the rooms trying to not Screw up. In this game Teamwork and Communication is crutial and makes the game Entertaining. While you can play Single Player, I highly suggest buying this for you and a friend to play, it is about 10 times more fun with other people.  You have your 4 Resources, Food, Production (Which allows Building Defenses and Production Buildings), Science, And Dust.  Food Allows you to level up, buy items from vendors, heal in the middle of a turn, and even to hire new characters.  Science allows you to Research New Buildings and Building Upgrades, and also to occasionally buy items from vendors although it's more likely to see a vendor buying either Production or Food, And Dust allows you to power rooms for Defenses, Production, and (Most importantly) to stop Monsters from Spawning in a room. The Monsters are pretty Tough to say the least and can make you almost smash your keyboard into the wall which makes resource and power management more crucial to your sanity. To get through a Level you must find the exit and get both your Main Gem and your characters into the Exit Room. This game is Worth the Money and the developers are amazing for this game. If you have the money pick up a few copies for you and your friends			"

								if you are anything like me, then you get a very queesy feeling whenever you see the ""early access game"" hovering over a game's store page. it signifies many crushed hopes, and a lot of ""potential"" meaning the game COULD be a lot of fun, but right now, it's an empty experience, lacking features, mechanics and content.HOWEVER i was totally BLOWN away with this game, which didn't show a single frayed edge. it has stellar music, fantastic visuals, and some really novel and innovative mechanics, taking both the tower defense genre, and the rogue-like genre to places we've never seen before.everything in it is already fun, and feels complete, which means it can only mean the game will get better! we hope. after being able to play this game on a shared account i am seriously considering splerging for the founder pack. 15 feels like a good price for this game as it is another game which may show many unique experiences, and therefore, many hours of play. i like everything Amplitude is doing with this game, and look forward to see what direction they take it in.

												This could be the single funnest game I've ever played. Highly recommended. I haven't been so excited to play a game in a long time.After playing it a lot, I did eventually get slightly bored of it. In particular the Drill mode kind of sucked the fun out of the game for me. Playing an ""endless"" mode is not as fun as it sounds at all, it gets EXTREMELY repetitive. Other than that, there are a couple annoying bugs. One in particular having to do with the achievements was annoying, where it gave me achievements and unlocked modes I hadn't actually earned. This leaves me wanting to either reset my achievement or at least try to really obtain the objective by myself, but overall it has soured the experience a little. I'm stuck not wanting to play the new mode since I haven't earned it, but then I can't work towards officially earning it either since I already have it.			"

								Comparing this to other early access games i have participated in, This is by far THE most devloped and amazing game ever to be introduced early to steam. It brings back those cool graphics which I had the joys of growing up with as a kid. and gives it this Dark Souls II level of difficulty which I both hate and enjoy at the same time (its a love hate thing). But it combines simple elements of tower defence alongside exploration and your regular RPG character development and items etc whilst slamming it with some very interestingly fun and clever mechanics. As much as I hate this game for never letting me get passed the 8th floor : P I know it is commendable in the way that in no way should you ever feel you have control of the situation.Simply, 10/10FYI: if you have a short temper I recommend not getting this game especially if you have been known to break controllers over Dark Souls XD			"

												If you're into the rogue-like genre then this is a must get. There's a wide variety of characters and a lot of micro managing so I hope you're somewhat good with strategy games. You juggle three different resources and level up your characters to reach the end. There is a multiplayer aspect of the game that's quite interesting, but there's also major desync issues. I've yet to actually reach the end on single or multiplayer, but at least single player won't kick you for lag issues or make it impossible for you to see what's going on in the game. I suggest you stick to the singleplayer until these problems are solved.EDIT: I just beat a run after 20 attempts. Losses don't feel like the game is screwing you over; every loss I suffered I knew was my own fault for not paying attention to something. Unlocking characters can be tedious but is simple enough. You have to find them in a run and recruit them. You must then keep them alive for the next 3 floors. Doing so will allow you to pick them at the start of your run.Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Controls: 7/10Replayability: 10/10			"

												PROS-Diverse cast of misfits that you will lead to an inevitable demise.-Creates a wonderfully haunting sense of isolation through both the visual art style and the excellent soundtrack.-Somehow manages to blend tower defence, rts, rpg and roguelike elements together without failing at any of them.-Easy mode will ruthlessly murder your squad over and over again. -Different types of escape pods to unlock, each modifying how the game is played.-Pixellated pugs.NEUTRALS-This is definitely a roguelike, and sometimes you'll do as much as you can and still fail. Sometimes you will find the exit to the next floor in seven or eight rooms, sometimes it will be the last door on the floor. I find that being stretched thin and having to guard three fronts with a handful of turrets and heroes to be half the fun.CONS-An essential tactic for later in the game involves using heores in unpowered rooms in order to prevent enemy spawns. I'm not sure if this is mentioned anywhere in-game. I found out about it on the forums.I can't recommend this strongly enough.

												The best implementation of a co-op Roguelike that I've seen. It mixes turn-based elements and real-time play, so that it's not one constant unbroken action sequence - you get downtime after each room unless you get overrun. The premise is simple: Open doors to explore the level, and beware of enemy spawns in unpowered rooms after you open each door. Find the exit, and carry your crystal from the entry point to it - but as soon as you pick it up, monsters will spawn until you escape.The lowest difficulty mode is tough, but reasonable - and there's one more above that if you're looking for a serious challenge. The descriptions of the items are humorous, the game is easy to understand, and offers a good challenge without being punishing. And it's fun on your own, but even moreso with up to three friends you can collaborate with. Highly recommended if you like Roguelikes and want to get your friends in on the action.			"

What do I rate it? A significantly high 7/10.Why?In brief; it's an amazing dungeon crawler with a tower-defense aspect seamlessly and cleverly incorporated into the fighting aspect of the game between each round of opening a new random door. You could trawl the floors for hours and spend even longer over-thinking your strategic moves between rooms. After the fourth or fifth floor, you begin to feel a familiarity building and the game slowly becomes a little repetitive. Discovering the same rooms you did two floors ago - like a treasure room, banquet surprise (food bonus), scrap parts (factory parts) and yadda yadda. So although the maps are all unique and no path is the same as the last map, you begin to build a familiarity with the small number of different custom rooms you could venture into, which to an extent, makes you feel like there's nothing new to discover and you've seen everything already. Just in a different order between the floors you take.Multiplayer is nonexistent online. I've tried searching for public matches and to no avail found any. So the multiplayer aspect would only be feesible if you had friends who also the game to play with and don't mind spending a vast amount of time on a playthrough that you can't save or return too. As of yet anyway. Overall...?Yes. It's a game that will entertain you for hours if you enjoy dungeon crawlers. Do not buy for the mulitplayer aspect, unless someone else owns the game and can be relied upon to play with you for hours at a time to even attempt to finish a playthrough. Atmospherics, music and gameplay is fairly good. Overal; buy this game when it's on sale. I wouldn't say it's worth the retail mark-up and it definitely needs a lot of rough edges smoothing out. Such as bugs and incomplete fixes. But a very promising arcade style game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a Roguelike focused on exploration, and incorporating some resource management into the mix. There is a lot more strategy in this game that your average roguelike. I find it to be enjoyable now (in the early access version), and there are many nice features coming soon. One of the things that got me interested in this was that it is based on the Endless Space universe, which I loved. If you are looking for a sci-fi roguelike made by a Dev that cares about, and listens to the fans, then this may be for you.			"

Replayability is high even though a run can last up to 4 or 5 hours (I got to the middle of the game in about 90´minutes. On easy..) which is hard to achieve in the first place. Graphics are charming and  the pixelart is very well done.Well worth my money =)			"

												Upon purchasing this game, I wasn't expecting much from it. Opening up the game, the front screen was already too much for my computer to handle. But after playing a game on easy mode and losing on floor one, I knew this game was worth my money. If you are looking for something hard and also fun to play with your friends, this is the game for you. The only game-breaking mechanic that I found was that you could not pause in multiplayer. This is one of the reasons the game is so hard. When the dungeon gets bigger and bigger and you and your friend are trying to do 10 things at once, when one of your heroes are dying, it is hard to miss it. Having played with my friend we lost quite a few heroes while learning how to play the game. This is definitely a game worth your time and money.			"

												Very well made game, and quite fun. Graphics and sound are nice. Gameplay is almost perfect. However, it does have two issues that are difficult to ignore. Its well worth the money, so be sure to pick it up.Here are the two things that bother me....1)  Very low item count for a roguelike. There are enough items to get by, but it feels like there should be more. Part of a roguelike game is hoping you do get what you are looking for. I've finished the game three times so far, and it just seems like it should have around double the items so there is more of a variety.2)  Mob crowding. Especially late game. It really does turn into a fuster cluck to the point where you can't see the fighting. Even early on, when you enter a room, your heros get clumped together. I would rather see a triple powered mob then 3 smashed together. Sometimes it feels like 50 are crammed into a doorway. You can hardly tell what or how many are dieing.Thanks for a fun game. "

But after my first successful run on ""Too easy"" I was extremely  proud. Two hours of epic battles, narrow escapes, and many lost heroes (let the tears flow) lead to a well earned victory. Several months later, I picked it up again solo. It's a different game solo. Although I feel the gameplay is much better solo, it's hard to learn from your mistakes. This game requires a lot of strategy, and I made the same poor choices over and over again. However, once I was finally able to learn from them and make my way through my first ""easy"" clear, it all paid off.This game is increadibly inspiring. The art style, along with the music, setting, and the ""all is lost feeling"" really get you into it.

Sometimes I'll spend a little extra time sitting in the main menu, because I love the song that plays.Overall, I would say this is a game worth buying.

												Take FTL style micro and put it into a rogue-lite (or rogue-like or whatever you want to call it,) game with tower defense elements and you get Dungeon of the Endless. Pick two heroes and a game modifier (the type of pod you crash into the dungeon in) and you can recruit an additional two heroes for a maximum of four (if your original two survive) characters with special powers that can level up and equip with items. You get resources by building generators for Industry, Science, and Food and protect them with a host of 'modules' you research throughout a dungeon. (and personal interactions in single player depending if you have two specific characters.) I bought the game on sale and the multiplayer was broken for about 3 weeks until they released a new update but now it seems to be working well for most people. So I guess keep in mind the game studio developing this game is busy with all the other games they are working on at the same time, multiplayer tends to still have an occasional bug. The multiplayer is fun but you need good communication at the end to succeed. Also if you happen to play the game please know this game seems to be taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of FTL by stepping up their naming of difficulties - there are two; ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy."" don't be ashamed at ALL to play on too easy, especially if you're on multiplayer with new people.

												I never predicted the fact that Roguelike and Tower Defense genres could go so well together. DotE is extremely addictive and fun for fans of those genres, it takes some of the best elements of both along with a really visually appealing take on retro pixel art. The only glaring flaws are the inability to save your game during multiplayer, and numerous current bugs involving loading and desynch in multiplayer. If they fix these issues then it'd be a contender for my personal game of the year.			"

Don't see that everyday.(Right now, with the cheap price, I highly suggest you nab this, its pretty cheap as it is)Without giving too much away, I this game is the type of game that is easy to learn, but hard to master. It's really hard. But that just makes every win very very worth-while. The visuals are just beautiful, the colors are vibrant and the pixel art is simply swell. Plus, it has multiplayer, I've tried it, and it's very unique and cool. You can say it needs cooperation. A lot of it. The game play is cool, the Dust system is nice, the towers to combat enemies are cool. Only problem with it is that if you buy DLC, you need to earn what you bought in-game, you don't get it right away. Not a fan of that, but the game is still cool without DLC.Oh, did I mention you can play as a pug?			"

Early Access Review
								The game is preaty good so far , can be really challenging alot of time's but thats half the fun right their . Im a big fan of FTL so right when I saw this game I instintly loved it . Their should be a  difficulty button so you can switch between easy and hard added later on because sometimes I like to go for a hard run thru while other time's I like an easier run thru but for now im just waiting to see what is going to be added next .

												PROS-Diverse cast of misfits that you will lead to an inevitable demise.-Creates a wonderfully haunting sense of isolation through both the visual art style and the excellent soundtrack.-Somehow manages to blend tower defence, rts, rpg and roguelike elements together without failing at any of them.-Easy mode will ruthlessly murder your squad over and over again. -Different types of escape pods to unlock, each modifying how the game is played.-Pixellated pugs.NEUTRALS-This is definitely a roguelike, and sometimes you'll do as much as you can and still fail. Sometimes you will find the exit to the next floor in seven or eight rooms, sometimes it will be the last door on the floor. I find that being stretched thin and having to guard three fronts with a handful of turrets and heroes to be half the fun.CONS-An essential tactic for later in the game involves using heores in unpowered rooms in order to prevent enemy spawns. I'm not sure if this is mentioned anywhere in-game. I found out about it on the forums.I can't recommend this strongly enough. If you're a fan of any of the genres listed on the tags, do yourself a favour and pick this up.			"

												Althought I have not yet played Amplitude Studios' branding game, Endless Space, I have played the other two of the series and I can tell that these developers have an extrodinary talent for game design. Talking about Endless Dungeon, it was the first time in a while a game has challenged me in just the right way. Too many times today, games rely on ""artificial"" difficulty, or difficulty without substance. Not Endless Dungeon. I've played the game many times, and successful runs are scarce. As a fan of both genres the game embodies (a rouguelike dungeon crawler paired with a tower defense), it represents each part of the game in a very solid way, providing an excellent coop strategy game that will certianly last. Just be sure you have a couple hours before you sit down and play it. The only issues that I can name is the inability to save in multiplayer, which I heard will be fixed, and my poor luck to find out about this series and not getting the special heros from pre-ordering other games in the series. These are minor things and barely take away from this fantastic game a whole. Amplitude constantly rolls out new updates, both free and DLC, so there's always a reason to return and play again.			"

												Excellent game with lots of replayability with different conditions and characters, think it would be awesome with a co-op of 4 people or at least 2 ^,^ all interesting if minor ability characters, items, and tactics.Kept dying like flies until I realized I could light up rooms to stop the horde of death.Had a great time, and yeah, you defilently need to set it to the easiest mode if you're completely new. (I kept trying it on the more medium setting, and I'm pretty solid at strategic and character gaming).			"

												A unique genre-blending game (real-time and turn-based strategy/tower defense/tactical RPG/roguelite) with stylish pixel art, awesome atmospheric music (MP3s included for free!), intense action and of course permadeath (you can save and quit, but can't load if you fail). Even though it looks like a serious sci-fi game, it can be a big too goofy at times. In my opinion, the game's main downsides are its sometimes too RNG-reliant gameplay (not that critical after you learn to manage resources well) and lack of replayability after you beat it for the first time (even though that will probably take you at least a dozen hours).

OverviewThis game works with a really nice concept, you are at a wrecked space ship and need to survive through some floors on each, taking care of monsters, characters and resources. You (if alone), can start the game with two characters, and while the game progresses you get the possibility to get up to four characters wich can be abbandoned mid-way. As for MP each person gets 1 starter.  The game is rogue-like so there's no save, everyone dies is game-over. No save estate nor last floor respawn, so you were warned. I should also say that this game is hard, really friggin' hard.Graphics - 8/10It's pixel-art-styled, it's simple but it deliver the job well, the monsters don't get repetitive, as there are a bunch of different ones(and some that are just a color change but ok).Gameplay, Music - 8.5/10The gameplay is really simple, so I found no problems with it, except of course some bugs and a bit of weird things on selecting each hero.Did not pay much attention to the music, the sound fx were high as hell and you just start paying too much attention to the game that you mostly ignore it.(Well played devs, well played)Multi-Player - 8.2/10There must be a separated part for this because:1- SP gets a little boring fast if you're not a big fan of this kind of game;2- It's really good as it had just a bit of lag during it;3- As for most of the games, MP makes it all better, if you have a friend that is, chatting on the console in the middle of a hord would be kinda tough.The VeredictThe game's really great and you should really give it a go, even if you need to wait for a sale. If you have a friend or 2 that also enjoy this kind of game than you shoud really buy it, you won't regret at all.A final score of 8 - Give the damn thing a try already!So many typos were made...

												Questions You May Have About Dungeon of the Endless1. Who put Tower Defense in my Rogue-Like?A. Don't question it it's good for you!2. Why are these monsters so nasty?A. They want your sweet Dust! Or your sweet butt. They may want both. Therefore you must defend yourself with pointy objects, shooty projectiles, and most importantly, TOWER DEFENSE!3. What? How do I Tower Defense?A. Get lots and lots of Industry, a good bit of science for researching stuff... THEN PLOP DOWN ALL THE NEUROSTUNS! ALL THE TEAR GAS! ALL THE PEPPER SPRAY (disclaimer: actually only one pepper spray per room is necessary)! AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA... Or whatever works for you really. That's what I like though.4. And what about my Squad?A. Explore the sprawling xenobiology research laboratory of the Endless with your ragtag party of guards, prisoners and natives to the world of Auriga! Let your Tower Defense onslaught whiddle down your foes, then have your heroes eliminate the survivors in a few well-placed pokes! Also use some of them to operate resource generators for EVEN MORE RESOURCES which means MORE TOWER DEFENSE!5. Who should I recruit?A. Ignore the naysayers, get Lady Joleri, for she is your tanky Broken Lord savior! Also her Dust deficiency-causing honestly isn't a huge deal. Pretty much everybody can be good too. SO FIND THE RIGHT HERO FOR YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!6. Should I play the game on Easy or Too Easy?A. EASY IS FOR MANLY MEN! TOO EASY IS FOR MANLY MEN TOO, WHO ARE ALSO MANLY MEN, BUT NOT MANLY ENOUGH FOR NORMAL EASY. BUT DON'T WORRY YOU CAN BE A MANLY MAN (OR LADILY LADY, EQUAL IN POWER, DETERMINATION AND FLEXY SEXY MUSCLES TO ANY MANLY MAN) REGARDLESS OF WHICH DIFFICULTY YOU CHOOSE AND YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL IN YOUR OWN WAY. Just do what feels right.7. I beat the game, am I a cool dude now?A. You were always a cool dude! But keep doing it to unlock more stuck and be THE COOLEST DUDE! 8. Why does the Sanitary Pod give me soap?A. Because don't drop the soap.9. Who's da best?A. You da best.10. Should people buy this game?A. People should buy this game.			"

												I really liked the idea of the game and it was really fun for me to work out the mechanics but there are some bugs in single player game. When my crystal gets destroyed game wont shut down and ı am stuck in the same floor and when a hero of mine tries to carry the crystal the monsters cant kill him and the game wont end. I am not sure if it is a bug but it is annoying because in order to start over again i need to abandon the game and the unlockable features of the game wont be saved please fix this or give me an explanation for this problem.

												The idea behind this game is really nice. Towerdefense, RPG and FTL-like tactics in a neat package. It just doesn't get it strictly right. And it's quite complicate and unintuitive to start with. Loads of info is thrown at the player without warning. The tutorial is a joke, especially for a game of this complexity.Due to the complexity it is even a worse time sink than a lot of rogue-likes. A playthrough takes several hours, my first longer game took 3.5 hours and i ""only"" made it to the 9th level of 12 or 14 on ""very easy"". After that the game ramped up the difficulty even more. I encountered a level that went down hard on my♥♥♥♥♥ as door-opening monsters spawned, which freed all other monsters... There was nothing i could do for my crew but heal them until they got overrun.All in all for the price of 4 bucks it's a great game. Just be prepared that it's far more complex and time-consuming than FTL. I'm not sure it really needed that level of complexity. If you're looking for a more casual game, don't even glimpse at ""Dungeon of the Endless""!			"

												I purchased Dungeon of the Endless  bundled with its DLC. I am enjoying my time  playing this game and I think it's worth the money. Even if you're not a fan of tower defense games like myself, this game puts enough of a twist on the genre to make it interesting, fun, and addicting. The game's difficulty spikes seem to resemble that of a roller coaster, up and down. However, learning the mechanics of DOTE gives you a 1UP over this unpredictability.			"

												Man this game can get old if your just in it for single player but if you play multiplayer and can understand the mechanics you can have some epic games. My last one as I'm writting this review was intense as a 3 man team we made it to floor 8 or 9 i forget which one but due to a horde of monsters attacking in concentration the other 2 were wiped out.I then quietly mourned thier loss and moved on my odds of survival were low but I had a monster on my side as sasha so kept pressing onwards. Through luck i managed to make it to second last floor and nearly die to a giant horde attacking me as a ran towards the elevator. The last floor i had made it. the first 8 doors left me with barely enough dust to power a room. I can't do much anymore i can mearly hope i can find the exit as i open the 11th door i see the exit. Half crazed half dying from laughter I grab the crystal and make a mad dash for the exit. healing myself many times. Suddenly I could see sunlight. I had survived.Honestly this game is hard but winning means something when you do do it			"

												I don't remember what exactly prompted me to buy this, but I'm sure it had something to do with the $2.99 pricetag.I was lucky enough to have a couple of friends online that night who had played a couple hours of the game some time before. The 3 of us then spent the next 3 hours playing through one full round (12 levels). It was an absolute blast. I later tried playing by myself, and managed my way through on the second attempt. Even by myself I had fun running around the various floors defending my crystal. It should be noted that this game is infinitely more entertaining and playable with friends (voice chat will be a necessity). Parties of 2 or 4 people are best, but 3 works fine too. The graphics for this game are as they appear in the screenshots; if this artstyle suits you, you'll love the game. If it bothers you, picking another rougelike might be better for you. For me, I like the way it looks, and feel it works well with the genre. It sometimes makes clarity in gameplay a bit muddy, but rarely is it a serious problem. The soundtrack goes hand in hand with the artstyle, and is simplistic and electronic. Thus far I haven't been bored by it, but I'm sure I'll end up replacing the music with my own before too long. I give this game an 8/10. I've had it 3 days and spent a LOT of my free time on it already. I'm not normally a huge fan of rougelikes, but the way it integrates so well with the tower defence, resource management, and RPG elements makes it SUCH a blast. Singleplayer is fun, but multiplayer with friends is infinitely better. Snag it up while it's on sale, and it'll be worth so much more than the $3 that you spent on it.			"

												Don't let the negative reviews fool you.This game is difficult only because other developers have made their games too easy, holding your hand through most of, if not the entire process.Another company by the name of FromSoftware made a couple of games people should be familiar with... I'm not going to mention them, but they strayed from the ""norm"" of today. Video games have evolved from simple exciting point grabs, to things where you actually had to put some thought into the experience, back to being needlessly simple point (now known as achievements) grabs.I highly suggest this if you want a game that actually challenges you to use your brain, gives you a proper sense of accomplishment when you complete something, and doesn't hold your hand through the process.I don't suggest this game if you have a difficult time with failure, an issue with perma-death, and an issue with learning a games mechanics on your own.TL;DRGet this game if you want a challenging video game; Don't get this game if you prefer todays interactive storybooks.

												Exactly what you want in a Roguelike -- Lots of depth.  Lots of variety.  Lots of strategy.  Very rewarding to play and master.9 out of 10 (with the potential for 10/10 with further development which is in the pipeline)Starts off very hard, but you always know why you died/failed.  As you learn how the game and characters work, the game gets much easier and starts to really shine.  If you're on the fence, get the basic 'Pixel Pack' - you don't get much with the upgrade to Crystal (one hero, one game mode).  I play on Linux under WINE with no major problems, although it's not supported.Pros:+ Great characterizations, diverse skills which dramatically change the game+ Monsters which force you to change tactics floor-to-floor+ Game modes, while a little thin, do offer a good dose of variety+ Music/Sound is excellent.  even at 100+ hours in, the music is still a welcome addition.+ Tactics and strategy matter - a lot!+ Lots of replayability and more in the future thanks to continued development+ Even if you're an expert, there's still a lot of challengeCons:- Tower defense aspect is really a second fiddle to the heroes, especially in lower levels, mostly due to one enemy type (Zoners) destroying minor modules- Multiplayer is still rough (but being improved patch by patch)- The music in the first video is not in the game- Interface could use a little work (health is hard to see, 'restore skill' is hidden, can't pin heroes to rooms)- Characters sometimes don't attack/repair immediately (minor quibble, really)- Crystal running is usually trivialAbout the difficulty: it's hard, yes (and I like hard), but you get to the point where the balance flips and losing becomes a rarity.  It's still difficult and rewarding, but the heal mechanic means you can just overproduce food and heal all the time, so it's actually hard to lose outright.  Many of my first few losses were simply being to skimpy on healing; lesson learned...always top heroes off if you want them to live.Other tips: * take 30 minutes and read a guide or two; it'll save you a few failed runs.* start on 'very easy'* PAUSE. all the time. assess how the battle's going.  is one hero in trouble?  are enemies going a path you didn't anticipate?* don't heavily invest in offense modules; your heroes should be doing most of the fighting* change your strategy if you see Zoners (triangle guys which attack minor modules), Dozers (big rock guys which attack major modules), or Riders (can open doors). monsters are set per floor.  if you see one of the above, the level is going to be much, much harder* Max is very, very good thanks to his ability to generate dust on door opens.  makes floors 8+ much easier.* Controlling aggro is essential, although there are many ways to do it.  the easiest is with Skroig, the necrophage character, and his Red Plume skill - reset (on the character sheet) when necessary; it's cheaper than healing/rebuilding.* Floors start at about 11 doors for level 1 and go to about 32 doors. generally, keep building resource generators until 2/3rds through. shoot for two operators at all times. make use of mechanical pals, when you'll be sure they pay off.* when dust gets short, have one 'exploration' wing where only one room is lit for defenses (with a combat hero that can control aggro), and one 'production' wing where all rooms are lit.  only open more rooms on the 'production' wing when you have enough dust to light the room you're going to open.* neurostun, tear gas, and biotransferrance are some of the best support modules* research 'Shop's and put an Operator on any merchants you find post floor 7-8			"

On top of this, the more you play, the more unlockables you will obtain. These unlockables integrate so much to the game, making the player endeavor to procure all of them. This game compels you to complete it, try every combination, and aquire all there is to get.In the words of GameGrumps ""10/10"".			"

Early Access Review
								The gameplay for this lovely early access title is rather forward; you're goal is to clear the level and escape the dungeon your ship crashed into, and you do this by telling your heros where to go, but they do the actual fighting themselves, you can however give them armor, weapons, and more-or-less create a Super Sentai Force of heros. Its pretty darn amusing when your team consists of a stoic medical robot, a giant, a midget, and a space bounty hunter who seems very similar to another bounty hunter from a Nintendo franchise.This game is without a doubt one of my favorite Early Access games on Steam, and I doubt that willl change.P.S: The ship is my favorite characterP.S.S:Watching your heros fight might sound boring, but it actully requires a fair amount of strategem and smarts.

Early Access Review
								This was my first real go at early access. I was hesitant at first, only ever hearing the horror stories of recently dropped games. After seeing this go on sale tho i couldnt pass up, and oh boy, I'm glad I got it. The video promoting this game pretty much describes it perfectly. If you like rouge-like games with rpg elements then you will not be dispointed. for me the tower defence style 'defend the base' element got me hooked pretty quickly. the only downside at all about this game for me was the fact that there is no endless mode 'yet'. It has been highly requested by the comunity and may be implimented in final release (fingers crossed) but dont buy this early access planning on having it. Overall this is a great game especially for the price. On sale it's a no brainer. TLDR; If you like rouge-likes then this is for you, and there is no garentee of an endless mode as of yet.			"

												Had a team of 4 heroes. Opened a door. Monsters pour in the now opened door and two heroes die. After this, I open the next door, and a zillion more monsters pour in. My remaining two heroes die. 10/10 would open two doors of death again.This game has a lot going for it, and it spans lots of genres and types of games. Turn-based? Yup, resources are gained based on turns. A turn is completed when a new door is opened. Real-time? Yup, combat, building, and movement takes place in real time. Roguelike/RPG? Yup, you level up your character and collect items to equip them with while running around each floor of the dungeon. Tower defense? Got that, too. You build different types of ""towers"" in rooms for defense, resource production, or boosting your heroes. You level up or heal characters by using food, build towers by spending production, and when you find a science crystal you can spend science to research new types of towers or upgraded versions of ones you already can build. There is also the interesting element of dust, which can be collected from some types of monsters when they are killed, or some rooms occasionally grant dust when entered. The use of dust is to power rooms to be able to run the towers you have built in them. The limited quantity of dust makes for some interesting decisions as you discover more of the floor, you will never have enough dust to power all of the rooms, so you must make choices as to which rooms to power. Unpowered rooms without heroes in them can also produce more monsters when the next turn is begun, so that also plays into the strategy of which rooms to power. Finally, once you discover the exit to the floor, it becomes a mad dash to take your precious crystal from the entrance to the exit and escape with all of your heroes alive. There is also a story element to it in that the characters have a back story, some of them involving other heroes as well. And it's in the Endless universe, which is quite a clever setting IMO, I already enjoyed the lore from Endless Space. This game continues with the same lore. This game is very fun, if you like dungeon crawlers or tower defense games, you won't be disappointed unless you despise the genres combined in it.			"

												Honestly , I think this must be a great game.Graphics and musics are so nice. I was excited.But as I started tutorial, I realized this game needs mouse wheel to play, and there is no way to change controls assigned to mouse wheel (Power a room).My mouse doesn't have mouse wheel.Wish this would be fixed in further update.

												Great game, though a little buggy sometimes.  It has a nice mix of turn based resource management, tower defense, squad based real time strategy, and hero development with randomly generated maps and randomly selected enemy types for each level thrown in for good measure.  Some of the heroes do their jobs better than others, but they tend to be unique and fun in their own way.Play Single Player to unlock things and make progress.  Play Multiplayer for silliness and comraderie.			"

												Background: I do not have much background in Rogue-Like Adventures.Replayability: By the very definition of a Rogue-Like game, It has immense replayability. There is a cast of unlockable characters and different game modes (Pods) available to challenge the player in unique ways. Each character brings its own set of abilities that are solo and Party based on timers or are Passive (100% uptime).Combat Mechanics: Combat is automatic for the most part. You move into a room, your characters auto attack. The control you have as a player is the use of special abilities, healing, and movement from room to room.  Characters are assisted by room defenses the player can build. Social Frustrations...: I normally put Mechanics here but so... man okay the characters you unlock between floors have conversations that give you a glimpse into their Lore. Sometimes though some characters do not get along and will literally kill each other between floors. It is a minor inconvenience on early floors but when it happens on the last floor its just frustrating. Not game breaking, just...Ugh!Final Thoughts: DotE is a vibrant pixel based Rogue-Like Dungeon Crawler with some RPG elements and quick reaction gameplay make it a great and cheap addition to anyone's game list.

Original dugeon crawlerIf you are a fan of RPG and dungeon crawlers with tactics, this game is made for you. Add with this a good challenge and a nice story/background story and the game is almost prefect.You have time to think and prepare your progression, sometime you make very important choices and sometimes you have choices that you can't made because you don't have the ressources/power to do it.Humor is also part of the game and fighting combat is well made.

Early Access Review
								The gameplay for this lovely early access title is rather forward; you're goal is to clear the level and escape the dungeon your ship crashed into, and you do this by telling your heros where to go, but they do the actual fighting themselves, you can however give them armor, weapons, and more-or-less create a Super Sentai Force of heros. Its pretty darn amusing when your team consists of a stoic medical robot, a giant, a midget, and a space bounty hunter who seems very similar to another bounty hunter from a Nintendo franchise.This game is without a doubt one of my favorite Early Access games on Steam, and I doubt that willl change.P.S: The ship is my favorite characterP.S.S:Watching your heros fight might sound boring, but it actully requires a fair amount of strategem and smarts.

Even though the controls are so simple(basically,it's mouse only) the gameplay is not. There are different pods and each one of them has different game settings. It provides players with the greatest experience that they can ever get. I've spent some time playing this game and I still enjoy it; thus, from time to time I play again. Totally recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								This was my first real go at early access. I was hesitant at first, only ever hearing the horror stories of recently dropped games. After seeing this go on sale tho i couldnt pass up, and oh boy, I'm glad I got it. The video promoting this game pretty much describes it perfectly. If you like rouge-like games with rpg elements then you will not be dispointed. for me the tower defence style 'defend the base' element got me hooked pretty quickly. the only downside at all about this game for me was the fact that there is no endless mode 'yet'.

												This game is a unique blending of party-based RPG elements and tower defense mechanics.  If you like either or both of those things, you will likely enjoy this game.When you first start out the game, you are able to choose 2 of 4 different heroes and, in the default escape pod, you crash land into the dungeon.  As you progress through the levels, you will come across more heroes in the dungeon and if you hire them and keep them alive for long enough, you will unlock the ability to choose them at the start.  Heroes can use different weapon types and they also gain specific skills (passive and active) as you level them up by consuming food resources.  Heroes act as your mobile gun platforms and damage sponges but, on the harder difficulty, they can be overwhelmed fairly easily starting around level 4 if you are not careful.Fortunately, each time you open up a new room, you are given more resources (food, industry and science) to work with based on your current level of production.  Each new room also has a chance to contain dust.  With your dust, you are able to power the rooms that you have opened.  You can then use your industry resource to build modules in those rooms.  The modules range from offensive turrets to defensive and support types.  Unlocking new modules and leveling them up all requires the science resource and access to a unique crystal module that you find in some rooms randomly.As you explore new rooms, you will come to the point where you don't have enough dust to power every room.  Unpowered rooms have a chance to spawn monsters each time you open a new door.  Most of the gameplay revolves around this mechanic.  You are constantly balancing your defenses to be strong enough to cover the amount of unpowered rooms you have in that direction.  Certain monsters will ignore heroes and target modules, others will primarily focus on heroes or try to knock down locked doors.  In the later levels you have to be aware of what all the monsters are trying to do and stay on top of it.Eventually, you will find the exit to the next level.  You may also open every last door on the level.  At this point, it is time to move on.  To do this, you have to have one of your heroes carry your crystal core from its starting position to the exit.  As soon as you pick up the core, all hell breaks loose and all unpowered rooms will start to spawn monsters.  I have generally managed to cheese this by using the Sara character, who is fast, as my runner.  With slower heroes, this phase could be intense.If you manage to survive the 12 levels of the dungeon, you will unlock new escape pod types.  The different types of pods change the rules of the game up in various fun ways with advantages and disadvantages like making healing cheaper but disabling the heroes' auto healing every turn.   These alternate ship types combined with the different hero abilites and the randomly generated dungeons should offer a ton of replayability to fans of the gameplay.I personally wish there was a bit more story involved, as the only real story elements are in the dialog between heroes while riding the elevator to the next level.  Certain heroes, when paired together, will have unique conversations that can unlock buffs for the hero.  But the way in which this is presented is a bit of a sore spot as I didn't notice a way to skip the lines of dialog you've already seen when proceeding to the next level.I also felt like the game could use a few more unique items as it feels like later levels you just wind up getting better versions of some of the same items.  I would have liked to have seen more active/passive skills that were unique to special items.  This is a minor complaint though, there are plenty of items to find with decisions to make in how to gear your heroes.I really liked this game, mostly because it brings a unique gameplay blend to the table with a nice mix of genres that I enjoy and a good atmosphere.  At the time of this review, I have only beat it once so far on the easiest difficulty, but I am looking forward to beating it on the next setting.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Roguelike Tower defense game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are some resolution sizes.You can play border mode.You are able to play the game in fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a Master volume slidebar.There is a Music volume slidebar.There is a sound volume slidebar.There is a background volume slidebar.You are able to use a controller??Able to change the controls on the keyboard.About the game.You have to pick one of the characters and play in the dungeons. Each character has their own power and effects. You can even unlock some during the gameplay. You have to play in a dungeon and you have to try to find the exit. Everytime that you open a door enemies could be spawning or new things could be discovered. Enemies are only spawning in dark area's and will never spawn in the same room as one of the characters. You are able to find items, level up and finding more ""light"". Light is needed to power up the rooms to prevent enemies from spawning or activating the machines. Whenever your crystal is under attack you may lose some light sources. Whenever you found the exit, you have to carry the crystal and bring it all the way to the exit. The crystal is heavy and will slow you down, so its recommended to let the character with the highest speed carry it. On the way to the exit, enemies will keep spawning overtime and hindering you. The only thing what is bothering me, that you can't choose which enemies to attack and ranged units is able to shoot you from all the way from the other side of the room. The more rooms that you open, the more dangerous it could be. Has Metroid reference.. Character is named ""Samus aran"" but the first letter is changed and names are reversed.Has many unlockable characters.Able to unlock different ships.Able to build machines and turrets for resouces and defend.Characters are able to level up in the session.Characters has different attribute and powers.There are 2 difficulty settings. Too easy or easy.There is an online multiplayer. (servers are dead, so you have to host one for you and your friends).Other things.Has Tf2 characters -.-Let's try Video:

												Its great single player and has great potential for the multiplayer to be just as great. However there are several limiting factors to multiplayer, the first being the inability to share items, and second the fact that research is not shared. This is crippling to those who want to play online. Especially those who are playing with public players.			"

												I love this game. It combines the idea of a tower defence with the sharpness of a rogue-like dungeon crawler, with intuitive and surprising systems. As usual with Amplitude, I suffer from 'one more turn' syndrome every time I play this game. It is harder and shorter than a 4x, but keeps me on my toes all throught the game, unlike in a 4x where one starts knowing noone, this game has enemies that scale, change and destroy constantly, from suicide bomb-bugs to wizards to crystaline bohemoths to weird two-legged wolf-like things. The multiplayer is slightly unintuitive, but very enjoyable all the same.			"

												Psycopaths and prison guards thrown into an endless nameless dungeon on a cataclysmic world.  This is the prequel to Endless Space and Endless Legend.  This is the origin story of the Vaulter faction.  This is the best tower defense game ever made.  It's tower defense RPG TBS-RTS.  It's also hilarious.  Amplitude offers free and paid content, I recommend them both.Permanent death mechanics, only save & exit exists.  TF2 characters all present and accounted for.  Multiple modes of play with varying pros and cons, many items to be built with useful and varying functions.  Also, the Grim Reaper shows his face to offer you bargains.  Do you make a deal with death?  Well, it's behind every door, so you might as well!Creative, original, inspired, riveting.  Try it out, or without a doubt, you'll be missing out!			"

Early Access Review
								I love steam, every time I turn it on it shows me something interesting. Today’s interesting find was this, Dungeon of the Endless. It looked and sounded such a curious idea that I had to buy it up. I'm happy I did. The opening cinematic was attention catching and what follows is addictivily fun game play. It's simple to get a hang of the controls but i expect it will take some time to master your own strategies for survival success. The dungeon crawler and tower defence aspects of the game work beautifully together. As you progress through the levels the larger the dungeons get offering more doors to open. More doors open meaning more ways for the monsters to get your heroes and crystal. It took me a few attempts to get past the first floor, carrying a crystal to an elevator is more of a challenge then I thought. Though mad dash's never fail me...shame I lose a hero or two in the process. Anyway I'm enjoying the Alpha greatly and i can't wait to see what more there is to come closer to full release. I highly recommend this game and it deserves all the support it going to get.			"

												Difficult to describe the game. A rogue-like adventure with lots of potential heroes and game-modes to unlock which greatly enhances the game's replayability. Additionally, the resource management and tower-building adds a fun new dimension which makes the game feel very different from other rogue-likes on Steam. (Although keep in mind, this is a rogue-like first, and a tower defense second, if you go in looking for pure tower-defense you might be disappointed.)In any case, I love it when developers who push the boundaries of a genre and succeed in creating something new and wonderful. I highly recommend the game, well worth the price.			"

												An enjoyable mash up of roguelike, tower defence, dungeon crawler and small part RPG. Take a party of up to 4 characters (who can be swapped out as you go) thro a series of levels escorting a crystal (power supply) that must be safeguarded to the exit before progressing to the next area. On the way to finding the exit you travel thro rooms/areas that allow you to place modules (research upgrades and provide resources for leveling up) and minor modules that act as various types of buffers, debuffers, crowd control and dps. As you enter new rooms/areas waves of creatures attack and attempt to reach the crystal you are safeguarding. One problem you have is that power is limited (dust - from the endless series of games)  and can only power a limited number of rooms prompting some tough decisions at times. Unpowered rooms equals spawn points for the enemy. Finding the level exit brings about a mad dash escorting the crystal being pursued by endless spawns of creatures.It can get a little repetitive which I suppose is the nature of roguelikes. But it also manages to capture that one more turn feel. So if you like roguelikes it will probably be your cup of tea,Genuinely original mash up attempt from a company that tries to innovate and not emulate. Well Done. A bargain for the price. (Currently on sale for £4.99).			"

Early Access Review
								I've never had so much fun losing at a game. This game combines aspects of the MOBA genre with a genre from the roots of MOBA, tower defense. Maybe I'm overexplaining it. This game is a tower defense game that requires your to manage 3 different resources, a team of heroes, and base construction/map exploration. It allows (and forces you) to build structures to increase your resources and defend your buildings, and a hyper-important power crystal. Resources are throttled tight, forcing the player to be proficient at economy, construction, and hero manipulation. The game features a rogue-like model of character growth and map randomization. This is the first game I've ever played that can be considered primarily rogue-like, and it is a blast. It's really hard, but it's still fulfilling when I get overzealous and open too many doors (Opening another door typically activates a wave of combat. It's a simultaneous unstap step/entering attack phase) in an effort to replenish enough resources to upgrade in time for the first wave.			"

It's very challenging but fun, also there is tons of stuff to discover.The game is not so much ""tower defense"" but your crew, you need to level them up by gathering food, farmed from your buildings and also by finding nice items.21000487 out of 24190487 rotten dog turds			"

												Big Fan of Endless Leganed, and enjoyed Endless Space too, so I thought I'd give this a go even though it looked a bit odd.First game. Didn't really know what I was doing, died, and thought that it was a bit naff. Tried againSecond game. 'Oh, hang on, I see.....' got a bit further but died again. Scratched head in puzzlement. Tried againThird game. It all starts to make sense and I realised it's actually really great.Never played anything quite like it. An intriguing mix of tower defense, strategy, resource management and exploration that has a massive 'just one more turn' factor. Whilst the premise is quite simple once you understand it, each turn really makes you think about the strategy you're going to employ, and it's very satisfying fending off a huge wave of enemies with a good combo of defenses and abilities when your plan works out. Just got my first victory and I'm very much looking forward to starting the next game. Definitely recommended if you enjoy something a little different.			"

												Ok this is a good game , I love it but there is one thing that pisses me off. There is a person you can play as the engineer form TF2. There are two major problems with this. First of all , the door opening animation dosent work at all you cant weald a door open. And the next thing with♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most is why in the gods name did you make him have a spear as his wepon ! ... Of all things you chose a spear. In TF2 you can use a pistol as wepon not a spear. So all i ask as a loveing fan fix theres two major problems.			"

												""Deleciously retro-looking"", is what my wife said to me yesterday, after looking over my shoulder while I was playing Dungeon of the Endless. I just hummed, or nodded my head. I totally agree with her, but I was just too spellbound by this game - especially since the completed version has launched last monday!Don't get me wrong, I could have easily looked over my shoulder and have an indepth discussion about the visuals of the game, because even though this game is a Tower Defense meets Dungeon Crawler meets RPG meets [prolly some other genre] it only has the GOOD elements of each type game. Examples..TowerDef) A wave of monsters only comes after YOU decide to open a door. Don't want to fight for a bit? Just don't touch anything..easyRPG) ""Experience"" is gathered in a pool and YOU decide who to give that experience too. You can see what kind of effect the added level will have on stats and active or passive abilities. Maybe you want to use that experience on healing or on buying stuff instead? Your choice..What I already found during early access:the visual are delicious,*1the characters are rich, *2the game is versatile and challenging,the play is intuitive,What I realised since the full version:the characters are even richer*2the game is really well-balanced*3*1 Maps are randomly generated each game, you don't always get the same monsters on the same floors, every room looks different with only slight repetitions here and there, every other floor you get a complete new set of rooms and monsters.*2 Regarding rich characters, each character has a short biography, some have interactions with eachother or make random remarks, but you're not drowning in walls of text. Instead you're really drawn to the characters in your team and want to get to know them better. Between more than 10 characters, I've only found 2 that are connected so far..*3 Died at floor 7 out of 12? Stop crying...start again!Buy this futuristic film noirish, action/comedy/attidude-packed, soon-to-be-award-winning-game-(mark-my-words)!			"

												If the video game FTL and the boardgame Descent got together and had babies?  You'd get this game.Referring to it as a roguelike/tower defense doesn't do it justice.  As an afficionado of turn-based games, I was concerned that this would be too 'realtime' for me.  Not to worry.  The developers refer to it as 'door-based', and only when you open a door does it shift to a quasi-realtime game.  Very similar to FTL when choosing to jump to a new sector.Also similar to FTL in the sense that you want as much of the primary currency as possible but never ever seem to have enough (scrap in FTL is roughly analagous to dust in DotE).The player is still subject to the whims of the RNG in terms of dungeon layout, shops, item availability, etc., but never punitively so.  Clever play almost always compensates for any randomness in a given run.Dungeon levels take about 30-45 minutes of thoughtful play, which is a bonus for those with real-life time constraints.If you're a fan of roguelike and turn-based games in general, and enjoyed FTL - I heartily recommend this title.

Characters are cool and unique with funny chat dialogs between them depending on who is in the party, items diverse and different with a big pro vs cons to some, map layout is totally random and on time a floor may be SUPER easy and the next time you just get wiped. Plan your route, allocate resources efficiently, research well, and you will have a lot of fun.			"

												I recommend this game for Various reasons i try to explain below, though it may not be enough information for the average gamer.A solid Tower Defense/Turn-based strategy mixed with sci-fi and hack-n-slash. Whether solo playing or online multiplayer, ""DotE"" will give most players a hard time; either by high blood pressure, rage, and/or suicidal thoughts. Theres a few easter eggs you'll catch here and there, and i'll not add any spoilers, but you'll get a chuckle or two from finding them out. Replayability is high (for me atleast). And we cant forget about that futuristic and highly advanced melodic elevator musicI've noticed a few bugs here and there, like heroes getting stuck in the animation for opening doors, which is gamebreaking more or less(if you can risk a hero taking one for the team). Or your tactical map not working, and you have to manually click and drag on the map just to see whats going on. On another note, the servers arent exactly...perfect with connectivity. This game also has its fair share of ""THOSE GUYS"" who immediately kick you from lobbies without giving you an excuse or even saying hello. It happens ALOT, and its a bit rude and repetitive. On the plus side, by having Endless Legend and/or Endless space, you will start seeing a few monsters and races from the other Endless titles. Brings back some decent memories, especially the broken lord Hero, and her impressive defense.Theres different Passive and Active abilites for heroes ranging from typical damage and defense boosts, highly resourceful aggro's, and turret/module upgrades. I believe this is the first game i've witnessed take advantage of hero's gaining or losing power due to thier personality and teammates within the same room as them on the dungeon floor. Both Endless Legend and Endless Space (great games by the way, leaning more toward Endless legend) have modding options and tools except for this installment in the Endless series. Hopefully that will change in a few months time BECUASE i'd like to see more heroes, abilities, and possibly monsters and multiple factions from the other games.By getting Emporer and Crystal packs from the other titles, it unlocks characters, ships, and artwork, music etc for DotE.It doesnt take a genious to figure out the uses of Food, Industry, and Science (no excuses for those of you who played the previous titles), although theres a slight exception for Dust as the tutorial deosnt exactly teach you how NOT to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked the first few playthroughs.Any way, im out. So good luck and add me if you need a companion or opponent in any of the Endless games. I also recommend Endless Legend for those of you who who like hexagonal turn based strategies like ""Michael Meyers"" Beyond Earth.			"

Posted: June 30, 2016
												This is one of the most complex games of Solitaire ever invented.Play involves ""drawing a card""- you ""open a room"", which may have a number of special properties, including suitability for installing resource generators, getting resources for free, etc.This, in turn, involves drawing further ""cards""- whether any monsters spawn from ""cards"" you have chosen not to ""put into your deck"" (using Dust to ""power them up"").  So managing your ""deck"" is essentially how you play this game; the ""heroes"", their levels and gear are mere mitigation used to hedge risk.This sounds OK in theory, but in practice, this game is very poorly balanced, and due to severely penalizing modding (it's literally not allowed to set the difficulty upwards if you mod the game), it's never going to be properly balanced by modders and is therefore chock-full of newbie traps, poorly-designed difficulty curves and bad design decisions, like weapons that don't scale well with monsters, random item drops that don't scale, heroes that are basically just statistical trash, shops that frequently don't sell anything you actually want, regardless of cost, a ""wit"" system that's supposed to boost production but barely gives enough to be worthwhile with practically all of the heroes with the Operate skill (and items that can give it are worthless, since practically none of the non-Operator heroes have enough ""wit"" to matter), etc., etc., etc.Worst feature?  You literally cannot get rid of party members if you want to trade up, short of suiciding them, with potentially disasterous consequences.  You meet a half-dozen other folks, but you cannot have them join you in any way.  It's a game design decision that makes me shake my head; the choice of whether to stretch one's Food to cover more people, but possibly get stretched too thin and die due to having a weak party, would have enriched the game.  But I suspect that the ""4 is the limit"" aspect was hard-coded into the UI long before ""you'll recruit heroes you find randomly""- it feels like it, anyhow.Basically, this is a messy experimental project where I think the developers lost track of the statistical meaning of their design decisions quite early in the process and, due to their absurd penalty on modding, it's unlikely to ever get polished and fixed by the player community, which is a real shame, because the central idea (""make the world's most complicated Solitaire and make it look like a RTS / Tower Defense game to get gamers to buy it"") was very interesting indeed, and in theory, this should be a very good game.  But as it stands, this won't stay on my hard-drive for very long; once I figured out that certain combos of heroes work all right, and realized that runs are essentially pure RNG and involve very little actual skill, beyond managing the ""cards"" and doing statistical guesswork, and that more than half of the ""upgrades"" and ""defenses"" were basically worthless... well, I feel like this was a clever Idea that arrived half-baked, wasn't ever really addressed at a deep level by the developers and can't get fixed by modders, not that it would matter a lot at this late date.  It's too bad, really; this is a game where most of the problems are clearly fixable, but won't ever get fixed.			"

Posted: May 13, 2015
												I cannot recommend this game highly enough. It's a simple, rogue-like, game that I think is best described as a Dungeon Defense. Your team of up to four heroes are trying to reach the surface of the planet Auriga, which you crashed through after an attack on your spaceship. In order to do that, you will have to navigate 12 (13? I haven't reached the end yet myself) floors of an ancient dungeon left behind by the enigmatic Endless from when they colonized the planet. In addition to collecting more resources needed to continue on your journey, each time you open a door in the dungeon one of several things will happen: monsters will attack from the open room, monsters will spawn in other unlit rooms throughout the dungeon, or a random event (mostly positive, such as finding an item or another hero) will occur. You can't light every room in the dungeon, but you can build defenses in the ones that you do. The monsters will try to attack your dust crystal (an item you NEED to progress through the game), so the game is about lighting paths through the dungeon to funnel the monsters down and wear them down with your defenses. I know I might not have made it sound like it, but this is a surprisingly simple game that is also surprisingly complex and nuanced. Easy to learn, but difficult to master. In later levels the game does start to throw some curveballs your way, such as monsters with erratic behavior and more imfamously those that go after your defenses and not your crystal itself. As I mentioned before the game is rogue-like, so sometimes things do just come down to random chance, but there are plenty of unlockables to be had that don't require beating the game itself, so most always I feel that I gain something on each attempt. Multiplayer is almost none existant, and so the rogue-like elements manage to keep the game feeling fresh and new even after many hours of single player. All things said though, this game is extremely difficult. Harder I think than FTL, I'd say. I know the only two difficulties available are called ""Easy"" and ""Very Easy"", but they're anything but; ""Very Easy"" is more like ""Normal"" and ""Easy"" more like ""Hard"". There are different escape pods that you unlock by beating the game and after reading about them I don't see how they can make the game anything but nightmarishly difficult. Fluff wise, those of you familiar with Endless Space or Endless Legend will find a lot of lore related to the two other games in the franchise, and in fact this game serves as a bridge between the bigger, grander, 4X stratedgy titles that Amplitude is known for. It also takes itself far less seriously, and goes out of its way to make fun of itself in the flavor text. It's my opinion that all the heroes in the game are on a sliding scale of insanity, and the game takes every opportunity to remind you of that.The art work itself, well, look at it. It manages to pull off pixel art as beautifully as Hyperlight Drifter. If anything that I said above sounds appealing to you, than pick up Dungeon of the Endless right away. I can't recommend it enough.			"

The levels are randomly generated and there are lots of characters to play with so the replayability of the game is very high.If you complain about all games these days being the same old hat and don't pick up this game you have no right to complain anymore.

												With refreshing visuals for the retro style it likes to use, Dungeon of the Endless Alpha packs in quite a fun, terror-inducing roguelike game. As soon as I hopped in my first game I noticed the lights and animations that add a level of... depth persay? It immerses you into a world (or dungeon) of mystery. It's ominous dark corridors and glowing lights attract you into a blood bath of creatures and survivors.  Although I am waiting for most of the ACTUAL mechanics that will get me to fully embrace it, Dungeon's alpha is no doubt fun. I am waiting with a delighted anticipation.After a couple of updates I am inclined to add that the previous statement of 'depth' is ever-changing.  It is increasingly diving deeper and deeper into my heart.  Dungeon of the Endless presents a glimpse of the array of mechanics, visuals and personalities which every consumer was hoping for when purchasing the illusive 'founders pack,'   or the alpha stage in general.  Ultimately,  (Finally, Jesus!)   this game is a must-by for ANYONE who loves the 8/16 bit retro games, adventure games, the Endless games, or simply any rogue-type game. (FTL, Binding of Isaac, etc.)Edit:  So with their new update, my PC can no longer run Dungeon of the Endless without lagging.  Hope they fix this by optimizing better.. It ran so well before....  v__v			"

The multiplayer, although still buggy is extremely fun.8/10 At launch of early access only 3 stages to play which take about 45-60 min to complete.  With that said this is a wonderful game. With random dungeons and different characters to choose from you can get a few good plays in before in gets stale. of course the game is not released yet so content will keep coming, but if you want 40hours for your 10 bucks you will be disapointed. But the ground work is there, this will be a highly rated game when fully released.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is another entry in Amplitude's loosely connected Endless Universe. The game combines roguelike elements with the dungeon crawler.The premise is this: you are among the handful of survivors remaining after a penal transport ship was attacked. Your escape pod crashes into the bowels of Auriga, a planet that's a wonderous hybrid of fantasy and science fiction, Our heroes must tow their escape pod's energy crystal up to the surface, floor by floor, in order to survive.Players accomplish this trek by opening dungeon doors. This is where the game gets its turn-by-turn basis from, as each door counts for one turn. The turn aspect is central, as the vast majority of your resources will be generated in between turns from various resource modules you'll construct. Of course, opening any given door has a chance of spawning waves of enemies which the player must fend off in an effort to protect the energy crystal. If the energy crystal reaches zero, it's game over.If this sounds like a familiar mechanic, that's because it is. It's the epitome of the tower defense game and you'll find that there is a plethora of offensive, defensive, and supportive modules the player can research and construct to assist in the effort. As in other tower defense games, each of the many enemy types have different priorities and abilities, so strategic use of these modules is important. Simply slamming down the default turret gun isn't going to help you (and in at least one game mode isn't even an option).The goal of each level is to find the exit elevator. When the player finally finds it, they will have to plan for an anxiety-fueled escort mission. One of the heroes must transport the crystal to the exit elevator. Once the crystal is picked up, endless waves of enemies will begin spawning in darkened rooms. To make matters worse, whoever is carrying the crystal will essentially be out of commission for the battle, as bearing the crystal creates a tremendous speed debuff and disables attacks and abilities for that character. Once the crystal makes it to the elevator, the player may leave. Be careful, however, as it is possible to leave without your other party members and they will subsequently be removed from the party.Along with the variety of modules, we have a variety of characters each with different abilities and perks. Each character belongs to one of three factions: crew members, prisoners, or natives. This is a background element but it does affect some perks and stat growth. For example, natives are the cheapest to level up but their stats aren't really impressive in their early levels. In this respect, the game is very much like an RPG, as most characters seem more easily fitted toward one role due to their stat growth and abilities. For instance, characters with a high Speed stat make suitable crystal runners because the effects of the aforementioned debuff will be less noticeable.The graphics use a pixel aesthetic, although it does not feel retro in style. It has a crisp feel to it and is pleasing to the eyes. Despite the simplicity, Amplitude has managed to create an interesting diversity of environments. Indeed, all the rooms are invariably boxy, but it's clear they put some work into trying to make the floors feel different. There's an actual sense of progress across geographic space by using different artistic themes for the decor.The sound quality is excellent. However, while the soundtrack is fantastic you may find it a bit repetitive after a few hours of play. I found myself turning the music off and turning on other sources for background noise after some time.Finally, the way in which this game unravels its lore is extremely subtle and I love it. Small vignettes explaining unseen stories can occur between levels, but only if you have the appropriate characters in your party. These stories can be simply amusing, explain what a character is all about, or inform on the relationships between our starring cast. The coolest thing about these is that each story ends in a buff being granted to those involved, empowering you for the floors ahead.Overall, I recommend this game enthusiastically. It's a wonderful blend of many different game mechanics that somehow seems to work. However, one final warning to any potential buyers: this game is difficult at first. Do not be fooled by the two options of Easy and Too Easy. I recommend chewing on Too Easy at first until you get the hang of the game. Some events are high risk/high reward and the choice of whether to take that risk is best served by a judgment cultivated in the crucible of Dungeon of the Endless.			"

												This game is great! The gameplay is engaging. The way turns are handled gives it a very good blend of real-time and turn-based strategy element. Concepts are simple. Controls are simple. Art is beautiful. Everything conceptually is perfect for a great game to waste of few hours of our days.BUT the game is not refined at all. I only play multiplayer, and so far out of the 5 games I've played, 1 of them we are forced to quit at floor 3 because one of my friend's screen turned black. 1 of them we are forced to quit at the start because my friend just got stuck at the door and can't do anything (except maybe deleting the hero?). 1 of them I was playing pyro and two times in the same game when she is operating, she gets stuck in animation and stops doing anything (can't attack, can't operate, can't take treasures/resources). 1 of them at floor 8 I just suddenly drop all my friend's connection from my game (but i am still connected since i am talking to them via discord), AND THERE IS NO WAY TO RECONNECT!. And finally the worse of all, at level 11, when I click go to next floor, the game froze and there goes our 3.5 hours of gameplay.So you can see how frustrating our experience are with this game. It's such a shame because this game has all the right elements to becoming a great game for us.			"

												A great melding of rogue-like and tower defense.  Instead of defending against attack on a static map, you have to fight room by room, floor by floor, in an attempt to reach the safety of the surface.  In true rogue-like fashion, you have random layouts and permadeath.  What more could you ask for?			"

												If the video game FTL and the boardgame Descent got together and had babies?  You'd get this game.Referring to it as a roguelike/tower defense doesn't do it justice.  As an afficionado of turn-based games, I was concerned that this would be too 'realtime' for me.  Not to worry.  The developers refer to it as 'door-based', and only when you open a door does it shift to a quasi-realtime game.  Very similar to FTL when choosing to jump to a new sector.Also similar to FTL in the sense that you want as much of the primary currency as possible but never ever seem to have enough (scrap in FTL is roughly analagous to dust in DotE).The player is still subject to the whims of the RNG in terms of dungeon layout, shops, item availability, etc., but never punitively so.  Clever play almost always compensates for any randomness in a given run.Dungeon levels take about 30-45 minutes of thoughtful play, which is a bonus for those with real-life time constraints.If you're a fan of roguelike and turn-based games in general, and enjoyed FTL - I heartily recommend this title.

												I recommend this game for Various reasons i try to explain below, though it may not be enough information for the average gamer.A solid Tower Defense/Turn-based strategy mixed with sci-fi and hack-n-slash. Whether solo playing or online multiplayer, ""DotE"" will give most players a hard time; either by high blood pressure, rage, and/or suicidal thoughts. Theres a few easter eggs you'll catch here and there, and i'll not add any spoilers, but you'll get a chuckle or two from finding them out. Replayability is high (for me atleast). And we cant forget about that futuristic and highly advanced melodic elevator musicI've noticed a few bugs here and there, like heroes getting stuck in the animation for opening doors, which is gamebreaking more or less(if you can risk a hero taking one for the team). Or your tactical map not working, and you have to manually click and drag on the map just to see whats going on. On another note, the servers arent exactly...perfect with connectivity. This game also has its fair share of ""THOSE GUYS"" who immediately kick you from lobbies without giving you an excuse or even saying hello. It happens ALOT, and its a bit rude and repetitive. On the plus side, by having Endless Legend and/or Endless space, you will start seeing a few monsters and races from the other Endless titles. Brings back some decent memories, especially the broken lord Hero, and her impressive defense.Theres different Passive and Active abilites for heroes ranging from typical damage and defense boosts, highly resourceful aggro's, and turret/module upgrades. I believe this is the first game i've witnessed take advantage of hero's gaining or losing power due to thier personality and teammates within the same room as them on the dungeon floor. Both Endless Legend and Endless Space (great games by the way, leaning more toward Endless legend) have modding options and tools except for this installment in the Endless series. Hopefully that will change in a few months time BECUASE i'd like to see more heroes, abilities, and possibly monsters and multiple factions from the other games.By getting Emporer and Crystal packs from the other titles, it unlocks characters, ships, and artwork, music etc for DotE.It doesnt take a genious to figure out the uses of Food, Industry, and Science (no excuses for those of you who played the previous titles), although theres a slight exception for Dust as the tutorial deosnt exactly teach you how NOT to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked the first few playthroughs.Any way, im out. So good luck and add me if you need a companion or opponent in any of the Endless games. I also recommend Endless Legend for those of you who who like hexagonal turn based strategies like ""Michael Meyers"" Beyond Earth.			"

My 18 hours on current record were put in over about 2 days...havent hardly stopped playing. Characters are cool and unique with funny chat dialogs between them depending on who is in the party, items diverse and different with a big pro vs cons to some, map layout is totally random and on time a floor may be SUPER easy and the next time you just get wiped. Plan your route, allocate resources efficiently, research well, and you will have a lot of fun.			"

												This game is simply amazing. Unlimited replayability, that necessitates deep thought and stategy. It's games like this, and FTL and many others that make me proud to be a gamer.Cons: Multiplayer lobby is kind of dead, on a Good day there's maybe 3 or 4 games being hosted (in nearby regions) though i'm sure theres more if you broaden the search. Pro: Great Game. Strategy is necessary. Multiplayer works very well except for a very rare glitch that allows you to have unlimited everything (I'm not complaining). Journals and stories for each character are great. Game is hard as hell, I have 13 tries to clear on easy and still havent cleared it. Great Soundtrack. I can go on and on.Long story short, buy it.

												If you're into rogue likes (as I am)  you'll most likely enjoy this  game. Decently challenging, requires strategy and good party development to survive. There are many ways to play the game, and certainly a bit of RnG thrown in as expected from the genre. Replayability is good- I just beat the game for the first time after a 5ish hour playthrough and I am confident I will play again in the near future. If you are not into roguelikes, I would not reccomend.			"

												As someone who usually absolutely despises roguelikes, I have to hand it to these devs. This is a roguelike that is actually pretty good! So many roguelikes just create ""difficulty"" with brute force randomness, but this game actually has a lot more strategy and a lot more interesting decisions to make. I especially like how the light switch mechanic works to shift the monster spawning around, and the fact that you can switch it up on the fly. Sort of reminds me of Desktop Dungeons where exploration itself is a resource. Similar principle at work here, which is very interesting. Even though escort missions tend to be an infamous no-no in most games, it actually serves a fun and interesting purpose here.Ultimately, though, I still don't think this game is for me, so I won't be playing it any further, personally. Because as much as there is a TON of stuff in here that I like, it still has those classic roguelike annoyances, such as opening a door and getting insta-ganked because randomness. Don't get me wrong, some people LOVE that, but it is one of the main reasons why this player specifically does not care for roguelikes.Tower Defense? Yes.RTS elements? Yes.Turn-based strategy? Yes.Squad-based tactics? Yes.Resource management? Yes.Survival? Yes.Roguelike randomness + permadeath? No thanks.But even as a person who has no taste for most games in the roguelike genre, I have to say that this game is really really interesting and worth checking out. Even though it's not for me, I can tell it's something special.			"

												An amazing (and amazingly addictive) tower defense/dungeon crawl/arpg game.  Take 2 heroes. Recruit others you meet. Open doors, build towers, and farm resources.  Level up characters and buy items and upgrades. In premise, it is simple. In practice, it is rather tough.  I did ALMOST beat the game once within 10 or so hours.  I never felt frustrated and time goes by like crazy when I play this game.  In short, if you like tower defense games at all, you should buy this.  Had for 2 days. Logged 8 hours. Send help.			"

												An imperfect game when it comes to balance but extremely user-friendly when it comes to interface aside from a few choices, like it doesn't seem to actually save hero groups like the keybinding screen suggests it can. The pixelart is gorgeous, the enemies are brutal. My number one nitpick is probably that it doesn't really give an indicator of the strength of the enemies that will spawn so it feels largely random whether you kill them or not.			"

Early Access Review
								I havent expected much from this game and it exeeded all my expectations. Classic turn of all rouge like/lite games was replaced with opening a door. Every time you open any door you receive access to next room. Room can contain different bonuses or monsters. You need DUST to power new rooms. But you have never enough of it to power all rooms at once and every unpowered room can spawn squad of monsters every time you open the door. The more unpowered rooms you have the more monsters can come. So you need to (despite of random nature of labyrinth) plan your advance and do whatever it takes to not allow monsters to owerwhelm you. Once you have found an exit from dungeon you need to transport your power crystal towards it. When you start to moove your crystal rooms start to loose power and monsters start to spawn with extreme rate. So once you have started mooving crystal - time working against you so you need to escape the level as soon as you can.Main disadvantage - multiplayer is not ready yet.Main Advantage - haven't encountered any bugs yet. No bugs at all.			"

												I enjoyed this in beta form.  I've played the final product now.I must say that I didn't think they could have improved it, but they did. This is a great game.The balance between tower defense and dungeon exploration is excellent. Both paths are equally viable. If you wish to set up a series of traps that monsters have to crawl through to get to your crystal, you can. You could alsomanage your heros, and set up buff rooms that make them over powered in choke points. Combining both is reccomended though since sometimes enemies might slip through, or you might want to thin the herd.Every floor introduces a different enemy set. They start off rather straight forward, stopping to kill your heros if they see them and destroying your major modules. Later on, you get ones that will seek out your crystal, rip apart your fixed defenses, suicide bomb, or even worse they will open doors for you.The last is bad for you because opening a door can spawn a new set of waves while you are already dealing with them. It could be a chain reaction resulting in a wave of creeps that you just can't win against.  This forces you the player to seek out these enemies and kill them before they can reach their destination. Have fun :DThe characters now interact with each other. Some complain that it's too much, but I feel that it sets the atmosphere pretty well. These interactions could even result in you losing a character, so watch out, and pay attention to what they say. If it looks like it might happen, it might be best for you to pick who to sacrifice, and offer him/her up to the darkness before one gets killed out of your control.Finally, it isn't bug free. However I have yet to find a bug that prevents me from completing the game. I am certain that they are working on the bugs.In short, what are you waiting for? Buy it now!			"

												Alright, I really need to re-edit this. Before I start, I DO recommend this game, because you WILL have fun. A ton of fun. The game's great. Incredibly unique, fun, interactive, fun characters, fun concepts, etc etc. That being said, some elements of the game can be really, really frustrating if you're unlucky. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It really is. Just to put some perspective, I just did a Drill run aiming to unlock the next pod (requires beating 24 floors), and because of *1* single bad batch of RNG, I lost. No counterplay, nothing I could do, I just got a bad batch of enemies and was forced to lose after 2 hours of intensive playing. My characters had a great skill spread (Pyro / others for AOE work), were highly leveled, all of my modules were highly leveled and had a great mix of them, but nope, one unlucky batch of enemies and it was impossible to win. Keep in mind that I had absolutely NO difficulty WHATSOEVER with the first 20 floors. None. Just 1 bad RNG batch, forced to lose. Cool. - Enemies are way too difficult to differentiate. After 30 hours I still struggle to tell which does what, and to my knowledge there's no way of knowing. There should be a monster encyclopedia that shows you and tells you their abilities. Speaking of which, explosive enemies feel hugely unbalanced. In a game where the spawns consist of a set few enemies per floor, if you get explosive enemies and some crappy RNG, you can get a huge wave of them and have them all explode at the same time trying to kill your modules, which actually just 1-shots your whole team and insta-kills any low HP characters you have. Almost no counterplay to this. You just bank mid-fight on killing them ASAP or at least negating as much damage as you can. - The UI is messy. For around the first 20 hours I actually didn't delve in to turret upgrades because I struggled to actually differenciate what the turrets did and how effective they actually were. Hell, the creators of the game thought it was even appropriate to slap jokes and puns in to the actual descriptions of these turrets which made learning what they do even more annoying instead of just having a box that pops up with a joke if you hover your mouse over the icon. - Items feel really, really lame. Anyone who plays the game can definitely agree with me on this. Some of the items are great and come with skill upgrades, and some of the items feel really good when you get them, but there are so many items that feel like filler items. They have almost identical stats to other items, but they'll just be strictly worse by ""2 less attack"" or something like that. It's not a matter of ""It's a starter item, so it'll be worse"" because the rarity of the items are the same. There's literally just one item that does the same thing as another, but better. - The ""Easy"" and ""Too Easy"" terminology is really off-putting for new players. The game's really difficult, so clearly the devs were trying to be funny with those labels. In reality, easy is actually like hard, and too easy is like normal. There aren't any other difficulties. There are pods that you can choose from, and certain pods have effects that can make the game harder (which is like ""Insane"" difficulty in most games). New players are left wondering why the game is unbeatably difficult for them when they're only in ""EASY'. I can only imagine a bunch of people gave up or refunded when seeing that ""EASY' was way, way too hard for them. You're practically required to start off a bunch of runs in ""Too Easy"" to figure out the game for the first 10 hours. - The game only has 1 song. Yup, 1 song (2, but the other is only briefly when you carry the crystal). It's basically a 15 second loop over, and over, and over, and over. Fortunately it's not an unpleasant.. ""song"", so this isn't all that annoying and you don't exactly notice in game. But really, they couldn't come up with some awesome 8-bit soundtrack? Would've been so good for this game if it felt more arcade styled. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the game is fantastic, but there are some definitive issues that make it feel REALLY frustrating to play instead of a relaxing arcade-like experience. You get some good, clean runs, and you have a blast, but then you get 1 bad RNG experience and it completely puts you off from replaying. There's a lot here they should fix.			"

												I stay up too late because I want to finish my run.  I wake up early because I want to start another.  I have not been gripped like this by a single player game in a very long time.  This game is extremely fun and addictive.  There is a wonderful balance of simplicity and complexity, and there is so much variety on how you can play the game.  If you enjoy tower defense games you will LOVE this.  You don't have to build towers even, you can beat the game with just your heroes.9/10, excellent game.  Only reason I give it 9 instead of 10 is because the story lines between characters only go to floor 5 or 6.  If characters had conversations between every single floor this game would be a 10 for me.			"

												I'm thoroughly enjoying this game already.  I am only a few hours in, but am having a ball.  I am an old man, and remember when Rogue was the new thing (hell, I remember when Pong was the the new thing) and this brings back those fond memories.  It isn't the big graphics hog that I am used to these days with the Mass Effects and Fallouts, but has a great old school vibe that gives it a great flavor.  Gameplay is a combo of dungeon crawl and tower defense, and is accomplished very successfully.  The humor is a nice touch, and is funny without being too cheesy.  (The description of the Energy Bar really made me chuckle.)I grabbed it on sale, and call it a great bargain.  If you're looking at it outside of sale season, I think you'll still get your money's worth.			"

												Best Rogue-Like other than Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth. Buy this if you don't have BoI:A. Now.Previously I left this review at those few sentences, but I must go on.This game is in my top 5 Rogue Likes, as it features interesting gameplay that forces you to evaluate risk/reward in every step you take. The game is divided up so whenever you enter a door, it is like ending a turn, meaning it is split up nicely and gives you a second to breathe, a calm before the storm if you will, and then immediately gives a 30 second push of hardship.All of this combined with beautiful graphics and a fantastic difficulty balance and character pool makes this a wonderful game that I would certainly recommend.

												I am a big fan of this game.  I originally got it before official released and loved it then, and love it even more now.The only way I can explain this game is it is almost like a very fast pace 4x game.  You explore the dungeon, finding rooms, loot, and other charactersYou expand by claiming rooms as your own using dust to power them.  (And surprising choices on what you claim and don't claim can change you from winning to utter defeat)You exploit by taking a whole wing of the dungeon and build up all your building there and stockpiling resources for the next floor.You exterminate, because if you aren't opening every door and killing everything that moves, you will not be leveled, you won't have tech and you won't have resources to make it through.Another thing I love about this game is you will never stop being surprised.  I am 60 hours of game play in, I just had a combination of characters in my team that caused a major event to happen between floors to the point I am standing up walking around the room like, crap, crap, crap, now what am I going to do.  This never happened before, why why did this happen to be 2 floors before the end aaahhhhh....  Pro:-Quick action   You can load up and play through a floor in 10 minutes, or play through a game in under 2 hours (If you live 2 hours :) )-RPG Elements   Your characters don't really get experience, but you can level them with food.  There are a lot of characters each with unique skill sets that are all kinda fun.  If you are like me, you even end up having teams you like.  Ultimately, the only thing you must have in you party is a fast hero, and there are plenty of them.-Building Elements    You might have to unlock them all, but there are choices for every play style.  -Replay Value    Even with just the variate of characters the game has massive replay.  Then, they added different pods before release which add a whole new level to the game by changing the core rules.  Cons:-Difficult     It is just unforgiving.  One mistake and your game can just be done.  Two mistakes and you are a better man then me if you survive.  (Many people will call this a pro)-Monster and item variety     There just isn't a lot of options for monsters and loot.  You get better version of the same gear and there is some variety in monsters, but I feel it is a bit lacking.-Cost     How can this company stay in business and make me more totally awesome games if they only charge $12.  They should raise it to $30 ;) "

												An interesting game that mixes genres very well, its like a hybrid of dungeon crawler and tower defense and feels very different from many other games I have played.The atmosphere is great as it feels mysterious, which is really helped by the lighting as you open up new doors and power on rooms. The pixel art is charismatic and the dialogue is quite funny. I really liked the interface of how the game switched between. It feels very fluid and natural to switch between the two fields of view on the fly. The co op mode is also a very fun addition as you discuss and elaborate upon decisions with friends, as you can spend as much time as you want between battles talking over what you want to spend resources on, which is very fun, and the single player game is equally as enjoyable. There are a large variety of escape pods, heroes and modules to unlock and discover that keeps the game fresh and enjoyable and the gameplay is also very innovative.I definitely feel there should be some gameplay adjustments though, as I really enjoyed the gameplay at its core but some of the rougher edges bothered me. One of the things I felt was missing was the lack of any sort of final boss of any kind, either a single tough monster or a horde mode could have helped, you just beat the 12th floor and the game just ends. Its very anticlimatic and it negates a lot of the choices you've made in terms of building your characters and unlocks. Why does it matter which modules I research and unlock and what researches I grind if I never have to use them in some sort of final battle? So you can simply stumble into victory without really earning it. This is one thing I'd definitely like addressed if the developers make a sequel to this game. Later on, it definitely feels like your victory is determined by which direction you pick. On my first winning co-op game, we picked to go right from the You kind of have to just, so some of the deaths feel quite cheap. The game also has only two difficulty settings, one of which is too easy and the other is too hard and is in desperate need of an intermediate ""normal"" difficulty to balance out the game a bit. The easy mode is so easy that there's no challenge and you'll have maxed out heroes in no time and thus the game becomes boring and in the harder mode felt like the developers couldn't figure out how to balance the gameplay for higher challenge so they simply spawned a ton of monsters so it becomes frustrating and not in a good way, and it becomes too random, even for a game with RNG.Overall, the game is quite enjoyable and there is a lot to explore and discover in the game, experimenting with different characters and modules is satisfying, exploring the dungeon is very fun as is weighing up, co op mode is also a lot of fun where you can discuss what you want to upgrade with your friends, however overall the gameplay should have some adjustments in order to make it great.

												This is not an easy game. You'll be confused, lost, sad, and alone at the beginning. However, as you progress through the game, you learn that life isn't so terrible, and that there may be a chance. Then you die and have to start over. Everything is different now; the randomized maps make predicting what your up against impossible. One thing is still the same though: you learned a little bit about how this game works now. You go through and get a bit farther, then die. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Eventually, you find out that there is a backstory if you are so inclined, otherwise you can continue to treat it like an evil arcade machine. This game has a lot of surprises in it that really make me happy: quite a bit of work was put into it and the fact that the creators cared is evident throughout.I would definitely recommend this game to anybody that likes being challenged and having to figure things out the hard way on their own. There is nothing quite so satisfying as making it past a level that maybe you shouldn't have, or trumping the unstoppable forces with sheer cunning. Very entertaining, fun and easy to pick up and burn a few minutes or a few hours of your free time! Would recommend out of 17.			"

												A great rogue-like dungeon crawler. It's one of those games that requires you a few tries to finally get it. You'll likely die on the very first floor on your first attempt, but as you play again and again, you start to witness how much strategy and team micro-management is actually required to succeed.The premise of the game is as follows: There are 12 floors in the dungeon. After every 2 floors you're in a new type of zone with new types of enemies, each time getting harder and harder. There's a wide choice of heroes to pick, though most are locked at the start. You can pick any 2 to begin with, and over the course of dungeon crawling you'll be randomly coming across others and able to recruit them to make up a team of 4.Now here's where you have to get tactical. You have a crystal that is your power source, which you must protect at all costs, and as you make progress through the dungeons, you find Dust, which is used to power up the rooms. Rooms where you've restored power allow you to build researched modules that generate resources for you or act as buffs, whereas rooms without power are dangerous and can randomly spawn mobs every time you open a door anywhere on that floor. The goal is to find an elevator on your current floor and to bring your crystal power source there.So the game involves a lot of planning, strategy, tactics, and team management, as well as a bit of luck. As with most rogue-like games, if you lose at any time (team gets wiped out or crystal gets destroyed), you have to start over from the very beginning again. Losing in this game can feel rather demoralising if you've gotten far, since a single dungeon run could take a few hours rather than half an hour that many other rogue-likes have.A bit of trial and error is required to grasp the mechanics of the game and learning from one's mistakes, particularly where hero combinations are concerned, as some can result in unexpected cutscenes in between levels where one of the party members gets killed off by another.The gameplay is really addicting if you like tactics and turn-based mechanics, but as I mentioned, it is hard, so be warned. There are two difficulty levels - 'Too Easy' and 'Easy', but they're more like 'Normal' and 'Hard', so don't be fooled by the wording. If you don't mind the challenge, then this game is definitely worth getting. You can play it both solo or multiplayer co-op.			"

												The gameplay itself is fine, but...The game is a huge tedious time sink, one session takes 3+ hours.The multiplayer totally ruined whatever positive thoughts I had for the game. The network code was clearly done by someone with no experience. It takes multiple tries to get a game going, and if someone leaves mid-game, the state gets corrupted beyond repair. The game makes autosaves, but when you try to load and regroup, players will most likely fail to reconnect. The timeouts are ridiculous, 5-15 minutes of looking at the loading screen while the game just waits. And finally, even if you do manage to get it to work, a successful run requires intense cooperation and communication, and there are very few decent human beings playing this. It takes just one person to ruin the game for everyone.			"

												Cozy little strategy game, which is a mix between tower defense and hack 'n slash.You build major modules to gather resources in different rooms, you control where the power goes (limited amount) and  you have to strategically play to create bottlenecks not to get swarmed. Fun and challenging, definitely hard, and gives a very rewarding feeling when you pull off some great plays. There are some minor annoyances that promote singleplayer ahead of multiplayer, but hopefully they will be fixed soon.If you think the game looks cool, i'd urge you to give it a go.

								This is a very unique 4x-ish, rpg-ish, TD-ish  game. It has pretty deep strategy, but rather than a huge scope with hordes of anonymous units this is a small squad of up to 4 distinct members.I love it. It's a fantastic game, that I highly recommend to anyone who likes strategy games and anyone who is normally put off by the somewhat impersonal nature of grand scale strategy games. This is intimate and original.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is pretty much a Tower Defense with Heroes. You're given a lot of options, but after multiple failures you soon realize there's really only one way to play the game (I'm sure I could look up a guide, but why should I have to do that?). There are limitations everywhere that I was not aware of when I purchased the game. You only get resources when you go to new rooms. Rooms are limited. Modules you build only give you resources when you go to new rooms. It's an annoying gamble to build a resource generator that may end up costing way more than it will generate. You don't get anything back when you go to a new floor. You keep your unspent resources, heroes (if they lived) and inventory. If you spent anything on turrets then you're not getting that back. And, yes, you will need turrets. Your heroes are squishy and die easy, no matter how many levels they get. I feel like the game would have been much more fun if it was based more on skill and patience rather than luck, gambling, and ""knowing exactly how to play it"". As it is, I can't recommend it at all. Not to mention the game's extremely apathetic attitude toward the player. ""One of your characters permanently died. Cry much?"" ""Your crystal is getting attacked. It's time to panic!""""Easy"" mode is the top difficulty at the start, by default. Grab your crystal, wait, and see how long you last. I know the game isn't designed to be played that way, but the result is way out of the ballpark away from ""Easy"".The monsters keep spawning, and each wave is more than the last. There's no limit. If you could hide with the crystal then the game would probably glitch out and crash. I don't care how badly you want to push the player forward. It's a cheaty type of mechanic that should never be used in any game.And wow. I was really tempted to purchased the entire Amplitude Studios bundle! The only thing keeping me from doing so was that it wasn't that great of a sale to get it all (some things not even being on sale). So I decided to try out Dungeon fo the Endless for $3. I'm SO glad I did. I seriously recommend anyone interested to try it out during the $3 sale. Don't buy the bundles. Try it out for yourself. The game is very punishing with little to nothing in the way of rewarding you for your efforts, so I'm sure a lot of ""roguelike"" players will like it. I was expecting more. I was wrong. I am glad I tried it out though. I won't be interested in any other Amplitude games.			"

												I need to stop believing people when they tell me that there is such a thing as a good roguelike.  I bought this game on the strength of the combination of Roguelike / 4E / Tower Defense... except it's not.  It's just another terrible little roguelike, a sadistic RNG that takes the place of creative level design.  The concept is nice.  Open a door, explore your environment step by step, do some research, build defenses... die, lose everything.... Repeat?  Why?  I get the idea that the makers of DotE are confused by the concepts of TD and 4E games, both of which I love, and both of which are predicated on the idea of slow, steady, calculated improvement.  Every time you conquer a level in a TD, you unlock more and more of the game, your skills get better, you gain more towers, and you take on greater challenges.  In 4E, resource gathering and untilization, slowly expanding your sphere of influence... these take hours or days, and garner iterative improvement.  In DotE the floors just aren't big enough.  Your empire consists of a couple upgrades, maybe three or four production units total, and maybe a dozen turrets.  Upgrades you research on one floor and almost everything you built are lost when you move up a level and nothing is gained from game to game besides a slow, inevitable feeling of malaise at the realization you've wasted money on this.  I love hard games.  I love overcoming challenges, but I like to feel like I'm the master of my fate and the utter blithering randomness, the ""haha, you lost, now start over from the begining with only your sense of shame!""... that's not what makes a good Adventure, 4E, or TD game.  Not even Nintendo Hard Platformers like Ghosts and Goblins did that. Oh, and everyone who raves about how simple this game is? So what?  Minecraft is one of the least simple games out there and it's massive.  Ditto Fallout 4 and Skyrim.  Ditto Bridge and Chess.  Know what's simple? Hopscotch.  Simplicity means nothing if the core game itself isn't good.  DotE could be good, if each dungeon were dozens or hundreds of rooms spread out across a vast area, which would have to be protected from invaders as you research and level up, battling wave after wave of monsters crawling out of your barely protected lightzone... and then, once you lose, as you inevitably must, you unlock some potential upgrade that you can use to get farther the next time.  Oh... I would have loved to play that version of DotE if it had true 4E and true TD, instead of just stealing ""elements"".  That would have been amazing			"

												This is a really cool and tactical take on the rogue-like. It even adds a tower defense element to the game which is actually very well done and vital to becoming victorious!If you are a sucker for rogue-likes like I am, then you'll love this game for hours and hours as these sorts of games have amazing replayability. I only bought it a few days ago and I already have enough hours in it to make my money very worthwhile! I did get this on sale for £3 to be fair but even the base price is great for the amount of hours you'll get out of it.Another great thing about this game is the multiplayer. I heard that it was a lot more buggy and a bit underwhelming at launch, but now they've improved it (like separate saves from single and multiplayer) I can say that it's definitely worth telling a friend or 3 to pick it up with you for these instense 3+ hour games! And of course, because it is randomised, it's a different experience everytime, so you'll never really master the game enough for it to become too easy.The only real cons I can think of with this game are the few bugs that I've come across, one being as insignificant as sound glitches online and another being gamebreaking if you suddenly disconnect or crash and lose your save file. However, I'm sure this is being worked on and will most likely have a fix sooner or later. One other con I will mention is that the mechanics are a little hard to pick up at the start because the tutorial doesn't give you much to work on, but an hour or two later and you'll be fine.All in all, I can say that this game is definitely worth your money! It's a little hard to pick up on all of its mechanics, but once you do you'll be thinking of all sorts of tactics to keep your team alive through each horrifying floor. It's really fun online AND on your own.			"

												Went into this game blind, Saw it was free for a period and just went at it.At first, I did not like it, it felt....awkward. The gameplay was odd, and the way your interface worked felt clunky. But then, after giving it time I got used to it, everything fell into place and I was able to start enjoying the game. After my initial 10 failed runs on Single Player and a few Character Unlocks, I really picked up the game and got into it, so I decided to try out multiplayer, that part of the game wasnt so much fun.  Every game I got into was full of Zerg Rushers, Leeroy Jenkin's w/e you want to call them. I ended up just ditching two of the players in my game so my friend and I could dual character, in which case we did much better than with others.The Game has a slight learning curve but once you get it down, be prepared for hours of fun. My only gripe is that the producers gave perm access to a different title of theirs instead of this.			"

												TLDR: Buy this game, It is goodThis game is pretty freaking amazing. I personally love roguelike games and tower defense games, but this game doesn't just combine those genres, it takes them both to the next level. With great multiplayer, albeit tedius to organize, Dungeon of the Endless breaks the trend of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and or unbalanced multiplayer in top down roguelikes. (Binding of Issac:Rebirth/Afterbirth, I'm looking at you buddy). This beautiful game also has great characters, from their design, to their  bios, and even to the small blurbs of diologue they make, my favorite being Skroig saying “Shall we dance, Mademoiselle Christelle?"" which brings me to the most interesting part of this game: The Crystal. Yes you will lose if all your heroes die, but you also will lose if you run out of dust when enemies attack your crystal. The blend of roguelike and tower defense is prestine and I reccomend this game not only to people who are fans of one or both of the genres, but also to people unexposed to amazing roguelikes or amazing tower defenses.

												This game is ridiculously hard -- probably mostly because I'm too manly to play on the recommended ""Too Easy"" setting.  So, so, so so hard.  As a roguelike tower-defense game, it's a resounding success.Amplitude has put the same care and ability into this game as they have in both Endless Space and Endless Legend -- games I also recommend for their streamlined, engaging 4X glory.  I'm not here to talk about them, though.Dungeons of the Endless is fun.  Until it wrecks your face.  At which point -- for me -- the pain of defeat is assuaged by the promise of another dungeon dive.To be forthright, there are some issues with the game.  I commonly experience what I assume is a bug with purchasing items from merchants, and with swapping items amongst my heroes.  I don't know if there's a gameplay element I'm missing -- because as far as I can tell, there's no documentation for the game, which is frustrating -- or if it's, as I'm guessing, some faulty programming.  It's not anything bad enough to preclude me from recommending the game.In closing, I'm looking forward to where this new hybrid genre hopefully leads.  There are hints of real brilliance not quite realized by this outing -- more focus on establishing safe-routes and requiring their use during escape; emergency one-off Dust powers for the ridiculous unbeatable hordes which have spelled my doom pretty much every playthrough; perhaps some micro-tactics control to allow for more intelligent defenses than the current auto-targeting system allows; it'll be interesting to see.To encourage Amplitude to explore their options further:  buy the game!  You'll like it, if you know what's good for you.  Even when it's tearing your face off.			"

												A fantastic blend of real-time and turn-based strategy, roguelike difficulty and randomization, resource management, and beautiful pixel art, Dungeon of the Endless is by far one of the best games I have ever played - lumped together in my top 3 with Risk of Rain and Magicka.It brings together the best aspects of several genres while being sarcastic, intelligent, funny, and downright unforgiving.  It takes itself seriously while still allowing room to make fun of both the player and itself, and the game is riddled with tongue-in-cheek references and jokes that will make you chuckle and grin.The characters are unique, interesting, and have very well thought-out interactions, hinting at a deeper story than at first glance.  The variety of game modes keeps the action interesting - even though replaying the default game mode never gets boring - and the vast array of characters leaves many opportunities to discover new character stories, new favorite combinations, and new gameplay in general.  Each and every aspect of the game is designed in a way that makes it fun to play, and that same intelligent design guarantees a decision is not without consequences or some sort of risk-reward tradeoff.And, with the improvements and alterations to multiplatyer mode, it's more than a blast to have fun with, yell at, and weep with your friends.PROS--Beautiful visuals: pixel art was a perfect choice to convey the game, and anything else would be an injustice--Great character design: each one feels unique and special, and each one has his/her/its own unique niche in the gameplay--Varied gameplay: even with the same characters, no two playthroughs will ever be the same--Great story: even though it's not a plain-and-simple spelled-out story, it's told in such a way that lets the adventurous player discover the story that is artfully placed throughout--Responsive and responsible Dev Team: there is a ton of interaction with the community, and it's underappreciated in general how important it is to be able to give feedback to the devs - they take everything in stride and when bugs are brought to the surface, the dev team squashes the problems--Fantastic multiplayer experience: not having to futz with a third-party program to hook up the multiplayer, having quick and responsive connections, and allowing everything necessary for a smooth experience really pays off in the fun department--Fun: plain and simple, it's enjoyable--Unforgiving: if you mess up in this game, you have a one-in-ten chance of recovering from your blunder, and that's good - any mistake deserves to be a fatal oneCONS--Difficult to learn: now, that's not to say it isn't easy to pick-up-and-play, it's to say that some people who aren't a fan of the genre or who aren't that good at strategy games will have a difficult time getting a grasp on this game; it's unforgiving and cruel--Strange controls: granted, you can change literally every single thing in the game to a different hotkey, but that doesn't mean that the base controls are easy to get a hang of - they're simple, but simple isn't always good--No controller support: granted, again, that you can find ways around that and that there are technical limitations, creative players have discovered ways to make it work - I think the devs should make it an option that is built-inOVERALL RATING9/10 - BUY THIS GAMEWhile the game is one of the most wonderful things I have ever played, it is not without its flaws.  Sometimes, the mouse controls can be a little painful and having too high of a sensitivity will often-times kill you.  The multiplayer chat doesn't have any quick-chat commands, and new players often times have a lot of difficulty figuring out the UI (in my experience).  Everything you would need IS there, but sometimes it's a little hard to figure out just what it is you need.  The inability to repair Artifacts/Research Stations is a real hindrance and very annoying, but it's intelligent design and addds to the challenge - regardless, the only character in the game who can repair them is only available for unlock three days out of the year, and that should change.

												I'll keep it short and sweet: this game is fun as hell.  I've seen some other reviews wishing the graphics were better, I can't agree.  I'm a guy who loves cutting edge graphics, realism, etc, but the graphics in this game are done purposefully and really well.  I really wouldn't think I'd like a game that looks so ""old school,"" but it's really the majority of the charm.  What makes a game worth buying to me is the replayability.  This game has it imo.  I'm having fun just going for the achievement, and Steam achievements are not something I ever care about.  For the price you can't beat it.  Side Note: I've always been a civ fan, but Endless Legend is better than civ imo.			"

Dungeon of the Endless is a fun, hero based tower defense game. Each character has a distinctive look and entertaining backstory, the pixel art is great, the soundtrack is memorable, and the in-game lore is intriguing. Very fun to play with friends, as it removes the need to pause the game and order all the characters around. The only downside to multiplayer is that it removes character dialogue, which is often humorous and/or reveals more about the situation. If they were able to fix that, this would probably be one of my favorite games on Steam.If you're looking for a good tower defense game, this is a great choice. With procedural generation and a big cast of characters, it takes a while for it to become boring. Definitely a go to game for my group of friends.			"

												Is this game worth it? I believe it is. Dungeon of the Endless is the perfect inbreed offspring between some aspects from a rougelike and a tower defense.  It is also challenging and every character is unique in their own way.  Your only goals while playing are to unlock characters and conquer the dungeon. Play it solo or with friends because I believe it is a game that is fun while playing solo and multiplayer.  The updates to the game are also nice and allow you to play as even more characters like Kreyang or some of the TF2 characters. You can get a lot of enjoyment and fulfilment while playing.  It is worth the price for what you get out of this game.  It also ties in pretty well to the other Endless games. I rate this a 9/10 because of some issues while playing			"

												This game is ridiculously hard -- probably mostly because I'm too manly to play on the recommended ""Too Easy"" setting.  So, so, so so hard.  As a roguelike tower-defense game, it's a resounding success.Amplitude has put the same care and ability into this game as they have in both Endless Space and Endless Legend -- games I also recommend for their streamlined, engaging 4X glory.  I'm not here to talk about them, though.Dungeons of the Endless is fun.  Until it wrecks your face.  At which point -- for me -- the pain of defeat is assuaged by the promise of another dungeon dive.To be forthright, there are some issues with the game.  I commonly experience what I assume is a bug with purchasing items from merchants, and with swapping items amongst my heroes.  I don't know if there's a gameplay element I'm missing -- because as far as I can tell, there's no documentation for the game, which is frustrating -- or if it's, as I'm guessing, some faulty programming.  It's not anything bad enough to preclude me from recommending the game.In closing, I'm looking forward to where this new hybrid genre hopefully leads.  There are hints of real brilliance not quite realized by this outing -- more focus on establishing safe-routes and requiring their use during escape; emergency one-off Dust powers for the ridiculous unbeatable hordes which have spelled my doom pretty much every playthrough; perhaps some micro-tactics control to allow for more intelligent defenses than the current auto-targeting system allows; it'll be interesting to see.To encourage Amplitude to explore their options further:  buy the game!  You'll like it, if you know what's good for you.  Even when it's tearing your face off.			"

BUT MAN O MAN - when you see that glorious end-game screen after the epic last level you realise; ""PFFFTTT I would easily buy this game for $15 that♥♥♥♥♥♥was EPIC""The only problem I'd really see with this game is it's repetitiveness when going through each floor - but that's kind of dumb because after all, it is; an Endless Dungeon.TL;DR - Game is Epic as ♥♥♥♥ to play w/friends.

												I really want to like this game. However, there are a few problems with multiplayer that are really hurting this amazing game. The main problem I see is, nobody in multiplayer seems to want to help new players. They'd rather ignore/ridicule them, as I've seen happen to multiple players on multiple occasions. I know this is a community issue, and not an issue with the game, which is why I'm still giving the game a positive review. However, it is important enough to be noted. The second issue is that once a player decides to leave, for whatever reason, even if their character is not dead they cannot return to the match, and their resources are lost. The ability to transfer items to other players would also be nice. Now for the good  things about this game... The gameplay is flawless on single player, requiring planning, quick thinking, and strategy to progress. But don't think that this creates a huge learning curve; after around a half hour of gameplay you should have the basics down and be enjoying yourself immensely. But don't expect it to get easy, because mastering the game is a totally different ballgame. Instead, expect to spend hours and hours learning from your mistakes, and dying from them as well, but always having fun with what is just a truly great game.			"

												FTL Rouge like and with a few twists, basically its a wierd tower defence game where u need to drag the crystal to the last room, when you find it.. only that when you do all hell goes loose, Build towers and get resources and defend them with building buffs, find treasures,Vendors,heros along the way as you play recruit or ignore, Spend or dont spend, alot of choices.. Personally i can recommend this game because i loved FTL and this game is like that short, however i dont find the same urge to play this 30 times in a row i did with FTL.. Guess its lacking something i dont know... Well worth the 12 Euros? Depends if your a fan of short games then this is for you, what will you upgrade and how will you survive or die? well its a must have for any rouge player.			"

												This game is quite an amazing thing, what else can I say? When I first got the game I really had no idea what I was doing until I started playing with one of my buddies. Before you read this review let me tell you, this game is a hundred times better with friends, its a very relaxing and fun game to play especially late at night. I love this game so much and it never gets boring. I'm going to keep this review short so, the pros to this game: music, mechanics, gameplay, everything. Its a beautiful game where you fight your way through floors to reach the exit, there are many different modes and playstyles based on the character you pick and the pod you pick. You won't necessarily escape on your first run, you may fail a few times, but in the end it really is worth it. It feels wonderful to complete the game and the next day you will want to play through it again. I highly recommend this to anyone who is up for having fun with their friends and is ready to go on a great journey and work hard to get there. Cheers.			"

Each and every aspect of the game is designed in a way that makes it fun to play, and that same intelligent design guarantees a decision is not without consequences or some sort of risk-reward tradeoff.And, with the improvements and alterations to multiplatyer mode, it's more than a blast to have fun with, yell at, and weep with your friends.PROS--Beautiful visuals: pixel art was a perfect choice to convey the game, and anything else would be an injustice--Great character design: each one feels unique and special, and each one has his/her/its own unique niche in the gameplay--Varied gameplay: even with the same characters, no two playthroughs will ever be the same--Great story: even though it's not a plain-and-simple spelled-out story, it's told in such a way that lets the adventurous player discover the story that is artfully placed throughout--Responsive and responsible Dev Team: there is a ton of interaction with the community, and it's underappreciated in general how important it is to be able to give feedback to the devs - they take everything in stride and when bugs are brought to the surface, the dev team squashes the problems--Fantastic multiplayer experience: not having to futz with a third-party program to hook up the multiplayer, having quick and responsive connections, and allowing everything necessary for a smooth experience really pays off in the fun department--Fun: plain and simple, it's enjoyable--Unforgiving: if you mess up in this game, you have a one-in-ten chance of recovering from your blunder, and that's good - any mistake deserves to be a fatal oneCONS--Difficult to learn: now, that's not to say it isn't easy to pick-up-and-play, it's to say that some people who aren't a fan of the genre or who aren't that good at strategy games will have a difficult time getting a grasp on this game; it's unforgiving and cruel--Strange controls: granted, you can change literally every single thing in the game to a different hotkey, but that doesn't mean that the base controls are easy to get a hang of - they're simple, but simple isn't always good--No controller support: granted, again, that you can find ways around that and that there are technical limitations, creative players have discovered ways to make it work - I think the devs should make it an option that is built-inOVERALL RATING9/10 - BUY THIS GAMEWhile the game is one of the most wonderful things I have ever played, it is not without its flaws.  Sometimes, the mouse controls can be a little painful and having too high of a sensitivity will often-times kill you.  The multiplayer chat doesn't have any quick-chat commands, and new players often times have a lot of difficulty figuring out the UI (in my experience).  Everything you would need IS there, but sometimes it's a little hard to figure out just what it is you need.  The inability to repair Artifacts/Research Stations is a real hindrance and very annoying, but it's intelligent design and addds to the challenge - regardless, the only character in the game who can repair them is only available for unlock three days out of the year, and that should change.

												I'll keep it short and sweet: this game is fun as hell.  I've seen some other reviews wishing the graphics were better, I can't agree.  I'm a guy who loves cutting edge graphics, realism, etc, but the graphics in this game are done purposefully and really well.  I really wouldn't think I'd like a game that looks so ""old school,"" but it's really the majority of the charm.  What makes a game worth buying to me is the replayability.  This game has it imo.  I'm having fun just going for the achievement, and Steam achievements are not something I ever care about.  For the price you can't beat it.  Side Note: I've always been a civ fan, but Endless Legend is better than civ imo.			"

												An interesting blending of genres and mechanics, Dungeons integrates perma-death, tower defence and rpg elements in a compelling and charming game.Though it is made up of parts done more extensively elsewhere, the whole is fresh and entertaining.As its a Rouge-Like you may be concerned that it will be too difficult to enjoy.  Don't.  The many difficulty settings mean that it will cater to all, from casual to not-quite-hardcore-enough-to-be-a-hipster. (You know who I mean, the ones that go onto a forums specificly to complain a game isn't hard enough and that everything has gotten easier since the 80's. Etc.  You know who you are.)It's fun, accessable and stands up to being played for quick blasts or for the long haul.  Grab it and you shouldn't be dissapointed.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon of the Endless is a pretty fantastic game. It is a mash up of many different genres all of which I love. Its mainly rogue-like, with permadeath and randomized dungeons. The other 2 main genres are Turned Based Strategy and Tower Defense, it also does have a splash of RPG-like character and item customization. With unlockables for your next playthroughs and a fair amount of randomization it offers quite a bit of replayability.I highly recommend this game. I bought it at 25% off which brought it to just under $10 and have enjoyed it quite a bit.			"

												Say hello to your brain again.Forget Civilisation, StarCraft or Total War. This is the Strategy game you want.I eat Rogue like games for breakfast. I loaded this one up and died, died and died again. I was still on the first floor.39 hours later I am one of 0.7% of people that has completed the Sanitary Pod ship. It can get quite addictive.ABOUT THE GAMEYour spaceship crashes on a planet and you begin with two characters either chosen or randomised. Your job is to escape and you do this by managing resources, shopping and building your party.There is a tower defence element where you build modules that give you extra food, slow down monsters, poison them, heal your party and a hundred other things in between.Doors. You won't ever look at them in the same way again. Every time you open a door in the dungeon ALL HELL CAN BREAK LOOSE.CRY HAVOC. MANIC. The game can't respond quick enough to your commands and you ponder afterwards if ever a game needed a telepathic link this is it.The Sanitary Pod is described as thus: Hard, cannot pause, stronger monsters, more unfavourable events, resources less common, healing much harder.Ten fails later I can't believe anyone can do it. This time I am halfway through the levels and have a full party. I have concentrated heavily on industry to the detriment of science and food. My party are mostly fighters and none can fix my modules if they have been damaged by monsters. I sacrifice the worst fighter to recruit an engineer type.The door bell rings and I discover hitting ""Escape"" does not pause the game. RING RING. CRAP. I run like a maniac to the door and run back. I lost the engineer. Later on in my mad rush to the elevator I forget to move all my party there and lose another character. Two characters left, two floors to go. I have concentrated heavily on building generators as monsters only spawn in the dark. My party is underlevelled and won't be able to heal much if attacked. On the final floor my rag tag dying of food party need LUCK OF THE DEVIL. Will I ever find the exit before I am overwhelmed. Left or right, North or South.Hallelujah brother! - I am one of the 0.7%.The game is hideously complex. Remarkable. Don't dismiss it's basic graphics. Don't think you have seen it all once you complete a dungeon. Do push yourself. No bugs.Man up - what are you scared off?			"

												Good ""Dungeon Crawler"" Roguelike. Or Roguelite? But that would mean there would be progression outside of the main game, which there isn't, unless you argue that additional characters and starting conditions (Pods) can be unlocked. For a character you have to encounter him or her in the game and have him or her survive for at least 3 floors. Pods on the other hand can be unlocked by either winning a game with another Pod or by doing some really annoying achievements (do not pause the game ever or reach level 24 in endless mode, research every module (level 1)...of which there are 26 I think...that can be a miss or a hit...and lastly: don't let your core get damaged). Of course you have to win those games...the research is ""more or less"" predictable, but I've still needed to invest heavily into research instead of food and industry (I didn't build a single industry module I think), which meant that my characters were woefully underpowered and I had to reset research many times or research stuff I didn't ever use just to unlock that Pod...it's ok if this is an achievement, but barring players from playing certain modes by such abominable achievements is just evil. I have yet to master the no damage one. It just takes 1 hit to start all over...and starting all over can mean up to several HOURS of playtime ""wasted"".What is this game even? It's a pixel art survival game in which you open doors (those count as turns) and power rooms with the resource Dust. Each room costs 10 Dust and you get that through events, opening doors and killing enemies. Enemies may or may not spawn in any room that is unpowered. In every powered room with a major module slot you can build either research, industry or food. Research is for researching new modules obviously, which can be done if you find the reserach crystal (and protect it from destruction for three turns). You always have 4 randomly chosen items available. Food is for healing and leveling up your heroes and industry is for building modules. There are also shops that sell items for any of the 4 resources (random). Items are pretty darn important.The goal of the game is to find the exit on 12 floors, which can either take a few minutes or up to half an hour, as it is, you guessed it, randomly generated. While searching for the exit you will have to contend with the various monsters on the floor that will inevitably spawn. 1 or 2 rooms are usually no problem for your up to 4 heroes, but the nature of the game is such that you will pretty much always have several rooms unpowered. The more doors you have opened and the higher the floor number is the harder the enemies hit (and new types of enemies spawn, for example ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aoe golems that only target your modules or kill off your reasearch node to almost make you not complete the damned achievement on floor 12...). The mobs that head straight for your core are the most dangerous ones to you. Anything else will attack your heroes and those can be healed. Every time your core takes damage, however, you LOSE dust, meaning the next door to open might get even harder, since you can't power another room or even have one more room now unpowered, since you need 10 dust for each room...it's a snowballing mechanic, against you.The game still is addictive and fun, but harsh. It has 2 difficulty settings: too easy and easy. Too easy is ""hard"" and easy is ""hardcore"". They're just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've yet to beat the game on ""easy"", but I'm also no expert in this...However, I also don't feel the need to become one, since the game doesn't offer all THAT much replayability in my opinion. Once you have unlocked everything what's there to do? It can also be played in up to 4 player MP, which is kinda fun.			"

												One of the best newretro wave games, and among the best games I played in the past 20 years. It is an easy to learn, hard to master rougelike, tower defense, RPG, team manager, diablo-type, real time AND turn based action-strategy game. You are in a crashlanded escape pod with 2 team members (expandable to 4) with a randomly generated dungeon level enviroment around you, where you have to find the exit and carry your energy source from the starting room there, to elevate a level until you reach the surface and win the game. Each new room is a mystery, each new room has a different tower defense layout, riches or terrors, a new path to find salvation and resources or a new source of darkness that lays waste on your team in the form of various monsters. And when you finally find the exit, prepare to move the energy source there to make the elevator working, and you dare to remove the source from it's previous position... hell is unleashed, endless waves of enemies try to slaughter you until you reach the elevator in a desperate run.The graphics is a perfect mid of pixelart retro and modern effects (such as heat distorsion, explosions, smoke, dynamic lighting/shadows) with a clean, informative and fun interface full of humourous and vital information well separated. The music, the dark, yet fun and arcade-ish atmosphere immedately hooks you in and the extremely well polished, nowhere else to be found gameplay won't let you leave for hours. Then the first wipe happens on a high level. All your upgrades, levels, team members, team composition (!), exploration, EVERYTHING is gone and you start from absolute zero (heroes can be unlocked to use later discovered heroes on start tho). And it feels bad. Until you start again, wipe again, and actually WANT to start again over and over until you succeed. That's gonna be a half-dozen or a dozen tries, and you will succed on very, very easy difficulty. Not gonna lie, the game kind of dies a little or more after that first completition. But it is a game to be replayed from start over and over, and every time it succeeds to provide new experience, new surprises, and keep up the pressure, excitement and curiousity with the question: What is behind the next door?

												Games can teach us many things. This game, teaches us that if we’re ever marooned on an alien planet after our space-ship crash-lands there, you should definitely go open every door you can find. It might kill you, since there are obviously aliens behind the doors that want to eat you. But if you don’t open doors, you can’t progress. Deep right? Doors of the Endless is a great game, with a very refined core concept it loops through. You use your rag-tag band of heroes (up to four) to open doors and reveal rooms. If there are bad things in the room, the heros will automatically engage and fight. You can assist by healing them or triggering their special skills, which get better as you level them up. Each time you open a door, you gain resources - making the act of opening a portcullis much like taking a turn in a strategy game. The amount of resources you gain is determined by what generators you’ve built  in the rooms that can support them. There are three: Industry lets you build turrets and more generators, Science lets you research upgrades, while Food lets you heal and level your heroes. As you reveal rooms, you also gain Power which lets you power rooms, toggling them on and off as you see fit. A room without power is dark, turrets built there won’t work, and worse of all: aliens might spawn there the next time you open a door. Once you’ve found the exit, you need to go back to your ship, pick up the power core, and escort it to the exit. Aliens will spawn non-stop until you either escape, or die. If you make it, you go up to a new randomly-generated floor, things get harder, but you might uncover new things like heroes that unlock for the next time you play.Like Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, Binding of Isaac and other games in this style, the main draw of Dungeon of the Endless is to play the game enough until you discover little tricks and techniques that are reliable. Then using those techniques, you get further in, unlock more content, and push on until you hit your limit (or the random-generator just decides to screw you over with a no-win situation, which is always possible). There’s great fun in using a game as a game, and Dungeon of the Endless has plenty of game with which to play.			"

												==Forewarning: The developers of Dungeon of the Endless have been bought out by SEGA, this means that this game is likely going to see no more support, and no sequel. Keep this in mind when purchasing.==An interesting mix of RTS and other genres, Dungeon of the Endless is a rewarding, but frustrating experience. [Summary at bottom.]You control 1~4 Survivors, from a small unlockable cast, and fight your way up 15 floors of randomly generated layouts. To complete this you can power individual rooms and build modules to harvest resources and fight the hordes of monsters, level up your Survivors to gain static benefits, and scavenge or purchase equipment and research. Each floor is started by your Crystal, which must be defended, and then escorted to the exit, which must be found.The game is privy to an enormous amount of RNG; the only static things are the characters themselves, the 15 floors, and whatever modifiers you selected (through unlockable escape pods gained through various criteria) when you started this run. Everything else is steeped in uncertainty; from the monsters that will spawn on a given floor and from which unpowered rooms, to where and what kinds of rooms spawn and what lays within, to the presence of item chests and shopkeepers, as well as if and where Research Artifacts appear and what research is randomly avaliable, as well as floor layouts themselves (down to individual room sizes and module slots, and if theyre occupied) and finally the location of the exit of the floor, the goal of any given floor.Learning to mitigate this RNG is critical to playing the game, moreso than any amount of game knowledge or unlockables can change; though at the end of the day you are completely at the game's mercy for the better part of any run; I've had more than a few runs end on the first floor or drag for floors on end without a single item. The game, in the vein of so many bad roguelikes and -lites, forgets the cardinal rule of random generation and gameplay: The ability to give the player mitigation. Players can only do so much in any given situation; and the game will punish you to a cruel extent if you aren't prepared in the specific way it demands from you. The game itself is very fun, it has excellent sound design and though the pixelated artstyle isn't for everyone, it's good enough (I'm personally not a fan of the portraits, at all); and the cast and world of the Endless franchise is varied and interesting; some characters even have unique interactions if they survive together.The gameplay is very hands-off, you only order the opening of doors, interaction of NPCs, and the destined room for a character; in addition to the building mechanic that compliments your Survivors. Combat especially is very non-player driven, there is no way to change the targets that a Survivor will prioritize, you only control their location, equipment, resource-based healing, and their 0~2 Active abilities, which have a lengthy cooldown and can only be used so many times per floor. For the most part, the player is left feeling very helpless as turns play out and choices are made, and hoping that everything just works out.What makes this lack of control very important, is the degree at which the game punishes you for failure. There is little to no margin for mistakes in Dungeon of the Endless; if you do not immediately react to a situation and are not absolutely spot-on with healing and buildings, you will fail; and the effects of failure range from losing modules in combat, to the deaths of Survivors, to damage to your Crystal (which loses its distinct resource, used for powering rooms). Failure in Dungeon of the Endless comes fast and easily, and you have to be very familiar with the game to know what you can do about it, and any failure at all quickly snowballs into a lost run.The game is mired in numerous small issues that gradually add up over the course of playing; things like being unable to pick the specific route of a moving survivor, the inability to use Active Abilities if you have more than one Survivor selected, survivors being unable to attack enemies moving between rooms, and the numerous issues in multiplayer (cannot pause, items often go to the wrong inventory, loading the game or changing control of a Survivor resets their 'floors survived' to unlock them, etc) are just a small, but noticable sample of frustrating details; that when added to the random nature of the game can turn a fun experience with friends into a shouting match in seconds.SUMMARYDungeon of the Endless is a fun game, but it certainly isn't for everyone. The mix of genres and mechanics is interesting, but at the end of the day very unrefined and frustrating. The game is heavy on RNG, and doesn't give you many ways to deal with or mitigate it, and very little control in general; but 'most' games can be won. Expect to have a wiki open when new to the game.If you're interested in the game; do your own research and really make sure it's the kind of game you can get into, otherwise you're going to be bitter about your purchase and everyone you were playing with.

								First of guys and girls this is an Alpha build so theres a lot more goodies to be added in the future and I would like to add I suck at most games :)I have to say for the 20 odd minutes I played this game there is a lot of fun to be had and I'm really looking forward to future updates. Theres a little learning curve (Or maybe It was just me being rubbish) but what I played was fun and intresting. Adding both dungeon crawler (Rouge-Like) and tower defence gameplay seems like a good idea and works well enough. I can't make an In-depth review (Since It's still in Alpha) but what I've seen and played I can see promise and would recommend especially since it's 25% off right now and the game is just going to get better and bigger.You can watch me play Dungeon of the Endless here

Then using those techniques, you get further in, unlock more content, and push on until you hit your limit (or the random-generator just decides to screw you over with a no-win situation, which is always possible). There’s great fun in using a game as a game, and Dungeon of the Endless has plenty of game with which to play.			"

												Usually, I start my reviews with a small paragraph to explain what type of game I’m reviewing. ‘Dungeon of the Endless’, or DotE for short, is an exception to that rule because while it is a strategy, tower defence and roguelike, and it’s rightfully tagged as such, it’s far more than that. It combines the above elements and the outcome simply cannot be defined by any of them. After quite some time into the game, I consider DotE mainly as a survival game, with features from the genres mentioned above. The reason is simple, your objective when you start a new game is to manage to get your group through various floors and survive until you reach the surface.The story is simple enough, the ship you are in, a prison hulk, is sent to colonise an unexplored planet, Auriga Prime. The only known facts about the planet are, that it was used by an ancient space-traveling race, called the Endless, and that there are resources and habitable environment. While the prison hulk arrived, long forgotten defence systems activated and destroyed it. The ships emergency protocols went into effect and shot all escape pods to the planet. The trick was most ship modules could also function as escape pods as well.When you begin a new game you choose the pod you’ll start the game in, the heroes you’ll start your accent and between 2 difficulty settings, too easy and easy. The pod determines the accents bonuses or handicaps, and given that the prison ship modules were used as escape pods, there is a good variety in them. You choose, depending on the pod, 1-4 heroes from the available list and as far as the 2 difficulties, they are certainly not what they are named, however, they are named in relation to the other so you’ll know which one is harder, prepare to fail a lot as the game is hard!After you are done with you selection and start your attempt to accent, you’ll find the selected heroes in the pod with the pod's power source and the door out of the pod. Your goal is to have at least one hero reach the exit while protecting your power source. Now, before we open that door there are some stuff I must explain first. You have 4 types of resources, industry, science, food and dust. By default, you gain some of the first 3 every time you open a door, while dust, being special, can only be found, looted or created under special conditions. Upon opening the door, a turn is complete and the new room is revealed. The new room can vary in many ways, from if it’ll have enemies, a vendor, an event or even nothing at all. Each room will have some buildable slots in it, usually a big one and few small ones. The big one is used for primary modules, most common are resource production ones that increase your gains upon completing a turn, while the smaller ones can be used for a wide variety of either defensive or utility modules, this is the ‘tower defence’ part of DotE. In order to build anything you’ll need industry points, to research new modules you’ll need science points and finally, food is used to hire, level up or heal your heroes. Upon securing the new room, you’ll be able to spend dust in order to power it, once powered you can build modules in it, however, some rules still apply, to power up a room, it must be adjacent to your power source or a room already powered by your power source. The strategy or tactical part of the game comes now, as you make decisions on whether you’ll power a room and what you’ll build in it, or, generally, how you’ll spend your hard earned limited resources. By choosing to leave a room unpowered it becomes a potential spawn for monsters whenever you start a new turn. A great feature of the game is that there is a map screen, where you can see the entire floor and give numerous orders to your heroes, however, the only real negative to this, is that you cannot open a door from this screen.The heroes follow some RPG rules, by having stats to show their effectiveness in each area and have item slots to equip items that can be found in the dungeon. Additionally, each hero has active and passive skills, with new ones being unlocked and existing ones upgraded upon levelling him up. Heroes also have special interactions for you to find about, either hatred or friendship, you’ll have to try many different group combinations and see how they interact with each other after each floor. The monsters, on the other hand, are quite variable and each feels unique towards its role, from swarming to buff or debuff ones, they even have different targeting priorities that you’ll have to find out and act accordingly. Each is easily recognisable from its model and you can pause any time to see what you’re up against.The visuals speak for themselves, while pixelated, each aspect is quite clear to see as heroes, enemies, animations and even effects have their unique model. The music while not that special by itself, does amplify the gameplay mostly because it has a bit-y theme and changes depending on whether you are in combat or not. As a side note, every version of the game has the soundtrack available in the game folder!Overall the game is a roguelike, meaning each run will be unique as each floor is procedurally generated. There are few roguelite elements that consist of unlocking new heroes to choose from and starting pods. On the negatives is that the tutorial is poor on purpose, it leaves many game features for you to find out, either by succeeding or not. It offers great replayability and time travel, as you’ll wonder how fast the time passes while you play DotE and opening ‘just one more’ door! While it’s really unique towards what it offers it’s really hard to give an objective score as there are little points that DotE can be related to other games, that being said for me it’s easily a 9/10 as it’s worth every cent/penny you spent on it, it will keep you busy for a long time and with each run being unique it has something to offer!  I believe that if you like titles like ‘Faster than Light’ you will find great enjoyment here too!-----------------------------------Introducing Gamephasiswww.gamephasis.com is a new gaming website featuring a talented team of game writers from around the world.

												DotE is an interesting combination of turn-base and tower defense. No two games are the same as each floors are randomly generated. It's a very challenging game and I have rarely beat it (on easy) in comparison to the amount of my failures. Yea, this game kicked my butt hard.What I do find intersting is the depth of each character. What is amazing is that some of the characters have intertwined back story and will interact.I don't recommend it to most people but for those that like a challenge, this game might be for you.			"

												I could tell you that this game was good and you should buy it, but I won't, instead I will tell you the sotry of me and my buddies trying to survive. So we play on too easy because easy mode is too hard and we go up the first 6 or 7 floors without a hitch. My frined then gets a boost that makes his character go super sonic, I then play the sonic x opening,  we start crying laughing. We then clear out an entire dungeon and come across a merchant who gives you dust for selling stuff, we get enough to light up the entire dungeon except one room. I have the brilliant idea to hang out in that room when we move the crystal to escape. Nothing happens, no monsters spawn and only the creepy music plays. We all go off and do our own thing ir for about 5 minutes and come back. Still nothing happens. I walk back to the elevator and monsters start spawning and I got a line of monsters chasing me. I get to the elevator and escape. We then proceed to explore the next floor, get hopelessly outnumbered, find a boss, run out of food, and die.10/10 would make frineds cry laughing again			"

Early Access Review
								An interesting mix of Roguelike and Tower Defense. Require both Luck and Strategy but since it's different each time you have to think. Will you use all of your heroes together to defeat the monsters faster or will you place them in different room to make sure that no enemies slip by to the crystal?At the time of this review, it's still early Alpha so there's only three levels but the challenge seems to be well balanced. I lost my first four games on the first level before really knowing how the game works and develop my strategy. After that it took me about 90 minutes to finish the three levels included.Luck is also involved since finding the best rooms for defence near the crystal helps while finding new blueprint for stronger defense is pretty helpful too while not required if instead you find good items for your heroes.Graphics are pretty stylish with kind of an old-school feeling (in my opinion.) and get you in the mood. Honestly did not notice the music and sound that much but probably because I was too much into the game. (Those 120 minutes flew by real fast.)Found no glitch so far and with the coming additions to the game it could be well worth it's price.			"

Early Access Review
								First of guys and girls this is an Alpha build so theres a lot more goodies to be added in the future and I would like to add I suck at most games :)I have to say for the 20 odd minutes I played this game there is a lot of fun to be had and I'm really looking forward to future updates. Theres a little learning curve (Or maybe It was just me being rubbish) but what I played was fun and intresting. Adding both dungeon crawler (Rouge-Like) and tower defence gameplay seems like a good idea and works well enough. I can't make an In-depth review (Since It's still in Alpha) but what I've seen and played I can see promise and would recommend especially since it's 25% off right now and the game is just going to get better and bigger.You can watch me play Dungeon of the Endless here

												This game is full of exciting features.Though multiplayer is still flawed (getting network timeouts and not being able to reconnect/continue the session), along with a few interface titbits that would make the game more practical, it's a blast. It would be a great boon to be able to see the resources of your teammates. Furthermore being able to trade not just resources, but also equipment (without having to sell them to shops and rebuying them for higher prices) would add to the ongoing fluidity of the game.The amount of genres (roguelike, tower defence, management) combined make for a wonderfully fresh experience.

Early Access Review
								This is fun, a turn based strategy game that doesnt get too convoluted, and keeps a fast pace for fun.  The pixel graphics are really top notch.I don't suggest playing on 'Too Easy'.  It really makes it pretty boring and you often have an overabundance of some resources.  I played on 'Easy' which is really the normal mode, and i couldnt get past the second floor until i had made about a half dozen runs.  But thats how you find the mechanics and figure out what your doing wrong.  After you figure it out, it quickly becomes a series of best/worst scenarios.  Tough choices and some easy ones.  And sometimes its the simplest strategies, no more complicated than a game of tic tac toe.  But it is great fun, and i am only guessing that at higher difficulty levels, when available, the choices will be magnificently tougher, and the consequences far more dire.I really can't do justice to what this game actually is, except. . . the video is very very accurate.  Its an everything-like.  I am now curious to try pure runs.  Where you just focus on Character, or maybe tower defense.			"

Early Access Review
								This is fun, a turn based strategy game that doesnt get too convoluted, and keeps a fast pace for fun.  The pixel graphics are really top notch.I don't suggest playing on 'Too Easy'.  It really makes it pretty boring and you often have an overabundance of some resources.  I played on 'Easy' which is really the normal mode, and i couldnt get past the second floor until i had made about a half dozen runs.  But thats how you find the mechanics and figure out what your doing wrong.  After you figure it out, it quickly becomes a series of best/worst scenarios.  Tough choices and some easy ones.  And sometimes its the simplest strategies, no more complicated than a game of tic tac toe.  But it is great fun, and i am only guessing that at higher difficulty levels, when available, the choices will be magnificently tougher, and the consequences far more dire.I really can't do justice to what this game actually is, except. . . the video is very very accurate.  Its an everything-like.  I am now curious to try pure runs.  Where you just focus on Character, or maybe tower defense.			"

												The game is a brilliant mesh of rogue-light and tower defence.Deeper levels can be moderately to immensely challenging.Character customization is open enough to be interesting, but isn't too in depth to make it tedious, or a chore to manage.Multiplayer still has a few bumps that need to be ironed out, but the single player is stellar.

												This game is trash. The concept and game play are fantastic, but unfortunately there are more glitches than actual game play. After playing, I have experienced numerous glitches. Almost 75% of games played had major glitches. The many annoying glitches are as follows.On multiplayer: Items often duplicate or disappear when trading.Constant disconnects.Single Player:Save files corrupt constantly.Heroes die randomly with no enemies around. (happened once)Often times, icons displaying statuses wont appear (like the gear for operate skill).Nodes that are fully lit, and should allow placement, sometimes get glitched so placement is impossible.If the game closes at any time, EVER, expect to lose progress because of the developers stupid save-scumming prevention. Even last autosave gets lost.Above all, the absolute worst part of this game is its saving mechanism. Too often, the game will not detect saves that are present. It will simply ignore them. The developer tried too hard to prevent save-scumming and, in the process, botched it up. It is very frustrating to have a great run and press the save and quit button, only to come back later and find no save. Sometimes after reinstalling the game it will magically reappear and sometimes not. Until the developer can fix the saving mechanism of the game so that it can be quit and actually save progress, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												This game is effin hard and I'm just playing on easy. Just when I thought I had ""easy"" down, some a-hole monster opens the door by himself, spawning zergs from all directions, while I was buying equipment. My strongest team yet was mowed down in seconds. I had no idea what hit me, thought it was a game bug until I googled what happened.Imagine playing witcher with no saves and some special monster spawns and kills you while your in the middle of leveling Geralt. Clearly these devs are a-holes who have no respect for standard gaming conventions.The game is fun, novel, addicting and very challenging. My biggest issue is the huge swings in each level's difficulties. Your team's life is dependent on the whims of the level generator. Depending on how many rooms you can ""power up"" and how they branch out from the crystal room, any given level can go from a cake walk to extremely difficult. A ""low dust"" level with 3+ deep branches connecting to crystal room directly is going to be very difficult to complete. Only one deep branch connecting to the crystal room will make the level very easy, even with powerful spawns.I'd recommend this for hardcore gamers only.-----------Update-----------After failing 6 times on the ""easy"" difficulty, I caved and started a play through on ""too easy"". Lo and behold I finished the game a few hours later. There is only ""too easy"" and ""easy"" difficulties in the game right now. Hate to find out what the ""normal"" difficulty will look like if they ever release it.Before you start the game, read how to unlock each ""locked"" pods. Some pods require you to complete the game + do all the tech research or unlocking all the doors or level a character to the max or things along those lines. Starting a game with a different pod causes the game to mechanics to change, and they all seem relatively easy to unlock in ""too easy"" play through.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a mix of exploration, ressource management and tower defense with RPG elements. You chose two characters which have crashed into this underground complex, and have to get to the surface by finding an exit on each floor. Each floor needs to be explored, essential rooms powered and defended against creatures. Once the floor exit is found, one of your team has to carry the crystal to the exit (slowing him/her down), while the rest tries to defend. Powered rooms spawn no enemies, so chose wisely before attempting the escape.You have essentially four ressources: Industry (let's you build stuff), Food (let's you level up or heal characters), Science (lets you research stuff) and Dust (it lets you power rooms). Modules you build can generate more of a ressource every turn, but have to be defended if in vulnerable spots.On the way up you can add two more characters you come across to your group. They can then be equipped with gear, which you either find or buy at the merchant, and which also randomly spawns on each floor. There are a total of 12 levels, all procedurally generated.It's sort of a fresh feeling gameplay experience: a mix between round based (preparation phase) and real time (combat). You can however pause the game at any time and still issue commands (or heal) during it.			"

												10/10 I love this game it is the perfect combo of strategy turn based RPG with a mix of dungeon crawling aspects. The characters are unique and fun each having there own perks. The world is always a surprise never knowing what might lurk around each door. In the game you play as well any character you want so long as you have unlocked them you are stranded on a crashed spaceship trying to make your way out as monsters come after you. ""Dungeons and Turn based in perfect harmony, endless fun.""Positives++Fun Graphics+A lot of Unique Characters+Unlockables :)+Lore is great+Challenging levels+soundtrack is great :)+Loot so much Loot :)Negatives--time consuming-Hard to control all your characters at once  "

												Played alot of early access and really enjoyed the idea. Was insanely tough with very few heroes but I had a lot of fun. Easy isn't easy and neither is too easy until you put hours into the game. I haven't heard anything good about multiplayer considering the save issues, which is sad because this game would be 100x's better with a solid multiplayer function. Lobbies and reliable saves pls. I came back about a year later and have ran through a couple 10+ floor runs. A couple hours coming to a frustrating death.. over and over.. whatever. It happens. And I like it.

												Honestly, this game was okay.  The first run was fantastic. Figuring out the strategy and resource management was challenging.  Finding items was satisfying, and upgrading the different modules was rewarding.  However, after one 10-hour playthrough I was able to uprade all modules and find every item, multiple times over.  Now that my first play is done, I'm finding it hard to justify a second run because I've basically seen everything. Other rouge-likes like Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain, and FTL had so much content that you needed multiple playthroughs just to see everything there is, and past that to optimize your planThe game was fun while there was new content.  Now that I know there is nothing else, why play again?			"

												This game looked like it had a lot of promise, but after playing it for a while the curtain has been pulled back for me, and I'd have a hard time recommending it as a result. It's perfectly fun for the first few floors, and then the game starts pulling out things just to limit what you can do. Want to put turrets leading up to your main defenses? Have enemies that attack and destroy them, wasting your resources. Want, or have to put the big modules in places outside of a dead end? There's enemies that will attack them, too, and are strong enough to blow them up in a couple hits, wasting a lot of your resources. You can't repair that damage unless you have someone with the repair skill, and it seems pretty often you'll have a party that doesn't contain one of those people. If you have a good enough set-up to get past those, the game will also start throwing in monsters that will smash open doors, which can spawn more waves, quickly forming a no-win scenario. If that monster is going for a door in an unpowered room (something that becomes more and more common as you progress, since you receive less and less Dust every floor), you'll need to send a hero in to kill it. Don't have one that's capable of doing that without getting killed by monsters that target them? Tough. Better hope you get one if you get up to the later floors, because another enemy appears that only spawns in unpowered rooms. It's stationary, but is quite strong, and will make enemies on that floor stronger, and since it's an enemy you need to get rid of it to actually get the after-combat regen. It's easy to kill when it first appears, but since it does along with other monsters in a wave, you again need someone who can run in and kill it quickly without dying themselves.You have your pick of two heroes at the start of the game, but it feels like no matter what you'll have some hole the game can exploit, which you need to rely on what heroes you'll encounter to fill. Since some are just straight up better than others, due to Repair and Operate being so important, it can be quite annoying to run into a combat hero when you need another person with those skills, or someone squishy when you needed someone else to work a choke point. Lots of Tower Defense games have dangerous enemies, but I found the ones in this game brought it down a lot.			"

												Dungeon of the endless is a rogue-like game crossed with elements of tower defense. It mixes exploration of random levels with several interesting mechanics, in regards to the skill tree's that develop your characters and your available resources.Your basic quest is to make it through a base by finding the exit in each level - once you do you must carry a crystal through to the exit. But there is a catch...as soon as you pick the crystal up an infinite number of enemy swarms the level, and you must hold them off while one of your squad carries the crystal to the exit.To aid you in doing this you can build various devices - turrets to attack enemies, or ones that increase your defense or heal you. However, each turret takes resources to build and energy to power them. Resources are gathered by opening doors in the environment / killing enemies - but the more doors you open the more enemies can pour out when you finally make the dash to the exit.......Every resource in the game is tied to this aspect - food (which heals you, or can be used to level up), science (the more you have the higher you can upgrade devices) and parts (x amount are needed to build each device) are all gained by advancing through the level. It's a balancing act - the more you explore, the more you can do, but by extension you will face more hazards.The rogue-like element is this......die and you go back to level one.......Yes, it erases any saved game and sends you right back to the start. I'm sure by now you have an idea of why this game is getting a thumbs down, despite me finding it moderately entertaining - at least for a while.It quickly becomes very boring. The random levels can either be: overly easy, or tediously complex, and the game doesn't develop at all. The furthest I have got so far is level three, and that's after about thirty attempts - doing the same limited thing over, and over, and over, and over again.For all the complexities of the systems in the game they sadly don't add much variety. And while it can be quite thrilling for your first few games it doesn't take long for the thrill to wear off. Repetitively slogging through samey environments, fighting enemies that, although different in looks and attacks, you just end up doing the same thing all the time. You don't control characters in combat, and levelling them up (which takes food, so you can't heal them) makes them tougher, but it doesn't do any more than that to liven up the gameplay.If you really, really get your kicks from strategic gameplay then this might keep you engaged, but for me personally I felt like I'd seen everything it had to offer within half an hour of playing it. Now it's become this mindnumbing excercise that I don't think I'll pursue anymore.Sadly it reminds me of Darkest Dungeon in that regard - an interesting concept, but one that ultimately makes for a dull experience. And Dungeons of the Endless doesn't have the insanity hook that livened up DD when it got stale, or the gleefully wicked narrator, or the appealing graphics, or the great sound effects. Whereas I played that game for about forty hours before getting bored with it, I find Dungeons of the endless is already proving tedious.			"

Product received for free
												I was given DotEndless from a friend with an extra key. Endless Legend was my first of the Endless games and this is my second.Positive things first: The game's art, style and Amplitude's signature wit are all very much on point. I had many chuckles in my time playing this game and everything looked and ran smoothly. The game is also unforgivingly brutal, which for any fan of rogue-likes can come to appreciate. If you make a mistake you WILL regret it, but that makes victory all the sweeter. And there are also a decent number of unlockable characters for a good number of different takes on a run, as well as those required small victories one needs for a brutal rogue-like (you unlock characters by running into them in a run and advance 3 floors, you don't need to beat the dungeon).All that being said I cannot recomend this game. Primarily because it teeters too far into more frustrating than actually fun in the rogue-like spectrum. I am infamously masochistic among my circle of friends and I still can't bring myself to WANT to play another run of this game after almost 24 hours of playtime. This is because DotEndless makes a classic mistake of roguelikes and does not doublecheck for actually impossible situations. And this isn't ""it's so hard it may as well be impossible"", I mean actually cannot progress within the game's constraints.Aside from that, another negative factor to this game is something I have noticed with the Endless franchise. There is too much crammed into the game. As the trailer and tags states, there are TD, 2d, rogue-like, RPG, strategy, etc etc elements in the game. What they don't tell you is that in the bid to incorporate all those tags, the overall game suffers. The rogue-like elements conflict with the TD elements, the RPG elements conflict with the strategy elements, and so on.The game's underlying premise and core mechanics are unique, and I WANT to like it. But I'm sorry to say numerous elements of this game need to be sacrificed for a better overall experience. DotEndless will draw you in for the first few hours and if you're stubbornly fond of brutal games like I am, you'll last maybe 20 hours before you start spamming restart for ideal starts or setting the game aside for another, better rogue-like such as:Risk of RainRogue LegacyCrypt of the Necrodancer----------------------Post 40-hour gameplay edit:I have resigned myself to grind at this game until I at least beat the first dungeon on easy, or else it will haunt me for eternity. While I have gotten considerably better at getting farther I just finished a 5 hour run dying on the last floor simply because I had picked the side the exit wasn't on to explore. I can only re-emphasize that this has considerably more good luck needed than is healthy for a game.51-hour edit:So I finally beat the first dungeon, and I admit my view of the game has improved now that I understand a myriad of tricks and skills to get you to the end. However, the fact that I needed over two days worth of game time to really get the game down and make it all mesh does not bode well. I still won't recommend this game to my friends, but I will say this game is possible at the very least.			"

												Basically a pretty straight forward and simple game to pick. Go through 12 floors filled with monsters and crystals, finding other survivors building supplies as you go in this semi Tower Defense mostly Rogue-like. There's something like 16 characters you can pick from, and you can always bring 2 (finding more as you go) to fit your playstyle. There's unlockable modes that alter the mechanics of the game, like 4 starting heroes or Endless mode, but it's all basically the same gameplay. At 15 hours of play, I started losing interest so I'd recommend trying it during a free weekend or demo.The major reason I am saying I do not recommend this game is the game is rather buggy, and these bugs are almost exlcusively run enders. Of my 15 hours of play, I ran into 5 seperate bugs that prevented me from both save+quitting (a feature exclusive to singleplayer) and progressing further to ""beat"" the game. These range from being unable to access a room, monsters having invulerablity and inability to move past them or even being to get the cleared floor menu to appear. These bugs were -extremely- obnoxious to encounter, and ultimately killed my interest in purchasing it. As of April 20, 2015, the game's bugs are too much to bear in my opinion.			"

												Slap some pixel♥♥♥♥♥♥together, invent a very basic resource mechanism, put ""random("" in front of every single function in the game (including character AI) and call it a ""roguelike"".That's basically this game. What passes as a fun idea on a lower difficulty quickly shatters at the horribly low product quality in higher difficulties. Your heroes don't attack? Well that's your problem, the random auto attack function decided not to work, that's just how it is, you can always just restart because ♥♥♥♥, why not? Not like you just wasted two hours on the lower floors.♥♥♥♥♥♥ resource placement? Your problem. Not enough dust because the entire floor didn't deliver? Your problem.The only thing that isn't fully random is the exist placement because apparently, that's where roguelike stops: if it could be convenient for the player.So yeah, if you're into throwing away hours because the developer couldn't be bothered to actually patch the game's core, by all means, go ahead. I'm glad I only paid a few bucks because it's not worth a single dime more than that.			"

												Another game with great potential. So many good things, the soundtrack, tactics and resource management. All of it is rendered pointless as the multiplayer functionality is pretty much unplayable. I can deal with the deceptive advertising from the store page videos, but the game is simply too broken to enjoy with friends.Involuntary connection drops happen every couple floors untill you are left playing a solo match. Players get black screens upon level completion and are forced to restart the game and abandon match. Multiplayer UI is regularly void of matches, either means nobody bothers with coop or the matchmaking UI is broken as well. Either way, it pains me to downvote, but a broken game is a broken game.

												tl;dr - Cute game, couldn't get into it.I love a good Rogue-like. I've poured countless hours into Torchlight, Diablo, Isaac... so on. Similar to The Binding of Isaac, this game has a very steep learning curve. Unlike BoI, there doesn't seem to be any 'reward' to dying. From what I gathered through a fair amount of Google, you need to luck out to gain enough floors to unlock a hero, every time you want to unlock a hero. Now, this isn't bad, except...All the upgrades you purchase - new towers, tower upgrades, so on - only apply to your current run. This game is essentially RNG taken to the extreme. Unless you're the luckiest space marine this side of the galaxy, you're gonna die repeatedly. I get that some games can't just be picked up and played, that you need to sink hours into them before you're going to win, but when winning is locked behind random rumbers and not skill, it becomes a tedious grind that loses all sense of fun very quickly.The graphics are cute, the soundtrack isn't bad, all in all, it's a decently polished game. Where it suffers is the complete lack of balance, the tutorial being summed up as 'die until you get it right', and a misleading difficulty system.The above points wouldn't be so bad for a game in Beta, but given that this is a completed game, I was expecting more.Graphics: 5/10Gameplay: 3/10Soundtrack: 5/10Fun to play: 1/10Overall: 3/10			"

												It is a nice game but it's so difficult you end up not enjoying it. There is only two difficulty levels: The easy level is already hard and kind of fun, but the other one is pointless to play. It is only possible to save your progress if you want to continue later but if you die, your only save game is deleted and have to start again.No matter how you good you get at it, and how much you plan your moves, you can be overwhelmed at any moment.I'm pretty sure many people like me have given up trying and uninstalled this game.

												Dungeon of the Endless is quite fun. But at it's current state, it's just simply unplayable on the Mac. The game usually run into display issues where the map cannot zoom in, this is not usually a huge problem, since you can always save & quit, let the game crash, and restart. However, if you run into this problem when the level is complete, or transitioning between different levels, then the game simply crashes by itself.  Now, this won't be such a problem if Dungeon of the Endless uses the traditional save system. In this game, you can only keep one save, and every save can only be loaded once. If you run into any crashes, tough luck, you just lost the entire playthrough and several hours of game/achievement progress.To save you on the frustration, I would not recommend this game at its current state. It's simply way too unstable for its save scheme to work, at least on Macs.If they fix this issue, or create a workaround, I would gladly give it 9/10.			"

												The game in its current state is a buggy mess. Just don't bother. You will be frustrated.First of all, don't turn on game pad support. Just don't. It's plain broken. The button prompts in the tutorial are for keyboard, the tool tip windows cover important information and sometimes the controls just don't work. My favorite was when I wanted to exit the dungeon and couldn't because even though it was prompted on the screen, the right trigger did nothing. Game over.Which brings me to the game over screen. Or what I think is the game over screen. Because I only get a black screen with music running in the background. Pressing any button brings me back to the menu. There are other screens that glitch out or are cut short too, like the intro or the loading screens.If it weren't for the technical issues I'd say the game is okay. Neutral recommendation. I have played more engaging tower defense hybrids. But with the glaring glitches and bugs, I can definitely not recommend buying this game at all.Hardware: MSI GT72S 6QE (i7, 16GB, GTX 980m)			"

												So yeah, one of your dudes can kill another one of your dudes.There's no precedence for it whatsoever. It's just a pretty highly specific scripted event between very specific characters, as if the developer were trying to troll the player. You won't even know it's a possibility until it actually happens, and except for the few pairings that it's possible for, you won't even have to worry about it.This smells of very good quality gameplay, and I am sure all of this highly difficult game's difficulty is well-balanced instead of artificial, RNG crap.For some reason, though, the game ended up uninstalled immediately, and I felt the strangest regret that I had ever bought the game, as well as this strange conviction to never buy any future Endless games.Other strategy games should learn from this. For example, Civilization could base the outcome of wars on historical events, instead of actual gameplay.			"

												This game is like Civ 5 for Roguelikes, and like Civ it CAN be fun, but then you realise you have spent a few hours accomplishing jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will break my review down below:GRAPHICS/ART:It's a retro-style game, so the canvas is limited, but the game certainly looks pretty good. Objects are clearly and distinctly present, so there is little to no confusion.GAMEPLAY:It's meant to kill time; you get random items, map layout, ally spawns, upgrades, merchants and exit spawns. The only thing for certain is the levelup skills and the two characters you pick at the start. It takes a LONG time to play a full game, and the gameplay never really picks up. It's heavily focussed on micro-management of up to four characters with unique stats and skills which allow them to excel in certain roles. However, the control and style in which this is done is quite rudimentary and provides the player with little input other than moving units or building defences. Later on the difficulty snowballs rapidly and makes it even more painful to keep track of all four characters and make sure none of them die or get underlevelled; the 12th floor for me was especially painful as there are few places to install resource generators, making the gameplay even more tiresome as I had to move around and heal constantly just to try and find the exit in the gargantuan map. I am not a huge fan of RNG being the primary focus of difficulty, ESPECIALLY when nearly every aspect of the game is decided by a roll of the dice, and it can take over an hour to realise you rolled pretty poorly for the late game.CO-OP:The only redeeming factor is that the co-op is nigh perfect; the connection is brilliant and easy to set up. However, if a character dies that player has to sit around and wait, becoming even more passive than usual until their teammates find a new character for them to play as, often requiring different types of equipment that the group does not have, making the experience further decline.PROGRESSION:None to speak of; you unlock new characters when you recruit them and either survive 3 floors in a row with them on your team, or win the game with them on your team. In multiplayer, the chance of them being unlocked is reduced the more players there are. The main issue arising from this is that it will almost always require you to get rid of one of your fully equipped, levelled character for the sake of unlocking a new one to start the game with. This will often result in quick defeat or increased difficulty, as there is NO INFORMATION given about the stats, abilities or equipment slots the character has before recruiting them, forcing the player to take a gamble. This is common in roguelikes, and not a huge issue for me, but for this game when 3 floors can take 15 minutes it was painful and dreary to think I would have to roll the dice countless times to try and get some characters I really enjoyed, as the base ones are bland and utterly boring.OVERALL: This game is not awful, but it barely scrapes through on being OK. It suffers from heavy reliance on RNG to have any semblance of replayability or progression, and couples it with gameplay that is as tedious as it is dreadfully time consuming.Not worth buying unless you have nothing to do these holidays and want to watch your life pass as quickly as possible.I rate it 10 points.

												The game would have been just fine if it weren't for the constant desync issues with the multplayer. Couldn't get past the second floor without it desyncing and becoming unbeatable. To make things worse loading a multiplayer game that got desynced removes the ability for the second player to choose a character. Do not buy this game if you are planning to play online.			"

												You know you're in for a rough time when you're playing a game that's tagged as a rogue-like and it starts with only two difficulties, ""easy"" and ""too easy,"" and you get wrecked on the second level, despite doing perfectly the rest of that level, and having picked up an extra party member and having lots of defensive lasers and teslas.The game's premise is that you open doors to rooms. You open a door, and either something good or something bad is in it. You generate resources each time you open a room, and you spend those resources to upgrade characters, buy new resource-generating devices, research new such devices, build defensive structures, etc. If you send power to a room, it is lit so you can see what's going on inside it, and enemies cannot spawn inside it. Any rooms that aren't powered but have an open door will typically have enemies pop out of them. You can take and remove power as you please, but must power any rooms in between your power source (the crystal you defend the whole level), and the room you want powered. The rooms' contents are random. Find the room that is the exit, and when you're ready to leave, you have to slowly carry the crystal from its starting point to the exit. The assault that comes is simply awful. It's an unending stream, which means if the exit is in a room that isn't powered, and that's the only direction that all enemies are spawning from, it becomes impossible to beat the level.Was this my fault? Technically, yes. I had no idea it was going to happen, but if I'd known better, I would have deliberately turned the power off in certain rooms to distribute enemies and make sure I could exit, now that I look back on it. However, this being a rogue like, my honest mistake doesn't mean I get to reload, fiddle around with my defense, and keep trying it until I progress in the game. Oh no, instead, being a rogue like, I have to start the whole damn thing over. While I'm sure there are people who brag about how good they are or make comments about how terrible they are while making backhanded compliments about their skill, the problem here is that the game appears to have enough levels that it would take several hours to complete, and every single error could mean having to do it all over again. This game is disrespectful of players' time, whereas a rogue like such as FTL seems to go so much faster with a shorter length so that losing doesn't feel as detrimental, and has so many fun little things to do, even on runs where you may fail, such as killing enemies by sucking the air out of a room, or taking over an enemy ship by teleporting on-board and killing its crew. Maybe FTL is longer but it doesn't feel as long? I've never beaten FTL, but I still think fondly of it and don't regret my time playing it. This game will mostly please the masochists and difficult-game braggarts. Masochists get abused by the game and feel like they deserve it, which pleases them, and difficult-game braggarts take pleasure in knowing they have the exclusionary pleasure of completing a game most players won't be able to complete, so they can brag about it on forums and talk about how ""easy"" it was to people who can't win and are frustrated. That last type of player is kind of a jerk, but the masochists aren't ""hurting"" anyone but themselves, so I'm totally cool with that.In summary, the game will make you start over from the very beginning if you make a big enough mistake, and I saw no relevant unlocks that I got to assist in playing again. The game's levels take too long except probably for people who are really good at the game anyway, meaning starting over is just an incredible disappointment. I would be a bit iffy on whether I'd keep trying if the game saved between levels, but with a total restart every time, no freaking way am I going to spend my time trying to progress in a game deliberately designed to take away ALL of my progress if I even make one mistake.

												The game was amusing and had a modest amount of strat the first few games. But after you've beat 2 or 3 levels, it's no longer very interresting. There's very little variety between the different levels. The only real difference comes in the form of what handicaps/penalties they impose on you for the level.Oh and on a side note...On my first run, things wewe going well and I was about half way through the dungeon. All my characters are on the elevator moving to the next level. Suddenly two chars get in an arguement or something and one stabs the other. This causes me to lose my Best/Highest DPS char right in the middle of a level.Devs can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves on game design like this. It's hard enough keeping people alive to then have them die at random on the elevator?			"

I just don't like RNG reliant roguelikes. RNG can be fun, but if winning relies on the map generator being generous, then it's stupid and frustrating.You don't control any units in this game, you just tell them where to go and they attack what they want, so you can't compensate for bad RNG with skill.Very frustrating.

												Half dungeon crawler, half resource management sim, Dungeon of the Endless is a simplistic ""Rogue-like"" set in the Endless universe. The thing that sets this apart from so many others in its genre is how you keep your party alive; major slots on dungeon floors allow you to build Major Modules (used to harvest resources), along with minor slots for offensive, defensive, and supportive modules. Three resources are harvested per door opening and modules add to their production: Food for healing, leveling, and recruiting heroes, Industry for constructing modules, and Science for researching upgrades and resetting your party's ability cooldowns. A fourth resource, Dust, is much rarer and is used to power the crystal you are escorting, which in turn powers rooms for modules. Gameplay is both turn-based (new resources are harvested from when you open a door to a new room) and real-time (combat, movement, healing, etc.), keeping you constantly engaged despite the AI-controlled combat. The first few floors are simple enough to clear out but about halfway up you need to decide which is more important: risking your party's lives and possibly the crystal itself or running to the exit ASAP? Keeping a balanced party and wisely spending your resources will make or break your runs. Luck is always a factor but I felt that once I knew how to control the flow of spawns and properly construct defensive chokepoints that most of my losses were admittedly my own fault. This game rewards planning and strategy instead of demanding you get lucky unlike other recent Sci-fi rogue-likes (looking at you FTL & SotS: The Pit!).Newcomers will be overwhelmed and probably give up easily because the tutorial is terrible and most of the game's systems have to be studied on the wiki, even with the extensive tooltips in-game. Although it practically plays itself at times and still could use some polishing and TLC, Dungeon of the Endless is a very unique Rogue-like and is worth checking out for fans of the genre.			"

												This game is like that cheating girlfriend you fall in love with: You can't stop loving it but for your own sake you should. This game sometimes is so buggy that it wouldn't even start and this ♥♥♥♥ up my mind.Buy it only if you like complicated and painful relationship.EDIT: after more hours I can say this: I realy like this game BUT it's really buggy. I don't mind losing if the game is hard but it crashed a couple of times while playing and I lost some of my runs after hours of playing. That's frustrating, didn't expect this on a 2014 game.

												Every couple of months I remember that I have this game and reinstall it. I play it for an hour or so and enjoy going through floors, upgrading my heroes along the way and managing resources. Once I get to floor 7 or so, I quickly remember why it was uninstalled. With mounting dificulty and sprawling hallways, this rogue-like quickly becomes a game of chance. Opening the wrong door at the start of a level leaves your party with a useless, dangerous string of rooms that do nothing  but spawn hordes of enemies; the later levels leave too much to sheer chance rather than carefull play. Of course, other games of this style have similar problems, but the limited resources you can obtain and the limited player interaction makes it hard to blame defeat on the skill of the player.The atmophere and art are excellent, but the game quickly becomes tiresome when you begin to see the dice being rolled against you.

												The game is barely finished. The UI sucks and is cut together so bad that things overlap and are all over the screen, don't know how you could mess that up so bad with 2 or 3 drop-down interfaces. The tile sets, weapons, room layouts and monsters cannot be considered rouge-like or very 'random' given the small pool of the total assets. Honestly, there is about 30-ish items that can be had, it wouldn't have taken much to throw a few extra in there. Multiplayer is worthless, you cant co-ordinate in this game, it's not possible given the way mosters spawn... you either sit your 1 character in a room with a turret or just left click around following someone calling the shots - you can't control/micro your character in this game, so you get the idea: boring. The monsters and gameplay are not balanced and do not progress linearly. You either smash a game or are barely holding on... just not fun or thought out. It's an indie game, it's unique and the good kind of quirky, but this is one of those games that make me wish we were back in the days of polished $100 game releases.			"

												This game is god damn addicting and lots of fun! Lots of really cool unique characters with fun to read lore and story. The base gameplay is quite simple but there's a lot to it, especially if you're playing as an operator character. You have to roam through rooms in dungeons and try to fight off all incoming aliens, manage resources, and recruit new allies all while defending the crystal, which is an essential item you need in order to proceed to the next dungeon floor. As an operator, you have to build and manage modules that will allow you to fight off creatures you run into in the dungeon, and defend the crystal. I've already sinked over 20 hours in the game and I still find myself wanting to go back and beat another dungeon. It's sooo fun and it's getting more updates in the future, including TF2 characters and more weapons. Can't wait!			"

You have your core and you have to get light in the room in order for the aliens not to spawn there. Every time you open a new room the next wave starts and all rooms you have opened and are not lit will spawn aliens and you have to defend yourself. The more rooms you open the harder the next wave is ...The game is very clever and I will spend a lot of time endlesly roaming the dungeon.			"

												If you're looking for a fun and challenging way to spend probably 10-20 hours, buy a copy of Dungeon of the Endless (DotE). I actually only stopped playing it because my power supply died and I couldn't replace it for a month.DotE combines the best parts of the roguelike/lite genre with a little bit of tower defense.The gameplay is very challenging, and replayability is extremely high. At the end of the day, it's simple gameplay, but can be punishing on your first few play throughs. You will get a real sense of achievement when you manage to best this game.The graphics are fairly low grade, but there is a definite charm to them.I don't know how to adequately express in words how much I enjoyed playing this game. It's super fun, and you will lose time and time again.Buy it and have some fun!			"

								The tutorial for this game explains the square root of sod all. Read people's guides on the Community Hub if you're struggling to get going. Once you get the hang of what you're supposed to be doing, this game is tactical, addicting and an amazingly original take on dungeon crawling (adding tower defence? I never would have thought that would work).This runs on the more Sanctum idea of tower defence, wherein you have your own characters that run around protecting your machines and with random attacks, it feels real, engaging and genuinely exciting to watch your tankiest guy drag your power source agonisingly slowly to the exit, and when he does, the sense of achievement is awesome.This game, currently in alpha, is still rounded, works well and bugs are minimal and not detacting from your enjoyment. In the standard rogue-like fashion, you will die, a lot. But the lessons you learn will get you further next time.If you like rogue-likes, get it, if you like tower defence, you should probably also get it. It's worth the £10 in alpha and I'm insanely excited to play it when it's finished.			"

								Played this game at EGX Rezzed and fell in love with it. I'd already heard of it and was excited to see it in the Leftfield Collection, and on the stand next to mine!  I was given a personal tour on how to play and lots of good hints and tips too.  As soon as I got home I bought the early access.   With elements of rogue-likes in the way the dungeon is generated and explored, and elements of tower defense gameplay as you create and place modules to defend your crystal until you find the exit, it offers great gameplay & beautiful visuals.  Highly recommended.			"

								Note: Game still in Alpha, Founder pack ReviewThis game is very unforgiving and has a sharp learning curve. The tutorial is a brief 4 pages and leaves one a bit confused as to what exactly you should be doing, but the game can be summarised as:Open doors -> Power new rooms (middle mouse) -> Build supporting machines in new rooms -> Build defences (Think tower defence) -> Open more doors (Discovering new loot/Monsters/NPCs)Rinse and repeat, All the while looking for the elevator down.Note: Monsters can only spawn in ""dark/Unpowered"" rooms, even ones you've previously explored.Once you've found the elevator, if you're happy you're done with the floor you can pick up the power crystal from your ship and head down to the next level (This generally spawns a few monsters to oppose your hero as they try move the power source)The game uses various resources to research/upgrade your heroes and build defences/upgrades for roomsThere are a few features I eagerly await, including a more in depth research system.All in all, a good investment if you want a quick repeatable little game with a strong theme in a consistent loreverse			"

								Curses, another roguelike devourer of sparetime. And a very interesting one. DOTE does a great job of putting tower defense, action rpg and strategy together. As with all roguelike games, it takes a while to get the hang of it, but once you get a grip on things, it is great fun und a nice challenge. Get it!			"

												OMG, this game is amazing if you like dungeon crawlers but is THE BEST if you like all the elements (including the rpg parts). BUT this game will not spear the new player, it will rip them apart and laugh (this is because you can just win on 'too easy'). SO get ready for the long run and a lot of losses with this game of multiple reruns with multiple types of pods to use which, in some cases, change the game a lot. I say this but its a great game with a clean cut pixelated art style, GO BUY NOW(!) NOW(!) NOW(!).P.S: The lore in this game is amazing and is very deep so yea, there are hidden talks between the charaters during the lift parts and everything SUPER COOL(!). "

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 17% YES / 83% NOGOODSome characters look neat and have fun, unique abilities.The game CAN be complex and interesting mechanic wise if it stops glitching.NEUTRALThere are some nice visuals in respects to characters but unfortunately the visuals are overall too muddled to make out what's happening most of the time. This really kills the visibility of the HUD which WILL get people killed.BADI was never able to keep a multiplayer game from crashing. This game has a 100% rate of crashing during the loading screen to new floors, where my party of 4 saw the second floor ONCE and that game it crashed on the 4th floor transition. We had everyone try to be the lobby leader once, where everyone encountered the same crash. Additional information: everyone had the updated Windows 10, on the same ISP, and stable connections.The difficulty curve feels like a turtle. One moment it's on its back helpless, then around floor 7 it flips itself over and sits on you. I can't believe how fast you get overwhelmed with so little resources to work with in each new floor. I'm still trying to comprehend why the last floor generated no dust after 6 doors, leaving me to rest on the laurels of my squisy party despite leveling and gearing them up the entire game. Overall the game's difficulty never felt good. It was either incredibly boring or just too difficult.SUMMARYI gave it a shot because it was a weekend deal at $3, but now I get to look at a dead game in my library that the developers have stopped supporting. In no way can I recommend a game that cannot stop crashing in multiplayer games and has the difficulty curve of a revolving door. It feels like a game that desperately needed more time debugging the online problems and the difficulty curve.			"

												I am in between if I like this game or not.Maybe I am just being salty.This game is basically ""RNG the game"".It can be fun when the game challenges you, sure.I am a bit of a perfectionist in a way. I like to keep all my heroes, and my buildings. Especially my heroes. It can get pretty hard when the floor decides to spawn 5 different ambushes while giving me no modules/resources to work with to defend myself nor my crystal; it can lead to some pretty serious salt. But I guess it does make for a decent roguelike game, albeit a frustratingly hard/unfair one at times.			"

												One of my most favorite games.  Very unique and love the concept.  Simple, pretty, with great functional design and love the music.Dungeon of the Endless is a mix between tower defense and hero wars type of a game.  Each door you unlock essentially ends your turn.  Rooms you have not powered, whether intentionally or unable, have a chance of spawning waves of monsters.  At this point, hope your defenses are good enough to beat back the hordes and your heroes are leveled up enough and equiped well enough to help.Part turn-based, part stradegy, I find this game to have a very refreshing asthetic.  Mixed with a reasonable price, why have you not purchased this already? ^-^Oh, you want to hear more?  Well, how about that this is a rogue-like.  No two games play the same, no two maps are the same.  Each time you play, it will be different.  Also, this game features a ton of unlockables, from ships which change your game type, to different chracters, of whom have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses.Multiplayer has always seemed to be pretty stable as well.  This also presents more challenges if you play with friends, as your resources are pooled.  How well will you be able to work together.  Can you make it to the final levels?  Maybe you just do not want to stop.  Try Endless mode for a really challenging experience!			"

												Solid rogue-like / strategy / squad play!I've played 8 hours so far, but feel myself getting a bit bored with it.  The items and the levels do not quite feel random enough; every level plays like a slightly harder version of the level before it, but that's it.I've only been able to reliably beat it on ""Very easy"" mode, which makes it hard to unlock other game modes.  It's a bit silly to gate game mode unlocks behind objectives (e.g., research all level 1 modules)The stats on the items are all hard-set, so there's no randomness there.  You can find yourself in a dry spell of only crappier items or duplicatesI like the resource-based play, but I find the turrets (modules) are a bit lacking.  I find myself only using a few of the offensive turrets, and avoiding the defensive ones almost completely.  Maybe they have more use in other game modes.The graphics are amazing! There's a lot of attention to detail, the setting is engrossing.  You truly do feel the oppressive environment.  The characters are charming, but seeing TF2 heroes really breaks the immersion and I wish they had left them out.I'd recommend watching a ""Let's Play"" of the game before purchasing.  After 1-2 videos, you should have a good feel for your projected enjoyment of the game.			"

												It's a great game, basically FTL making love to tower defence. The FTL vibe is strong but the tower defence part is not a very important aspect of the gameplay sadly, (I run through to level 12 with basically building just a couple of defence towers). It's worth the FTL price but would probably not pay the full price. Graphics are too hipster and confusing for my personal taste, they fit well with games likw Crawl but in this game it just works to confuse you. Excellent copy, i've pretty much read through the descriptions of all items, has not happened since south park & the stick of truth.			"

												This game really surprised me - it's quite a little tactical wonder with lots of elements from different types of games thrown in.But, at its core it's a roguelike because of the random, procedural dungeon levels. Oh, and there's also some tower defense elements  which are not just randomly thrown in, it's a more than just slightly important game mechanic and plays a key role in how you'll escape with your crystal in each level once you find that elevator. And you can't discount the RPG aspect, because how and who you equip with what and which skills are absolutely crucial. And tactical strategy because you have to count placement of heroes in which rooms or you'll definitely fail. Then there's the loot aspect which can make one almost obsessively compulsive about gearing up the heroes from the previously mentioned ever-important RPG portion of the game.So yeah, that about describes it.At its core.In the end, though, this game is more than just merely the sum of its parts - it's all tied together very well, and ties well into the lore of amplitude studio's other games, Endless Space and Endless Legend if you're looking for those kinds of things.And the music is pretty great.

This game has a tons of different items to assist you on your runs, and you can unlock different runs with special restrictions and bonuses. Heck, I still have not beaten the whole thing yet.			"

								Still in the early stages of development but the quality is clear, this game is really challenging and likewise extremely rewarding, the music is great, the mechanics are refreshingly new and fun.  You require a lot of resource management and planning to stay ahead.			"

Its as if some gaming chef took a blend of the most bold spices and premium dough and sprinkled some brutally hardness on top. And then he baked it into a pizza. And the people who got the pizza liked it so much that they just kept coming back for more despite expieriencing it for the first time, multiple times. They still came back. thats how this gmae is its HARD and I mean it. Its beautiful. Its tense. And its overall the way to ""blend"" so many great genres together into a great game. ~ 10/10			"

												If you're looking for a fun and challenging way to spend probably 10-20 hours, buy a copy of Dungeon of the Endless (DotE). I actually only stopped playing it because my power supply died and I couldn't replace it for a month.DotE combines the best parts of the roguelike/lite genre with a little bit of tower defense.The gameplay is very challenging, and replayability is extremely high. At the end of the day, it's simple gameplay, but can be punishing on your first few play throughs. You will get a real sense of achievement when you manage to best this game.The graphics are fairly low grade, but there is a definite charm to them.I don't know how to adequately express in words how much I enjoyed playing this game. It's super fun, and you will lose time and time again.Buy it and have some fun!			"

												It's a great game, basically FTL making love to tower defence. The FTL vibe is strong but the tower defence part is not a very important aspect of the gameplay sadly, (I run through to level 12 with basically building just a couple of defence towers). It's worth the FTL price but would probably not pay the full price. Graphics are too hipster and confusing for my personal taste, they fit well with games likw Crawl but in this game it just works to confuse you. Excellent copy, i've pretty much read through the descriptions of all items, has not happened since south park & the stick of truth.			"

												I absolutely love this game! The character design is sleek and beautiful, the enemies are creative, and the dialogue between your heroes are funny! Some (I want to say most) of the negative reviews are based on the difficulty of the game specifically, but this is not the kind of game that you can just press any button or use any unit and expect to win. You have to really think about what the stats of all of your mods and units before you place them and position them and go with the learning curve. It's harder to win when you use the same unit all of the time, so you have to switch things up and get creative. Just a few things that works is to take advantage of the tactical map went there are alot of enemies on the screen or when you are carrying crystal to the next floor, keep one defensive gunner unit to protect the crystal while the others explore, and don't waste power on rooms that doesnt lead to the exit or provide defense for the crystal. There are plenty of other ways that you can come up with to win. Once you get the hang of this game, you won't be able to stop playing! Totally recommend it!			"

												The goal on each level is the same and It's to find the exit and transport a crystal to power the lift to the next level. Behind each door there might be a swarm of monsters or an artefact, a socket to build a factory, or one of a few other options, with the doors acting as tacit turns in the real-time action. Special ability recharges are based not on time passing, but doors opened.You are always pushed to move forwards, and never have quite enough supplies. Rooms have to be lit to prevent them from spawning monsters, but there’s no way to do so for more than a handful at a time. Now those powered rooms play host to tower defence action, where you build weapons and support structures to protect your team of two heroes.Every decision is a balancing act, from whether to leave heroes by the crystal to prevent enemy waves smashing it while you are at the other end of the map. To use a factory slot in a new room to build an industry generator for creating weapons, a science one for researching toys, or a food one for healing and recruiting.Etc. Perfect game for long gameplays.			"

												This game really surprised me - it's quite a little tactical wonder with lots of elements from different types of games thrown in.But, at its core it's a roguelike because of the random, procedural dungeon levels. Oh, and there's also some tower defense elements  which are not just randomly thrown in, it's a more than just slightly important game mechanic and plays a key role in how you'll escape with your crystal in each level once you find that elevator. And you can't discount the RPG aspect, because how and who you equip with what and which skills are absolutely crucial. And tactical strategy because you have to count placement of heroes in which rooms or you'll definitely fail. Then there's the loot aspect which can make one almost obsessively compulsive about gearing up the heroes from the previously mentioned ever-important RPG portion of the game.So yeah, that about describes it.At its core.In the end, though, this game is more than just merely the sum of its parts - it's all tied together very well, and ties well into the lore of amplitude studio's other games, Endless Space and Endless Legend if you're looking for those kinds of things.And the music is pretty great.

												Solid rogue-like / strategy / squad play!I've played 8 hours so far, but feel myself getting a bit bored with it.  The items and the levels do not quite feel random enough; every level plays like a slightly harder version of the level before it, but that's it.I've only been able to reliably beat it on ""Very easy"" mode, which makes it hard to unlock other game modes.  It's a bit silly to gate game mode unlocks behind objectives (e.g., research all level 1 modules)The stats on the items are all hard-set, so there's no randomness there.  You can find yourself in a dry spell of only crappier items or duplicatesI like the resource-based play, but I find the turrets (modules) are a bit lacking.  I find myself only using a few of the offensive turrets, and avoiding the defensive ones almost completely.  Maybe they have more use in other game modes.The graphics are amazing! There's a lot of attention to detail, the setting is engrossing.  You truly do feel the oppressive environment.  The characters are charming, but seeing TF2 heroes really breaks the immersion and I wish they had left them out.I'd recommend watching a ""Let's Play"" of the game before purchasing.  After 1-2 videos, you should have a good feel for your projected enjoyment of the game.			"

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 17% YES / 83% NOGOODSome characters look neat and have fun, unique abilities.The game CAN be complex and interesting mechanic wise if it stops glitching.NEUTRALThere are some nice visuals in respects to characters but unfortunately the visuals are overall too muddled to make out what's happening most of the time. This really kills the visibility of the HUD which WILL get people killed.BADI was never able to keep a multiplayer game from crashing. This game has a 100% rate of crashing during the loading screen to new floors, where my party of 4 saw the second floor ONCE and that game it crashed on the 4th floor transition. We had everyone try to be the lobby leader once, where everyone encountered the same crash. Additional information: everyone had the updated Windows 10, on the same ISP, and stable connections.The difficulty curve feels like a turtle. One moment it's on its back helpless, then around floor 7 it flips itself over and sits on you. I can't believe how fast you get overwhelmed with so little resources to work with in each new floor. I'm still trying to comprehend why the last floor generated no dust after 6 doors, leaving me to rest on the laurels of my squisy party despite leveling and gearing them up the entire game. Overall the game's difficulty never felt good. It was either incredibly boring or just too difficult.SUMMARYI gave it a shot because it was a weekend deal at $3, but now I get to look at a dead game in my library that the developers have stopped supporting. In no way can I recommend a game that cannot stop crashing in multiplayer games and has the difficulty curve of a revolving door. It feels like a game that desperately needed more time debugging the online problems and the difficulty curve.			"

Early Access Review
								Played this game at EGX Rezzed and fell in love with it. I'd already heard of it and was excited to see it in the Leftfield Collection, and on the stand next to mine!  I was given a personal tour on how to play and lots of good hints and tips too.  As soon as I got home I bought the early access.   With elements of rogue-likes in the way the dungeon is generated and explored, and elements of tower defense gameplay as you create and place modules to defend your crystal until you find the exit, it offers great gameplay & beautiful visuals.  Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: Game still in Alpha, Founder pack ReviewThis game is very unforgiving and has a sharp learning curve. The tutorial is a brief 4 pages and leaves one a bit confused as to what exactly you should be doing, but the game can be summarised as:Open doors -> Power new rooms (middle mouse) -> Build supporting machines in new rooms -> Build defences (Think tower defence) -> Open more doors (Discovering new loot/Monsters/NPCs)Rinse and repeat, All the while looking for the elevator down.Note: Monsters can only spawn in ""dark/Unpowered"" rooms, even ones you've previously explored.Once you've found the elevator, if you're happy you're done with the floor you can pick up the power crystal from your ship and head down to the next level (This generally spawns a few monsters to oppose your hero as they try move the power source)The game uses various resources to research/upgrade your heroes and build defences/upgrades for roomsThere are a few features I eagerly await, including a more in depth research system.All in all, a good investment if you want a quick repeatable little game with a strong theme in a consistent loreverse			"

 Dungeon of the Endless: A Beautiful, Interesting Journey into Tedium The game has many issues, but beneath them is a very interesting diamond in the rough. A Dungeon of the Endless 2 could be very cool, even something derivative of Dungeon of the Endless. If the game had more skill-based mechanics, a way to fight back during its arbitrary spikes of difficulty, and more variation in the dungeons, it would be fantastic. Someone please, learn from this game, and make a better rendition of it.Dungeon of the Endless makes a big attempt to do something cool with a lot of potential, and for this it deserves some praise. It also looks incredible. Sadly, the game grows shallow quickly, and leaves you ultimately dissatisfied.3 out of 5			"

												Pretty bloody amazing, but very frustrating at the same time. Most of the time anything that goes wrong is your fault, so I can see how people slowly get better and better over time, learning how the game works by trial and error. It's a bit tough in the start, but once you start getting the hang of it the first few floors become much easier. I still havent finished a full run yet though... the next little learning curve is at around floor ten and up, where level four modules are sort of no longer enough to carry you through the game.

												First things first: this game makes no attempt to teach you how to play, and is smug about it. It's actually not that complicated, so this is pretty inexcusable.However, after watching a very helpful youtube let's play explaining basic strategy[1], now that I know how the f this game even works, I'm having fun. Graphics and sound are great, gameplay is fun. The writing isn't very good, but I don't think English is the developers' first language so they get a pass.Not amazingly good, but nice.

After a hundred or two planets and small satellites i decided that I had enough of that, but i had only one planet to colonize, so, uh, i packed up and flew at her. We crashed on this planet and fell straight into the dungeon.So... I just decided to go, um, you know, Full Master... Um, Dungeon Master, with a full dungeon on this planet... And, uh, it's going pretty well!Surviving is 300 FIDS. ♂But seriously, this game have a great gameplay, awesome ambient soundtrack, and very good pixel graphics.You should buy it, if you love dungeon-roguelikes (even if not)!

												Personally, I love puzzle/adventure games that present this dilemma: bail and leave with what you have, or inch just a little further and get a bit richer. Each step you take, you have to reevaulate if you can open one more room and still make it out alive. There are no save points, there are no do-overs, and sometimes pushing a little too far comes with a bleak ending. The game is extremely unforgiving when you first start, and can be wildly frustrating, but each time you play, you improve steadily. The game rewards you for quick thinking and picture big reasoning, without relying too heavily on cheap deaths. Don't get me wrong, it happens, but had you bailed from that floor earlier, it wouldn't have.I highly recommend this as a single player game, and you'll have a good time, surely.			"

												At first glance this looks like another cheap roguelike with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, but in fact its the opposite of that! The visuals are stylised and extremely well done, while it uses sort of same pixelated feel like many other games, it fits perfectly! Thegame is a mix between FTL, tower defence and old school dungeon crawlers  gameplays.It is very easy to get into, but  its EXTREMELY punishing. 1 tiny mistake can cost you an entire playthrough of many hours. Played 6 hours and furtherst i got so far was floor 7. Characters and items are varried, leading to a huge range of possible playstyles. In fact the game is all about choice, randomisation and strategy. And at every new floor you'll face some sort of new danger which will fkc you up in one way or another. Balance is done extremely well, its hard to point to the 'favourite' hero or how someone is better then others, its all about choice. Some time i might want to have Max and Elise, other times perhaps Jorith and Samus, maybe even Mizu and the spider lady! Every choice is viable.Overall its a fantastic game, and for the price its asking its an absolutely steal! ♥♥♥♥ waiting for sale, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Only complaint i have is the soundtrack, - sometimes its fantastic, sometimes its just not up to the level. While most of the time it delivers and enhances the pleasant experience, some tracks are just ruining the feel for me, which is a shame.Final score 9.5/10 for an indie game. Easily best thing in the genre since FTL and i already want more of it. There are many games where i couldnt give less of a♥♥♥♥♥♥about DLCs, this is not one of them, like in FTL i think a few new systems would be just fantastic, but i understand they would be hard to balance out in this fantastic game. And a very solid 8/10 as a general game, - seems to me like a lot of people might see it as too punishing at times.Very recommended for purchase.			"

												Fairly boring after the first few times. The 'random element' is less about replayability and more about ways to get ♥♥♥♥ed over and end your run without hope. I'm not that great at the game, but I haven't had the playtime to get good at the game. It's fairly boring, all you do is open doors and run around preparing for bad luck.Also, the multiplayer on this game is dead, making for a dull and frustrating experience. I wouldn't waste the money if I were you.			"

												At first glance this looks like another cheap roguelike with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, but in fact its the opposite of that! The visuals are stylised and extremely well done, while it uses sort of same pixelated feel like many other games, it fits perfectly! Thegame is a mix between FTL, tower defence and old school dungeon crawlers  gameplays.It is very easy to get into, but  its EXTREMELY punishing. 1 tiny mistake can cost you an entire playthrough of many hours. Played 6 hours and furtherst i got so far was floor 7. Characters and items are varried, leading to a huge range of possible playstyles. In fact the game is all about choice, randomisation and strategy. And at every new floor you'll face some sort of new danger which will fkc you up in one way or another. Balance is done extremely well, its hard to point to the 'favourite' hero or how someone is better then others, its all about choice. Some time i might want to have Max and Elise, other times perhaps Jorith and Samus, maybe even Mizu and the spider lady! Every choice is viable.Overall its a fantastic game, and for the price its asking its an absolutely steal! ♥♥♥♥ waiting for sale, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Only complaint i have is the soundtrack, - sometimes its fantastic, sometimes its just not up to the level. While most of the time it delivers and enhances the pleasant experience, some tracks are just ruining the feel for me, which is a shame.Final score 9.5/10 for an indie game. Easily best thing in the genre since FTL and i already want more of it. There are many games where i couldnt give less of a♥♥♥♥♥♥about DLCs, this is not one of them, like in FTL i think a few new systems would be just fantastic, but i understand they would be hard to balance out in this fantastic game. And a very solid 8/10 as a general game, - seems to me like a lot of people might see it as too punishing at times.Very recommended for purchase.			"

												The furious clatter of the keyboard in the room behind me nearly drowned out the persisent hum of machinery, but it was better than listening to Nurse Deena yelling about everything.  When she was on task, she was very competent, which more than made up for any social shortcomings.  She was also an excellent shot.Somewhere ahead, deeper into the darkness, I was sure Mitzi was having a conversation with herself again.  She makes me a little nervous - I watched her tear apart monsters with her bare hands - but she's all we have. We lost Elise earlier.Elise was our lynchpin, and could hold a breach with her armor and weapons all by herself. The best we could tell, she detonated explosives in a room full of those highly volatile bloated creatures.  There wasn't much left to salvage. A flicker ahead was Mitzi in position. I took a deep breath, checking my weapon.""Ready here"", I exhaled. ""Open it""			"

												Purchased by a friend as a gift for around $5. Worth every penny, I normally hate ""do a level so many times you learn how to beat it"" type of games, however, this is a true roguelike in which every run, every level is 100% varied. Different power ups, play styles, your team all matter and this game 100% encourages trial and error with a lot of reward when you get it right.			"

												I'm not a rogue-like fan.  So take what I say with a grain of salt.Pros:- Decide what you want to build to boost science, production or food output- But there's a break-even cost associated depending on how many doors any level has- It's also possible to get infinite food and production with just the right technologies at an early enough level- The tower defense element of the game is a really great twist.- The story-line connection with other Endless games is compelling.Cons:- Even with maxed out characters all at level 15, by the 9th floor sometimes there just wasn't enough energy to light up rooms and it became impossible to defend the crystal.  This gave me the impression the game is purely luck of the draw - if you don't get good dice rolls, skill won't matter.- There are many red-herring technologies and part of the game is learning how the game will play at the higher floors.  The learning curve is a bit like a very enormous ""Simon"" memory game - repeat the buttons until your memorize them, only here you are memorizing the relevant technologies.- Almost won't play at all on my MacBook Pro - I have to back off the screen resolution or it's completely broken!So even though I feel I got my money's worth, and I might play more, I don't feel there's much redeeming value to the game.  It's a bit stupid that way.  I keep asking myself ""is this gameplay really very rewarding"" and often the answer is no - it feels like more of a grind.Nevertheless, I watch Amplitude's Unite 2014 video where they explain how they made the game and it was great food for thought.  It's a HORRIFYINGLY inefficent.  They show how they came up with shader solutions to some problems, and then neglected to use those same solutions for utilizing a perspective camera at long-range and instead opted for orthogonal.  So close - and they just gave up and shipped it with an orthogonal view.  This makes me cringe a little bit every time I play it - that there's so much being missed and potential the game had and it was lost.TL:DRIf you are only going to buy 1 rogue-like, this is not it.

												Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike tower defense. You crash land a small party on an alien planet and have to fight your way to the top (or maybe it’s bottom, I’m a bit confused on that point.) Along the way you will open doors that will trigger waves of enemies to appear and try to destroy power crystal from your escape pod that you’re dragging along. When you finish off the attackers you prepare for the next wave by building resource generators and defense turrets, equipping heroes and researching new technologies. Then you open another door and rinse and repeat until you find the elevator going to the next floor or you die.From what I understand about game design Dungeon of the Endless has optimal tension curve. You have really exciting moments right after you open the door and periods of calm preparation between them. The tension rises during each level as you never have enough dust to power on all the rooms, as well as along the levels as difficulty increases and you meet more and tougher enemies.  It’s really cool that it’s set in the same universe as other endless games. And even though personally I can’t recognize anything other than Food, Industry, Dust and Science I wish more games would do this. The pixel art used in Dungeon of the Endless is something that takes some getting used to and it can be sometimes hard in the heat of a battle to tell what kind of enemies you’re fightingDad rating: GoodEven though killing off the waves can take some time you can pause the game at any point. And save and quit between the waves. Contains pixelated monsters and some fighting, it’s a bit hard to say if kids will be scared.I recommend Dungeon of the Endless because it’s a game that I sit down to play for 20 minutes and find myself 3 hours after my bedtime trying to tear myself away from it.

												First things first. I really like the company behind this game, I have already Endless Space, now Dungeon of The Endless, and will later this November sale will be getting Endless Legend. The science with each of the three games are mastered down to a key in my book.Ok now for the review of Dungeon, I'm still finding new things in game, while on top of that new updates that keep me coming back for more, and I HAVE YET to beat 15 floors in one run, but the best part that is me finding out the different tips and tricks that i've seen actually work more or less! The hereos are a fun mix of characters, meaning Loner types, Out Going Social types and so forth.  I still cant believe of the time I'm writing this review I have 30 hours, it only feels like im at 5 still!			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access-version is fun and well worth the money. Great soundtrack, nice setting and a fun game to play. Good combination of rogue-like low-tech adventure game + tower defense. If they enrich the game with similar high-quality features this will be a indie-game-of-the-year-candidate. To be fair, the early-access-version is short - three levels and some finished the game in 30 minutes, I spent 2 hours figuring it out. Some seem to complain about the learning curve, as not everything is explained-as-to-a-child. If you are fine with ""learning-by-doing"", early access is for you!			"

												Amplitude have a habit of making games that are very well designed, finely balanced, challenging but, above all, fun to play. DotE is another example - there is a lot of content here and much to master and the re-playability factor is high. Very much recommended, particularly for those with a love of any of the multitude of genres that have been spliced into this devilish concoction.			"

												That's the kind of game that should be thrown at light speed right into the face of the people who said that great ideas can't beat fancy graphic and realistic animation. Dungeon of the endless is hard to define, a bit of tower defence, a bit of rogue like, a bit of strategical, probably one of the best games on steam with this price. Tip: play with friends 'cause it's more fun and 'cause servers are empty, also the long duration of a single game can brought to the disconnection of the host leaving you with a growing and unstoppable rage caused by hours lost... and that's unhealthy			"

Early Access Review
								It's a really creative mixture of genres and a lot of fun. Another surprise of the producers of Endless Space. At the moment though the game seems a bit too random to me. Depending on the layout of the rooms you get, you can end up in quite hopeless situations and the enemies take you down from all sides, or if you're lucky it can be a very easy linear path.     WARNING: The game can be finished in about 1 hour, so currently not worth the money in my opinion. But it looks like there will be a lot more content implemented soon...			"

												I'm glad for the free weekend, because after a single 4-hour session beating the game on ""too easy"", and checking the wiki to see if I missed anything interesting (I didn't), I'm done with this game.The basic gameplay loop is this: Open a door, pause the game, put enough turrets and heroes between the enemy and your core, unpause the game, watch enemies die, repeat. Tactically, the difference between a hero and a tower is that the hero can move around the map. That's about it. With 20+ rooms on each of 12 levels, it gets repetitive rather quickly once you have an approach.There are a bunch of items and abilities, but the vast majority of them are minor stat boosts, with the most game-changing of them being a basic taunt. One of the more common abilities gives you more money for parking a hero in a room with an econ tower, which is about as boring as it sounds.Ultimately I'm glad I didn't have to spend money to find out this game isn't for me.

												Gave it an honest try, and I wish I could like it more. It has a lot going for it in terms of aesthetic and theme.But it just loves being a ""Rogue-like"" so much that it actively detracts from the game itself, and this is from someone who likes Roguelike games!The game knows what it wants to be but it's to an extent it's not enjoyable. From the very tutorial it advertises that there's a lot that it doesn't teach you, and to find out things yourself. By dying. Well, that's cool, sincerely. But could you have at least pointed out where to use Research Points? Because it doesn't, and you find out by interacting with Crystals that are randomly found on each floor, an essential mechanic for one of the core resources that is unexplained.Of course, it uses idiosyncratic difficulty names -- ""Too easy"" and ""easy"" -- that older games used for flavor... and most modern games avoid because it's unintuitive to what someone entering a game should expect out of their game.The fact is that it blends two very unforgiving genres together, but explains less than it really should. Tower Defense games have walls of text to describe the functions of things for a reason, and the less descriptive a roguelike game is the harder it is by nature. Not a bad thing, but combined with the mindset of a Tower Defense game -- pure strategy, based on what is being given to you -- the difficulty is spiked up because the tools available are less known.The straw that broke the camel's back for me was that it lacks autosave, and it is liable to crashing. Two bad but acceptable things that combined in a modern game becomes unacceptable. Almost every modern Rogue-like game has auto-saving that is of course written over when the game is opened up again, just as a quality of life feature.The core gameplay itself is good, but I can't recommend this game as a complete, polished product. And that's not even a railing against ""indie"" games. You don't see these problems with the current tried-and-true top rated Roguelike games, which offers options for a range of difficulties and self-induced challenges rather than sticking you out with ""Easy"" as the hardest difficulty. As I played more and understood the game more, the focus became less the difficulty and more the disatisfaction with continuing a tower defense loop that offered minimal room for advancing strategy and thoughtfulness, and instead focused on a slow grind. Games that encourage wiki help don't lack nearly as much instruction as this one.			"

Posted: December 7, 2014
												A bad game that I want to recommend but just can't.DotE sits between two genres, RPG and Tower Defense and is pretty poor at both.The characters follow the Fire Emblem rules in that certain characters surviving splunks together will get a bonus and develop a personal story between them but death means dead, no reviving. The Tower Defense aspect comes from your need to keep your master crystal in one piece and failure to do so is game over.These are really cool features so how does the game fail at them?First of all the characters don't interact until every stage is finished so most of the time they are just characterless which is unfortante because they are really well animated and when they do engage in their stories they are interesting, so why are they so mute the rest of the time?They also die, very easily and very often and the game likes to mock you about this fact with ""let the tears flow"" which doesn't upset but rather what it does do is make me indifferent. Imagine if in Final Fantasy 7 when Cloud goes mental after falling into the Lifestream that the game just says 'Cloud is crazy, your heroes moved on'. Suddenly the whole impact of the gravity of the situation is gone which is what happens when I lose a hero. I don't care that I lost them because the game doesn't make me care.Characters level up, have stories, are unique and well drawn and yet that is where the RPG element ends. The characters are for the most part interchangable. Some operate modules and others can take or deal a lot of damage but other than that the characters lack any of the things that make Fire Emblem a joy to play which is a shame.So the other side of the coin is Tower Defense. As far as TD games go, you open doors and gain dust. Dust powers rooms which allow you to power turrets. If you lack the dust (and you will) then you will soon be fighting waves of monsters and you will wipe. To counter this you can build lots of Industry and research the ability to power rooms wih industry instead of dust, a feature which becomes almost mandatory as the game goes on. Researching however is completely random so you may get shafted and be faced with an unwinnable game, just because. Thankfuly however the game makes the chance of this occouring, very low but know that it can happen.As for difficulty you will hear the game is too hard but this stems from the fact that ""too easy"" means normal and ""easy"" means very hard. If you play this game, keep this in mind because you will die on easy often and when you go to the forum to complain about it, believe me they know already. Everyone does.The TD aspect suffers from being dragged down by the RPG side and the RPG side suffers from being a hollow, empty experince for the majority of the game that never improves for examplewhen (or if) you finally beat the game what is your reward? See that store page picture? No I am not joking. Not even a ""congratulations"", you just get a stock picture and that's it. I didn't even believe I had beaten the game at first; What happened after that good opening cinematic, did the budget run out? Or did they not expect anyone to beat the game? I mentioned before how the game made me not care about the heroes and the ending just reinforces how lazy the RPG element is. The story doesn't even have a proper ending, not even a line of dialogue to let you know what our heroes did next, nothing.The music, the sounds, the art? All fantastic! But the gameplay is not good and that is a huge letdown because you really want to enjoy the game and you want to care about the world going on and the lore but each run is about as disjointed from the characters as you can get, the TD element is pretty badly done with nothing learned from fantastic TD games like Orcs must die and it just creates a really disappointing, mediocre game that you really wish was better.The netcode is great when it works but if you lose connection their is no re-join option and you can't pause/save a MP game so I hope you have a few hours to spare. This is also a game that suffers from making you go to a wiki to learn what things do and just add to the things that detract from what would otherwise be a fantastic game.Maybe future patches can help the game out because it does so much right that the things it does wrong are noticable like a beautiful person with a giant metal nose. You might admire the beauty but you can't ignore the nose either.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

Early Access Review
								Until this game is finished, I don't recommend playing it unless you can get it for DIRT CHEAP. The game itself is fairly interesting but missing most of the elements or mechanics that seem to be expected in providing interesting balance and whatnot. I'm not saying it's impossible to win, it's not... it's actually incredibly easy to finish a game (which is currently locked at I think 5 stages) but my problem is that it's too damn easy, there just aren't enough variables on both sides to provide a compelling and replayable game without using the same or similar builds you previously used that worked.So far it's barely worth a 2/5 and I would even go as low as 1/5 except it works well enough to allow you to get an idea of what they were invisioning, their goal is certainly not 'ambitious' regardless of what bs the company might be playing up for marketing purposes but it has potential to carve up a nice niche genre slice all of it's own.Combat is a solid 2/5 and IF it ever gets finished and continues at it's current pace will probably manage a 4/5.Exploration is a sad 1/5 as since an entire ♥♥♥♥ing mechanic (research tree) is missing, you have to rely on random drops to learn new tech which can be a significant burden on resources leading to a no win situation.Role Play is unfortunately a 1/5 as well since it seems that most if not almost all of the features they have yet to actually implement have been thought of for the current balancing and so there are times where you are either TOO powerful and just steam roll everything or you are pathetically weak and can't go any further without some serious resource spending (if you have any to spare/spend).Tower/Base building is 2/5 mainly due to my previous complaints (it feels like a good deal of the balancing is based on elements that have yet to actually be developed and/or released).I do like where the game is going and I really hope it is up to the same quality as Endless Space, since Dungeon of the Endless really does take most of it's ideas and naming conventions from it's parent game. I do also like just how much of a rehash this game has on several done to death genres like Tower Defence and Dungeon Crawl (Games that inspired Legend of Grimrock) scenarios without actually being an outright clone or 'spiritual successor' (Bioware, Dragon Age is not the 'spiritual successor' to anything except EA financier's bloated bank accounts... STOP MILKING IT) but I'm seriously concerned that we're going to see what has already been done to successful game IPs turning into mediocre or worse sequels and threequels.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is a fun game.  That being said you sometimes randomly lose to the dreaded plus sign narrow hallway.  If this hallway (with a shop in the middle) spawns in the only path to the next floor, you will be unable to pass it and move on.Also the multiplayer is pretty terrible unless you're playing with good friends.  The level of coordination required is too much for random people.Recommended if on sale, you don't mind losing to bugs, and only want to play single player.			"

												Had been watching this game on the store for ages, and gave in when it was on special and also picked up a DLC pack. What the movies and info doesn't tell you is that the game is effectively a simple clicky game with little to no strategy. It fulfills all the niche 'hip' cliche's from a couple years ago : 8 bit GFX, rogue-like, random, progressive, blah blah blah.But in the end all your doing is exactly the same thing for 12 missions to unlock another ship to do exactly the same thing over and over again. I play Warframe .. I know ALL ABOUT doing the same thing over and over again and really enjoying it.But this really missed the mark with me.My beef's are : 1. The game takes a LONG time to play. Nothing is done quickly, and there is very little excitement after the first few rooms you unlock.2. The 'unique characters' really don't have much differences to them. Sure this woman runs a bit faster and this guy has a different gun. But they're all much of a much-ness. 3. The weapons available to you are very thin with a clear progression. There's no 'fun' in the armory. Sure there's some gags and what not but after you've read them you don't really care. I was expecting real choices between items : eg. pick this one for an obscure boost over a certain gain with this item. 4. The interactions between the characters are so few and far between, and really amount to nothing. With such an advertised diversity I was expecting them to have a bit more personality but it's all just 'the first guy has an extra +1 gun skill, the second guy runs a little bit faster, the third guy does something else, etc'. 5. There is very little replay value. I got to level 11 on my first go, and then got bored and started watching TV so one of my guys died, and after that it was useless to try to continue. It wasn't a challange, it was just pointless. 6. It's not worth $12 (US) .. I bought this on special and honestly I've played games for 99c a hell of a lot more and had a ton more fun. Even at half price I feel like I should have thrown it back to Steam for a refund. But I bought it and played it and will give the dev's their dew and money for it.Overall, do your research before buying. It wasn't my cup of tea even though it really looked like it would be.If you're unsure just buy TeleGlitch and have some fun with that because it kinda does everything this game say's it does  but does it in a way that's actually fun. Even Chainsaw Warrior is better even though it's massively simpler and about 99% less involved. Underwhelming and over rated.Sorry guys. But hey at least your marketing strategy worked.  "

												Maybe surprisingly, I do not recommend this game to the general public. It's just too hard and a little niche.I did only play it on the free weekend. But still! >5 hours!tl:dr: For the hardcore puzzle/tower-defense-but-not-tower-defense player. Otherwise, get it on >50% sale.Don't get me wrong, it's fun, have put a few hours into it myself, but the amount of time one run takes is a little exhausting.Each room is 10-45 mins, with 13 rooms, each longer and harder, riding an exponential curve type-of-deal. I poured ~5 hours with a friend and have only gotten to level 11 (unfinished though).Thankfully you can save and continue, though. And multiplayer is essentially bug free. (You can even save and continue your multiplayer games!)It may be that I came into it expecting a ""sit down and finish in one sitting"" type of game (there is no save button in the interim/elevator screen, but only actually in the level can you ""esc"") and got a ""sit down and REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE but you can't because it's already been 3 hours and you're only 75% done"".Also rage inducing when you run out of resources / never have enough light / the music is a little depressing / it's dark / the item rolls kept giving you assault rifles when you need a sword / did I mention the atmosphere was a little depressing?Otherwise, beyond the complaining, the ship models are FANTASTIC, the textures are excellent, the animations are good, there are shadows, yes *REAL SHADOWS* in a pixel game. Sound design is good too, but I mean, you're stuck underground so it's gotta be a little dark and moody.Overall:Visuals: 9/10 dat non-pg miku doeSound: 6/10 watcha gonna do when u stuck underground?Gameplay: 5/10 hardhardhard, but mechanics are greatMultiplayer/Gui/MetaSys: 10/10 all really well done and smoothWhy I don't recommend this game with such >5/10 ratings?

Has promise, but is frustrating for new players.Right off the bat, I didn't appreciate the 'humor' in the ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" difficulty settings.  I say to myself, ""I always play Normal or Medium difficulty in games, so Normal / Medium must unlock after you complete the game on Easy!  So I'll play on Easy!""  Uh, no.  After seven frustrating attempts later, I almost give up entirely and uninstall the game... ""Easy"" is the developers joke.

Has promise, but is frustrating for new players.Right off the bat, I didn't appreciate the 'humor' in the ""Too Easy"" and ""Easy"" difficulty settings.  I say to myself, ""I always play Normal or Medium difficulty in games, so Normal / Medium must unlock after you complete the game on Easy!  So I'll play on Easy!""  Uh, no.  After seven frustrating attempts later, I almost give up entirely and uninstall the game... ""Easy"" is the developers joke.  The difficulty levels are actually ""Normal"" and ""Hard"".  <sarcasm>Very funny.</sarcasm>  Not a good introduction to a game.So in one last attempt to at least experience the game and give it a fair shot, I played the game on ""Very Easy"".

												The deal breaker for this game is the dumb*** decision by the creators to delete the players save file after its been loaded. WHY!?!?! The creators of this game must have bumped their heads. I understand its a rougelike, but it doesn't take into account if a player crashes. You might be asking yourself how often something like this happens, the answer is often enough to be a problem; and it might be slightly tolerable if they warned you about this reality when you load a save, but no, fly b***h. I love sinking several hours into a game only to restart, not as a result of my own ineptitude, but because of shin kicking mechanics programmed into the game! The bottom line, there's no excuse for this tom F***ery, the game has been out long enough for this problem to be resolved. FIX YOUR S**T!			"

As it stands now it's more about micromanagement and twitch strategy than skill which is fine if that's your thing but not for me.Also the tower defense part doesn't really work - you can't earn enough rescources to pay for the sheer amount of defense you need to effectively defend room(s) that you're not stood in.

												4/10 (Bad)Dungeon of the Endless is a supremely crappy game that borders on unprofessional.I can't even describe its genre, because it haphazardly throws together practically random elements of several genres that simply don't go together. If I had to take a guess what they were going for, it's a frantic tower defense (?), but its atrocious control scheme & interface combined with contrived and frankly needless resource management slow the game to a crawl and only confuse the player. Furthermore, you don't really control anything that's going on; you just turn things on and off and hope your characters don't die where you've stationed them. Your control over the fight? You can clumsily move your mouse to the green + next to their portrait to heal them if you have Food available.By the way, the only thing making this game any different from a tower defense? ENEMIES CAN SPAWN ANYWHERE ON THE PATH TO YOUR TOWER, in any room you haven't turned the ♥♥♥♥ing lights on in. What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that? Did I mention that the only resource to heal your characters is acquired by opening doors, thus creating MORE ROOMS you can't possibly keep lit, thus allowing more monsters to spawn than you can possibly manage?I have absolutely no interest in the outcome when I play this game, because due to the absolutely idiotic design choices made in this game, I'm not actually playing anything. The game pretty much does its own thing and tells me to go ♥♥♥♥ myself.Just about everything about this game is terrible; the horrendously awkward and self-defeating gameplay, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ faux-retro graphics that make it impossible to tell what's going on, and was there even music?? At all??Oh and lest I forget: absolutely no game should ever require the middle mouse button or scrollwheel in gameplay. That's all there is to that.Roguelikes in general are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pretentious games, but this is just convoluted garbage. Do yourself a favor and play something good like Rogue Legacy, not this crap.			"

												I feel this game could maybe have some potential, if 2 of the basic mechanics werent so bad. And that mechanic is moving and attacking. The game literally tells you ""You dont have control over your characters attacks"". they also should have told you you have no control over how your characters move. When you move your character, rather than moving them around the room, making for a better game, you move them from room to room. I could be okay with this, if it didnt make the combat even worse. You have NO control over your characters attacks, how they attack, who they attack, or if they EVEN attack. Without the ability to move your characters across the room, or choose how or what they attack, combat is just annoying, cause you just sort of KNOW they will die. You see, one of the things that make games that allow you direct control over your characters great, is that you can move around as you attack, and choose who you attack and when. The problem with this game, is that you cant do any of that, you cant choose how or when or if your characters attack, all you can do is equip them with gear and move them room to room, placing capsules and stuff in each room. And another big problem, is that enemies will appear in rooms you have already been in. Sure you get an alert that they are there, but there is no POINT. There isnt even any reason as far as i can tell, except for the fact that they will go back and attack your ship. Its not like doors open, or theres an enemy spawn there, they just suddenly appear, which is less of a problem, and more of a thing that makes you go ""are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?"". If they either:  1) Got rid of the enemies appearing out of nowhere, or 2) give you at least SOME control over your characters. The game CAN be good, but only if the developers truly want it to be.I know i only have .2 hours on it, but until they fix these things, It just isnt fun to play....			"

												Hard as hell even on ""Easy"" for all the wrong reasons.  The tutorail is awful and nothing is explained well in-game.  Don't expect to get anywhere without having the wiki open on a 2nd monitor or alt-tabbing all the time.If you can get past all that, it's actually a pretty good game, but even so the RNG can literally give you unwinnable levels, especially on the first or second floor where it's entirely possible to have the exit spawn so far away you can't create a safe path to it and your heroes aren't leveled up enough to deal with the constant waves.If you're a big roguelike fan, I think you should pick this up.  But if not I can't really recommend this game in its current state.			"

												In short: A superb blend of RPG Rogue-like dungeon-crawling with light tower-defense (which is a mouthful !).You start by picking two characters (all characters are unique, with broad classes). With the selection out of the way you procede into the game proper. You explore the ""dungeon"" you find yourself in by opening doors and building. Once a room is cleared of enemies you can then build turrets -to protect your starting point- and other modules (that do a variety of things, including increasing the resources you gain each time you open another door). You also have limited ""power"", you can power a room to prevent enemy units from spawning and to enable building. You can also find merchants, extra characters, and ""relics"" -which enable the ability to spend resources on researching better turrets and modules. The game is pausable at any point, and the game moves forward everytime you open a new room. Once you find the exit (or better yet, explore the entire floor) you must pick up a crystal at your starting point and race to the exit, all while your other characters defend from waves of enemies that spawn from each unpowered room. I have not done this game justice in this short review, but it is definately a must-play with enormous depth and replayability.The music is excellent, as is the art-style.			"

It is a combination of protect the core Tower Defense, action rpg, escaping with core, and resource management.The only downside, is when the RNG decides to deal you an unwinnable level(very rare, but happens).  It has a good bit of replayability, if you want to try out different strategies, and over all it is just nostalgic to see characters from different games, fighting together to survive.This game isn't for everyone, some will instantly hate it, while others will love it.

												Dungeon of the Endless is the most refreshing game I have encountered in the last 5 years or more.I have a weekly co-op gaming session with a friend of mine, with a psychometrically developed scale to rate the quality of our gameplay experiences.DotE rates up there with Diablo 3. We get engrossed in the experience. The visuals are incredible. There are tons of resource and defense module choices which let us change our playstyle, along with characters and pods which change decisions on a broader level.This is an incredibly solid game that we have played longer than our typical game-rating sessions go because it's that good.

												Reminds me of Dungeon Keeper, which i LOVED (not DK2 or DK3), but ...* gets repetitive really fast: you open a door, kill all randomly spawned enemies, open a door, kill all randomly spawned enemies, open a door, ...* One run takes really long, just to suddenly get pwned because of a misclick (how often i moved a ""parked"" hero by accident, losing the next turn's income)* ""no"" abiliy to save and restore a game. You just copy the game's data-folder around to restore a game-state. This seems to be there to make the game harder - well it just sucks. (Also their files inside the game-dir are really WEIRDLY named)* The mix of realtime vs turnbased playstyle is weird. Most Abilities stay up for like 8 sec, while the cooldown takes 2-3 turns.Basically: was fun and weird - will not buy.			"

												Recent purchase, new to the game.It's fun, but when the game crashes (or locks up) you're forced to start from the beginning, which is a serious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Even if you've saved and quit once before, if your game doesn't save and exit properly you're ♥♥♥♥ed out of your progress. It's not a dealbreaker, but it makes me stop playing the game after it happens and not want to start again for a long time. I won't recomend this game until they figure a way to fix that, especially when the hallmark of the game is ""this is endless, see how far you can go.""			"

												Where to start where to end...""Rogue-Like"" is now synonymouse with cheap random difficulty because lazy devs don't care to properly balance their game.  This game is a promising concept wrapped around the good old fashion risk/reward dopamine problem.  This is fun for some people... so if you like to win games because you get lucky then by all means get it.If you like to win a game because you honed your skillz... then avoid, you will only be ultimately dissapointed when you realize that you only ever win because you got lucky this time around.Additionally, the save system still appears to be broken.  I saved a game only to come back unable to continue because that was greyed out even though the game askes me if I am sure I want to start a new game losing the old game it will not let me play.  Game devs should never let game save bugs like this & others last this long, that is just terrible.			"

												Dungeon of the Endless is the most refreshing game I have encountered in the last 5 years or more.I have a weekly co-op gaming session with a friend of mine, with a psychometrically developed scale to rate the quality of our gameplay experiences.DotE rates up there with Diablo 3. We get engrossed in the experience. The visuals are incredible. There are tons of resource and defense module choices which let us change our playstyle, along with characters and pods which change decisions on a broader level.This is an incredibly solid game that we have played longer than our typical game-rating sessions go because it's that good.

												I bought this game while on early access and i was surprised at the frequency of updates i recieved from it! it updated at a faster rate than starbound (then again what game DOESNT update more than starbound?) and within days after buying it, i already started to see results. for a quick TLDR on the game....:You control a team of inmates, guards, and crewmen that were held within the prison ship entering the orbit of a planet lost to the ages. Unfortunately for everyone on board, the orbital defense systems from the ancient race of aliens came to life and blew the prison ship to bits. one escape pod was shot during the chaos. This is where you come in.Every dungeon is randomized and you will get a diffferent play through every time which keeps the game fresh and appealing. Probably the coolest thing about the game is that every character in the game (idk about the special ones from the packs) has interactions with other characters. You will know when you find this interaction when the two begin having conversations on the elevator ride to the next floor complete with yellow text and special dialogue. Survive three floors and you get to hear the whole story between the two PLUS they usually buff each other.Only downside to the game is the multiplayer. Be sure to grab some friends for this one or get alot of single player experience under your belt since i've noticed alot of skilled players handing out rolls and such. make sure you have a basic idea of the game or play with a group of friends for the best possible experience. ALSO and i CANNOT stress this enough: expect your multiplayer game to possibly cut out on you if you get a slight connection disruption. the Servers for the game are still in early stages so it's to be expect. Just be patient with it as the team behind the game fixes problems and glitches very fast.PROS:-Fantastic art-Very immersive sountrack-A new level of depth and strategy from the tower defense combined with the rpg items-Enjoyable characters with their own unique stories and personalities. my favorite story between two characters is title ""Downfall""! up to you to find who has that story -.o-action packed wave defenses that will leave you holding your breath in the later floors-excellent difficulty scaling. if you thought floor one was bad.....heh just make it to the last one and prepare to cry!-very fluid animations for a 2d pixal art gameCONS:-the game is in a league of its own thus creating a high learning curve. Stick with the game and it will come to you with practice-multiplayer service disruptions (this is planned by G2G to be fixed with time)The fox fur's over all score of the game?a very well earned 9/10when they fix those service disruptions, this game will be on my top played list. only reason i havent put more time into this game is that having a job kills alot of that time!~Roka~			"

								An honest to god 9/10 game. Played and loved it so much I went ahead and sold some pixels for Steam Credits™ for the Founder's pack.Pros-Beautiful artstyle-Unforgiving-Easy to learn and use interface-Gameplay that is actually fun-A tower defense mechanic that isn't just tacked on but serves a purpose-Characters are all individual in their abilities and not copy pasted-Gameplay encourages exploration of a levelCons-A recent update made it so that the merchants will often take resources as payment rather than the dust. This update also lowered the amount of dust found on a level. Because of that the ability to gain resources has been stunted because by the second floor you can't have enough of any one resource due to you not being able to actually place any form of harvester-*The skill sheets in the drop down box will often bug and do the opposite of what you want it to do.(If you want to use the skill then it will sometimes drop down the box and if you want the box it will drop down the skill)* (This could be fixed by moving the skill box lower below the activateable skills and by allowing the player to change the opacity of it.)-*A recent update replaced the hero texture on the right side with close ups of the hero's face, it bugs me personally but doesn't detract from gameplay*-At the last door all non lit rooms will spawn monsters and they will come and come and come. 9 times out of 10 for me this ends in my death. I don't want to see this removed but I would like to see more dust dropped per level.(** are minor complaints, not hugely problematic but an annoyance for me)Like i said, a good 9/10. Even with the few flaws the game is one that I sometimes find hard to put down.Great job lads.			"

												This game isn't worth the money. It's quite boring, the difficulty is too high, and while I'm sure I could beat it if I invested the time and energy, there's nothing in the game engaging enough to motivate me to do so. Also, it's a hodgepodge mishmash of different genres, although it doesn't do any one of them particularly well IMO. Buy only if you like games that are difficult for the sake of being difficult or are obsessed with combining genres together.			"

												Really wanted to like the game, the atmosphere's great, the design is done beautifully, and it's an interesting twist on a existing concept.However, support is non-existant, they created a ""controller mode"", however it's impossible to manually rebind keys. That doesn't sound too bad, except if you are unlucky, under some configurations, your Xbox controller will not function properly, and the button necessary to heal your characters will not work... Even worse, the button required to go to the next level will not be bound, leaving you to die endlessly at level 1. I suppose the name didn't lie, it is endless, as in impossible to finish.So all in all:Design 8/10Gameplay 6/10 (It is pretty fun up to the point where you get to watch your characters die every game at the last room of the first floor while you desperatly try to press RT)Support 0/10 (1 week after reporting bug, ""Doesn't work, that's odd.""  The end) Used as a Sisyphus Simulator or a art commentary on the pointlessness of struggling after a space crash ? 10/10. "

If you are really determined you can finish the map but only if you know roughly where items should be on the black screen. Hawever, even if you pass the level (floor), game crashes between levels without saving. So next time you open the game there is no çontinue'option :(Reached high levels twice and both times same thing happened. Don't buy this game until it's fixed, you''ll only get dissapointed and frustrated.			"

No matter what characters, what level I have them at, what gear they have, no matter what the hell I do, the game throws an unbeatable floor 12 at me every single time. You start with ONE gold bar to light rooms up with, and nearly every single time, on floor 12 the rooms give no gold. You cannot win. I despise the fact that you have to luck yourself into ideal scenarios, that's not skill, that's rolling dice.This game is dice-rolling masquerading itself as some sort of strategy. It isn't.			"

												Honestly I don't know if I recommend this game or not. I wish there was a ""thumbs sideways"" button instead of just up or down.On one hand, the mechanical depth is surprisingly good and if we rate ""your money's worth"" at ""<$1 per hour of enjoyable gameplay"" then I'd say I got my money's worth.On the other hand, this trend of intentionally terrible graphics has to stop. The graphics in this game are ""distractingly bad"". As in, so bad, it's hard to keep my head in the game because the graphics just keep distracting me with how terrible they are. Yeah yeah retro, blah blah, whatever. But what they're trying to do with the characters and the room environments is just too ""busy"" for the graphics to be this low resolution. FTL was similarly bad but simple enough that it didn't seem quite so distracting. In this game it's distracting.If there was a sequel that promised to be even deeper and more interesting and better in every way but with identical graphics, I wouldn't buy it. So, I got my money's worth here but I'm not sure I would go so far as to recommend it.Dear 8-bit graphics trend, please die.Die. Die. DIE.			"

												So, I had the opportunity to try this on a free weekend, and I was enjoying it quite a bit until I ran into a couple of bugs that resulted in my being unable to progress.The bugs in question seem to be collision or pathfinding in nature. One involves a cross shaped room, where if you place a module it can prevent you moving past and, if your character is close to it when it deploys, can cause the character to get stuck and be unable to move even after you destroy the module. Loading and reloading will allow you to move again and resolves the pathfinding problem, which would be a little irritating but overall a small issue, however I encountered a problem with the enemy pathfinding that caused them to get stuck inbetween rooms and due to this, you can't save and quit.I ran into this scenario 3 times when I was around 3/4s of the way through the game causing me to waste about an hour to an hour and a half of my time altogether. Because of this I do not recommend purchasing this game, although I may revise my opinion in 6-12 months when they, hopefully, patch it and if I find it on sale for a few dollars. Not going to waste my money on this game full price after my experience with it.			"

												Dungeon of Endless is a very unforgiving game for a tower defensive, hack and slash kind of game. Not really a model breaking game, there's not much about this game for me to talk about. The multiplayer option is brutal, even on easy mode. It has a story, yet, the game was too busy trying to murder you with iits randomly feneraing monsters and creatures, you'll encounter, to actually tell it. Oh, they could have worked on the character rostr, too; Not enough diversity.			"

												Fun game, but has game impeding bug (at least on Mac). When you play for a while and reach high floor then zoom glich kicks in and you can either see a tactical map or black screen. If you are really determined you can finish the map but only if you know roughly where items should be on the black screen. Hawever, even if you pass the level (floor), game crashes between levels without saving. So next time you open the game there is no çontinue'option :(Reached high levels twice and both times same thing happened. Don't buy this game until it's fixed, you''ll only get dissapointed and frustrated.			"

												I didn't like the core gameplay mechanic. It feels almost like an attempt to make an action version of a 4x, which didn't do much for me. I did however, find the strange notes that you find at the end of the game REALLY cool. If I enjoyed the game play more, I'd have had fun trying to figure out what was really going on in behind the scenes.			"

												While the game is fun if you enjoy tower deense games, it has a bug where there is no exit to a level, causing you to lose all progress. No point in playing as you can play for an hour or more, then come across this bug that cuases you to need to restart the game and lose all progress.This game has been out for a while now and it still has not been patched, and I see others have had the same problem. I definetly will never buy any games from the developer again.			"

												So, I had the opportunity to try this on a free weekend, and I was enjoying it quite a bit until I ran into a couple of bugs that resulted in my being unable to progress.The bugs in question seem to be collision or pathfinding in nature. One involves a cross shaped room, where if you place a module it can prevent you moving past and, if your character is close to it when it deploys, can cause the character to get stuck and be unable to move even after you destroy the module. Loading and reloading will allow you to move again and resolves the pathfinding problem, which would be a little irritating but overall a small issue, however I encountered a problem with the enemy pathfinding that caused them to get stuck inbetween rooms and due to this, you can't save and quit.I ran into this scenario 3 times when I was around 3/4s of the way through the game causing me to waste about an hour to an hour and a half of my time altogether. Because of this I do not recommend purchasing this game, although I may revise my opinion in 6-12 months when they, hopefully, patch it and if I find it on sale for a few dollars. Not going to waste my money on this game full price after my experience with it.			"

												it's an ok game.  TL/DR at the endI think endless space and endless legend are THE BEST 4x games out there at the moment. Civ franchise and others (I own or have played the competition thoroughly) are a pale imitation of the design and depth of what the endless series brings.but: I just couldn't get into this game, despite playing it for a long time.I really really dislike the inability to clearly differentiate between monsters, the frantic nature of the game and the lack of strategy and tactics that comes with it.Tower defense and roguelites are my other favorite game types, so this should be a perfect fit. but due to the real time nature, it ends up muddled and frustrating.its pixel design is simply misplaced and overdone.in a game about exploration and monsters, I want to see beautiful environments, well designed monsters and clear strategy and tactics.neither the art nor the gameplay are 'clear' or allow me to just enjoy the game. it ends up a clickfest that forces me into the same boring tactics to cope with the games flaws.TL/DR:      I can only do well if I play in a manner that is wholly unenjoyable.note about the 1.99 addon:I'm owning everything(every addon, every single thing) Amplitude has ever released, except the rescue team addon: horrible feminism & diversity insanity inspired art -- no thanks.

A crashed prison ship, a group of strangers and 16 floors of death between them and freedom.  What's the worst that could go wrong?A brutally difficult tower defense / strategy game hybrid.  Manage resources to upgrade technology and characters with an ever decreasing amount of power to keep rooms lit (and not spawning monsters).The difficulty is both the game's greatest strength and weakness one wrong move and it's all over even after hours of play.

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Dungeon of the Endless 

			Views: 9		

			Today we check out Dungeon of the Endless. It is a rouge-like, tower defense, Roleplaying game (Phew). It's lots of fun and well worth checking out.		

What is it?Dungeon of the Endless is a tower defense, rouge like, roleplaying game. That is a bit long winded, so I'll break these down a bit. You play as a goup of adventurers who have crash landed on an ancient planet. You're goal is to get off of the planet by getting to the elevator on each level and powering it up. In order to do this you have to search through rooms, kill enemies, and loot awsome stuff. Every few rooms you explore, there will be a wave of enemies that tries to either kill you or destroy your power crystal. You have to defend this crystal (you need it to power the elevator). In order to do this, you power up the derelict rooms that you've searched and build towers to kill the waves of enemies. How hard can this be (you might ask)? Quite hard. The limiting factor in all of this is the four rescources you have to manage; industry, tech, food, and dust. Industry builds towers. Food heals and upgrades your heroes. Tech gets you new towers. Dust allows you to power more rooms. You get a certain amount of each of these every turn based upon how many large rescource producing towers you have. You also unlock characters and new escape pods as you go through the game. These will give you new options to start the game with.Pros:-Amazing soundtrack. From the start menu this music draws you into the world of Dungeon of the Endless.-Streamline gameplay. Everything is quick and easy to do in the game (the hard part is getting the strategy down).-Great visuals. All of the characters have great personality that is expressed even through their movements. For instance,  there is a character who thinks that she is a spider (crazy, right?). She even goes so far as to walk around on all fours, which I think is an awsome touch to the character. Cons:-There is no way to zoom out without entering the tactical view. This isn't terrible, but it would be great to be able to see the entire network in it's full color.This game is great and I'll be playing the heck out of it for quite a while. It is definitely worth picking up, and is worth way more than the current price.DLC: Is the Crystal Pack worth it?That is a question. I havn't purchased it, and I'm going to give it some time before I really decide wether or not to pick it up. All that the DLC adds in game is one character and an escape pod. I'd recommend picking up the game first and then upgrading it if you get hooked (which you're likely to).			"

												I think this is a beautiful game in many ways. I love the graphics and love the idea, the soundtrack is absolutely perfect... I love the roguelike genre.So why did I not recommend this?Well, just because I haven't found myself that interested in it. I bought it on sale and still don't feel great about it... I just am not interested in coming back.I could probably, to some extent enjoy playing some more. But it doesn't excite me anymore and it's not that compelling.. So why should I?I think this game could be great for some. I wanted to like this game so much, but it just didn't click for me.The first few hours of playing are incredibly fun. If that is enough for you, then by all means I recommend this game.I should also mention that this is more RNG based than most roguelikes. I've heard people complain about The Binding of Isaac being too RNG based... well if you thought that was bad just skip this. This game relies on RNG more than any other I have seen or played before. :(			"

Otherwise, you may want to wait until it's finished and see how it shapes up.			"

												This game is not in Early Access, so it is supposed to be finished, right? I haven´t played it much in singleplayer so i can´t say if there´s anything completely broken there. The multiplayer however i can tell you a great deal about how broken it is. It is actually entirely unplayable if your goal is to reach the final floor and beat it. I tried to play the game with my friends five times, the first four times the game got stuck on the transition to the 4th floor. We gave up and decided to wait until the multiplayer issues are fixed with a patch. When the ""save in multiplayer"" feature was added, we thought we could finally play the game. Oh boy, how wrong we were. We made it to the 10th floor this time. We finished the floor, put the crystal in the final room and got to the elevator screen. Well, three of us did. Unfortunately, the host was still on the floor when the rest of us were already on the elevator screen. We waited for about 10 minutes to see if the game would for some reason make a miraculous recovery. As we realized that we were hoping in vain, the host killed the game through the taskmanager. It´s no big deal, right? I mean, we have a savegame, so the worst thing that can happen is that we have to do the floor again, right? WRONG! The savegame was gone, our six hour progress was gone and so was any interest to start this frustrating piece of **** ever again. Don´t get me wrong, the game is fun and in singleplayer it´s probably a good experience. If you intend to play this game online with your friends, save yourself the money and frustration and go look somewhere else for a good co-op game.  As far as I´m concerned, I´m not going to bother with any further updates to this game, that claim that multiplayer bugs were fixed. Maybe I´ll come back in 2 or 3 years and give it a go then. Maybe by that time the game is ♥♥♥♥ing playable in multiplayer. Thanks for reading all of this.... had to get that out of the system. :)tl;dr: don´t buy if you want to play this coop with your friends, you´ll end up frustrated and wish you could just return the game.

												Could have been much better.Pros:-Random Generated Dungeon-Challenging-Lots of Heroes to unlock-Interesting tower defense meets dungeon rogue-like conceptCons:-Can't rebind all keys/mouse buttons in options. (Seriously Devs?)-Lacking in loot/items-Difficulty spikes too quickly - Making it more of a chore and less of a legit challenge-Ships you unlock have poorly designed drawbacks that make it to where you'd never choose them-Would have been much better without the ""Get the Crystal to the exit"" mechanic-Exploration is limited because each time you open a door the waves of monsters get drastically more difficult, effectively killing your desire to explore and loot. -Poor graphics-The Perks/Skills system is extremely underwhelming.-Overall bland gameplayThe game just doesn't execute.  Looting and exploring are really stiffled in Dungeon of The Endless.  Which you should never do to a dungeon game.  I understand challenging games like Dark Souls and Legend of Grimrock, but this isn't challenging as much as it is tedious.  The rewards aren't there. The characters, items, and gameplay aren't enough to warrant another playthrough.  Honestly to those that have taken part in giving this game ""Overwhelming Positive Reviews"" what other games are you really playing?  Play some real dungeon games, and then come back to this one.... Then we can talk.			"

												This game tries so hard to be too many different things. It starts off seeming like it's pretty great, but then the more times you play it, the more you realize in its efforts to be a little of everything, it's not good at any one thing particularly. There's too much resource management for this to feel like a true rogue-like, so you're constantly monitoring the amount of resources you have and lots of different modules. The tower defense elements are not really that well implemented, you must rely on the heroes to do much of the work - but if you try and stick heavy with leveling and outfitting your heroes, you'll get creamed later on in the game when the waves get much larger and more vicious. Even well equipped heroes with many bonuses have a hard time against some of these creatures, but unlike most tower defense where you can give yourself a lot of time to chip away at them, you really can't.In this game, you use dust to power rooms, without power the rooms can spawn creatures and you can't put any modules in that room. You can't light all the rooms, so at best you can just make it so they only approach from a few vectors. This chokepoint idea seems like it would be fun in theory, but in practice it works poorly. You have to place modules down to increase the resource gains per door opened (turn) but you'll almost have to place these along the route to the exit for each floor for them to be protected and useful. So you have to place your valuable modules in the direct path of where bad guys will be walking along, and they'll smash the modules quickly. To make matters worse, you must research every module besides a few very basic ones. This research does not carry over between matches, so you restart this process each new game. Each module takes 3 turns to research, but if you start research on one and there are only 2 doors left on the floor - you're SOL for the research you just spent on that. Again, in a game that was more balanced this would be an acceptable risk, but losing out on things like this will screw you over so fast you might as well just give up.So unfortunately, this game causes lots of frustration after you spend quite a long time on a run and then lose it because the game decides to throw too many creatures for you to handle. Whereas losing a run of Binding of Isaac or FTL is irritating but gives you another chance to learn without feeling to punishing, Dungeon of the Endless takes a lot of your time to get through a run and messing up after spending so much time on a match feels awful and sharply decreases your desire to make multiple runs. This game is much more of a sit down and make a run, and if you lose, just quit and come back another day (To compare, I found myself playing many runs of FTL and Binding of Isaac as both felt way more receptive to quick runs and not these long drawn out things). To make note - the creatures don't always spawn every turn, sometimes none spawn. Even with well prepared defenses, heroes set up in good positions, you will still get absolutely smashed. You'll be pausing to heal your hero, unpausing, then a second or two later pausing again to heal, until you either have nearly no food left or they just die. While all rogue-like games have that element of RNG and unpredictablility, Dungeon of the Endless piles that on top of a mediocre tower defense and dungeon crawler. FTL is frustrating for those same reasons (RNG), but you can tactically plan much better than you can in Dungeon of the Endless. This game is just too lackluster in too many areas to be worth it. Yes, the art style looks pretty nice and the music is pretty good - I wanted so much to like this game, but I just can't. The game has too much going on for its own good and brings down the overall experience completely.			"

												Alright.. i don't even feel like giving any kind of detailed review, i just need to get this out. I absolutely LOVE the visuals of this game, its just gorgeous and fantastic... but the gameplay.. i can't stand it... at all. The main reason why i can't stand it is because i'm just furious that this game is what it is, i can see hundreds of ways a game with such amazing pixel art and music could have been SO much better.. I KNOW its unique, i know its combination of multiple genre and all that... but OH MY GOD I JUST HATE ITS GAMEPLAY... I don't know much about these developpers but it just feels like the guy responsible for the art is a genius and the guy responsible for the gameplay is someone who thinks more complicated = better.. either that or there was some intense conflicting ideas at some point and this game is the result. I don't know... this game just makes me crave like crazy a game that looks exactly like this but with a completely different gameplay. If someone can make that happen, i will play your game. Thanks for reading.Btw i'am really sad to thumb down this game, but in the end even if your drooling over the visuals, the gameplay just matters more. And no i can't even push myself to play anymore than i have, the game literally makes me feel depressed, this is the first time i'v had this feeling with a game, its just crazy.			"

												This game title makes you think this goes on forever, something that I personally was interested in. It only has 12 floors, and while the difficulty does increase, it's an incredibly short and repetative game, There's very little depth and the dynamics are for the most part the same. Items are not diverse, it feels gimmicky, and unpolished. The graphics are appealing, the 8-bit remakes are everywhere and the nastalgia makes it high demand, and I feel for a 2013 title, the game was clearly trying to capitalize on it. That brings up my next point, the bugs. This IS a 2 year old game, and  the multiplayer is full of bugs. Heroes will randomly stop attacking, the movement is clunky, and it has a chance of freezing every 3-4 rooms, requiring a complete restart. Luckly it does have an auto save feature, but if you're not playing with friends, it's incredibly unlikely they will return to continue the game. This should not happen to a 2 year old game, period. This game was obviously rushed and unrefined, the dungeon is obviously not endless, and neither is my patience for this game.			"

												Could have been a good game. The mechanics and design are excellent, but a game like this was always going to come down to co-op play after a few hours, and MP here is a massive scam. Multiplayer just doesn't work after months, and their promises every couple of weeks about how they are investigating the instability and connection issues are just getting more and more pathetic.

Not even an auto save at te start of a level.I Highly recommend this game if you ARE ONLY going to play it SINGLE PLAYER and/or IF YOUR LIKE PERMA-DEATH CO-OP.Seeing as the main reason I got this game is to play Co-Op with someone else I am giving this game a NO to being Recommended.P.S. No way to revive your team members when they die in both Single or Multi-Player. Also no way to exchange items from one Hero to another in Single or Multi-Player.			"

												As of December 31, 2016 I have put 20+ hours into this game.I cannot recommend this at all.It is because the game is too difficult to start. What I mean by that is that the start of the game is too difficult so trying to start a run is too challenging and unfun. Not only is the game too challenging but the mechanics of the game is explained very minimally so in order to play you are required to lose several runs. However what furiates me the most is that there are controls that allows you to play the game more efficiently by binding groups with numbered groups but the only way to know about this is for you to just happen to take a look and notice that this is a possibility. The gameplay loop is very basic and throughout the game notihing new happens and the story feels tacked on.You get very few dialog popups when your characters open doors and complete the level and are given 1-2 lines of dialog from only 1 character. The dialog is very bland and does not explain anything and you might as well just skip over them as they provide no information on the setting, characters, monsters, anything. So esentially the game is very boring. Characters are uninteresting, gameplay loop is uninteresting, and the story is non-existent.I highly recommend that you save up your allowance and just buy something worthwhile of your precious time remaining on Earth.

												(Played this gamed mostly offline so the 2h are not represantative ;) )Pros:- Charming pixelated graphic stile (little bit overused at the moment but this game actually looks special)- Loads of characters that all play a little different- TF2 characters :D- Very atmosphericCons:- Very generic dungeon crawler- Extremely repetitive, no replayability at all- Not much room for tactics or strategy- Lacks depth in terms of item variety, character advancement and lore/background story- Only 2 difficulty settings (plus the fact that they are called ""too easy""and ""easy"" which just bugs the crap out of me, but thats just me i guess :D)Summary:Well, i would love to give this game a neutral thumb because i definetly had fun for 2 or 3 hours when i got to know the game and figured everything out, so the learning phase was really fun but...for 12 or 19 bucks there are other games on steam that keep you entertained for a longer time than that ;)...if its on sale go for it though :)			"

												I want to like this game, but it seems incredibly poorly executed.When I play something that advertises as ""rogue-like"" I expect a difficult game, but one that gives you enough information & options to succeed if you're careful and willing to die a few times. (The Dwarf fortess style of FUN)This game gives you the first (difficulty), but fails miserably at the second (tools to succeed).-You cannot examine enemies to identify which ones have the most HP, DPS, DEF, etc. -You cannot see any debuffs that they have cast on your character, instead you have to watch your stats to make sure you dont have a triple stacked DPS debuff on you. -You are given no information as to whether certain buffs/debuffs stack and to what extent they do so.-In the late game you simply have no idea how many monsters are in a mob, because they all overlap and noclip through each other. Making strategic decisions is pretty difficult when 10 monsters looks identical to 20.-You cannot examine your modules to see any of their stats, and have no way of identifying their HP, DEF, and the status of any Buff/Debuff on them.-You cannot control the positioning of your heros in a room, which is important for AI targetting & trying to establish a backline-You cannot chose your hero's targets, they shoot at whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they feel like shooting. You can't even set them to prioritize certain types of enemies-You cannot choose which unequipped items you want to put in your backpack (to keep) and which you want to put in the inventory (lost at the end of the level). You have to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with equipping and unequipping stuff to try to get it to put the right one in there, and it isn't always possible.As it stands it feels like an RNJesus crapshoot.			"

												Cool style and a neat idea, but there are too many elements and not enough time spent explaining them. The game is difficult, not in a challenging way. Ultimately, it's just hard to look at, hard to understand, and hard to play.1 - Pixel style is hard to look at -  it's hard to discern what is important to pay attention to, and this kind of pixel style, when done too noisily, is fatiguing on the eyes. In contrast, something like Superbrothers is much easier to look at, with restrained palettes and more balance tones/ contrast/ focus. This game is just too noisy.2 - Game doesn't teach you - A series of single-objective tutorial missions would have been helpful to demonstrate the game's many elements. There's just too much to track as a new player: I didn't understand how I could get more dust, what the large modules were for, how I even got the smaller dust modules I did, how many attack modules were optimal, any strategy or approach... just no sense of the relative function of many of the game's elements, which made it frustrating to balance the cost/ benefit of any decision. As if the main game (open doors, move, attack, build-things-to-do-things) wasn't enough, the character sheets and skills and equipment were just another layer of complexity to manage/ ignore. Overall poor job of teaching you how to play... and I know there is some benefit to letting players explore and discover mechanics, which is something games like Journey and Ico do well, but there's too many factors here and not enough thought put into a welcoming beginner experience.3 - Hard to control - having to individually control numerous characters was too much to manage. A follow function woud have been great to keep the party together. It's too easy to lose track of what's happening in combat (due to the low-fi pixel art and tight view) and lose party members.4 - Difficulty. Even on the easiest mode it's too challenging to finish a level. Once you grab the power crystal, a ton of enemies attack. I never felt like I had enough turrets to stop them or characters to hold off the enemies during the crystal run. I tried three frustrating times to finish the first level, to no avail, due to the difficult visuals, control scheme, game balance, etc. THIS WAS ON THE EASIEST SETTING ON THE FIRST LEVEL, FOR NEW PLAYERS.Anyway, a frustrating experience. There are more rewarding ways to spend one's time.			"

												I can't recommend this game. I can't even figure out how to play. I'm just gonna write how it went for me.I start the game. I pick up my controller, only to find it does nothing. I look in the options, and there is a controller mode. I click it and it tells me that I need to restart my game in order to use a controller. A little strange, but not too bad. After restarting, I begin the game, select my two characters, and press start. I suddenly find myself just dropped into the game after a very short cutscene that explained almost nothing. I eventually figure out how to move one character but not much else. There was no tutorial for starting the game for the first time. I pressed start, looking for the controls. Turns out, start only pauses the game. So I hit the back button and get my menu. I had to move to the last tab and select ""tutorial"" to get my tutorial. The tutorial, however, didn't help much, as all the controls in the tutorial are for keyboard and mouse! WHAT!? So I restart my game again after switching back to keyboard and mouse, and go through the tutorial. I make it through the tutorial and at the end, they basically say: ""We could also explain all the other stuff you need to know, but ♥♥♥♥ it. Find out by dying!"". Brilliant. So I continued on and got killed by the small enemies. I ♥♥♥♥ing died on the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ floor. On ♥♥♥♥ing Easy.*sigh*So yeah. Do not recommend.

												Actual name of the game is Detach Crystal: Get Overrun and Die.Music is annoying. Gameplay is slow as hell. Nothing you do is actually satisfying. Nothing is explained; the game even says you'll learn stuff as you die. Resources are so strictly limited and based on a guessing game it's pointless to try to plan anything.Oh, and based on the limited options available at the start of a run, you still die even if every room is packed with turrets. Good luck running your slow carrier through rooms infested with monsters practicaly immune to the only defense you have available. Can't even move power during the final sequence so the whole ""tactics"" bit they advertise is a load of horse poop.Game is crap. Save your money.			"

												Meh!Not sure why, sorry for the brevity.  I didn't hate it so much as ...You know a game is meh when you get to play it for free ... and find you don't want to play it any more while it is still free.Maybe you'll love it!  or not.  I just thought ... meh!			"

												I cannot recommend this game.I think there are some good elements, but the generations of levels and the roguelike aspect pushed to the point of no save in a game where it's actually real-time makes it a difficult game overall where a simple mistake can turn a whole game upside-down.The dungeons are pretty long, and whenever you get the gist of it, the first levels can go pretty well, but it gets tricky at some points, and to gain somehow the experience of how you would manage such a situation you have to go through an entire level again.Altough i get the idea of not casualise every game although there could be some difficulty level more balanced to allow casual players to enjoy the game.

												Dungeon Of The Endless is one of those games that tries to blend too many genres and fails. I purchased it for myself and my wife since it seemed to be an RPG of sorts, with a blend of tower defense. From all the videos we could see, you actually controlled one character. In reality, you don't really control characters so much as you direct them into ""rooms"", an action that not only is not super fun, but also feels incredibly clumsy and unrewarding. There is very little in terms of ""micro"" strategy in the game, as your position in combat barely seems like it matters. Building things is also not exactly fun. In general, there's just something missing for us in this game. It is overall just not a very satisfying experience to play. I did my best to get my wife to give it a chance, as she usually loves these types of games. Sadly, this game was the first time I've seen her quit out of a game in less than an hour. She *really* hated it and was dissapointed that it was not as it seemed. So I guess, maybe check this out if you're interested in the weird gameplay experiment they attempted. It really just didn't strike a chord with me or my wife. I suggest watching a ton of youtube let's play videos before you purchase this, it is definitely not for everyone.			"

												Nice idea, woefully executed.  I tried hard to like this game, I really did but from the appalling Spectrum-esque save system to the frustrating, tedious chore of the gameplay, this game just doesn't work on any level.  FFS Ah Diddums on the old Spectrum was less frustrating.  I only got this game because it was in the Endless Legend and Endless Space bundle and I'm considering not bothering with those games, and getting my money back, my opinion of the dev's abilities to make a GAME are now so low.  A complete waste of time and money			"

												Great Game in concept but first release has a billion bugs inside the multiplayer mode. I can't beleive they released this game in this state, as its otherwise a fantastic game.recommend only if they fix the many and annoying glitches in the next patch - serious lack of quality control.if you like DOTA u might like DOTE			"

												where to begin.- What i think. Almost everything is amazing about this game. I like the art style and i love the gameplay. And it just got better when it got co-op multiplayer. I think that when i looked at this game, when it was in early access, i thinked that the game looked like something to me, even though it was a strategy game ( It's not because i hate stragety game, i think that Age of Empires is a fantastic game, but that's another review, i could talk about that for days ) And i was acually right, in the beginning it looked weird, but when i got into the game, i think they knew what they where doing.-About the game.In the beginning you can see a list of characters, where you need to choose two characters, the cool thing is that if you need to play as more characters, you need to find the characters in the game, and then you need to do something to get the character, it's a bit hard, but it's acually fun, when you get into the game. After you have choosed your characters you start off, where your ship/space ship crash into a planet. The game is about where you need to protect a crystal, and find the exit door. In the game, you can buy things to protect your crystal and it will get easier to find the exit door when the enemies come. After you have find the exit door, you need to get the crystal to the exit, but be carefull, when you collect the crystal, a bounch of enemies after you. It's acually like The binding of Isaac, where after you have killed a boss you can get longer down in the basement. But just in Dungeon of the Endless you just get to another place, i think. There are 12 places in the level/ship, and one of the cool feature is that it isn't just 12 places in the level, but there are also other ships.I think that this game will be in one of my favorite list of games. I would really recommend this game, and i will give it a 7,25/10 :D			"

												The multiplayer is broken as hell. With 2 players, it will occasionally work. With anything more than that, it won't work. Joining a lobby works fine, but when the actual game starts loading, it will kick everyone but the host from the game. This happens with me, and several of my friends (5 of them). Combinations of any of us hosting don't work. If you host a game several (10+ times) with just one other person, you might get a game to start. But even then, you're not safe - sometimes in between floors, it will kick a player, and you're screwed. Again, this doesn't just happen with me. every single one of my friends who has bought this have the same issues. Otherwise, when the planets align and the game actaully works, it is FANTASTIC. Great game, just wish I could play it in multiplayer.....			"

Early Access Review
								A really awesome rogue-like with tower defense aspects.Coupled with good music, pretty tough difficulty at times, and a decent pixel aesthetic you'll easily find yourself crying on the floor after all your heroes die.			"

												Not entertaining enough for the difficulty/learning curve.No apparent way to revive dead  heroes.The maps seem to be completable only by learning them and planning based on that, which is rarely fun.Combat is boring.			"

												This game doesn't have much replayability as the unlocks aren't really all that rewarding and all yur work from one game is lost the next game. Also the difficulties are just weird and there is only two of them very easy and easy?			"
