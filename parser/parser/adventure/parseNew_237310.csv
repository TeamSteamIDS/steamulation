												I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try...(Real long read, but want to make sure to steer you away from this terrible, terrible game)EDIT: But first, if you’re here for the Steam Exclusive Deal? Dooon’t do it.First, they’re treating you like brainless cattle. It’s NOT free DLC, you’re downloading nothing new. All it does is let you start with a level 35 Time Tracer (Very low level) and give you a bunch of TIMED cashshop goodies (They pretend that’s worth money, hence the ‘free’ part). That. Is. All. Nothing new or unique.You’re not cattle to be milked like KOG loves to believe, don’t fall for this ‘free DLC’ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.And back to the review….First - Cashshop.It's a free to play, sure, but it fails absolutely miserably at handling its cashshop. Power, not convenience, is for sale. Just take a look at what you'll want for a new character:Want to use more than 4 skills at once? 9$Ditto items? 6$Want a costume (greatly boosts PVP stats)? Anywhere from 15-32$Do you want skill notes (greatly boosts skills)? 1.50$ a piece, can use up to 6Want an overpowered pet? 4$Want an overpowered mount? 23$That's 60$ for a huge power boost nearly unobtainable ingame. In other words, apparently this game is so awesome, a single character should cost more than the price of a triple A game (Surprise, it’s not). That’s not even touching the hundreds of dollars you can spend going for overpowered +11 equipmentThat alone should be giving you bad vibes, but to continue…Second - Balance.Short version: There is none.Long version: Sigh…	KOG's idea of new content is a new, more broken character. That way people will go ""AWESOME"" and pay $60+ in previously mentioned cashshop for their new broken character.And then they release another, even more broken character, and repeat the loop for infinite money. New dungeons? Nope, halt the update and add another new character instead.Let's look at the most recent, broken example, Add, or specifically the new Diabolic Esper class coming out:


YouTube™ Video: [Elsword Korea] PvP  Diabolic Esper vs Crimson avenger 

			Views: 4,266		

			1:1		

 (30 second clip, implore you to take a gander)Yes, that is Crimson Avenger, -second- newest class, dying in 30 seconds while DiE literally just runs around spamming missiles. Mind you, this is SSS rank play, top tier stuff. Welcome to Elsword PVP.Ignore the most broken cheapskate for a second, as even the basic combos are horribly unbalanced. Eve in general is incapable of looping without spamming Tesla Shock, the worst KD reset skill in the game. Ara and Add have built in infinite loops with their basic attacks. If they catch you once, you will die without manabreak. That means anytime they catch you, it's a guaranteed -100 MP for you, while Eve will end up doing scratch damage while -giving- you MP. It’s completely unbalanced at the most -basic- level, before even delving into class skills and powers.So if KOG can’t even balance the most basic and -important- aspect of a fighting game, what hope is there for the rest of the game?Third - Combat.So there's PVE and PVP. Originally both took skill to be good at....Not anymore.With the last dungeon revamps we had ages ago, everything's been buffed with fake difficulty. Bosses ignore combos with length super armor while hitting chunks of your HP off, or get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like flat out invincibility/smaller hitboxes.Even the normal mobs are getting stoic counters to break free from your combos. Because ♥♥♥♥, what is this, a fighting/combo game? Oh, it is? Well oops.The end result is that the game is becoming more and more like a maplefest game. No skill, just button mashing and potion chugging, spam your highest damage move whenever the CD is off.So what about PVP?You can probably guess how this’ll go.As should be evident with the cashshop and balance sections, PVP is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Doesn’t matter how skilled you are, if you picked the wrong class/don’t have as much cashshop as everyone else, you lose. They only need to be slightly competent to floor you.But assuming you're equal in everything, class, cashshop, how's it go then?Laughably. This is a terrible excuse of a fighting game.99% of PVP is catching, which is hitting your opponent first so you can combo them. The actual combos are brainless, you memorize a small string of button inputs and that's it. You repeat that forever and you know PVP. Catching is the only hard part, which naturally gives the edge to the players with more range. Guess who everyone picks.Look at Add, newest character. Starts match with DP mode, spams nearly undodgable homing shot, teleports into you for combo, never runs out of DP unless he kills you enough. Nothing counters it.But even ignoring Add, this game is still a joke compared to other fighting games. There’s almost zero strategy involved beyond picking the right character.Fourth - ContentThis is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. KOG literally couldn't give less of a♥♥♥♥♥♥of what the players want. We haven't had real new content in almost a year now. Our current endgame is summed up in 5 dungeons, the Secrets. You only run them to construct a Secret set, which takes at most a month. Then you have nothing else to do but PVP. Congrats, you won Elsword.This is yet another ploy to make you make another character and spend even more on cashshop, but considering how boring it gets to play the same things over and over… that won't last long.You could try to argue PVP is the heart of the game, but as I've tried to make clear, it’s terrible. Even the rebalances are jokes; Season 3 revamped a total of TWO out of 26 classes, and completely ignored (and even NERFED) classes desperately in need of it, like Code: Nemesis again.Not to mention, again, the complete lack of cashshop separation from power. Expecting nerfs to costumes, +11 weapons, skill notes, etc? What is this, a balanced F2P?So yeah, PVP is the ‘heart’ of Elsword, and it’s rotten to the core.Fifth - Regional differencesI mentioned them a bit already, but it goes a lot deeper. If you play Elsword in KR, it might actually be somewhat better overall. Anywhere else? ♥♥♥♥ you.So what does NA get? Summed up in a few words: Cashshop, inflated prices, worthless trinkets.Meanwhile KR gets so many EXP boosting events, crossover events, fun little stuff like Bingo events, even a month long Harmony festival with cashshop rewards/costumes/exp boost/stamina boost/free healing items/and more all rolled into event that's still going on. We don't get anything like that anymore.So tack that on top of the already increased EXP requirements and bland general events.But wait, they also purposely punish our region for no reason!In KR, Henir and Secret revamps came with new level 70 sets, could trade your old 60 sets for them. In NA, all the work you put in the 60s? Do it again. Make 70s from scratch with the vastly inferior 60s in dungeons designed for much stronger equipment.We can't even get voice acting yet, we're still using KR's voice overs, while even the UK managed to get English dubbing (Which was horrible in quality because KOG isn’t going to waste money when they could pocket it).Our GMs do make an effort to have silly mini-events, but they're powerless against the greedy grubby hands of KOG.And this is all because the MMO market anywhere else aside from KR is pretty slim. KOG can tell us to eat♥♥♥♥♥♥and we have to, because we don't have many other options.Which is why I eagerly await DFO's return, KOG is about to burn their own ship with this♥♥♥♥♥♥------------------Hopefully you’ve got the gist of that and now understand what’s wrong with Elsword. Pleeeease avoid it, KOG doesn’t deserve a penny from you. Tell your friends, too, don’t let them waste time or money on this crap.There are far better ways to spend your time and money than this game.			"

												As someone with over 2000 hours clocked into this game, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is a pay to win game. You can travel through most of the game without cash, but if you wish to succeed at all in it, you will need cash. $10 for a repair scroll. $13 for a marriage (Note, the site only manages increments of 5, 10, 20 and 100 so anything odd numbered requires a larger than your desire purchase), as well as other 'interesting' payment methods. Such as if you wish to expedite your Hyper Skill work and just buy it, it's 550 KC, however, they don't dabble in ""pay what you need"", so you need to pay 10 just for that 550.The PVP is by far one of the worst pvp systems I have ever had the sheer disgust of dealing with. It's almost 100% completely gear based. Someone with a highly reinforced weapon and armor 'will' plow through you with little effort. If it's not their gear ending your chances, it's their character. The balancing in this game only grows worse and worse each big update. Chung, the gun user, when built right, now has almost infinite Super Armor capabilities. Making him impossible to combo against. AND THEN IF THOSE 2 aren't stopping you, it's lag. Opponents randomly walking out of your combos, dropping away from them, with 0 care in the world.MP Breaking is a method to escape combos, but there have been many times where I simply saw them walk away from my attack, no Super Armor, not even any damage, just walked away. It's so infuriating seeing hours of progress in your pvp rank get taken down in 1 to 2 matches NOT because you were outclassed, NOT because you were outskilled, but because the person had stronger gear than you, or lagged, or simply was better than the class you used.The only redeeming thing this game has is it's community. You can literally trust a stranger with 2 Billion ED (Ingame currnecy) and actually receive your item you payed for. The reason why that's an issue is you can only trade in increments of 700 million, so you will end up accepting a trade twice to 3 times over giving them all your money before you receive your item. They could so easily run away, but they don't, they're trustworthy. Everyone there is kind, enjoyable, very, very weeaboo not gonna lie. But at least they were cool.The gameplay itself is still enjoyable in dungeon runs, it's fast, fluid action slashing and destroying enemies. And that's enjoyable, or at least it is to me, for 3 level cap characters. But once you get that far, you have to start grinding and start paying to keep up, needing to buy Ores and garbage to make your weapon stronger so you can actually excel at your class. And that just wont happen if you run free the entire time.With that said, I can't recommend this game to users that want an mmo they can really dive into. This game is worth a look at best, but barely worth truly getting into for the long run. The Pay to Win model becomes all the more apparent as you level up and the sense of feeling cheated out of victory as well as simply too weak (even when you have end-game gear) is a feeling games like this should not generate within their players. It's a sense of worthlessness that you can't ignore, and when you've reached such a feeling, you start questioning if the game is really worth your time, rather than if it's worth your time to achieve the stronger gear that you were just clobbered with.

												Elsword the game with a unique charm similar to Smash Brothers, but with the faulty advertisements of a dedicated fighting game. In terms of specs to run this game, you can nearly hop on any computer and start playing.You join the game, select your first character. A unique cast that charms you by the beauty and elegance of their fighting styles and chibi-like looks. As you start off you may go on solo or with your new found playmates. From the combination of side-scrolling gameplay like in Mario Brothers, and light and heavy attacks similar to Smash Brothers you may be fooled into believing it's a fighting game.But sadly the more you attempt to play arena, the more you attempt to hone your skills, the more you attempt to dungeon, the more you attempt to strive to become stronger in PvE or PvP. The more you quickly realize how difficult it is to get by without throwing your cash at this game. But with a few hours to spare you want to experience the full experience, the challenging experience. So you press on without spending a single dollar.So with a keen interest in PvP you begin. You begin to practice and practice and practice. You go from a nobody to a noticeable foe. Practicing in spar rooms, and taking on the dangerous Arena. With your technical skills honed you realized, this isn't a fighting game. It's a beat-em up game. And despite your efforts you get trumped time and time again by simple tricks which you have no counterplay to.So with all the pain and suffering, you think maybe you should pursue this ""gear"" everyone talks about. So with your technical skills honed to perfection you struggle onwards.With hard work and much grinding hour by hour, day by day, you've accomplished difficult feat for Elsword. You've spent hours doing daily quests leaching off the ""strong"", and doing event quests acquiring much needed assets to your ""gear."" You've done it you're fully accessorized and you even look pretty damn good.Gear the major determining factor to your stats, you've increased your stats to your ideal, using your RPG knowledge you've put it together like a puzzle. Each piece that took you hours upon hours of your time and effort.Now with your new found power you are respected for your clear speeds in dungeons, your friends respect your hard work and your power. So you tackle PvP once more.Now you have become what you thought was impossible to defeat, you have become one of the ""strong."" Only to be hated in PvP. Only to give your opponent the experience against fighting impossible odds, with little to no counterplay. You soon find yourself bored time and time and time again. You've honestly done all you've wanted in your solo adventure, with your free2play spirit in a harsh monopoly of a pay2win game.So you think back and ask yourself. ""What have a really accomplished?"" I've made friends along the way I see them come and go. Your closest friends have quit the game. The community dwindles to near emptiness at night. When the community is awake the topics is always the same. Complaints about the game, complaints about PvP. When someone asks you to teach them you simply laugh and show them the one trick that works 9/10 games. When you try to style your combos many will not notice and only few veterans will praise you. You've reached a level of strength that one would not think is possible without spending at least a couple hundred dollars.""Is there something more? Is there something more to experience?"" You ask yourself. With only the feeling of empty accomplishment and many regrets. ""Did I actually enjoy playing?"" Yes, yes you did for awhile. But soon it became a disappointing grind everyday, soon it became a hassle a simple desire to see how far you can push the limits. At times you showed anger, frustration, and then you took it seriously and in the end... You've hurt your friends, and you've hurt the one that you held dearest to you, a game taken too seriously.So you decide to slow down, you decide to see ""What more does this game offer?"" Taking the time to sit down and read and watch the story. Reading up on the lore. You quickly discover the plot is incoherent, sometimes unfinished, misleading, counter-intuitive, but comedic and random.With so much hours put into this game, with many accomplishments one after another. Sadly this is the disappointment in the end.This is my lonely and disappointing adventure in Elrios, in the game of Elsword.----------Despite this. You log on, to talk and meet old friends that still have stuck with you for all this time. This is the true value you found. Even despite the poor community lacking knowledge, patience, or trust. You've found a few friends worth keeping, and I think that's true in any MMO if you play long enough.Until the day I leave a small dent, or even a small mark in another game I hope there's much more beautiful things to see.With all that all I can say about Elsword is... Much potential entertainment led astray. Community exhausted by their love of the characters despite the harsh reality of the game. Because the beauty and personality in the art and in the characters were shown greatly. But the poor leadership, organization, and excution of the game led to a very disapointing effort.Thank you for all the good, the bad, and the worst times I have ever experienced playing a game. A heartwreching, heartbreaking experience combined with a false caring of your efforts. Even if there's a few moments that are pure gems.			"

												Ive played this for years, ever since Raven first came out( Before it came to Steam mind you). Things were great at first, fun combat made  my actions planned and less forced, nice mix of characters each with there own unique story, and having my character seem to actually age when i'd reach the next class made me feel like I was growing in the world.But as time went on, things changed. PVE stayed the same (after some minor additions to help remove inactive players) But everything else began to seem wrong. PVP is broken, I've seen people play as Chung, and picked the class Tactical Trooper, and not even need to fight. I saw these 2 players, both level 70 at the time, face off, and while the other was busy attacking chung, he just sat there, gaining MP from the blows. When he had enough, he pressed ONE skill, dropped a nuke, and it was over, all of the other's HP was gone. And thats COMMON in PVP, just one example of thousands.Next is the costumizations, yes theres alot to choose from, and most are amazing, but they cost way to much. The only reason people buy them is because if they don't they can't have that crutial edge in a fight, as the best costumes all have fairly decent,(if not overpowering) stat boosts. But to KEEP these little outfits you MUST PAY DOUBLE PRICE TO KEEP IT. If you dont specify that you want it permanently when you first buy it, it will disapear forever after only 30 days. Making you waste all that money is a low blow.The community isn't to bad, I had a great guild and i'd been a member for most of my time there. But in the more competitive areas thats not really the case, PVP pits you against others based on Rank and not Level, meaning as a poor level 15 I may have to fight a level 80 De-ranker....Yes people derank themselves by losing to people on purpose, then fight there way back up for ammusment. I recommend not even bothering with pvp until your final job class is unlocked at level 35.The last and probably the worst is what happened to my younger brothers account. He's young and naive so his password wasn't the most secure, and he was unfortunatly targeted by a hacker, after I appealled to costumer support on the issue they asked me to;1. Have my previously used password2. a SCREENSHOT of you playing as a character on the account3. emal address and so on... I was finally able to give the info and when things seemed to be looking up.THEY DELETED HIS ACCOUNT, on the grounds that ""Sharing your password to others is prohibited"" as if all the time he had spent on his character wasn't bad enough, all the items bought even with real money were erased. My brother was crushed and quit forever, myself shortly after when something similair happened to a guildmate. The support is poor when it really counts, and isn't afraid of quickly saying 'Theres nothing we can do'.I'd go on but there are many other reviews you could read that have the finer details of the games issues, and to be honest i'm getting a headache remembering all this crap.Try it yourself if you want, but for your own sake don't buy anything until about 3 months into the game, see if its right for you. No need to break the bank for that swimsuit costume that gives more stats than any armor set...Not even gonna start on THAT one.			"

												Let me list my problems with this game.There is a significant pay-to-win issue in the game in the form of costumes and gear enhancements. Contrary to a relatively ""fair"" free to play game model, Elsword's costumes (for a reason which is easily fathomable) give stats and overall power. As a result, this results in those who are willing to pay real cash having a significant advantage over individuals who do not. More to the point, Equipment enhancements, due to their nature of increasing stats via an increasing percentage per enhancement level (From a 1% stat increase at +1, 15% stat increase at +6~9 and a +30% stat increase at +9~11) results in a ridiculous power disparity between high-enhancement weapon wielders and low-enhancement weapon wielders. With the present average enhancement at +7, people at +8 and higher will have a 15~100% base attack stat advantage in comparison to the average player.The PvP system of this game, contrary to most individual opinions, is genuinely well-thought out and generally well made. This game's PvP is dependent on your ability to 'catch'- i.e., hitstun your opponent and land a series of hits in the form of combos, and repeat. Hence, it is potentially possible for any character at any level to defeat any character and any level, as long as one's skill level is higher than the other. On a clean, basic flowchart, I find this highly appealing.However, there are several significant issues with this PvP system.First and foremost, there is a signfiicant balancing issue between the many classes and characters you can choose in the game, particularly with the more recently released character/classes. For those interested in said balance issues the PvP forums are the place to go.Secondly, due to this game's frame rate being directly tied to your computer's performance level (i.e. general graphics and CPU power) and because your frame rate is directly tied to your character's input response speed (e.g. Attack/Movement/Jump speed) anyone with an inferior computing experience compared to the opponent will find themselves severely disadvantaged due to their character's slower response time- hence opening up far more opportunities for your opponent to catch you whilst simultaneously reducing your number of opportunities to catch you opponent.Thirdly, this game's matching system is a peer-to-peer system, which directly connects your IP to the opponent's IP. As I am an Australian and this game is based in America, naturally most of my opponents are individuals across the whole pacific ocean, resulting in horrible latency. This results in delayed response times as hits and actions on your screen may not register on the opponent's screen, as is the same for your opponent to you as well. This results in a horrible PvP experience for both parties.Finally and most importantly, the above enhancement system comes into play in PvP as well. As in PvP, you can be matched up with anybody and anyone regardless of character level/class/equipment enhancement level, anyone with equipment of lower enhancement level will find themselves highly disadvantaged in many matches due to their equipment being inferior to their opponent's.  As a result, the gear discrepancy between players becomes ridiculously high as one progresses up in PvP rank, as eventually, regardless of their skill level they will find it extremely difficult to defeat their opponents who have far superior equipment. For instance, a +7 weapon wielder may find themselves hitting for 3-digit damage on their opponents whilst they hit back for over 4~5 digit damage.Hence, the PvP system at its present state is highly undesirable to play without significantly increasing your character's power level, which in turn requires (and will inevitably require) real cash investment, i.e. as the common phrase is, it will require you to buy power.On the flip-side of the coin,the PvE system of this game serves as several dungeons in which you clear stages after stages of monsters, culminating to a generally difficult last-stage boss. However, after a while these bosses become walkovers, and it becomes boring to grind these after a while. Challenges exist in the form of solo Secret Dungeons and Henir Challenge modes. Although these are indeed interesting, they harshly punish you for failing in them as the former consumes rare items for entry, and the latter will only provide rewards for entry only once (i.e. if you enter and die in the first few stages, you won't be able to get any rewards for the rest of the day). This also results in significant time and power investment.Would I recommend this game? No. really, no. It's genuinely fun, yes. However, that's only once you reach the end game and you have sufficiently invested enough time and money in order to establish your character's power and place in the Elsword world, as I have done so. I genuinely do not recommend this game for anyone with insufficient time or money on their hands.			"

												This game may look friendly, but the more you delve into it,the more you realize that it's just a façade.It's says it's ""Free to Play"", but it just have enough free content tolast you a couple of dungeons. Unless you pour cash in this game,you will have a hard time alone.Pay to unlock the B skill set. Pay to get another skill tree setup.They give you HALF OF THE STORAGE CAPACITY. Not even ONE PAGE. HALF.And don't get me started on the bank. If you think half was bad enough, wait to see the bank deposit,Oh, and that nice ice burner sets? Too bad, you need to be Filthy rich to collect just ONE of those. And that'sonly for ONE character.Oh yeah, you need to buy all of these things for every character you create. Funny, eh?Oh, you want to PvP? Too bad, Equipment and Costumes stats carry over to PvP. Skill is one part of the equation, andit's the little part. The moment you encounter an opponent with the same skill level, the one who wins is the one with the most overpowered gear. Not even kidding.And it's not even balanced. Want to be OP? Get the latest class. 90% of the time it's OP as hell.KoG it's not known for being great at balancing stuff.I come from Grand Chase, and even though it's a very old game, The PvP is balanced, because the Equipment stats don't carry over to PvP. The only thing that matters it's your skill.And Mounts? Pfffft, same as Ice Burner sets. Good Luck Trying to get that ""Chocobo"".Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game, unless you have good friends to play, or if you play a couple of hours a week.2/10Pros:-Nice Graphics-Aisha can be a Magic Girl-Elesis-VICTORY SWORD, HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!-If you don't care for PvP, Jobs are actually entertainingCons:-Extremely overpriced stuff-Pay for everything-PvP is utter crap unless you pour unlimited money works-Phorus, Banthus, and Pong can ruin your sanity-If KoG could sell instant Lvl 70 upgrades, they would.-Stamina (I mean, maybe in Korea it's a good idea to limit the amount of time people invest in this game, but in NA it's actually a very bad move. I mean, look at Elsword EU)-Korean voices (If you're not a fan of asian things in general, you will hate the voices. Even though it was hinted that this could have an English Voiceover, it never materialized, AND GRAND CHASE HAD TONY OLIVER, WHY?! EVEN ELSWORD EU HAS ENGLISH VOICES)-Elsword it's an irritating brat-Job costumes are timed, and there's no way to buy them "

												I've played this game for god knows how long (roughly 3 years). I feel I should post a review.Jist: Play one of 9 (soon to be 10) characters, with 3 different and slightly-to-very unique playstyles on each. With gameplay that is a mix between Smash Bro's, a traditional fighter, and traditional MMO.So lets hit hard with the Pros and cons.Pros:•Core gameplay is extremely enjoyable•Variety variety variety•The aesthetic is very pleasing, even though the whole ""play your manga"" original tagline is nowhere to be seenCons:•Pay2win•Pay2win•there is very little actual content•there is very little actual balancing. With the arrival of PvP Season 3 proving it in spades, good luck if you arent 70 and dont have a weapon +8 or above.•Pay2winFinal word:I love this game, I really do. I've spent minimal actual dollars on it, and made tons of friends. which is nice when you're a casual, but if you want to be a competative-to-hardcore player, have fun dropping several hundred++ dollars in this game.Please bare in mind, I still play this game, and love it. But I cannot recommend it due to flaws which are out of our hands.Even though I gave this game a thumbs down, I hope to see you in Elrios one day.-ign: fetishfox "

												Got nothin much to say except I CAN'T... STOP... PLAYING... THIS ADDICTING GAME!!!! Fast paced side-scrolling hack and slash action complemented with an amazing variety of character classes, each with their own unique specialties that make them stand out, beautifully rendered background environments (since this is a side scroller) almost like an amazing artist just painted the whole thing with awesomeness and HOLY FREAKIN HELL!!!!... THE MUSIC IN MANY PARTS OF THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE!!!!... I Just have some minor issues with this game... Stamina bar and tedious last class change quests and skill unlock quests... ( DAMN YOU AND YOUR ERRANDS CAMILLA!!!! DX)... Overall I would REALLY recommend this game to anyone that loves either good locales, good music, or some of the best side-scrolling gameplay Ive seen in my life... If you feel tempted to try, me and my Deadly Chaser will see ya in glorious PvP! (unless you face a Dimension Witch or an Infinity sword were against those either you dodge everything or you're freakin screwed... or just put a giant amount of unexpected burst on them like I do XD)			"

												This game made me hate the now typical practice in not only ""Free to Play"" games, but in most MMO's in general.I looked into this game a couple of years ago because I wanted something simple and easy to jump in/jump out whenever I wanted to ""play"" a game but not really play a game.  You know, do something to kill time until other obligations spring up or if I can't decide what other game I want to play instead.   I treated this game as a snack; something to enjoy in the meantime before the real meal comes up.At first I was pretty happy.  It was nice, colorful, and simple.  And despite the atrociously generic characters (little girl with a big sword, little loli mage, blonde haired elf archer, etc), I still enjoyed playing with them for a while.And then it hit me like an angry flaming brick wall;  You're not allowed to even have simple fun unless you're willing to shell out the cash.""It's free to play!"", you exclaim. ""Of course they'll charge you for SOMETHING.""Fair enough.  But I shouldn't have to pay money out for an extra skill slot.  Little things the game throws at me shouldn't require extra cash when I never wanted the item in the first place.  And all the base, free costumes are incredibly ugly... which is to incentivize players into paying more money for their costumes.And on that note; the Pay to Win.   If ANYONE tells you that isn't true just know that they're lying.   Those stat increases are insane!  It doesn't matter how well you are at the game because little Johnny Morebucks can buy an insta-kill weapon and BOOM! You're dead.  No glory, no skill.  Just a whiny kid with his daddy's money. Typically I wouldn't mind handing over a few bucks for a neat costume.  But this is insane.   The stuff you can buy with real cash are incredibly overpriced and needlessly over-powered for no adequately explained reason.  And after a certain point it's almost as if the game expects you to start throwing money away just so you can progress.  That's insane.Games like this are an embarrassment.  If you want to make a Free to Play game, then go for it.  You want to charge a little for a neat outfit or an accessory?  By all means.  But don't charge $40+ for a single complete outfit and then jack up the buffs to where you become unto a God.   I know what it means to have fun; it means to feel as though you've accomplished something.  That YOU became powerful on your OWN merits.  Not by buying it.And this all doesn't even address the grind.  Dear god almighty the grind.  ""Oh, an MMO that makes you grind? How absurd!""  I know, this isn't anything new to MMO's.   But this makes a grind and turns it into a tedious, required chore where the end never comes into view.  It's just over and over whacking the same bland enemies with the same bland backdrop with the same obnoxiously bland sound effects to the track of some bland, forgettable pseuo-electro pop nonesense.I'm also ignoring the whole ""weeaboo"" thing but... hey, it's Elsword.  Young anime girl with unnatural hair weilding a big sword.  What did you expect?No, I don't reccommend this game.  It should be pushed aside.  This sort of practice should not be encouraged.  And I don't care how much money you borrow from your family/friends, or how much you earn to justify spending it on this.  You're paying for numbers and pixel clothes.   That's depressing.			"

												Dungeons are fun. But as an S rank NW, I can confirm that pvp is pay to win as hell. No matter how well you can outplay your opponents, most of 'em will just be cashed up Lv70s that oneshot you with supers or something. Pretty frustrating.Aside from pvp though, too many things that should be basic features in the game are insanely expensive and only apply to each individual character... You looking to fully enjoy that new character? Check your wallet, son.			"

												  As someone who's played Elsword for a long time, I must note that Elsword has gone down a few leagues in the last few years in terms of playability. It's really fun and all, but it's absolutely lacking in endgame material. Endgame gear is a matter of ""Do this single dungeon 50 times."" as well as a general lack of leeway for unique setups in pvp. With the recent updates. I might as well note a few of my observations as well as widely accepted information from my peers who also play the game.    PVP is much more centered around stats than skills, and money is a key part of this process. Players without premium currency will find it practically impossible to hit over +8 ""Enhancement"" (The process of increasing equipment stats by a given % which increases in increments each level, from 3% increments to up to 40% at the moment) for their precious endgame gear unless they don't mind it resetting, or breaking (Which at that rate, you must spend premium currency to FIX the item.)   The max enhancement level is +12, which allows players spending cash to be infinitely stronger than those without it, seeing a 135% higher difference in stats (This is actual data as well.) To increase enhancement levels without risk of reset or breaking, players must spend a small fortune on ""Fluorite ore"" and premium currency ore that makes enhancement far easier. Players are known to spend up to 600$ just to get one item to +12.   Onto gameplay, in PVE enemies are usually just the same AI with a different model, and eventually you notice a very obvious pattern in the story that'd feel about as repetitive as Bravely Default was with its 5 worlds mechanic. Early game is actually the most unique part of Elsword, which is rather ironic with how bleak it quickly gets. In later areas, the main reason anyone desires to replay dungeons is to obtain ED, which is spent in the economy. The newest area, Elysion, is the only exception to this. Sadly, this is only for players who are 5 levels from the cap and finished a long story quest around the other regions with their usual ""Copy-Paste"" style of gameplay.   With economy on Elsword, everything is horrendously unbalanced. Every run in the final dungeon gives you around, 300,000 Currency. On the other hand, any costume piece will go from 40 to 600 Million currency. This doesn't include Ice Burner sets, KoG's gacha for Elsword. These sets, which are usually priced at horrendous levels, can cost over a billion for the accessories, and 5-6 billion for the sets. I wish I was joking about this but unfortunately as a player of over 4 years, I can't. To go back on this, that'd be doing about....20,000 runs to obtain an Ice Burner set. Endgame equipment is also given the same treatment, usually being about 1-2.5bil for the full sets.  Combos aren't nearly as fulfilling as they seem at first as you may quickly realize that the best combos are the shortest. In pvp, the meta is known for ""Loops"" an infinite combo where the player simply inputs the same command over and over to ensure you cannot be knocked down. With the +12 mechanic for players who can afford its insane costs, pvp is simply a matter of who loops who first, and whether or not they've the money to kill the other quickly with the loop.   For a beginner, Elsword is a really fun game, and I in no way condemn anyone for trying it. But the game's flaws are cleverly hidden until you go further in, and the results as I can personally say, are as unpleasant as it gets. Elsword was much more exciting years back, when it had the playability and focus more on skill, than the money you spent on making your gear too strong. Originally, the top enhancement level was in fact +8. I noticed the game started making a turn in the wrong direction for long-time players the moment +11 became the new max, and +12 later. It no longer had nearly as high replayability.   My advice is that if you are looking to save money for an MMO you'll be playing for a long time, even spending on a pay to play game like FFXIV would be far more profitable than playing Elsword to get to the end.

												Don't let my time spent on this game fool you. I've been on board since Raven's release and it's been quite a roller coaster in terms of my opinion of this game up until now.Elsword is a great game, don't get me wrong. The mechanics are solid, I haven't run into many glitches, and the general feeling of the game when playing is unique. Being a 2D fighting game, scrolling is to expected when it comes to dungeons. Elsword does it very well. Each dungeon has its own theme and get more fun as the game progresses. With the addition of fields, players have an alternative to obtaining EXP. PvP itself also rewards players with EXP, but in much smaller doses. Skills are flashy, each playable character feels unique, and overall, the game is pretty easy to pick up.However, some key things set this game back two steps whenever it advances one. Mechanics are solid but latency issues and ping play a large factor in being able to PvP well. More often than not, I find myself dying to lag than skill, even when the other person is better anyway. I've won my share of lag matches, and I always feel bad when a genuinely good player gets beaten because of the awkward connection. Dungeons rehash a lot of the mobs. Certain effects can bolster and change a mob, but for the most part, it just takes more time to kill it. Speaking of which, every dungeon's boss save for the secret dungeons' are extremely easy to kill. It takes two to four 200-300mp skills to down most of the bosses. Some dungeons are too long, especially toward levels 30-40, and feel as though they are just intended to burn precious stamina. Killing mobs in fields also costs stamina, but that was very minor in my opinion. The PvP matchup system runs by what seems to be just ranks. This can cause a lot of problems as some high level players who have already attained high ranks lose matches on purpose and ""derank"" in order to climb back up and farm for AP, which is currency only obtained through PvP. Skills themselves are not a problem, but more often than not, I find myself using little to no skills on the trash mobs throughout the dungeon. Leveling up in general to get more skills is a pain, especially that dreaded moment when the next quest is level locked and grinding is the only option. Grinding itself isn't that hard, but the community is not very friendly to grinders. The community itself is mediocre. Rudeness and trolls are abound in PvP, loners and the occassional leech can be found in PvE. Another non-game related problem besides the community is the economy. Massive prices, ED being extremely worthless, buying one's way to win through the cash shop etc. The cash shop itself is Pay2Win, and even though it's possible to overcome that (skill notebook, bank perks), it's extremely inconvinient and requires tons more effort. Some features that give the game a very different feel and the player a much easier time are locked down permanently without cash (skill slot B, pets).Of course Elsword is a good GAME. That's about all it has going for it. Everything that contributes to the game other than the actual mechanics kind of break it. If you can put up with all that as long as I have, then kudos. Elsword is enjoyable, but only so much so.			"

												In many ways, this game is very fun. For instance, the combo-based, skill intensive combat is engaging and addictive and the characters are varied and interesting.However, despite all of the selling points of Elsword, it is simply not a good game, there are far too many obvious cash-grab microtransactions and many unethical practices by the developer: KoG.Things in the cash-shop are VERY expensive and are almost always bound to a single character. People say that with enough dedication etc... you can buy these things with in-game currency but trust me, unless you're really lucky or play this game pretty much all day, you're going to have to cash to play this game.To play ONE character properly with all BASIC functionalities unlocked like extra skill slots, a costume and acceptable inventory space would cost you at least $~40 USD. Now keep in mind, this is the essentials and is only for a single character. If you really wanted to play this game a lot, you'd need to spend more, upwards of $60 USD per character.Then there's the Stamina system which is a stupid Korean system that was transferred to the North American server for some asinine reason. Simply put, Stamina limits how many dungeons and monsters you can kill/run on a character in a day. For every monster you kill, your Stamina decreases by about 0.1% and if you reach 0% Stamina, you no longer get EXP from killing monsters and you cannot enter any dungeons. You run out of Stamina VERY quickly i.e. If you are running dungeons and questing to level up, you'll probably completely run out of Stamina in about 1-2 hours. After that, you have to wait until the next day to play on your character again... unless you decide to enter the Arena and fight some people in some cancerous PvP matches. But I can't be bothered explaining how unbalanced PvP is in this game, I'm sure other reviews cover it deeply.Anyway, this game's essence is fun and good but, the stupid cash-shop and terribly balanced PvP coupled with stupid Korean systems like Stamina completely ruin the experience and utterly invalidate any good points this game may have.

												Yo, why are you reading recommendations? Just go play it. You've got nothing to lose since it's free to play. Go.Wait... you're still here? Still not too sure about it, huh? So, you wanna hear more? Fair enough. Well, this is a game that does ""Free to Play"" the right way. Yessir. There's no locked content or anything that would prevent you from enjoying the game unless you'd pay. There's an item store where you can buy cool costumes for your character with real money, but they DON'T affect the gameplay since they're just costumes. Y'know, cosmetics. But you're gonna want them, because the game is a hell of a lot of fun and you care about the way your character looks in a fun game. Especially when it's not a FPS. I mean, look at TF2 for instance. If you have hats in TF2, then you're definitely gonna want to have some cosmetics in this game, because you can actually see your character at all times here.Now, you might be asking yourself, ""yeah but what if I don't want to pay real money, will I still look decent?"" Well my dear reader, you'll be glad to hear that yes, you will be able to have your own style and look decent even if you don't pay. Sure, you'll be less fancy or less over-the-top, but there's a lot of different clothes that you can drop, and another cool thing about this game is that you can enchant and give attributes to your items. This means that your old dusty shirt you love and cherish can actually be good for a lot longer than you might imagine. You get quite a reasonable amount of in-game money by simply playing the game normally, so you can actually enhance your equipment pretty easily and it's fun to experiment with that.What else is there to say? Wait, you're right, I haven't even talked about the actual combat yet. Well, this game uses a basic melee combo system and a spell system that uses Mana. Your Mana regenerates faster as you do melee combos. So what you do is you combine your melee combos with your spells and it's super fun and satisfying. There are many classes to choose from, so that makes the game very replayable. Oh, and the surprisingly great music adds a lot to the intense, fast-paced combat.All in all, this is quite frankly one of the best free to play games I've played in a long time.I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.

												As a veteran of this game for almost four years, i can safely say this game does indeed have potential, but wastes it in alot of areas, the game requires necessary grinding for a good amount of skills, and the pay wall in this game is ENORMOUS. Unlike other games, Elsword locks both four skill slots off, and extra pages in the skill tree, both of which are nearly 20$ apiece. The game also does indeed have a problem with class balancing, and the developers refuse to listen to the american playerbase for opinions regarding buffs/nerfs, listening only to the korean playerbase. This game is indeed fun, but that will only last at most a few weeks before you start to become bored with the game or play with friends. If you do indeed like grinding, forced halting of your gaming due to the stamina system that is implemented, and severe balancing issues, than this is for you. Otherwise, i say skip out on Elsword, and look for some other game.			"

												So I decided to do a re-do of this game cause I gotten back into it and feel it gotten some improvements.By the way, I’m not only back cause of the new characters (Luciel), but because of the many revamps and better events they been having. The game did get better but I’m still giving it thumbs down cause of many reasons still which ill list but I’ll start off with the positive things about this game and also don’t give me saying I haven’t play the game long enough when I have over 300 hours and if I include the non-steam version, that would be over 5,000 of hours.Pros-Game can handle any pc and don’t need any decent PC(Almost weak as a web browser game).-Doesn’t take up much space-Great with friends and the dungeons and back ground designs are beautiful.-Lots of beautiful costumes and outfits to try out.-Always doing updates.-You can be a Loli and do amazing skillsCons-Events are starting to become helpful and amazing but it require you to be on elsword everday and  stay on for hours just to get some event items and you can not miss any days of logging in or else you will have the buy the tickets or items to make up for it and if u can't buy to make up for it, guess what, **** you!,you should have been on elsword everday!(that what it feels like).All the events quest ever be about is just asking u you to do repetitive dungeon’s they make you do over and over again daily until u get numbers of items to turn in to Ariel or whoever to get your free outfit or what not, for me doesn’t feel very rewarding and a waste of time, it’s like working at a restaurant to cook and serve back and forth for 8 hours straight and only get 5$ for it.Also the events really aim to be cash grab, just discounts and asking for your money.-Its P2W, while people on the right says it’s not and people on the left say it is, imo it is P2W regardless of what the people say that’s not P2W(Don’t give me that BS about grinding when its impossible in NA).-Unnecessary items to buy, skill slot B(never heard of a mmo that charge you money that require you to use  more slots just so you can use more skills), 2nd skill tree and limited inventory space(can't be earn for free except rarely in events), its very low, same for bank slot(again, only can be earn with money) and finally no free perm mount except rarely in events of course. -Pvp,still bad after all these years, still gear base and p2w and there no real skills needed in the game, it’s all about attacking your opponents and not letting them move an inch. You might think it be like a soul calibur side scrolled anime style cause of the fighting and weapons use in side scrolled with the anime theme. But ohhh no, it’s far from it. The game is 90% spam and there barely any fair game play in it, this why everyone always going on about calling you a noob when you beat them and giving you the same feel to call them a noob when you get beat by them, it’s never a “gg” really in elsword. Pvp in the system have the worse reputation of them all and best stay away from, with that skill slot b, 2nd skill tree  and finally and most of all, the gear from henrir and SD duns with +7 scrolls or higher, you won’t be able to pull off unbreakable combos and have a decent fair tree of pve and pvp and to be able to stand pvp a bit. -To repetitive, repeating the duns over and over for everything in this game, as for your normal story quest, it so lazy how they use it, it just do it on normal,hard,very hard,very hard twice or more and then it slap you right in the face.Do the same dungoen you already did like 4-5 times again but 10-25 more  or so just to level up, depend on the level rate your at and not just that but also quest, job change, skill quest and item drops are annoying and can cause you to get bored of the game very quickly.-Lack of content,to many updates and add-ons about  pets, mounts and most of all way to many costumes and  ib's and not enough of real content(mind as well call it ""weeaboo dresssem up simulator forever""). The real contents don't happen until 2-3 months, after all it just be pointless events doing the time, other then that its just useless updates that ask for your money. Lets be honest here, the game is more about power and greed and all about trying to get rare things to show off so there not much to do in the game, you dun, you field and pvp that’s it, sure a lot of mmo’s does the same, but most tend to be very creative at their questing(for example, you deliver and travel and gather flowers or what not to complete a quest, elsword you just kill mobs 24/7)  -The game is way to expensive and have terrible economy,the item mall and in game board(33$ for a full perm outfit for one char, 23$ for a perm mount again just for one char per account and take over hundreds of dollers to get a full ib set with op stats to help you dominate pvp. This game require crazy amount of money.) I could never afford those things  on the game board and the cash shop and what worse is, they starting to sell things over 1bil ED when back then ib weapon would be just 600 mil ED, same for skill slot B, when back then you could have gotten it for 600 kching and get it for 400 kching, now the only option is 900 kching.-Lack of true customization, Can you start off customizing? No you can't, you start  looking like a clone with other beginners  in the game .The game go on and on about how you can customize like crazy when you can’t, you have to paid and worse is… its over price. 3$ to change my eyes, 7$ to change my pose and another 3$ just to see a 2 second skill cun-in scene just doesn’t make any sense at all, they should be free and brought with ED or obtain by quest.I can go on and with more cons since I have more but thats just the gif of it, most likely when they have the new characters 2nd job comes out, a few weeks later ill most likely leave the game for a while again and since Blade and Soul on its way, most likely Elsword will be dead to me for good, now don’t get me wrong, elsword is a good game, especially for indie gamers and anime lovers that like small and simple games but I’m a person that expect more work and creativity in it and prefer bigger and more open world mmo’s.Overall: Do I recommend this game? Unless you don't mind repeating duns multiple times which you can get bored of very easily, got friends willing to spare time in this game with you, you can afford the overprice items and can stand the huge months of grinding, (Super OP RGN meaning its all about the drop rate in this game to get far) and gear just to get pieces from the in-game board and most of all got friends to help and trade with. Also don’t mind lame events that’s most of the time cash grab and most events require you to  come on elsword every day to get free stuff WHICH cases that you will have a high chance to not have the time to come on every day and finally can stand and ignore the salty p2w pvp bs..then your fine, elsword is for you, especially if your into anime, small lack of content and only want the strong concepts of the game and most of all an indie kind of gamer but other than that, I don’t recommend this game, to be fair i'm done with Nexon games in genreal. Not even excited for the up coming game closers which is another kog game, feel like just going to follow along another kog game mistake like elsword, more excited for bigger up coming mmos so you’re better off playing better free to play titles, such as warframe or the upcoming game Blade and Soul or phantasy star online 2 and more.Update: Now that Blade and soul is here i have no desire to have this game in my mind even, anymore and also excited for Black Desert online as well.Final verdict: 5/10-Just A Mix And Average Game.

												I've tried so hard to like this game, I really have. I've put in 200 hours, and it's 200 hours i wish i had back. I've uninstalled this game so many times it's not funny. Every time something new comes along I grit my teeth and hope for the best. It never gets any better. PvP is so broken it might as well be ""hit your head against the wall"" simulator. Sure, you can Try to win, but guess who you're fighting against: Mr. Op-bottoms and his fat stacks of cash! His money will shield him as he stunlocks you against a wall and kills you in one combo, doesn't that sound like fun? (I'm looking directly at you, Lu/Ciel and the new VIP system.) The various characters are quite nice, very varied. But every single one of them has a skill or combo that just screams, ""Screw you, I don't care how good you are, you're dead."" Dungeons so tedious and repetitive you'll think pulling your teeth out is a better time. I GET IT the level designs are beautiful, very very true! But I can see that the first time I go there, and by the 5th time it's lost its charm. I'm not gonna go into the in-game store. What I have to say about it has been said before. Goodbye Elsword, you were a sick tempting mistress. But you've aged too much and it's time to return you to the street from whence you came. Godspeed, oh daughter of Babylon.			"

												Ok now that i've played this game for 650+ hours, i think i know what im talking about when i say this game ISNT paid to win at ALL. 650 hours into this game and i haven't spent a single DIME on it. People say ""ohhh but you have to PAY to get more skills ohhh"" and whine about it. They act like it is IMPOSSIBLE to win in pvp without 4 extra skills, like you have absolutely no chance and you're at such a low disadvantage that it isn't even worth trying. Let me teach you something about Elsword Mr. 30 Hours. It may seem like some characters are better than others, like how Lu/Ciel is 2 characters instead of 1, so there is no way you can beat them, but if you played every class for every character, you would know that they are completely balanced. No matter who you choose, you can still beat somebody who is the opposite character. Like a Physical Attacker like Elsword has the same chance at beating a Magical Attacker like Rena like how an Elesis has the same chance at beating an Add. People only say ""new characters are OP"" because they have a different mechanic than others. Go ahead, prove me wrong. When Ara came out: ""OP cuz hits too much"" Elesis: ""OP cuz too much strength"" Add: ""OP cuz range"" LuCiel: ""OP cuz 2 instead of 1"" Rose: ""OP cuz 4 weapons"" I think i made my point. I do recomend it to people who are willing to PLAY THE GAME to get good, instead of wasting money to get 4 skills, then complain.			"

												This can be an extremely addicting game, if you give it enough time to do so. Right in the beginning, you choose from a decently large variety of characters. To be honest, it's not really that great until you hit level 15 and can start your job change. A job change basically means you get more skills, a new look, and better stats. There are, however, both pros and cons to this game which I will also review.Pros:> Lots of potential time to put into it> Variety in characters> Different playstyle, even in just one character> PvP can be based more off of strategy than pure strength> Lots of people - lots of friends> Community is, for the most part, pretty good. Better than most.Cons:> CAN be pay to win (The game's gold currency (ED) can be used to buy items that normally cost real money)> Trading could possibly make you lose your ED> Broken economy> Unbalanced characters (Though, there are character rebalances every so often)> PvPers who rage when they loseFinal verdict:It's a great game and definitely worth a try. Try not to be too discouraged by it being a bit slow in pace up until level 15 (which you could easily get in 30 minutes) and the broken economy. The variety in characters and even variety within each character should keep you busy for a LONG time. It's easy to make friends, because a lot of people are pretty friendly.			"

												This is a super fun game and all, but I would not reccomend it to anyone because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about of money you have to have in order to go anywhere in this game. This is a pay to win game no matter how you look at it. I tried to not pay a single penny into this game and It was practicaly impossible to first get any good items, raise any in game money, and anything else that you would want an need in a game. You want in game money? Well then you have to buy an iceburner with real money but it costs a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of money. 1 dollar for one icrburner and your chances of getting anything good is very low. In fact most of the things in this game are very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low chances of getting anything good. So if you are willing to fork over tons of money to get overpriced items that you may or may not have the chance to get than by all means come and play. I mean its over 23 dollars for one stupid costume set in the game, that is freaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly overpriced. Also when you finally get an item worth selling from an iceburner, mainly costume pieces, by that time you get that and try to sell it, KOG has already thrown out a new event that makes your item worth nothing, because they added new stuff. Then when you got to dismantle the item because you cant even sell it anymore you get one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little item that is worth nothing even though you have spend tons of money trying to get tha one damn item, its such a bad tradeoff and screws you over huge time. This game will only find ways to screw you over, never have had a moment in this game where they have not tried to screw me over out of my money. So please skip this game and find games that wont take your money like these greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will.Also there support sucks so bad, they will try anything to not help you and worm their way out of admiting that their game has bugs. I bought something and it never showed up in my inventory, so I created a support ticket and even had the proof that I had tried to buy the item and never showed up. All they did was say well there is no proof that you bought the item in our records so we arent even going to try to help you and look further into it. What ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t support team that is. So if you play this game, dont expect any help from the support team they will just worm their way out of admitting their game has faults and in the end leave you screwed.Overall this is a fun game but the people who made it are money greedy people, who will try to do any little thing to try to suck up money out of you. I have spent over 1000 hours on this game (most of the hours of this game was before this game was put onto steam) and all I have seen is them finding more and more ways to suck us dry of money. Its pathetic. Save yourself money and dont bother with this game.			"

												I want to reccomend this game. I really do. I have played this for hundreds of hours before it was considered for steam. and i will continue to play it and all. And at first its fun and such but.. It is heavily reliant on pay to win aspects. You will LITERALLY spend hundreds on microtransactions on this game. That isnt an exaggeration. That is a fact. I love this game, i truly do. But i cant recommend it for other people.			"

Warning! This review is long. Like, REALLY long. Do not click on this review unless you're willing to read a lot.The gist: This game is a trap. Stay away while you still can. Intro: If there's anything one should gather from my rather long playtime for this game, it's that this game is rather addicting. Don't get me wrong. There ARE some enjoyable bits in this game. I wouldn't have come back to this game after six months and rediscovered all the bad bits if there wasn't. But, yes, there are quite a few problems I have with this game that keep me from recommending it to anyone (or at least, anyone that  I'd respect  I know). Gameplay (PvE): If you've seen any of the trailers or read any other reviews for this game, you probably already know what the gameplay is like. You're at the leftmost side of a level, you go right, hitting anything that looks at you funny until they fall over, until you reach the end and get teleported to another, seemingly identical level. Well, maybe I shouldn't be so harsh. Some of the levels DO seem like they're set up rather well and the combat is rather engrossing. Armed with combos, special attacks, and super attacks (I know there aren't any moves called that, but whatever), the player can very easilly feel like he's a badass fighter in an action anime, running/flying around the screen hitting/slicing badies until finally blowing them up with a large explosion. Until, of course, they realize the enemies are collectively about as threatening as a one-legged spider with brain damage. The enemies in this game are either legally blind or incredibly stupid because they only seem to acknowledge your presence when you're either right next to them or hitting them across their stupid heads. And when they do notice you, they perform their telegraphed attack once before either forgeting about you or walking slowly towards you. The exception to this behavior is the boss enemies, who have a better grasp on the idea of focussing on players but feel they need to more obviously telegraph their attacks to be fair. Again, the levels do seem like they're well-made, so these problems with the enemies wouldn't seem so bad if one needed to visit each level only once. Is that the case? No. Levels will have to be visited three, and later even four, times before being allowed to the next one. And that's even assuming you're the right level, because otherwise the game just tells you to level up more, and since levelling up is so tedious, especially at higher levels, it won't be long before you're so familiar with levels that you could draw them on paper while blindfolded (this is assuming you're following the story, of course, and not just playing levels, but since levelling up takes so much grinding, especially later in the game, you might as well). What also doesn't help with this tedium is the music. I've read some reviews where people have praised the soundtrack, calling it beautiful and epic and the like. And I have to say, yes, the music is rather wonderful...... for the first fifteen seconds anyways, because after that it just loops over again. Even the most beautiful tune in the world is going to sound annoying and overplayed after looping it every half a minute. Add this to the already grating grind settup and what would just be a minor annoyance to my ears suddenly turns into the music I hear in my nightmares. Of course, a good way to break this tedium would be to play the levels in a party. Yes, this is an MMO after all, and thus you're given the option to play levels with up to three other players. In fact, the game actually encourages it (In a way that I'm not too fond of, but it honestly doesn't get me angry enough to talk about it.). Unfortunately, the only form of communication that the game provides is a text chat, which does not go well with the fast-paced action prevalent in the gameplay. As a result, playing in a party can usually be equated to a giant cluster♥♥♥♥ of screams, explosions, and screen shaking. Overall, I'd give the whole PvE aspect of the game a miss. Gameplay (PvP): Now, in my opinion, this is where the game truly shines. One of the problems I had with PvE was the non-threatening enemies, and replacing them with one enemy who can actually outsmart you certainly fixes that. And the fast-paced gameplay is right at home in this mode, creating moments where the difference between victory and defeat lies within a nanosecond. I've had matches where both I and, I suspect at least, my opponent were sweating bullets throughout. Matches where I felt like I had to actually contact them and thank them for providing me with such an amazing fight. What's unfortunate is that I can count the amount of matches like this that I've actually had in Elsword on one hand. It seems like for every opponent pitted against me at the same level as me, there were about fifty who were forty levels below me and fifty who were forty levels above me. This can be blamed on Elsword's rather bad matchmaking system. So, to summarize on actual gameplay, look somewhere else. Community: I remember a review talking about how the people in this game are really friendly and playing in the community is fun and how it's so easy to make friends in this game. I can only assume that they were an extrovert and thus able to make friends anywhere else, because, for an introvert such as myself, the majority of the people that I seemed to get acquainted with were people that I wanted to reach through the computer screen and punch in the nose. But maybe I'm wrong on this. Maybe all those annoying players were just a small fraction of the player populace, and the majority of the players on this game are nice, decent individuals who don't get upset when you tell them that no, you don't want to friend them just because you said something remotely funny while in a level. But if that's the case, then it certainly isn't obvious to me. Management: While I don't seem to agree with them on some things, the creators behind this game do seem to take care of it. Bugs and issues are practically nonexistent, and updates are rather frequent. They also hold events for their players. No matter what day, there's always some kind of event going on in Elsword (which, to me, totally undermines the whole POINT of an event, but whatever.), where any player online during it can get a special item only available then and there. It just feels as though they're focussed on all the wrong things. It seems like, for every update made to balance the game or fix issues, there's about twenty updates made to add a new costume to the in-game store. Oh, yes, they have an in-game store, where things in it cost real money. Some items even have additional stat increases when worn. Now, debate can be made over whether or not these increases have any real impact on gameplay, but frankly, it's the fact that there are stat increases in the first place that pisses me off. There's more to be said about this feature, but I feel plenty of people have already harped on it enough that anything I say here would just be a rehash. Closing: This isn't a game meant to bring in new players. This is a game meant to keep old members mindly interested and not think about any other way they could be spending their time, turning the grindfest that is its gameplay into a reasonable sacrifice for getting this totally new accessory only available on a certain day and then doing the same exact thing the very next day. It becomes very easy for one to become addicted to the promise that is a free accessory. The only reason that I got out when I did was because I realized what was happening. But others are not so lucky. Even today, there are those stuck in this endless loop with little hope for escape. Do not join them. Stay away while you can.			"

												Ignore my play time. I have played this game since Closed Beta in 2011. I partially did not want to write this review but I grew tired of the bullcrap this game has gone through.The game was fun. Fast forward to 2015.I'll be honest. Grand Chase can't even compare to the amount of pay to win that this game has, and that says a lot. In order to stand a chance in PVP, you have to sacrifice money. Costumes have stats in them and are extremely overpriced. A full set can cost you between $25-$31.Everyone and their cats in SSS ranks will have a Ring of Fury(aka Ring of Free Combo) which costs $8, and/or a +11 weapon, which there is little way of upgrading it that far without forking the money over. Magic Necklaces are a necessity, which again, costs $8. Don't even bother with Ice Burner sets because that's a huge money sink too. PVP Skill only applies when both sides spend enough money, and have a good connection with each other.Elsword's Netcode is even worse than Grand Chase, as it's very common to run into players who lag, ignore your hitstuns and walk out of your combos. Even back then when the game was only  restricted to only NA and Oceanic players, lag was still common in PVP.The events we had lately are either cash shop, or just useless. There is little incentive to even bother participating in many of them. Especially our current halloween event where there is no way to maximize the rewards you get without cashing. Character balance is atrocious. It seems that KOG doesn't care about character balance, as each character that gets released gets more and more overpowered. Older characters, from Elsword to Eve(except for Runeslayer) will have a very hard time standing a chance against newer characters in PVP. They take very long to get to balancing anyway.I'll admit, I did cash, but not frequently. But until KoG steps up their♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not going to give them my money. And the more they force me to cash, the less incentive I have to play the game anymore.Don't get me wrong though. Elsword is still a great game, and very fun as long as you play casually and not take the game seriously. PVP is an absolute joke for reasons stated above, so just♥♥♥♥♥♥around. If you want to play a bit seriously, there are some guilds out there that have developed the competitive scene, but like I said, you're going to have a hard time standing a chance in PVP without spending some money.For those who want to play Elsword, be warned that you're going to have to use the cash shop at some point in your gameplay. It's a necessity.			"

												Awesome game and addictive. A very good game that has jrpg elements in terms of gameplay. Can be a bit repetitive at times but overall it is a great game!Now after playing more than 400 hours, I can say that even though i have spent money on the game, there are still many other factors such as skill that play an even bigger role than pay to win issues. As much as having a super cool costume, magic necklace, and a ring are important, they are NOT essential in the game. As much as there are people that spend so much money that it is impossible to beat them, the chances of facing those people are pretty low. There are a few cash issues invluding the ridiculous item mall prices but again, you dont have to pay to win. Its just nice and I still believe that Elsword is a great fast-paced side-scrolling MMORPG.Gameplay:Gameplay wise, the dungeons are nice and graphically designed beautifully with a mix of monsters for each different major area. Each dungeon has unique bosses that are designed to not be total walkovers. Even though once you get to level 55+ there is a bit of level grinding, with the constant addition and promotion of new characters, Elsword is a very good game. On the other hand, the PvP community is practically brain-dead with sore losers and rage quitters. Since you have to pay $9 for extra skill slots for the in game (you start with 4 and the skill slot gives you 4 more) they constantly call you a spammer. Also, level difference plays a huge role as players level 65+ often have end game equipment that makes others look like they dont do damage.Overall : 9/10			"

												If you want a fun dungeon brawling game, sure, this is your kind of game.If you want a fair balanced PvP system, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself.Those last three words is a summary of the entire ""balancing"" system of the game, in which they have weakened some characters beyond belief (and might I add you'll still be hated for playing them) and strengthened some to be god's smiting fist. and as of now, with this collab cash grab, Rose, or female gunner from DFO, youll be given hell after hell with the rediculously overpowered class changes they present, and are presented.Key features of Elsword online (positive)Good visuals during attacks and combat(i personally was never interested in the story but)pretty good story for anyone who actually cares to readand leveling feels rewarding.Cons. (and the cons are mainly for the bread and butter of the game- its PvP system) Oh baby, here we go.starting with non PvP1. Stamina bar- but can easily be exploited through events that give off alot of stamina potions. still annoying.2. What is balance? baby dont hurt me!3. ""I have an army!"" ""We have a laggy elsword!""4. ^ the following characters and/or specific classes lag. not even salty, i played them myself just to test it4.1 symptoms of these are: jumping out of or hitting you through your own attack and on a rarer case, hitstunning you while super armored***4.2 These classes/characters are: Elsword-All, but infinity sword is a little less like its counterparts.Ara-All. thats it, no balance, just lag.Add-Diabolic Esper class, but really, were you actually planning on hitting him?and mainly, Rose the cashgrab- All and will most likely always be all. no balance, no logic, no effort.*** For those who don't know (new or interested players) there is an effect called super armor gained through using certain command skills/skills and they make the player grow bright red around the outline of the sprite, signifying that you'll take less damage and be able to take hits without hitstun.My part of this review will talk about KOG games inability to balance characters.when they did revamps earler this year they made 2 characters at a time so ridiculously overpowered. after all characters were released, they finally ""balanced"" the classes.and when KOG ""balances"" they weaken whoever the players ♥♥♥♥♥ about, and strengthen the ones everyone loves. so that means more cocky players.with more updates and ""revamps"" they seem to love calling them, the game started killing itself from within, now if you dont have a laggy or unfair match, I'll be really surprised.This is my non-biased review, the things i have mentioned in this game, are things I have come across on both ends of playing as- and have had played against in this games PvP system. The game would be Highly Recommended by me if the imbalance didnt kill the fun. Maybe one day it will be fixed. but not anytime soon it seems! ^-^'			"

												Would recommend avoiding this game at its current stage if you are a new player.EDIT: Ignoring all the points listed below there is currently an issue where players are experiencing sever frame drops which has yet to be resolved.https://elswordforum.koggames.com/showthread.php?275348-Drop-FPS-is-backCurrent State:-Player VS Player Portion: Pay to Win + people from outside of NA cause lag issues (game has a p2p connection).-Required to pay 9$ just to use 8 skills instead of 4 on a character (unless if you feel like you can make do till you can afford to buy one with in game money off of another player or hope for an event to hand out a free skill slot).*Edit: Creating a new character and achieving your characters Job Promotion will net you a temporary 30 Day Skill Slot to use 8 skills.-Gambling System (Ice Burner Pieces): The gambling system in this game requires a ton of cash if you wish to aquire any of the more premium costumes. The rate is increadibly low and the rewards being less than desireable. You can forgo this and purchase a regular costume set for around 24-30 USD or alternatively wait for an event to hand out free costume pieces or buy them off the board with in game money.-Cash Cow Server: The mother server for this game happens to be in Kr which recieves exclusive content and benefits and most of the events which are brought over to the other servers end up having watered down rewards.-Most suggestions and feedback in the official forums seems to be unable to actually be implemented rendering the section to be useless for the most part leading to minimal community changes being implemented.

												I love this game.. cute characters, nice combos, fun pass time.. But if you hate it, then.. Here~ Make an apple pie instead :3Pastry2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.			"

												Elsword in itself, is actually a pretty repetitive game. Frustrating and basic.However, having said that. It clearly has some form of enoyable charm that keeps players coming back for more, with the fast paced crazy combat, intense PVP action and overall captivating competitive gameplay, the game clearly can keep a player entised for hours on end, for weeks and weeks to come. Though there is a cash-shop that holds a lot of important things, such as slot expansions and inventory space. The game is not only playable without having to pay a single thing. You're more than likely going to find yourself being able to justify making purchases within the game, as you'll play it that often and enjoy it that much.			"

												Pros:-The Updates.-Cool game to play with friends.-Personallitys are well done in the dialogue and is fun to read.Mixed:-Pvp/Sparring Now this can be eiether pro or con  pvp isn't just something you look at and say ""Yeah its bad"" Not to me it all depends on the person you fight and what personallity its like taking a gamble if you pvp you might get the ""Excessive Try-Hard"" kinda fighter who wants to give as little of chance as possible or you might get that rare occurance of someone who complements, stays silent or says gg I mean just being respectful at all. Sure there is much other types of people to but yeah I put Pvp and Sparring in the mixed session.Cons: -The Stingy♥♥♥♥♥people who can't take a loss seriously.-Matchmaking is meh usually if you just fought the person you just got done battling if you both enter the que most likely you two are going to be paired again.MY Opinion: I think Elsword is a really fun game expecially when you have friends tagging along with you in dungeons or forming up teamwork for pvp. Pvp for me isn't that bad I don't think it is pay to win I've beatten plenty of my fare share of♥♥♥♥♥kicking in arena you just got to earn your way up nothing but leveling and saving ED to get somewhere IF you really set your mind to building yourself up for arena you can achieve it without money. The updates are just exciting and always have me waitting to see what they could do next to bring to the table. Well done game.			"

												If you're willing to ""invest"" hundreds of hours in a game and can afford to pay at least $100 (or more) to have decent equipment, mounts and stats, then I recommend you to play this game. This game is not casual at all xD it will suck your life out, and you will feel good about it. Of course that would be if you're able to spend some cash on it. I'll write some pros and cons of this game that, as an ex-player of Elsword, noticed in all my in-game experience.Pros:1. Nice move combinations.2. Epic music and visual detail.3. A VERY social game. Most of the community (non-pvp community) is not toxic, and if you play for a while you'll notice that to be successful in this game, you need to be on a guild, which is not a hard thing to do. 4. Constant updates and twitching.5. Great mod system. (GMs are great)6. Every character has something different to offer. They are fun to play for a while. You can have several characters to play with, with different gameplay and spells. You will be amazed, really.7. PvP system is fun. There's 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 matches. You can even prepare your own fights against your friends.8. Item trade system is great. 9. You can chat with everyone in the area you're currently are.Cons:1. The player economy is broken. There's an in-game market were players can sell their items and let me tell you, everyone is greedy as hell, and inflation is constant in there. Wanna have in-game money? You need to either spend days farming for loot to sell or spend some bucks in the game. 2. The best items in the game require you to either play months to obtain them or to invest cash. And by the way, the very best items in the game are obtained through some sort of ""raffle system"": you buy ""ice burners"" and ""fossil readers"" that will randomly give you items. Most of them are trash, And yes, some dollars are required for this. 3. Very linear gameplay. Can get boring after a while.4. Some characters are unbalanced. Just play a PvP against an Add. Or let yourself get combo'ed by a LK.5. Item space is A JOKE. Space is very limited, and yes, you will get LOTS of valuable items through the game. Want some more space? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$6. Personal Message system was programmed by monkeys. You'll learn that whispering is the way to go. 7. Stamina. You'll see that it is a great issue during your Elsword journey. There's never enough stamina xD. But there's Unlimited stamina on weekends (yay)8. Freaking low drop rate for loot. Like, really low.9. THAT PVP COMMUNITY DOE.Wanna be the very best? Like no one ever was? Wanna Crit like a champ? Spend cash and get those OP stats you search for. Jokes aside, you'll enjoy this game for a while, if you don't mind either having ""below average"" stats for a while or spending some $$$ on the game. Have fun with your cash... ehh, I mean in Elsword!			"

 ~~ My Review ~~  Introduction  Hello, I have started playing this game since 2014 and this is my opinion and review of this game. I know a lot of people won't bother to read lengthy text so I will just put the information in point form.  Pros  + Wide variety of character to choose from with each of them having their own unique skills+ Great soundtrack from different stages and towns+ Simple to use marketplace without the need of using real cash to open up a shop+ A lot of the event is suprisingly great. It another way of making income in a quick way+ The number of customization you can apply to your character is massive+ Colorful artstyle and appealing graphics  Cons  - Pay 2 Win. You need to use real cash to upgrade your skills and inventory slots. However, you able to purchase it with in-game money. That if you are rich - PvP is extremely unbalanced with certain characters able to dominate a wide number of character/class due to cheap skills and overpowered attack- Repetitive and grindy gameplay. Some of the crafting items requirement is really rediculous which could take you a week or more.- Stamina system !!! Seriously, that crap features belong to a mobile games not a MMORPG games. I understand that it used to prevent players from playing the game too long but that doesn't mean you should limit the amount of time they spend playing on the game.- Resurrection system is horrible in my opinion. You cannot respawn within the same area you last die unless you spent real cash to buy more resurrection items. Another way is through event but it depends on what event they will put into the game.- A character named Rose make many of the character felt obsolete especially Chung since it is a much more superior class than the other one- Toxic community though this is just as expected when playing a MMO game - With each update, the game is getting more worse especially the inclusion of additional stats and unbalanced equipment- Unstable servers that kicked you out of the game even with strong internet connections. Seriously KOG, fix your servers @_@ - No steam achievement integration and steam trading cards to keep player more interested in investing in this game Final Verdict  Sadly, I can't recommend you guys to play it. Sure the gameplay is quite fun but with each update Elsword is progressively getting worse and the developer is hunger for more money than actually caring more about the player. I missed the old Elsword where everything is straightforward and simple. I started to quit and stopped spending on this game already. Greedy developer like KOG simply doesn't deserve my money. You want to bring back players ? Fix what is broken first otherwise more and more player start leaving.At least Korean Elsword is much more fairer to player and still going strong to this day.R.I.P North America Elsword = 2011-2014  Final Score  Old Elsword - 8.5/10New Elsword - 4/10  "

												Used to be a fun game until the community went down hill. Consumers arent having fun then before, barely any new contents, literaly went from entertainement to marketing, items are over priced, pvp is 100% P2W if you're not willing to spend money to this game, dont play PvP. The only thing i enjoyed about this is the PvE and the new Hero mode, that's the only reason im playing this game. Basically new update in this game means new items in the item mall, 8$ per piece, prices doubled if you want a permanent costume PART. The ice burners are the only thing feeding the developpers with *profit*. New costumes? Get it from ice burners only, you know the item which you have♥♥♥♥♥♥luck / RNG even after spending 800$. Even the halloween costumes are dumb, why arent the creators that won the halloween costume contest 2016 getting the costumes they made if they won? Instead give them K-Ching (in game monney currency) that allows them to buy the costumes they made instead of giving it for free sure. I had high hopes when they started to put new game modes, but its hard to enjoy them if the servers aren't stable. Instead i see players teleporting or me getting the connection interrupted message while my internet speed is good enough to run a game without lag? They DID listen to the consumers but that was only for the balance patch. TL:DR The game is becoming worst and worst, PvP is pure P2W (Unless you do spar with a friend), new update means that you need to spend money to get the new items, game is purely focused on marketing instead of *Entertainement*, community is not friendly at all even players in game that spam *Git Gud* or *Lagger/Runner*, used to be satisfying, pve is still fun (But now they limited the grindings you need to do to get gears).

												Pay2win garbage. To start off you're going have to pay an extra 8/9 bucks just to be able to use 4 extra skills on your hotbar, and this is for each character you make.. not account shared.  Overpriced cash shop, going to have to pay almost 30 bucks for a costume if you want your character to look unique. They limit you in a lot of aspects to  nickel and dime you for ""convenience"" items... like the skill usage I mentioned above. Want more mana gain from your attacks or when you're recieving damage so you can you use more skills in a dungeon/pvp? Well you can just buy a mana necklace for 8$ more for a pernament version. Want a nice pet? pay up. Do you want that pet to pick up all your drops from the dungeon? You got to pay even more on top of that. Anyways, the game is really repetitive/grindy.. no surprise for your typical Korean MMO. Endgame revolves around you repeating the same dungeons to complete daily quests. PVP is completely unbalanced starting from the characters and to the gear and bonuses some costumes give. The pay2win factor can really be noticed there. Don't get me started on the economy. Due to inflation and like zero money sinks, this game's currency (ED) is pretty much considered worthless. I always wondered why Korea Elsword always had a better economy compared to their other region counterparts. It just makes me think that KOG and KOG GAMES (gamer's publisher/developer) doesn't care at all for the nonKorea servers and just sees an opportunity to squeeze as much money as possible from us. Also there's a stamina system in this game that limits how much you can play each day .This game is indeed fun though with its combat, and I really do love the character designs also (especially Aisha's and Ara's) .It might be fun at first, but after reaching max level and grinding dailes to craft gear... I was like what's the point if I'm struggling to play this game regularly without using my wallet frequently. If you're not going to spend  money on this game especially for pvp, I wouldn't even bother playing it. The combat got boring after repeating the same dungeons over and over. And on top of the overpriced cash shop, the broken economy, unbalanced pvp, pay2win aspects, and the toxic community (at least when I played)...    I would say it's better to pass on this game and play something else. ------------------------------------------------------------ Edit: I understand that there's an extreme fear of ""pay2win"" when it comes to f2p mmos/mmorpgs nowadays. I also apologize if I repeated that word too much here on my review. But after playing both on the NA and Philippines(including b4 the International Merge) server for almost 2 years, I believe that this fear is true with this game and not an exaggeration.			"

												After playing thise for 2rys(not playing on Steam) I still recommend this game, but it has tons of flaws in it. I should start off by saying that story is not its best. As for the gameplay....oh boy. If you're not having, you're straight up not having fun and surely won't while in the dungeons, some of the quest from Feita and beyond will have repeating the same dungeon over, over and over again. It could be a dungeon you absolutely despise. As for the characters, they're not there best either. You'd think such a game as this has balancing, but no KoG doesn't believe in balancing. I'm staring right at Wind Sneaker on this one. In PvP, you're either gonna try your hardest or die at it because once you run into someone who is S or higher will the most OP gear you've seen, your chances of winning are slim unless your absolutely sure you got this down. The content, its good but the fact that KC waters it down gets me and probably other players fustrated. Such as the latest update with the Market Revamp, I desk slammed my face so hard. No ED sinks, at all or a proper Gate of Darkness. The only thing thats not keeping me from quitting are the characters Raven, Elboy and the coming soon to NA, Add. Also, my motivation to get to lvl70 and reach for rank SSS. I'm gonna stop, this review seems long and I've explained quite enough. Yes, I still recommend this game to people who are new to this type of Gameplay, but those who seens games like this? Not a chance.			"

												where to begin... the cash shop is VERY expensive, about $30+ for a costume and $10 for extra skill slots (which should be there to begin with) i would say the balancing sucks but there is no balance. they just buff whatever they want to buff and make it overpowered to one shot in PvP. as for the community it's the most toxic community in the entire history of any game i've ever played in my entire life (yeah even worse than CS:GO and every MOBA out there) and the people who run the game pay ZERO attention to what the community is saying. i swear they're just stealing KR's updates and just using those cause of how lazy they are... even though they have said they do it different than other servers which is complete BS i follow KR so i know what they do and it's EXACTLY the same. they don't do sht to their own server... my advice? don't waste your time with this game. go play B&S or DFO something i promise you'll thank me in the long run.

												Ok, I'm going to start this off by saying I played this game a few years back and loved it, I came back not long ago and was again enjoying it but i'm going to tell everyone to not install this game.I installed it and it ran fine for about a week, then it's anti cheat software called Gameguard which it auto installs without telling you updated, after said updated the game wouldn't launch and when I tried restarting steam it wouldn't launch either. I tried unsinstalling steam to reinstall it to see if that would fix it, the files for Gameguard refused to delete and I had to go through a long process of changing ownership of files, digging up files to delete them, removing seemingly random Regestries and then finally booting into safe mode to finally remove Gameguard and be able to use steam again. So yes, this game is good, but sadly it installs an anti cheat system that can basically act like a virus and is a massive headache to remove, so i'd recommend avoiding it.			"

												[EDIT 3/29/17: They're removing the weekend's unlimited Stamina perks. And just like that any motivation I had for the already needlessly tedious grinding is completely gone.]=Pros= It looks cool and the story's good. That's it.And now for the bigger list. Just saying, don't let my hours spent playing fool you.=Cons=  - Counter-intuitive mid to late-game combat goes completely against what you were taught before. If you're a newcomer to any dungeon past Feita, forget about winning without an OP party that barely gives you any opportunity to do anything.Have fun losing your revives to a massively difficulty-spiked boss and being made fun of rather than helped.- Community is among the worst I've seen in my life with regards to how they handle new players. They'll badger you for lucky pulls from boxes (which will come few and far between unless you open your wallet like some retard), but that's about it. Hate is tossed around between players a lot, especially where the bullsh~~ PvP is involved.- Unholy-bad problem with class balance. This, in a nutshell, is why I quit taking PvP seriously and only do it for sh~~s and giggles with friends. While some characters are built very well, there are others such as Eve that can barely do a god-darned thing on her own and others still that are so godlike compared to everyone else that they just crush all opposition with little to no resistance (Add, Elesis, Lu/Ciel, etc).- Unless you figure out every little trick and trigger in the book like a tryhard who has nothing better to do with their time, I'm fairly certain even going by so-called ""Pay2Win"" will not help you. The mid to late game will take just about every opportunity to punish you by chopping off around half your health simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time once (which, more often than not, newcomers will not be able to tell when that is), and it doesn't help that there are way too many windows for that to happen with how long it takes to kill things later unless you have those stupid +11 weapons that are next to impossible to build anyway with how low enhancement success rates are.- Don't play solo when aiming for levels. EVER. It takes way too freaking long, and even with a party in tow you'll find yourself repeating segments of the game way more than any sane person should.- Annoying notifications about who did what 24/7, which by the way get in the way of your experience and stamina bars so you can't see them.- Storage space is too small, and you have to pay to expand it. The amount of times I've had to sell, dismantle, or throw away useless armor and weapons well below my level is downright disgusting.- I mentioned this before, but the equipment enhancement system is hands-down the WORST I have seen in ANY game. I'm convinced I could play against FF12's infamous superboss Yiazmat and (somehow) beat it, and it would not take nearly as long as it would to get a decent late-game weapon in this game because of how low enhancement success rates are, and the consequences for LUCK-BASED FAILURE are ridiculous; sometimes nothing will happen, others your equipment will LOSE a grade or even drop all the way back down to a +0, or it will outright break for no good reason.- Same goes for enchanting effects time-wise. It takes way too long to get just one necessary material, and if you're looking for anything specific then good luck because all of the in-game ways to get them are completely random and few and far between (some of which will have you again chancing death).I could go on for hours about how many sloppy design choices this game made. Yes, it is free to play and some things can be fun THE FIRST TIME, but with how much of a stupid grind-fest it quickly becomes and how asininely and increasingly unfair and unforgiving it becomes to newer players (Dark Souls and classic NES games are more forgiving than this game is), even if you're looking for some kind of time waster I would ultimately say... look somewhere else. This game will not do new guys any favors unless they're prepared to pour out their wallets (and I can't guarantee even that will help you). Do I find it fun? Kinda, but I'm highly doubtful you will.			"

												This game is absolutely awful, the older, original characters (Elsword - Eve) are completely outclassed by any of the later characters (with some minor exceptions). Therefore, if you like competitive PvP at all your best bet is going to be 1 or 2 classes, Add and Luciel at the moment. Additionally, if you aren't in NA you may experience Elsword's Laggers, you will be staring at your screen watching someone warp around everywhere while their skills buffer randomly and end up killing you, fun.The leveling is trash, it consists of doing the same dungeon 3 times, once on any difficulty, again on hard and again on very hard, for EVERY dungeon. Once you get up to skill notes and job changes they consist of grinding the same dungeons sometimes upwards of 20 times or paying $5 USD.Which brings me to the cash shop, sure it's a free to play game but, it may as well not be, you start off with a ridiculously small inventory which you have to pay about $2 USD to expand by 8 slot, 8 SLOTS, to top it off you need to buy these for every one of the inventory cateregories : Special, Inventory, Consumable, Item, Quest, you'd need to pay $10 USD just to upgrade each of those inventories by a measly 8 slots (not enough, so you more have to spend about $30 USD just go get enough inventory space). Then there's the costumes, they cost about $30 USD each and if you want to play competitive PvP good luck without a costume, also, if you want to play Luciel you need 2 costumes so $60. The worst part is: costumes and inventories aren't shared across characters so, that $30 USD you just spent on your main character's inventory, yep, you need to spend another $30 for every other character you want to play on,Please don't play this game, it's Nexon's second Maplestory and is nothing but a shameless attempt to grab as much $$$ as possible.

												The game is ridiculously pay-to-win like many others have said. You can have fun early on without having to pay an arm and a leg, but it will soon become obvious how repetitive the game is without dropping a chunk of change. So the hope is to draw you in big time, and get you pay even bigger to continue enjoying the experience.			"

												Yes, It doesn't say I've played elsword on steam, but off steam, i've had over 3 years of gameplay.This game is EXTREMELY fun, it is a great game but, i cannot recommend it due to the overpriced pieces on the NA server. It'll take around a whole month of playing to get a good top piece, just buy dungeoning. The only other way your gonna get that is by spending alot of damn money for the piece. Some of the pieces are worth over 100$, just with in-game money that'd take years to get. THE PVP IS COMPLETELY UNBALANCED. All the characters in the game are just not balanced. They have their cons and pros, but some characters, only have pros, no cons at all. Some even only have cons considering how stupidly weak they are. Onto the pay 2 win topic again, every expensive top piece gives stats, you need a whole set for more stats, you need money to get +11, probably over 100$ just to ATTEMPT.If your glad to spend alot money on a game. Go right ahead, and you'll have one FUN time in this game. OTHERWISE, don't even bother downloading, getting the highest rank in the game probably will require you to spend around 500$. Getting to level 70 isn't as hard as it used to be.The only good part in the pay 2 win scene in this game is, Elsword even gives chances to get some pretty good weapons, for instance, i spent nothing and got probably 15$ worth of items without even an event. Events give you the chance to get new and cool sets.Overall my rating is 9/10 to the game. But unfortunately spending is the only way your gonna enjoy it. THIS IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME!IGN: Fistomatic			"

												This game is the very definition of free-to-play & pay-to-win. It literally takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥of the phrase and transcends the very meaning of ""micro""-transaction.While the game can seldom be fun in its repetitive PVE grind-quests, the PVP is a complete joke. If you actually expect to stand a chance in PVP, you'll need to shell out $50+ of real money before you even start - like every opponent you'll ever face in there, assuming they aren't either hacking the game, exploiting their character's imbalance of the month, or stunlocking you in a never-ending combo until you lose while they gloat about how♥♥♥♥♥♥you are as they teleport around the map due to their♥♥♥♥♥♥internet connection.Want gloves for your character? 500 K-Ching ($5.00).A full outfit since you're stuck with no clothes and looking like a peasant noob? 5,000 K-Ching ($50).The prices are obscene and KOG knows they can get away with it because mindless ♥♥♥♥wits will openly pay it because they think prices like those are okay. Which sets a lovely example for the new generation of gamers. Not only this, but at every corner/turn/etcetera, this game gives out free items that last for a matter of hours before disappearing. If you want the item, you'll have to pay these kinds of prices for it. Literally just a way to tease players and coax them into♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away their money.And you know what? The greed doesn't stop there. There's a marketplace in the game and there's just as much greed there as there is from the developers. Some people actually expect you to pay hundreds of billions of in-game cash (ED) for the things you want.Literally gaming at its worst. I'm not even going to check the box asking if I got this for free because I've spent the equivalent of two brand new AAA games and still got ♥♥♥♥all out of it. I feel cheated by this game. If there's anything this game succeeded in doing it's this: It made me realize how bad this issue is getting in games today and I promise both this company and the next that I will not touch their game should it include microtransactions.I had two friends who got totally and irrevocably consumed by this game and now spend every penny of real money they earn in it ($150 a month minimum) and won't listen to anything I have to say on the matter. I fear that when they're 25 they'll still be playing this joke of a game and spending all of their earnings on it and will both wind up homeless in the future or something. One of them won't even talk to me anymore because they don't want to hear what I have to say.I would have recommended this game for the purpose of showing people what gaming is not, but I don't want others to fall victim to this horse♥♥♥♥♥♥and other games that follow suit.This last point I'm going to make isn't directly tied to the quality of the game itself but more at the community. I once had a guild in this game called MaliciousEntity and at some point I added a guy who told me some sadsack story and since I felt bad I made him an admin. After that, he took over my guild and it wasn't mine anymore. I ended up leaving and taking my closest friends there with me. Apparently, a friend of mine looked up my guild in the game and he found that a few months down the line, the guy I handed my guild over to bet my guild in a guild war or something and lost horribly, with a score of like 0-32. So my guild was handed over to the other and it was renamed to ""rA"". Maybe my guild will be in better hands with them, because it surely didn't mean much to the guy I initially gave it to.TL;DR:Story: 7/10.PVE: 6/10.PVP: Lol ♥♥♥♥ you.Visuals: 5/10.Community: 2/10Microtransactions=True.Overall: 2.0/10.

												FULL Warning, if someone is planning to read this, be aware this is a long review.Elsword is game that is, like a lot of games nowadays, a game i call 'Junk Food', is good, very good, but only for a while.The Story is simple, nothing mind-blowing, this is both a con and a pro.Since it is simple in generic terms, is nothing special and for so, it doesn't stick out from other games.On the contrary, this eases the player getting into it and makes it easy to understand and value, still i will say this is a case where the plot is maybe... too simple...The aesthetics and visuals are most impressive, in this point in time, nigh-every game is out to look edgy and serious, for so, making Elsword all the more special with its unique anime style artwork and graphics.The characters models, on the other hand are... Meh, driven by their artwork, i was expecting a much more cleaner and precise model, the models look nowhere near as good or detailed as the artworks and at first it bothered the hell outta me, i will say i like almost all of the suits for nearly everyone, but i wish Job Change clothes didn't expire, smart people will see is a cheap way of the developers saying ""Want to look good again? Load up money and buy some sh¡t"".I will not sh¡t on the cloth clipping visual effects when you are wearing too much junk over since a lot of other games also have this issue, plus the fact that is not really a big deal and it doesn't have any relevant impact besides being glaring...Gameplay-wise, i will say Elsword has a very interesting concept and it pulls it off rather well, entering dungeons and combo-ing the sh¡t out of everything that is in the path along with visually impressive attack and a good amount of skills to dish out great amounts of pain without letting your enemies breathe is very satisfying and rewarding... When you learn to get those skills.Blazing through dungeons is very fun and appropiated party combo is a very cool thing to do, however if you are a person who gets dissoriented easily you might find yourself losing track of yourself and your actions due to the amount of shines, effects and explosions on the screen, which admittedly can become very annoying for some people.PvP, on the other hand, has to be the weakest part of the game for me, and i can say for nigh-everybody, the more they attempt to fix things, the more they♥♥♥♥♥♥up, not to mention that, if you have spent a good amount of hours in this game, getting to know the game as much as you could, the unbalance in PvP and how broken it is becomes more evident the more you level up and face people.Leveling up increases base stats like HP, Phy Atk/Def and Mag Atk/Def, also after certain level thresholds, you will be able to learn more skills that do increase your might and power to badazz proportions.In PvP however...Lets run down a list from the less impacting to the most obvious and annoying.1. Crappy Matchmaking System: I know everyone who has spent some decent hours in PvP did experience being like Lvl 30 and you are put to brawl agaisnt a Lvl 45 ~ 70, also when, since the PvP is Rank based (Standard stuff, the more you win matches, the more you Rank up), a beginner of Rank B can be placed to fight agaisnt a Rank A or S, it doesn't impact as much as the Lvl gap matches, but is still a very r3tard3d system.2. LAAAAAAG: Some say the Lag issues were probably inevitable, and to that i say bullsh¡t, i've played many games in which having a below-average internet didn't impacted much on the game itself and didn't made the experience completely suck balls, when you are PvPing (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3) and someone has lag, beating that son/daughter of a b¡tch just became a whole lot harder, in 1v1 the most annoying since if someone has lag, you will be unable to engage the foe in a combo since, you land the hit, but the damage and the flinch is inflicted after a period of time, making the entire concept of the game to be completely shot in the azz.This also applies to instances in PvP 2v2 ~ 3v3 where someone would activate Awakening or use a Special Active that causes Skill Freeze (Everyone in the Skill Freeze reach is immobile and unable to take action until hit or Skill Freeze ends), they are not affected or instances where the Skill Freeze is canceled by someone else who used another move that Skill Freezes, is hard to explain, but get to Lvl 70 and enter 2v2 SS Ranks matches and see for yourself.3: Character Disbalance: This, same as the issue with PvP Lag, becomes more apparent the more you progress and face players at higher levels, certain classes are CLEARLY better than others, being for mobility, damage, coverage or all of the above, this is even more obvious when you look at classes like LK, RS and IS and then you look at classes like LP and MM, and even if the previously issues are not present, some classes are just a cakewalk to use:EM: All she needs to do is XZZ or just keep running away and use Meditation or just stay still and camp MP, Some EMs may say ""Duuude, we need a lot of MP to attack"", and i say, once again, BULL. SH¡T. The moment you get MP, you use the MP, but you get a lot of MP, since EM has the biggest MP gain by attacks and almost all her attacks provide a great MP gain.Rena Classes:♥♥♥♥♥♥them all, To start, all of them noob Renas just spam ^X or ^^X to catch since is fast and has good coverage, don't be surprised if you are caught repeatedly by those noob Renas that just wait for you to approach them and ^X is the only thing they know to do, then there is what i consider to be the biggest facking bummer after Add, RENA'S AND AISHA'S TUMBLING.This abomination of a feature makes it a death-wish to throw Renas or Aisha into the air and hit them while airborne, if you do, they do a flip and as soon as they land, they can jump again, unlike all other characters that after landing, have a slight delay before being able to move, making it very easy for them to cassually hop out of your combos and back-firing you.ADDISON: This MOFO is the epidemy of Aimbot, almost all of his moves cover a good area, any commands he has are so easily spammable that a one-handed fetus with mental problems would be able to combo and nigh all of his moves are homing.He was made with the sh¡ttiest HP output, but you know that doesn't mean a damn when you can't even get close to touching him since he always has the screen bombarded with homing moves.4 and most important. Gear Difference: You can be the best of your kind, the number one as your class, however you face a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that has a cutting-edge gear and wrecks you over in just a few single hits, Gear Carry is without a doubt the biggest facking problem of balance that helps unbalancing the already unbalanced PvP.Costume Parts, Costume Suits, Magic Amulets, Magic Stones, all of those, 90% requiring you to waste real-life money to get easily, these parts do build up a good chunk of your battle stats, and just with that gear boost, a completely ♥♥♥♥ing noob and idiotic player can pot shot a pro player effortlessly by just having the gear advantage, this becomes much more frecuent when you are on your road to SS and SSS, you will find players with absurd stats that with landing 15 hits on you is enough to take you down while you will have to strike them like a sewing machine to get remotely close to depleting a small slice of their HP.In the now PvP Season 3, the gear advantage is even more apparent as it can make playing serious PvP SERIOUSLY UNBEARABLE, More so when you are constantly being placed to fight agaisnt the same exact gear carried douch3bags who have obnoxiously strong gear sets, Even more so when they behave all mighty just because they have the gear upper-hand.Music: No need since music is subjective.END VEREDICT: As i said in the beggining of this review, this is JunkFood game, play it until you get to Level cap and had enough fun with PvP, then uninstall and change to another game.

												I personally dont recommend this, for one, it fails to launch most of the time, and i have to go through uneeded methods just to play most of the time. Another thing is, everything in the items shop is too expensive, where 10 dollars could get you a pretty decent game here on steam hardly gets you jack squat in the items shop. Sure, you COULD get stuff from events but theres no garuntee that you'll have those forever. Not even the clothes you first start out with stick with you forever so  basically you're gonna probablly be walking around in your character's undergarments if, say, you come back to it 15 days later then poof! Its gone, not to mention if you want to actually BUY a costume to stick with you forever if you get one of their packages, can cost you up to 25 dollars or so, sure you could go for the 30 day option but that makes it so its pretty much not worth it to get it that long. Hell, the best costumes are locked behind ice burners and god knows how much money THAT could take just to get the full suit, same goes for mounts but worse, you cant even really buy them, and fossil readers dont garuntee you a mount either. Basically and eventually the game is going to make you feel, pathetically weak even if youre the highest level available unless you cough up some cash just to feel justifiably strong. Not to mention drop rates are horrid, most of the time youll be picking up equipment that wont even help you so you just end up selling it all the time till you magically just happen to pick up ONE item thatll benifit you. I could go on, but, i feel this has gone long enough. Overall if you REALLY want to play this game, go to Void elsword, everthing is more reasonable cash items wise and such and it overall feels more fun and is more functional than the official game overall save for some bugs and etc.(Apologies if this is bad, its my first review ever.)

												What may be addicting and enjoyable for others turned out to be boring and overall frustrating for me.  The cash shop blatantly awards paying players an advantage over FTP's and provides all kinds of fast-tracks of progression which make playing without paying an agonizing experience.  Once you get to around level 30, which I did, you realize that many of the skills available to unlock require you to complete unbearably repetative tasks, and nearly ALL quests ask you to do the same thing, and that is ""complete this long boring easy dungeon 5 times.""  To get the items required to unlock skills, you have to do the same dungeon DOZENS of times.  There aren't really many available methods of leveling up, and around where I got I realized that there really isn't much content in this game.  6 or 7 zones total with 5 or so linear ""kill-all-enemies-to-move-on"" dungeons (can't recall the exact amount), that you will complete an inordinate number of times in order to progress through the game.  In order to make up for the marked lack of content, they slow down the progression systems with repetative quests, stamina, and slow exp gain.All of this, I say, would be excuseable if the combat system was phenomenal.  Well, I think it isn't, and this is where the frustration comes in.  I'm no noob when it comes to pc games.  Most of the games I've played require accuracy, speed, and precision in great amounts.  So I was naturally excited when I started learning the combat of this game, but I was soon disillusioned.  I would describe the combat as overall clunky.  There is no such thing as intuitive, fluid movement here, unless you perfect certain very difficult patterns that exploit properties of certain skills: patterns that are easy to mess up.   I would repeat a combo over and over again and have it be performed sucessfully only about 50% of the time.  I did get quite good at it, but it was never fun.  I never felt like I was truly in control.			"

												Probably not worth your time.If you like anime, some fan-service, sidescrollers, and grinding you'll be fine.The Elwiki[www.elwiki.net] is a great resource if you're going to play.I've been playing on and off for a long time.The game makes a ridiculous effort to cockblock my attempts at progress. There's a stamina bar that limits how many monsters that can be killed in a day (it's manageable, especially with unlimited stamina weekends), but more importantly the EXP rates screw you over around level 45. I've been forced to grind several times in between dungeons around Velder for that reason, and it appears at the same spots on every character.The progression itself doesn't feel very spectacular. You only get a skill every five levels which isn't too often when the cap is 70. Once you finally do get a variety of skills, you're locked to only using four at a time unless you pay $10 for an expansion. Changing jobs is what pathes the way to more skills, but it also gives you new combos to use in addition to your character's base ones. The problem here is that most of these combos can be impractical to use, so having more than one of a character can feel incredibly repetitive.You mostly play the game by using combos. You also have to practice catching opponents in PvP and knocking them down wastes a good opportunity. Knocking down monsters reduces the damage they take and they may retaliate with a strong attack. Combos are pretty easy to do in PvE, especially since you can just obliterate the first 20 dungeons without a care. btw don't solo. Love yourself (and your stamina). Monsters tend to be more aggravating than they are challenging.The art is pretty and the outfits have a unique style, but the characters have been driven to almost exclusively fan-service. This is most apparent in the recent customization options (cash only) that have appeared in the Korean server. Most (if not all) of the new female art is sexualized.There haven't been many efforts to upgrade the ""anime"" quality to the game. They've stuck to the same assets they've had since the beginning which is ironic when I see ads saying ""Play your manga!"" as if that were the main appeal.The characters weren't amazingly unique but they had their own things going for them. Effort has clearly dropped in development, however, and this is most apparent in their most recently released character, Add, a blatant ripoff of Accelerator from A Certain Magical Index. Although it makes sense to try to appeal to anime fans in this way, it exhibits the disrespect the game has for its own storyline. The character preceding was an imitation from their previous game--a callback and a bit of respectable fanservice--so it was no foul, but, to be fair, it also wasn't the pinnacle of creativity.The worst part is I'm going to keep playing.

												I have been playing before add got released, it was fun back then because the only try hard people did - was combos.Now players try hard in pvp so much that everytime you even so much as to touch them, they instant mana break.[if this is salting to you, so be it, like i'd give a shizzle (^: ]Mind you, this is between A rank to S rank, I can only imagine when you get to SS,SSS and Star rank.With Elsword becoming more broken and characters who are usually released become more unbalanced..I really suggest you leave before you get a taste of salty players and hypocrisy.  did i mention lag? yeah, lag, got to love it I am in the brink to quitting the game itself if it weren't for other players who gives me a reason not to or shows me that there is slight hope to this game *cough*At least they made earning gear more easier than it was before, yet still, even after obtaining gear that you thought could beat those others who has..  +10 and +11 amirite? LOL nah, pay to win always [wins], overly geared is considered ""good""  i miss the times when people's definition of good is actually being able to pull off a combo In overall the current time that i have spent in this game has only given me a large amount of salt, even though i cashed for costumes.(I play outside steam in case anyone is about to bash me saying it shows I haven't played much)Did I also mention that in pvp nowadays, people do the low rank and high rank duo in 2v2? lmaoPve, oh good ol' pve, goodbye x""D[update] PAY TO WIN ON PVE TOO, HOLY MOLY... should i be selling weed to pay for my gear? cuz with my payments, it's like paying for hospital bills or university tuition fees. The only good part or ""fun"" part is where you play with friends ==;Update:-tried pvp, i cried salt.WHERE THE DINGLE IS THE DAMN BALANCE MAN? THIS IS SAD-constant threats of bans cuz I ""hack"" this is an infection god demmit. INFECTIONS LIKE THESE SHOULD BE KEPT WITH RESIDENT EVIL GAMES!

												 This game is the very worst possible evolution of the Free to Play model. Hotbars locked behind a paywall, bag slots locked behind a paywall. Anything resembling the art style of the game in  a set of armor, paywall. And these aren't tiny 1 dollar or 2 dollar paywalls, this crap is like 30 dollars at the least! Some things can be unlocked for 5 or 6 dollars, but each item is priced just high enough to send you up to the next 10 dollar incriment of the in game currency! Everyone in the game is decked out in high end outfits and you look like you are a character from another friggin game when your free clothes expire. Oh yeah, you pay 30 bucks for an outfit and it has a licence that expires most fo the time if you don't pay double for it! Don't get me started on premium emotes, stances and PVP gear. All around this game would be a blast if there wasn't a pay wall jammed into every nook and cranny of the game to the point it becomes totally unplayable. I would gladly throw a dollar on an outfit, maybe 5, but this pay model is off the charts ludicrous!			"

												(I keep my statement, this game is still sinking lower each day)Has of the Sanders introduction and the Skill Tree Revamp that this game has gone downfall for the following reason, agree with me or not. (Lets compare some facts with Korean Server).- Its almost impossible to not need a B-slot, which is a Cash item.- Comparing with Korean Server, the experience tables in North America are so high that makes grinding a boring thing. (It used to be fun at some point). Nobody likes do grind like that, although now it's easier since they changed them to the JP ones, still KR are lower.- Not to talk about the random updates [Random has in not making sense like GoD and their Random Cubes mechanics].-You can trade your liver for the cheapest ice burner gloves, hope you have enough organs to keep up with North American server economy.If you want to experience true Elsword go play in the Korean server.I could keep doing this all day, but why bother?To anyone going to play this good luck out there, the game mechanics is nice and fun, but since the above mentioned its getting less and less fun to play.

												Ive been playing this game for 3 or so years and ive enjoyed every second of it to be honest.                                                                    Pros:+you can play as 10 selectable characters each with their unique fighting style.+good way to waste your time and day.+gameplay can be addicting.+there are some nice people in the community.+you can have some fun in pvp+There are some really fun classes you can try out.+also the game introduces a tutorial for new players so they wont be as lost.+sparring mode can be used to fight with other players or just talk and have funNeutral: *In my opinion the game can be more of a dating website at some point. In sparring I see many men/woman(rarely woman) try and get a date.cons:-pvp can be aggrivating. especially with a lot of salt tossed around in the arena. If you constantly pvp and are fragile in feelings ( ; -; ) then be advised to be careful.-The game is mostly ""pay to win"" as they call it. If you wanna look badass/sexy your gonna have to pay for it. a single costume costs about 30 dollars or more not including accesories. prepare your wallet.-the community has only gotten worse over the years. the game is mostly filled with people who want to date or perverts(*cough* me *cough*. like 90% of the game is nothing but perverts. There are nice one's. I do admit that. Ive met lots of decent people and friends. Even my ex said it. she told me one time. ""When the good admins of the game left. they must have taken all the nice/good players with them.""-sometimes you can see spambots in towns trying to get you to go to their website and get free k-ching (currency that you have to use real money to buy). It can get annoying that you'll have to move locations half the time.-pvp can be a constant aggrivation as well. if your the rage hard type (like me) then expect to rage your heart out.-tutorial can get annoying once you already played the game for so long that you already know how things run.-gameplay can get kinda boring for some people. I personally tried to have one of my ex's play the game, he played it and ran through some dungeons and said ""so this is it? Just do the same thing over and over again and just keep fighting dungeons.""-also there very strict with their policys. If you get caught doing something like cheating and hacks. it will immdediately be permabanned. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. so be warned.			"

												While i like this game, due to the fact i have freinds who play it and are willing to help me out, i just cant recommend it, this game pretty much takes everything bad about f2p, multiplies it by 10 and stuffs it in your mouth. lets see: grinding? yep. pay to win? yep. unbalanced characters? yep. this is scratching the surface of how bad this game is.1. depending on which character you pick everything will either be way to easy or near impossible. no in between. due to new characters being more and more OP with every release. take time tracer for example, he has a passive ability which allows him to shorten ability cooldown times, and has another ""ability"" of sorts which (from what i read) allows his MP and DP to top each other up, which sounds good, but that would desroy anyone in pvp2. levelling is ****, getting to level 15 can be done in about 5 hours, once you are about lv 50 it can take up to a week to level up again and with the stamina bar, you can only do about 20 dungeons a day, and quests can make you do a single dungeon up to four times AND some quests requre a certain level to complete them meaning it will take you about a month to complete a town/village (maybe half a year max for hamel and sander)3. the cash shop. oh god, dont even get me started. this abomonation is so unbalanced its almost laughable. not only are the purchasable things WAAAAY over-powered they are also often expensive as ****.costumes: between $25-$40 dollars for a full set (will give you IMMENSE buffs for pvp) pets: $4 seems cheap right? no. they start as babies and each time they get in to ""special"" stage you have to give them particular food which you have to also buy for about $5 for 10 which will get you to about teen stage (halfway) AND they are also stupidly OP, doing about 200% of your default damage in a single attack.skill notes (will make skills way more powerful): about $1.50 a pop and you can use six at onceneed more inventory space? $2 per tab, and whats worse, you start with about 3 rows of inventory space (9 slots each) and ONE backpack expander gives you: full space? no. 5 lines? no. 2 lines? also no. you get ONE extra line of space, meaning for full tab space (6 lines plus the 3 you get when starting) means $12 per tab and there are about 6 tabs (excluding costumes) means $72 for a full inventorywant to use more than four skills at a time? $9want more potion space? $6want a weapon that is more powerful without the risk of destroying it forever? up to $50 PER EQUIPMENTbasically that is around $100-$200 PER CHARACTER! i think that is enough on the cash shop4. pvp: dear holy mother of god. this is by far the worst thing about this game. if you enter you have to beg to god that your opponent hasnt spent money on the game, if so, you're ****ed. you might as well quit now.5. fossil readers and ice burners:(fossil readers can give you pets and mounts, ice burners can give you costume peices) they are $5 each. and while the items you use them on are relatavly common there is only a VERY rare chance you will get anything of use, meaning you may have to spend around $100 MORE just on these and with ice burners you also have to worry about character specific costumes. imgaine it like this: you spend $50 on ice burners hoping to god you get a costume and finally, on your 20th burner you finally get a peice OMFG I GURT A PEESE!!! and then you see it is for a different character. that means you have a 1:7 chance (that decreases with every character released) on top of the fact there is about a 1:100 chance of getting one in the first place6. dungeons: they are far too easy to the point that most of the time you can solo a dungeon 5 levels ahead of your level and the bosses are generic health bar bosses, bearly any variation, and if there is variation it is ofthen done terribly. super sheild, for example, means the bosses are close to invincible until you do something else (kill lesser enemies, beat the **** out of a ""generator"", so forth)it isnt all bad though, such as, the graphics are decent and the cutscenes they have recently added look great but the pros are far outweighed by the cons anyway unless you have a freind willing to help/give you stuff/give you their life savings, I have to say, avoid this game at all costs! it may look good graphics wise and the trailers are awesome but just about everything else is broken or ****. and sorry for any misspeled words. oh, and if you want a good f2p game look at tf2, robocraft or airmech, i have to say those games are the oppisite end of the spectrum for f2p games, ill post a reveiw for them soon			"

Product received for free
												Back when this game was young, I'd say the characters were more fun to play. (Actually required a brain) Now? So many people are playing the characters that don't. This game (PvP wise) is more class focused. The classes that are pretty much easy and dumb to play are Add (DE and LP) , Ara, Elesis (GM mostly), Chung (IP), Lu/Ciel, and Eve. Although, Eve damage is more balanced in sparring. She's legitimately dumb in arena. So if you want to win A LOT, play a character that doesn't require a brain or minimum work. If you were to put the best LK vs the best DE player, LK would lose. Too many people play easy classes. What's the fun in that? It's horrible for those that plays a character that require more thinking and game plan. If this game were to make the old character more powerful to withstand those easy classes, it would be a lot more fun. The gear in this game are fine. Yes, even with +12, and +11. It's purely based on your class and how good you are with them. But if you're playing a class that requires more thinking, no matter how geared and skilled you are, you will lose to the easy class that is geared and skilled too. Not to mention that this game requires Player to Player connection. This means that if you live in Australia, fighting a player that's in the U.S, you both will experience delay. Some classes are more lag proof than other classes, so you may be at a disadvantage. Surprising Fact: Not a lot of people know about this. You would have to PvP on a class that's hard to play to understand this. (Class vs Class case) P.S I'm a CBT player and a KR player.			"

												I honestly have nothing good to say about this game. - Gameplay, which is supposed to be focused on Combos, feels incredibly lacking. Don't expect anything more demanding than Z+Z+Z+Z+X.- Graphics. Full 3D should be a good thing, right? Nope. Especially when you see the same low-poly 'Bob The Builder' blocks being copy-pasted from dungeon to dungeon. - Deisign. Outfits should be an incredibly tempting 'must-buy' because of how good they look. In Elsword, most outfits consist of White, Black, and an 'Accent'. Or worse: PlayBunny, Demon, Angel, Oriental. - Sounds. I had to turn this off. Battle should consist of the sound of metal colliding and wood breaking...not whoopie cushions being let loose in a vat of butter. - Music. I certainly don't remember any of it, so I went on Youtube and listened to the tracks. None of them have a 'wow' factor...and they almost feel copy-pasted. - PvE. Pretty boring and really to easy to max out. There really isn't that much challenge out there. As I typed this, I even forgot it was playing in the background...wow.- PvP. Hope you spent money if you actually want to win. With regenerating MP, talent can only get you through so much before you end up stun locked or one shotted. Especially when LuCiel gets their 2nd job...- World HUB. This really bothers me because it feels like they're just trying to stretch out the gameplay as well as give you some reason to purchase a Mount. A Mount in a sidescroller. Think about it: $. You can also spend $ traveling from HUB to HUB. Even more bothersome, the World Map is accessible anywhere...so why aren't the two of them tied together instead of being weird seperate entitites?Honestly, Grand Chase S2 was as good as this genre was going to get. Elsword is your typical Korean MMO: No originality, hand holding grind, and a constant squeeze for cash and ideas from the community. If you go into Elsword and find yourself thinking that this experiance could be better, then go hunt down a Grand Chase private server. FGC. Obviously, I'm bitter because KOG failed to improve upon Grand Chase because they wanted to focus on Elsword.			"

												No doubt about it, Elsword is an amazing game with great gameplay and combat. I won't deny that, but what I absolutely hate about this game is the community.I'm an Elsword ""veteran."" I've been playing since before Eve's character release. I can tell you that Elsword had an amazing community with lovable players. It was very easy to make friends and get into guilds. It was like we were a big family. Even if there were tons of us.I'm not here to tell you how I miss the old Elsword. I'm warning you about this game. The community is absolutely horrible. I can't Arena without people whispering me ""You have no skill."" or ""Salty?""It's absolutely depressing. I can't play this game without getting mad and taking it out on players, which only gets worse. Call me salty, that word's overused anyways.I hate Elsword. There was a time when I would recommend this game to you because it was amazing, but that time is long-gone and likely to never return.I don't want to sound like the ""Haha, I've been playing since ____, and this game suCKS! I WANT THE OLD ELSWORD BACK!"" because I, personally, don't like people like that and to be honest, they taint the ""Elsword Veteran"" name.We get it, the game was good back then but stop trying to get it back.That's why I'm quitting this game for good. I've never played such a rage-inducing game. Even Dungeons suck. I can't go through one without the entire team yelling ""hurry up"" just because I'm not at the portal within 1 second of the timer coming up.To be honest, it could just be who I am. Maybe I just have a low temper and all of the idiots are getting to me. You can try the game out yourself, nobody's stopping you. I'm just saying, be warned, the community isn't so lovable.			"

If you like mindlessly grinding extremely easy content, then this might be the game for you, but I personally like more customization and uniqueness in mmos. There are other mmos that do what this game does better.			"

												I have been playing this game since 2012. Yes my steam profile doesnt say that but i downloaded it directly from the web page so it doesnt record into my steam. (i downloaded the steam version recently)So i will tell u about this game and my experience with it  Pros: Variety of character/ classes. There are a total of 34 class with 11 different characters each have their own unique style/ play style-Varieties of skills. Some look and work almost like another but most are unique with cool animation-Cool dungeon design (not game play wise)-A battle can be very cool and flashy which in my opinion never a bad thingAlso this game is not ""pay to win"". Well it does pay to get your character op in 1 week rather than 1 year. But overall most item mall stuff can be obtain completely free via the Board. But with a shet tons of grind With all that said why am i not recommend this game?Cons: The game is full with glitches. Extremely unbalance between class And the developer know absolutely nothing about their game and what their players want-Every basic need that u need in the game u will have to pay for it. Or go and grind and lose your sanity for ED -In game currency- to buy them. Everything from pets, to Skill B slot -an item that give u 4 more skill slot- which should not be a god dam thing that u have to get because it the basic of the gameplay (skill spamming). If u dont own it u get a big disadvantage. Despite how important the item is The developer give it a cost of $9. You can see how greedy they are-Poor dungeon design (game play wise) The dungeon is absolutely repetitive and boring. They have almost no talent in creating a good and actually challenging dungeon (well there are a few but it rare). The boss is so poorly thought out. If u want to fight against bosses that run away or go invincible for like 30 sec while attacking u with their stupid moves and u cant do jack but wait for them until they come back, then this is the game for u cuz it what alot of the dungeons are. -It the worst grind fest game i ever play. i played alot of MMORPG and i know it a crucial part of it But this game bring it to a whole new level of grind. Im at lv 90 (when this post was made) level 99 is the max level. And if u want to lv up to max u gotta do the same stupidly made dungeon for at least 300-500 times which is absurd and REPETITIVE -Bad developer: The developer dont care about their community at all. Result in horrible plagued community with cancerous c*nt who go around trolling and being a d*ck without any consequences. The developer also horrible at balancing and bug fixing. Nerfing a class that dont need it and buff class that is already over power. They always either over buffed a class so it become a monster or just nerfed to hell. The costumer services is horrible and unresponsive. Bad events that make me thinking why these events need to be exist. Alot of events they have usually for player who pay for the game.The reason why im still playing this game is because alot of my friend still play it so at least we can play together and do stupid stuff in game to make it actually fun. Other wise i probably never come back to this trash of a game			"

The Devs of this game should take notes from other successful F2P games such as ""Warframe"" where weapons and mods are still obtainable without the use of money.

There was some semblance of balace in the PVP.All was good with the world.But over time, with the addition of new characters, it became increasingly pay-to-win. The devs don't care. They're getting their precious dollars out of the NA playerbase while the KR playerbase gets all of the goodies.Want a good Action MMO? Go play Dungeon Fighter Online. Pass on this. It may be enjoyable at first, but rest assured that you'll either fall into the Pay-to-Win trap, or quit out of disgust.			"

												Elsword is a fun free-to-play game. You can play as many different characters with many different styles and the whole experience is multi-faceted and allows for a lot of varied gameplay. Upsides: lots of different characters with multiple different styles (except the newest character although I'm sure that will be changing soon enough), lots of different quests, both main and side, and the dungeons are varied and provide a challenge every now and then. Good for casual gamers. Downsides: in-game purchases alter the flow of the game quite a bit, PvP is kinda broken unless you spend a ridiculous amount of time or money breaching the gap, the story line exists but doesn't draw you in at all, guilds are a dice roll in terms of being helpful, multiple mechanics are not explained and require multiple google searches or maintenance requests from their main site for help, and servers have a tendency to be less than reliable.Side note: if you want spend money on their free-mium stuff, it's a tedious process of updating your account on their website *not on Steam* to even buy anything. Another personal gripe of mine is that the in-game costumes (that look really cool btw) are almost always temporary. When you buy them in-game they cost double to keep them permanently, which is just annoying in my opinion. Like, I'm already spending money on your free game, I would appreciate a little bang for my buck, ya know? Sorry, rant over.My downsides list is longer than my upsides list but that's because I have spent a lot of time figuring it out and want you the reader to know what to expect. But honestly, I enjoy the game and I'm being nitpicky because it had a lot to offer. If you like RPG's then you'll like this game. I have put more than 100 hours into this game and still enjoy it but that's honestly the minimum you need to get somewhere productive in the game. It's a good game for a casual gamer looking to kill some time when you want a break from other things or simply a long term grind.			"

												Elsword....if I had to describe the game in one word to represent the game itself and its community I would have to choose the word....SALT. I wish I could get my money back and note that I'm asking to get my money back from a FREE TO PLAY GAME. That game is a penny pincher and is way too savage for a new player that has no financial support to get a good headstart on the game. Even many of the BARE NECESSITIES of the game require paying up to obtain it's not even a matter of obtaining them through more painstaking means. It's purely impossible to get far in the game without paying up unless you spend a full year of suffering on the game and have the luck of every single god from smite. The gameplay isnt even bad but it's very VERY repetitive. The game is too grindy and doesn't pay out enough for all the effort put in. Getting on to the events of the game I find that they are good SOMETIMES but usually the events require paying up for something in the item mall to even benefit from them. The next thing is the cosmetics factor which is OVERLY emphisized in the game or rather due to the community the cosmetic value in the game drains your wallet more than actually playing it. For a free to play game elsword is the most overpriced game I've ever encountered. You could literally use the same amount of money it takes to get 1 full costume set on elsword to buy any 30 dollar game that you could want. Hell I bet most of the people that play elsword could have probably had cars and 4K TVs and a LIFE if they weren't spending it all on chibi korean pixels. The final and most nerve wracking and stressful part of the game is its pvp. MY GOD. Those are the first words that come to mind when looking at the salt seeping out of arena. Arena is already unbalanced because of elswords favoritism of female characters. Due to this things like ROSE were allowed to happen....elsword couldn't even make their OWN CHARACTER for that one. Guess they ran out of trollish ideas and yoinked one from DFO. Rose please....go back home... PvP is already unbalanced as is but by allowing people to bring in +11-12 lvl 85 4D Gear with Raid weapons you only mean to add fire to the flame. I believe that last point on pvp speaks enough for itself for any of those who read this and fight the good fight.			"

												It's an enjoyable game, it really is, but I have to hate on the fact that this game is very 'Pay to Win'. You have to buy yourself the upgraded job/class for 2USD, (which in reality really is not much),  you also get some nice items for doing it, but those items last ~10 days, which ticks me off. If I was allowed to keep those items I'd be happier, but alas, I cannot. It is quite grindy, but what MMORPG isn't? All in all, I recommend it if you have a few bucks in your wallet and you're willing to spend it for a 10-ish day bonus costume and some extra skills, even without the job advancement the game can be fun, but sadly as it is highly P2W I cannot recommend it. If you're going to win me over, the least you could do is let me keep those job advancement items, like c'mon.Note: I have not played very long, nor have I tried the PvP.			"

												Wanted to try out this game for fun since I lost motivation playing Tree of Saviour.You can't play the game without having your account activated, but their automatic email system is ridiculously slow so I didn't bother until the next day. Once I manage to activate my account and got into the game, the game started with all it's audio off with no way to turn it on until you finish the beginning of the game. I found the input unresponsive when trying to perform basic beginner combo on both my keyboard and mouse. I had to spam my keys as if I'm trying to compete with turbo mode. Sadly this is with a latency of ~72ms with their server.Gamepad is not natively supported despite it advertise as having gamepad support on their site (so you will require third party software such as xpadder, joymotion, logitech gaming software, etc.). They lock you out of their official forum unless you spend money on the game. I can understand that if their community is extremely toxic, but you can't even view the forums as a newcomer who will not spend money on a game that you have not played.There's a few other problems, but overall, my first time experience was pretty disappointing.

High-ping server channels and minor bugs are also annoying.I would like to rate this game 7/10, regardless of small troubles above, this game is really fun, casual and even more great when you play with friends, especially in PvP Survival mode.

												Elsword is an MMO that, obviously, has pay to win factors in it, but aren't needed. They are very helpful though. I have spent money but that's for  a e s t h e t i c s. I found it to be very fun and there are regular updates with events going on. It's time-consuming like every other MMO mostly because of level grind. Especially from level 90-99.For a 2.5D scroller, it's actually pretty fun. Smooth animations/frame if you have a good internet. Very flashy and lots of visuals. Personally, I think it's become very easy for new players to level up lately. Events have given then level boosts, equipment boosts, etc. Later on you'll need to party with others practically all the time. Stages like Secret Dungeons and Heroic Dungeons are difficult.Be careful about breaking equipment from upgrades. Armour and weapons can be upgraded to +6 but has a chance of breaking onwards to +12.Learned that the hard way (Rip +10 drones)Take note I don't PvP, therefore this review is mainly PvE.Hours should be 600+ q~qEve Best Girl			"

												Elsword is funky. Let me state this off the bat, I have 0.1 hours in the steam version of this game. This is because I have to go and use the other exe in Elswords folder because the steam one dosent work for me. Thats apart of my first topic. This game is buggy as hell for me and a lot of others. From downloads freezing to ""no response from server"" while all my other friends are playing, just hope you dont get these bugs. Secondly, this game can get boring. Unless you usually like replaying games, it can get repetitive and boring. Especially if you are not a pvper. PVP is a huge part of late game to the point of where PVE players are thrown under the bus. I recommend this game but know what you are getting yourself into.			"

Balance:    This game is highly unbalanced.  Just recently the NA servers went into the ""renewals"" which essentialy took away many of the fun skills as well as buffing certain classes to insane ends *cough* every rena class *cough*.  Every character has its own playstyle, and each class can vary that playstyle vastly.  However, it goes without saying that some characters will always be better than others, no matter how skillful you are.  However, this game is fun even if you do not main one of the better classes.  PvP is still winnable and PvE is nowhere near impossible.Fun or Boring:   This game is an MMO, so expect grinding.  However, expect much less grinding than any other MMO.  Leveling is easy, especially considering the exp boosts that KoG is always giving along with free level boosts.  HOWEVER, do not level boost your first character.  Leveling up your first character for the first time can be one of the most fun things about this game.  I am a PvE player and have yet to get bored after my countless hours.  I have logged in 832.5 hours on steam as I write this review, but have been playing since May of 2013.  Counting the hours I have before this game was on steam, I have quite a bit.  The game is still being updated constantly.  Events are nonstop, and new areas and level cap increases have been chaning a lot recently.  The best part is, you can check the KR server for things to come in NA.Community:   This is really a tough one.  Given it is an anime game, except creeps as well as normal gamers.  There are plenty of young kids who assume that playing a girl character means you are a girl irl... and will hit on you.  Toy with them :)  .  Besides them, there are random roleplayers and such, but finding the right guild isn't hard.  Many of the more active players will be in guilds that may not accept low levels, so finding good friends can be hard at first.Way the Game Plays:   Image super mario smash brothers, except with spells, mana, and an amazing PvE system.  Also, this game is much more respsonsive to controls given it is a PC game.  Lag can be an annoying issue, as a party cannot kick a lagger.  The only kicking system atm is one that allows all party members to vote to kick a player who hasnt dealt enough damage.  Even buffers do enough damage, so if the button is lit, I suggest clicking it.F2P:   This is a F2P game which means MANY MANY microtransactions.  If you want to complain that this game has too many or that its game breaking, please cry elsewhere.  Costumes are the only essential thing in this game that you can buy from the item mall.  However, you can get yourself 4 costume pieces for 250mil ED if you dont mind your costume not matching.  250mil sounds like a ton at first, but given you earn over 1mil ED per level 70 run, and there are now lvl 80 dungeons, you can earn that ED fairly easily.  Whats that? 250 runs just for costume pieces sounds like a grind?  Fear not.  As you level up, just make sure to hold onto your ED and you will have plenty.  I am not even including items such as secret dungeon materials.  You can obtain somewhere between 3-25 of these per run depending if you do lutos mode or not.  Currently these prices went up to roughly 300k-400k per piece, so you can sell those easily.  Not to mention, almost every event has free accessories or costumes that you can earn by simply playing enough (usually involves logging in for 10 minutes each day).  PvP is limited by your gear, but PvE is not at all.  I know someone who is ranked top 50 with a +9 weapon, which is now extremely easy to get if you understand the concepts of making money in this game.			"

												To start off, you have to almost buy everything in the game including skill slots, and you only get 4 before paying. you also have to buy backpack expansions, which i can see reasonable, but the problem is they give you crap before buying expansions.Buying things with in game money are basically pointless except for  a variety of accessories, because by the time you get up to the level where you can use the weapon you can buy, you don't even need to buy it anymore.There are 2 upsides to this game though, the combat, and the characters. The combat is a hack and slash button mashing of z & x. Although, over a long period of time, the combat starts getting boring, knowing the only time you get more combat moves is when you get your class change, I am going to rate the combat a 6/10.    Each character has  their own story, weapons, and combat style, but some of the different characters have the same class change stats, which imo, is kinda lame, but like i said, they all have their own combat style.The maps in the game start to get redundant and lack imagination, because some of their maps are the same, but flipped, or with a different climate and time.I think the thing I hate most about this game is the stamina, you have stamina on every character, and when its empty, you can't do any dungeon quests and you have to wait until 3:00am to play again, which makes you think that the creators don't want you to play the game. My rating for this game is a 6/10. I do reccomend to people who are new to PC gaming. Its still fun at time and i would continue playing it because they are always adding new items and characters that get enjoyable.  "

												As much as I want to recommend this game, as much as I did enjoy playing it before I hit the grinding threshold for purely F2P players aroud lvl 40, hell, as much as I enjoyed the PvP in the brief moments it felt functional, I cannot recommend this game because of the sheer amount of problems it hasIts F2P model is garbage, the PvP balancing, if you can even call it that, is some of the worst violations of common sense I've ever seen (Who would put high damage homing projectiles in a game without a block mechanic? KOG!), and the collision detection is wonky as all hell. (Just look at TyroneSama's ""HITBOXES"" series on Youtube) Also, lag manifests in interesting ways in PvP, ranging from warping all over the arena to walking out of combos to just being frozen in place to NOT EVEN FLINCHING. Overall, solid game ruined by P2W and poor balancing.			"

												I actually played this game a while ago, and I have to say, it looks really cool. It's not mind blowing, but for a vividly colored anime world, it's really nice. And the gameplay is innovative too. Sure, you can just mash te keyboard and swing wildly, but if you want to really survive, especailly if you're going solo rather than in a party of online players, then you WILL master all the key combinations in order to dish out powerful combo moves.However, as you get higher and level, the pressure to spend real money gets higher and higher, or maybe it's because I didn't have people to play with.However, the game is still fun, killing monsters is satisfying, and the boss battles are so incredibly awesome and epic, you'd think Nintendo thought them up! So if you have lots of friends, and don't mind spending real money (mayeb 30 dollars), then this is the game for you.			"

												Tldr: Elsword is pretty good. 8/10Ive been playing elsword since 2012, elsword has come along way and has developed into something that more people can enjoy. When i first joined i had no idea how to do anything ( i didnt even know how job's worked). After all these years there is just something that pulls me back every month that makes me finish new character job changes.If you dont like rpg's than there is a change you probably wont like elsword. Elsword isnt as pay to play as people make it seem, but there are some things that do need you to pay for if you want to go ""pro"", whatever that means.All in all elsword is a really good game and you should give it a try.

												I've been playing Elsword for a long time, even before it released in North America, since 2010. I even played the Chinese knock off Fists of Fu, or East Fantasy Online. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I had well over 20,000 hours. From 2010 to early 2014 this game was my life. And thankfully I kicked this bad habit of a game and haven't played it since 2014. Yet somehow this game is still on my mind, it's just a scar on my life I can't seem to forget. Avoid this game like the plague if you're weak willed like I was, it will suck you in and turn you into a salty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with an empty wallet. Pros-In it's prime it had some of the best PvP I've ever ever seen. I've still yet to find a game with a comparable combination of ultra quick cancels and combos. Cons-One of the most vile communities I've ever seen. Especially horrible if you're not a fan of Weeaboos.""Events"" consist of either PvP with a GM which isn't nearly as fun as it may sound, or an opportunity to drop $100 on costumes. Terrible netcode, in a game that requires such precise movements this is unnaceptable. It's also peer to peer, and they've merged servers before, so expect ping in the 100s quite frequently. Recently Reduced FPS cap, speed is tied to framerate in this game. With the 60FPS cap movement isn't nearly as quick as it was before, some combos can't even be pulled off anymore. It almost seems as if KOG is progressivly modifiying the game to make combat worse,As pay to win as you can possibly get. Not only will paying players have double your stats, but they'll have a total of eight skills to use, while a non-paying player is stuck with four. Completely Unbalenced,Old classes are completely outdated, (Wind Sneaker being the exception, her concept alone has been broken since she was released years ago) they recently released a character that literally replaces Elsword himself. Leveling up consists of doing the same dungeon 3 times or more. A casual player will probably take an entire year or more to reach the level cap because of this. The PvE is so painfully repetitive that you'll most likely be happy with any alternative you can find. chatting or roleplaying with weeaboos in the vile section of the game called ""sparring"" is usually what most end up doing.In my opinion the only reason this game is still alive is because a small group of unlucky people who enjoy collecting Ice Burner Sets. Ice Burner sets contribute to the pay to win aspect of this game, you spend $1 on an Ice Burner, this Ice Burner has like an incredibly low chance to give you a single piece of a costume set that changes on monthly basis. These costumes don't replace your armor, so the incredibly high stats on them after socketing give quite an obnoxious advantage over those who don't have them. These collectors often buy in bulk, usually $300 at a time, I've been playing long enough to not only see others do this, but actually do it myself. Less fortunate people look at collectors like gods. Hoping that their $5 charge will get them something (It wont). If you have a low spec PC, steam has so many better options than this terrible game. Do yourself a big favor and forget this one exists. The PVP videos on YouTube might seem really attractive, but it's really not worth trying.			"

												Ok, I'm going to say it. Elsword USED to be Pay2Win. Back during the 2014-2015 Elsword days, you'd had to sacrifice some of that cash in order to buy the extended skill slot and a ring of fury. Now, those items are buyable from the board. The economy thankfully deflated sometime ago and Ice Burner sets are easier to obtain compared to how they were back then.Now here's the problem with Elsword.PvP is STILL unbalanced. Winning/Losing a match is usually decided in this order: Gear > Class > Actual Skill. I find this odd since Ereda Island actually normalizes damage, so why is PvP not like this?I still like Elsword, but I'm going to give this game a negative review since there's no mixed reccomendation on Steam. The community is also something to take in account, which I have mixed feelings about. The community had changed so much from when I started back in 2013 that I can't help but feel saddened over it. If you give this game a shot, take caution. "

												As you all may know, this game is the fine definition of P2W, and the worse type of P2W. The f*cking store in the game has cosmetics that dramatically increase your stats... but to be totally honest, this game is actually really fun, but with major flaws. If the cosmetics in this game had no stats and you can actually get the full skill slots without paying $9, it would be much better. The classes are also really unbalanced and the pvp is broken as a direct impact. If they can fix this and maybe put like a price tag on this game, like maybe $20 for the full experience, it would literally be perfect.*As a side note, most people that I talk to about this game, they say they don't like it because of it's extreme P2W style of F2P, so fix your sh*t KOG*			"

												Nice gameplay, great graphics, but HORRIBLE BALANCING WITH EVERYTHING. Everything is completely Unbalanced, PvE, and PVP.  The newest character Ain is the most OP piece of crap ever added to this game, and the constant unbalancing Nerfs and Buffs KoG shoots out their asses only makes the problem worse.  They have trouble lending an ear to their players to see how they take to new characters and their skills, so they just throw out random nerfs and buffs and say ""Eh, maybe this'll do"" when in-fact it makes things worse (Most of the time at least.)  But! If you can get past the unbalanced gameplay, there is a lot of fun to have in this game.  That is if you can become a player with unreal amounts of ED (ED is in game money), be willing to spend thousands of hours in this game, and be willing to throw a few bucks out to the gods at KoG every now and again in order to fit in.  (Doesn't take much)			"

												I've played since beta, before moving my account through Steam... bottom line, if you don't have $50 to initially spend on this game, don't play it. You need to buy alot of support in order to play. Bare minimum the $10 skill slots. You only get 4 when you need 8, especially with the 10+ skills you use. If you do have the starting funds, it can be a great game. They ran my wallet dry, so, I can't really have fun anymore.. it's hard keeping up with the majority buying thier way to ""win"" and not letting you fight because they hog it all. Oh well.			"

If there were any downsides it would be the money it costs to permanently buy costumes and costume pieces as well as mounts and pets and the pvp that can put you up against a high level players. Besides that it's really fun and there are cool events that allow you to get these items I mentioned above for free although it usually involves alot of grinding.			"

Posted: August 29, 2014
												I played this game since the release of grand archer and wind sneeker.Where to start, the game can claim it's different than most game that are around today, which is true, not many do the gameplay that elsword does. Now where this game falls apart on you........some may tell you that leveling up is easy in this game, that's not true, it's only easy if you are below level 30 or so, after that you will have to repeat the same dungeons over and over and over and over and over until you run out of stamina, and which you find yourself having to not even level up ONCE and then you will have to repeat the process again the next day.EXP boosting does exist, but there is a catch, you either grind for a few days to get certain items to get exp boosting items, which will take a while, or you can just buy it with real money, which for the people with no means of getting real money or using them for an online game, that is really unfair. Why you would need to boost exp to level up only once and which still takes a long time to do is beyond me.You won't fully enjoy the game unless you're within the level range of 50-70, which again, why would I need to be that high of a level to enjoy a game to its fullest. I'm not just talking about certain things being blocked off to you if you do not reach level requirement by the way.Even so though, I'm not sure your attention span will even want to go that high of a level if you're not into grind fest, which this game is a HUGE grind fest. Example, early in the game, it will only take you around 2-4 hours to get from level 1 to level 15 easily, at first you're like, ""This isn't too hard if the game is like this all the time."" which you would be right......if the game worked like that in the first place...but when comes the time of around let's say....level 36, it will take you a day to jump to level 37.Now, let's talk about classes, the system is a complete mess, I won't lie to you. After you fight a couple of matches with people in your skill range ( as in how well they fight etc etc) you wll notice that some characters are WAY better in pvp than others. What do I mean by that, well....if you took an average skilled elsword and throw them against an average skilled add, more than likely without fail, the add is going to win. Why? well because all skills activate instantaneously, elsword is melee based even if he took the magic path, his range does not exceed that of an add's, the add player will only have to keep his distance and hit the elsword at least once to get even closer to him and then throw in some long comboes which will probably do a significant amount of damage, rinse and repeat. The same can be said about the mage, all she would have to do to beat a swsordsman, is run away with her teleport skill which has a low cooldown of about like 5-10 seconds, cast a spell (which is also instantaneous) run away, stand still to recover MP at which they recover MP way faster than any swordsman will recover, rinse and repeat.This doesn't only apply to PvP, those same characters that are generally better in pvp, are sometimes generally better in dungeons. WHY?! This baffles me on why this game only focuses on making the strong characters stronger, and the weaker ones even weaker, I just don't get it.Instead of making the main character, Elsword, which this game is named after him, stand a chance against these over-powered characters, they make an entirely different character, his older sister, the swordsman that can stand a chance against them. Any new character this game will add, you'd win any bet that that the new character will be even more over-powered than the last character. This game's balance of equal powers, doesn't exist, it's been throw out and left somewhere in the middle of nowhere.What's even worse for any elsword player is not what lies with the character himself, it's the community. Elsword has a skill which can make him unflinchable for only a few seconds so he can get past all these spells or long range attacks that are being thrown at him so he can stand a chance against them. Sounds cool right? Well, too bad, according to the community that skill makes you a noob and you will not be liked by anyone if you use it, and therefore discouraged to use it to give any elsword player an advantage over the newer characters and classes.I only list the character, elsword's, problems because he has it the worst, the second swordsman, Raven, may also have problems with these new classes and characters but not as bad as any elsword player.--------------------------This isn't the end of this game's problems, there is more..........-------------------------------------The community of people here isn't very pleasant.......You either have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who usually are the competitive type who aren't nice to you if you use a tactic that they don't like, or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because of no reason, people who are generally good people, or people who goes both ways. Some people you find you may say they are ok people, being ok people does not mean they are generally good people, just for the record. I will not hate on the beggars which I will talk about why later.Lag isn't something to write about because any MMO that has the same feel of fast pace fighting will face this problem. The lag will depend on how powerful your computer is and also your internet connection, so at that point it's not the game's fault so don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me.Another major point to bring out is that this game is WAY, WAY too benefitting on the Pay-To-Win area. You don't gain a small advantage if you buy a costume and enhance it, you will gain a HUGE advantage. Well what do I mean by that? Well....if you fight a person, and you both do not have a costume before, you both are in the same skill area, same characters and exact same class, and you fight and it's a close match and you win. Well, the same person comes back the next day, has a costume and has enhanced it with speed or power and challenges you again, more than likely, you're going to lose more almost all of the matches against that person, and more than likely it will not even be a close match, because of your lack of a costume.The only only way to obtain a costume is if you pay real money to get one, or by people selling costumes, which is ANOTHER major issue to this game.....You see, the reason why I don't mind beggars is because I know there is a good reason for it....the economy is a complete and utter trainwreck, there is just no going around it. Hyper inflation has hit this game real hard and continues to do so. Want one of the current costumes that is only obtain through ice burners and generally looks cool? well you're going to have to pay 600 million ED (in game currency) for a single piece of that costume......WHY?!?! ED isn't easy to get either for people who don't use real money for this game, you eitehr have to do weeks worth of grinding for around a 200 mil, and then hear that the item you wanted has inflated to an even higher price, so you're screwed. Simple cosmetic items are far more EXPENSIVE than the actual gear that matters.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The only reason why I would reccomend you to play this game as it is right now, is if:A) You have friends you can play with and you know you're not going to hate eventuallyB) You only live for the grinding in gamesC) Have money to waste onto this gameD) Dont mind the fact some other characters are generally better than the one you are going to pickE) Will never touch the ranking PvP modeF) Have patience with a gameG) Don't get angry at gamesThese are the only reasons why I would recommend this to you.Oh, and it's not, "" Only one of these apply to me, I think I'm going to like this."" no you need to have the qualities of at least 3 of those options to enjoy this.

												At one point, I had fun with this game (as evidenced by my playtime). However, that changed, and at the same time, I also realized that Elsword just wasn't a good game. Now, it's been a long time since then, but I can't imagine the game's gotten any better, and there's a reason for that. For now, the review....The main problem with Elsword, in my opinion, is that the combat is very, very repetitive. Going through dungeons will comprise a large portion of your playtime, and those dungeons require minimal skill, as you can simply mash Z and kill everything. No skill, forethought or strategy required. Unfortunately, this also applies to many of the game's bosses-- the only difference is that you might have to jump over an attack or two.The second problem is the shameless cash grabs. When I was playing, I would occasionally get some sort of container with excellent items inside that could only be opened with a specific key-type item. Where would one find those items, you ask? Why, the cash shop, of course.Look, it's standard P2W crap. I don't think I really need to go into detail here.The third issue I took with Elsword, and the reason I don't think it'll ever improve, is that the game had a bad case of power creep. Every so often, a new character would be released, and those new characters were invariably better than all of the other ones. This was a complete disaster for the game's balance, as these new characters would dominate the PVP, and everybody else (Myself included; I played Rena, one of the game's oldest characters) suddenly had a very difficult time competing.To wrap things up, the PVE isn't interesting, and the PVP isn't balanced. Neither is particularly fun after a certain point. So, what's left? Please think about that before you play the game.			"

												I've played this game for 5 years on other servers (basically I play two servers which are KR and private server) so let me just get into it. First of all, Steam version are originally block download restrition back in a day but now you can download it. Note that I live in Asia region country which it was blocked but it restritcion removed recently even the standalone version removed them 2 years ago. Genius. Secondly, if you happen to have an International account (ID, PH and IN) you can't link them. Okay, wtf? You guys allow players from these INT server to use NA sites for download, register and play INT server onto the same client. Are you telling me that I need to have NA account in order to play on this version?Lastly, this game can be so addictive but at some point, when you reach into higher level, things getting hard right? Well, it's normal in any other games but this game is pay2win game. Everything needs to be pay. This is the only game that ask you to pay for the additional skill slots. Additional skill slots needs to be pay? Yes. This game also offer you with some overpowered accessorries on their item mall. This game are extremely bad with their RNG (random number generator) stuff. Expecting that you can increase your equipment to the desire level you want w/out taking out your money? Hell no, like I said, the RNG in this game is bad you will need to pay for the stones for protecting enchantment decreasing. Your equipment destroyed, what should I do? I know! Pay for the scroll that can restore your broken equipment from previous enchantment. Balanced game? What's that? Never heard of it.There's still more I can say but I let you guys newcomer explore this game more deeper. If you don't want to waste your money, please back off from this game. If you want to see other players suffer with your throwing money skills, go ahead. I would not recommend this game if you seek for fun. There is no such thing as fun in this game except if you play with your friends and/or guildmates.			"

												Elsword is a fast paced fun mmorpg who's main problem is would most likely be class balancing (some classes will make u laugh and feel good about yourself others will make u cry and scream). Overall community is great i often talk with random people in town and dungeons but at the same time pvp is the exact opposite which is why in pvp i ignore chat and focus on winning. Fairly easy to gain levels and progress up to level 50 after that it depends if your willingness to sell your soul to the game. Another problem is as for gear that game is very limited unless your a very capable fighter"", or u have loads of money to buy item mall gear, or you're online all the time the for the occasional event. in my opinion the game is 7.5/10			"

												Is Not like use to. you are better  off playing something else.Is the game fun?: Yes only to a certain limit. Is the PVP Good?: HELL YEA! for low levels in 20-40.. After you pass level 50 - 80 it turns into a 100% pay to win  game.Is it balance?: No... After S1 and S2 half way, The newst characters are broken and the Revamp is making it worst.Is the game Actualy free to play?: Yes actualy! Pve is fair but Sadly if you wanna get into pvp and do good ( you really don't need skill any more to play pvp..) than no! $$$ all the way.How is the cash shop?: Customes are over prices and can only be retrade once.. Unless is a IB custome witch cost over 120-500$ dollars.I have made over 12 Characters on Elsword and spent over 600$ on this game, sadly in steam only show 150+ hours but im pretty sure i have way more than that. From experice on reaching SSS on my GM BM BH and DC i can tell you the that worst thing about this game is the PVP community and economy.  Wanna play this game for the PVE? GO ahead is actualy pretty fun PVE! Get a hook on some friends start a skype and PVE all night! Just don't touch PVP. Play this game?  25% yes 75% No  "

												Where do I start... This game was great. I say ""was"" considering I haven't played for months, perhaps a year. The last time I played Elsword was during the final 3rd class release events and the time I decided that the community and structure of the game was at it's most unstable. Apparently I was wrong. I liked the game, I really did, but honestly, I feel the updates come way too fast to earn any event prizes. I admire their attempts at bringing old players back to the game, but the rewards don't feel like a ""welcome back"" gift and more of a""Come back and we'll give you things"". In the old days, Elsword had a skill system where players could choose to equip any skill out of an entire tree, that includes the hyperactive. Since then they changed it approximately thrice now; in one version, the original tree was revamped so instead of dedication sp to the skill to level it up in bundles, you had to level them up one-by-one as well as there being a passive-skill tree seperated from the rest, second and third versions being the ones available today. Something that hasn't change was the pay-to-look-pretty-and-still-somehow-be-better-than-everybody-else system. Ah memories, when people who took pride in their wallet dumped it into the game to get absurd amounts of magic stones to attribute their equipment with top of the line perks. The PVP is always the same though, you end up fighting another player within your rank or level range and get completely overwhelmed because of their dexterity. To those who want to play this, don't play a PVP mode. The ranking and matchmaking system is as skewed as WarThunders'. PVE is as equally skewed, but with the players being on the same side. Since I began playing this game, I admire KoG for implimenting the individual item drop thing, but alot of the game is repetetive. Scroll right, scroll left, kill everything, move on. I used to feel alot of competetition playing in PVE like I felt in PVP because everybdyo went straight for the mobs and ythen moved on. Yada Yada Yada.tl;dr: I used to like this game when I started out, but as the game developed, it lost that special something that hooked me in the first place. PVP sucks, PVE sucks because everybody kills something before you do, it's repetitive, Everything in the Premim+Casual market is overpriced, the updates keep changing the game that it's hard to keep up. I don't recommend it for people thinking they want to return to the game, but I do recommend it for first time players, just don't PVP.			"

												This is a good beat-em-up to pick up if you're in the mood for one.  The relatively fast paced action is enough to be entertaining for some time.  That being said, be sure to bring a friend or two because playing this by yourself is not quite what this game is meant for.			"

												Well Elsword is a pretty fun game when you don't need to fork over ♥♥♥♥ing cash to purchase something that you need and as I have read some other reviews i agree the PVP is completely horse♥♥♥♥♥♥and it is pathetic to try to fight someone who stunlocks you into a corner and kills you in a single combo burst then brags about being good about the game even though you got into a combo when you weren't able to do a single thing to try to break the combo or escape. Then the next topic is the PVP items, that you have to spend real cash for so you have a chance to stand against someone who wastes money to just fight in the Arena when the system of hit detection and internet that are so bad when you are fighting someone on McDonalds internet as I say it is like Minecraft PVP internet problems. But for anything I would say this game is far worse than any other Pay2Win games besides Grand Chase. But It is a pretty fun besides doing the same levels over and over again and the broken PVP netcode but I wouldn't recommend playing it even though i still am since I have nothing else to do. But I hope my Review helped you decide on playing this game and thank you for reading this and goodbye.			"

												Ok so here is the game from a newbs run through Starting out this game looks great controls are good everything looks good to go.Then later on you start doing dungies with other people and its just a bunch of people smushed together spaming abilitys and wacking a boss.... you can't even see your person there is no challenge there is no block or dodge in this game you can jump but I dont see the point since you can just spam the boss and knock it down or stun it over and over...The quests are brain killing repetative boringness of killing stuff, or doing the same dungies 3 times in a row to get 3 of the same quest items off the last boss inside.Also the quests outside the dungie are the litterally the same quest over and over untill you reach 12 and try to move on to the higher lvl zone and you dont have any quests there. So all you have to choose from is doing the same lower lvl quest you have been doing over an over or go into another dungie for the 4th or 5th time spamming♥♥♥♥♥♥in a mess of non sense. The game looks great but the gameplay, quest system, and fake♥♥♥♥♥combo system are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥!2/10			"

												Coming from Grand Chase i'm verydissapointed. The stamina meter is stupid, and with every update the game becomes more and more P2W because KOG secretly removes features in their updates, like the skill note update where they took away the ability to get them via drop. Grand Chase was actually pro consumer.			"

												I've played 25 hours at the time of writing this review. My character just reached level 60.First of all, don't let the people saying this game is P2W stop you from trying it. Yes, it is SLIGHTLY p2w but only at the top tiers of PVP. Far as a casual PVE game goes, Elsword is just wonderful. The main thing people complain about is the costumes, but from what I can tell so far the buffs they give are not that significant. I've had no trouble finding good sets of equipment to dress up my character with. I even choose not to wear the promotional costumes because I think my character looks cooler with just equipment on. Since I'm only level 60 so far I haven't really delved into PVP. But I have been looking into how you can upgrade your equipment, what you can grind for, etc. I really like what I've seen, there is a nice variety of equipment, if you just do quests you'll never feel like you need to grind or like you need better gear. A lot of the time I find an awesome set of equipment, only to find another set with better stats a few minutes later that I am reluctant to equip because it doesn't look as cool. The best part is, the advanced sets of equipment have set bonuses. The game is very generous as far as f2p games go. There is a stamina system, so you can't run dungeons when your stamina runs out, but this resets every day, and if you get a group of players you will barely use any stamina in dungeons. You can easily get free stamina potions though through quests or exchanging hero coins for them. You can also grind a bit to get costumes for free. Quests give you boxes with whole sets of advanced equipment, with sweet set bonuses. You can craft healing items, and quests give plenty of them to you for free. You also get 10 resurrection stones per day, which are basically extra lives in case you die. You can buy more, but I've never used all 10 in a day, even when playing the hardest dungeons for my level, on the hardest difficulty, while undergeared, solo.The community seems to be very friendly, I was invited to a guild that offers me free stuff (which I don't take because I'm independent) and I always feel welcome in dungeon runs, even when I'm with veteran players who are a lot better than me. Higher level players have no problem steamrolling dungeons and bosses for you, in fact most of them just enjoy showing off their characters. The only negative thing I can say about the community is that I saw a bot one time advertising in a village. The story isn't that compelling in my opinion. I just skip through all the cut scenes at this point, I play this game for the game play. If you're the type of person who enjoys side scrolling action/combat, and customizing your character, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's free, fun, and simply gorgeous.  "

												(Note this is a long rant about this game so I wrote a little summery about the game at the bottom of this review to save your time. If you like to see the quick summery of it just scroll to the bottom (I won’t blame you….this is long….no pun intended) if you want details on what I find bad about the game than continue ahead)________________________________________________________________________________Although steam says I have w.e many hours I have I’ve played this game way before it even got to steam and when the newest character was the 4th one (Raven) and all I can say is this game is terrible (in comparison to its older version). And it’s mainly due to stupid design choices starting withPvEMainly untouched by the f***ery that is until you get to the higher levels and the divines hand comes down with a smite of a difficulty spike with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies hitting with the forces of semi-trucks loaded with nukes and simply requires you to have a bunch of potions and people just to fight through one redundant dungeon to the next (btw the story is go here do it 3 times sometimes more to get a drop or some♥♥♥♥♥♥than move on to the next)PvP (The bulk of my argument cause PvE is just so boring to even talk about)Oh where do I begin....this blight on everything divine and holy is the main reason why I have issues with this game. And it starts with the claim that it’s a “Technical skill pvp"" but that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and here’s why. let’s say you’re  lvl 21 just starting to get into the ring trying to get your bearings,First match:  you'll match up with someone around your level a nice balance gameSecond match:  another match that’s balance what’s wrong with this again?Third match: ♥♥♥♥ING LVL 80 now you'd think oh no big deal surely the game auto scales us to a similar level or something to keep everything equal? Well...Your ♥♥♥♥ing wrong that bastarad lvl 80 will be dealing 80 lvl damage while you’re doing your 21 level damage so you could be great at the game and be able to out play everything your opponent does but you better have the grace of a swan and the unpredictable movements of a f***ing alpaca cause the instant that lvl 80 gets you he will steam roll your♥♥♥♥♥in a single combo...sort of like a mouse fighting a person with a nuke launcher, sure the mouse can wiggle his way around get some bites in but the second that guy pulls that trigger you better have your last will and testament cause you won’t have enough time to type the “f*** you lvl noob!!!” in your spurt of rage. Now here’s another issue in pvp and that’s the damn lag, the pvp lag is so bad you can even tell when you’re going to have to deal with it simply wait in the pvp loading screen and if someone marinates on 30% for too long guess what you have a lagger to deal with. And the reason why this is so bad is that it breaks the fundamentals of the game which is to cause a person to flinch so you can lay down your punishment, but laggers will slip out of these combos and be able to attack you causing you to flinch and letting them to combo you instead, And after a little testing the lag isnt caused by your internet but it’s the game its self that causes it (note this applies to some). For example if I pvp with my friend whos a block or so down from me no problem if I hit him he flinches everything is alright but lord help me (Or by freyja boobs *just look them up on the wiki…seriously*) if I pvp with someone who’s not even in my f**king city cause from that point lag starts to set in and it’s not your fault the game doesn’t have any dedicated servers to individual zones so your fighting people worldwide which leads to delayed reactions messing up your combos or a person would use a move a good while ago (which didn’t execute cause you hit him) but will pop out of nowhere damaging you and allowing the f**kward to roam free like a b*tch I mean bird. Oh and while we’re on the topic about breaking the fundamentals of the game, SOME OF THESE CHARACTERS ARE DESIGNED TO BREAK THEM. There are characters who have moves that put them in a super armor state which prevents flinching or it’s there damn passive (I’m looking at the damn elboy family) in conclusion screw pvp in this game period.  it’s not fun to much of the time and even without the lag the laziness to not have the game scale me and my enemy  to a f**king common level will ruin games that you could have won had the game stop being a lazy azz.Pay to win?F**kYes""Oh only thing you can do is buy costumes that’s not pay to win"" --the elsword loyalist to everyone""F**k off you cheeky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" – me to those loyalist who say the previous statement and here’s whyCostumes in the game will give your characters stats like extra health, attack speed stuff like that. The problem about that is they not only give you these stats which will offset the balance of pvp if the other person doesn’t have one of those costumes but these costumes can be thrown into anvil of f**kery  and upgraded even more. This completely causes the costumes to have more bs stat potential than anything you can get in game (watch someone try to defend that by saying how to brought it and they deserve the stat boost and blah blah blah “""F**k off you cheeky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" ) putting this into perspective the average person would have about 5 pieces of equipment (not including accessories) now these pay to win masters would have about 11 a costume for each of the 5 pieces and hair now that’s without the damn enhancement stones which adds even more disgusting boost to the costume making your more powerful than the average player (and let’s not forget about the set boost you get adding even moreeeeeeee stats). and before you ask no there is no way to have a permeant costume in game you do get a costume but don’t get attach to it cause it will expire in about 10 days unless you buy the ♥♥♥♥ing thing note I didn’t put accessories into the count so that’s even more to deal with._____________________Summery and Conclusion_________________________________________This game is just a mess from the PvE in late game to the PvP from the beginning, PvE is the definition of insanity doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again for something different, PvP is worked against by the core of the game in total and by the way its design. And to top it off the game is boring (mainly due to the broken PvP and redundant PvE), the only reason I really play it is because of the characters which I personally like as there really interesting due to their different job changes (think of Pokémon but when it evolves you choose from 3 different evolutions or 4 for one of the characters) there different play styles always were fun and the combo system in the game is actually really fun to play around with although it does have a learning curve but after you learn it you can do some real fun combos. But I don’t think the reason why we play games is just for one thing and I honestly will not be dropping a dime for this game in anyway shape or form cause it hasn’t earned it and instead of buying things to customize my character ( ironic how the steam page says how you can customize them as much as you want which is a bull face lie cause you need real world money and will buy a set of clothes cause of the set boost it gives) and note I have several characters to waste several bundles of dollars of several different characters is disgusting and more of a cash ♥♥♥♥♥ than evolve was at launch. If you play this game play it for the characters and to see their abilities if you find something worthwhile in it enjoy it although I don’t think it will last you a very long time . "

												Elsword is a Korean MMO beat 'em up in 2&1/2D. Here the player controls one out of nine (as of now) characters to level them up and defeat hordes of monsters while progressing through the story.Unfortunately, I already ran into problems at the level of trying to register an account. Apparently their confirmation emails can only reach certain domains, like GMail. Before I figured it out, however, I already linked my Steam account to the one that I couldn't activate and had to wait a few days for it to expire before being able to re-link it to a working one. During that time my enthusiasm for this game died out completely and it basically set the tone for my playthrough of this. If the creators fail on the level of account creation... That's just not a good sign.Once we enter the game, the first thing that comes to us is the fact that the English localization team decided to leave the Korean voice acting intact, which is quite unusual for most English versions of Asian games. I personally don't mind them, it's just that it was kinda hard to understand what they were actually saying, me being used more to Japanese.Speaking of that, I usually like to mod my games to some extent, so I managed to find (by complete accident) a mod which replaces the voice packs with those from different languages, so for example I could try getting Japanese ones into the game, which would keep it somewhat climactic yet I would be able to make out some words out of it... eeexcept the NA version (which is apparently the Steam one) changed the voiceover format from .wav to .ogg. For no reason.Another thing that stroke me as kind of odd is the fact that you need to name your characters. I mean, it would be okay if they were just classes to be chosen from and you could customize their appearance to some extent, but they are all named characters with unique backstories. Why do you have to call yourself something like ""Eve Clone no. 99""? Why can't you just give your account as a whole a single nickname to use for all of your characters?I stretched out this rant long enough, so let's get to the main part of the review.The anime-style cell-shaded graphics look okay. They aren't anything spectacular, and can kind of make your eyes tired, especially the low-res textures. While it did take over three years for the game to leave Asia, it still came out later than for example Team Fortress 2.In the sound department, it's honestly mediocre. None of the music felt memorable to me, and you will get tired of your characters saying the same thing over and over again during their combos or victory poses.When it comes to gameplay, it's pretty much just your standard 2&1/2D beat 'em up but with RPG elements. You level up your character, your skills, obtain better gear, power it up... At level 15 you can advance into one of the three possible paths for your character, each possessing different skills and abilities, and at level 35 you can achieve the final form of your chosen path. And here's where the bad things begin to pop up: even the normal mooks are often tanky damage sponges with heavily-telegraphed attacks, turning at least the early game into a button mashing contest of you just wearing down their HP using the same combos over again. Your chances of dying at anything that isn't at least a mini-boss are basically nonexistant provided you do dodge their blows. You can use special skills which are usually very powerful hits or autocombos akin to supers from fighting games, burning MP in the process which can be gained back by hitting enemies and slowly replenishes itself over time. Also, you get only three item quickslots and four skill quickslots. You can double those amounts... by paying real money. Imagine if in an MMORPG, you had a very limited quickbar for skills and items and had to pay for another quickbar.Oh, and guess what: after reaching certain levels, you get two new skills... to choose from. Yes, you can get only one of those two. Considering you are already limited to taking a maximum of eight skills with you to any given battle, four if you didn't pay up, this kind of thing heavily limits the level of versatility your character can achieve. Of course, you can get the other skills via a different skill tree... by paying real money for it. The worst part is, it wasn't like this for six years. Only later did the creators realize that they can grab money off of that new possible restriction.Also, the costume pieces you get in this game only last so long. After that, you are switched back to regular, unimpressive, plain clothes. I dislike limited-time stuff like this in games in general, since they're just one huge bait. You get used to them, and then they are taken away, like that. If you want me to earn my cool looks later on, then don't showcase them early on, so I will actually be able to see how my character progresses from plain clothing to divine-level armor or something.The quests are also disappointing. They have the standard story dialogues, with the only difference being that your character isn't a soulless mime who just listens to what others have to say. Most of the quests are your basic ""kill X enemies"", ""collect X items"" or ""beat X dungeon"". Heck, some quests even outright tell you to beat the same dungeon multiple times. Let the obvious grind begin!What also bothers me is the fact that higher difficulties, for the most part, count as Numerical Hard, i.e. enemies' stats are inflated to higher levels but they fight the same way and it only takes longer to beat them down. Besides that, higher difficulties sometimes add an additional miniboss for you to fight, and that's about it.Another thing is that, despite it being technically a beat 'em up, it still has accuracy and evasion stats. Why does the RNG get to decide whether or not you hit the monster when your weapon visibly makes physical contact with it?Since this is a beat 'em up, I wanted to play it on a gamepad, but this game's support for it is honestly pretty mediocre. You still need your mouse to get through menus, and the number of skill and item quickslots (without buying the additional ones!) already exceeds the number of buttons a PS controller (which I'm using) posseses. So you'll have to reach your hand out to the keyboard often.I can't say much about PvP since I'm not interested in it, but I can already tell that it's not fun. The game allows you to take your gear and its stat boosts into PvP matches, and while it does get ""normalized"" to not allow min-maxers to build something ridiculously broken and impossible to counter, it doesn't apply to everything. While skill obviously allows you to overcome challenges, the gear is still an important part of it. You'd think that it being a beat 'em up will have some kind of way of purely skill-based play, at least as an option, but no.Okay, so until now it was only the negatives. What are the positives? Well... the wide variety of characters and their possible classes allow for a lot of experimentation. The bosses are still pretty fun to fight against. There is also a Stamina system which is supposed to lock your character out of dungeons for the duration of the day if their Stamina gets completely depleted, but it shouldn't happen unless you've been playing for a few hours straight. The character arts also look absolutely amazing. (Too bad they aren't nearly as detailed in the game itself.)My final verdict? The cons far outweigh the pros. There are restrictions on things that shouldn't even be restricted and certain solutions to things that are just plain stupid. I can't recommend it unless you play it more as a side thing for fun, not taking it too seriously and ignoring all of the limitations induced upon you.			"

												This game is not for people that want a truly Free to play Experience.The leveling can be fun , But eventually you'll get to the point where you need to spam play the same dungeon to level up.The PvP in this game is based around Money. The more you pay , the more damage you will do.The classes are quite imbalanced. And most of the events circle around 'Discounts' in the item mall.I suggest this game only if you have money to spare.

												Don't let my hours fool you and my time on steam. I been playing consoles and other games for a while now and been playing non-steam version of elsword for 3 years.I just gotten me a gaming computer and gotten steam for it. Anway let me begin the review.Pros:*Have at least 3 friends to play this game with and you have a blast.*The back ground and the scenarios of the game  are soo beautiful.(it is anime base after all.)*It's classic, bring back Memories to classic gamers and there isn't that many 2D side scrollers mmo's, so if your a indie gamer kind of person and into mmo's, this game is for you.*The outfits in this game are just amazing, I love them all. You can never get tierd of changing looks and there always new ones to enjoy and like.Cons:*Mindless action- Meaning there no strategies,tacties or thinking needed to beat enemys and foes in elsword, it's all about rushing in and attacking as fast as you can with out letting the enemy or foe move an-inch in this game(like pvp), results of being to easy and finishing the duns and enemy off and not much of a challenge. Elsword doesn't have class roll's meaning any healers,tanks or supporters, everone bascially a offense char and all there class are to, but some class have very little support skill like TT  with shield and MP giving and WS the only class that have a healing skill but no one use it but hey elsword is a to easy game and you don't need it but add-ons like this is what make team work and mmo's interesting.. but oh well.*Not all costumes can be obtain easily, like ice burners, you can only get them through burning Ice burners, the problem is..it give you most useless stuff most of the time like magic stones,Advance magic stones, shards more. Those are the 3 it give more then the useful stuff like ib sets,high level accessory and +6 ammy's or more.So that means you could be spending 100$ and not get anything useful.*The Economy in this game is sooo bad, Everything is expensive, the cash shop and in-game board. A Perm outfit is 33$ and skill slot B is 9$ and a mount is 23$(for a short time after the event) so you could be spending 60$ per char or more sometime just for the small things you want. As for the in-game board..it's impossiable to get anything(For NA Elsword). A lot of people said ""Well, stop complaing about the game being expensive, you can just buy it off board"" but elsword in-game board for costume pieces and ib sets and rare items be over 100 mil ED and you only get 2 mil Ed per run in final region of elsword duns(Sander). So trading and and having good spending friends is your best luck in elsword NA.*The game is nothing but a RGN loot(meaning it rely to much on drop rates,random and mostly luck)there no quest in this game that just give you anything rare or worthy really...*The game is super reapetitive...(example) beat the dun on normal, oh you beat it? Good, do it again hard, now very hard, now very hard 3 times. Once you done with the quest, your only half way there to level up, so you would have to do the duns over 10-25 times(through Feita-Sander regions) it get pretty annoying and boring pretty quickly and  tiersome and it prove this game was to careless and lazy in-making for the questing system.*pvp...is the most complan thing ever in this game, it's pretty much broken and very much un-blance and very much gear-base.But I won't go into detail much sense the community it self will tell you how bad elsword pvp is.*Stamina system..idk what to say except it stupid and pretty tearing the players freedom of playing. Once it hit zero, all you can do is play pvp, stand around and talk with people and play on another char.*Sound track- The sound track in this game is so bad and boring, meh, I only like 3 and pretty much it, most people had to add custom for mods but to others, most don't.*Content- Okay they clam they have new content constantly more then other mmo's which is true, ever 2 weeks they have a new update, but reason I dislike it, cause it mostly just new ib sets, new outfits,mounts and pet to spend a lot of money on and barely anything new.*Customization-They said in the about me.""Customize like crazy""but there isn't any ""real"" costomization at all unless""you paid for it"" and""grind for it"" which ever mmo have or should have so I say it's pretty misleading what they said in there advertising and about the game section.Do I recommend this game? Only if you don't mind it being nothing but a grind-fest(meaning to much farming and nothing but repetitive questing),can afford this game, you don't mind  a mmo's of picking chars you like and not create your own character , you like small and simple game that doesn't offer much contex and got good friends that willing to take time into this game, but over all I don't recommend this game. Personally I quit this game, not even void or korean server interest me much , cause of the game play it self. But sadly I still play this game only for friends reason. But once PSO2 and BNS comes to NA(there still hope for BNS for NA btw) i'm 100% done with elsword.Bonus:Is this game paid to win?It's more a mixture, half paid to win and half not.Pve:NoPvp:Seem like itThose costume and putting duel stones on them(expecially on ib sets) makes you un-stop-able plus the fact with the skill notes to boost your attack skills and able to get repair scrolls and have the extra skill slot for high advantage in pvp and most of all having those 6+ or more ammy's for high advantage for your SD and herir gear that cause pvp to be gear base expcially around S-SSS Rank.(seriously, what mmo charge extra for skill slot?).Everone have there own opiouns what they think of this game, please don't assume i'm complaing about the tiniest things in this game and wish everything to be easily handed to me for all the cons I listed have been a huge issues for years in this game.PS: If I had to reccomend better F2P anime mmo or mmorpg game's that out in Western I would say ""Dragon nest, Aura Kingdom and Mabinogi"" those 3 games tend to have more content and context and true ""RP""  and  fair rate price in Both Western then Elsword does ;3.But I do have other to recommend but  there not out yet but coming soon.That is all and have a nice day.

												Its funny how this game uses arrow keys. The arrow keys on my keyboard are busted but I don't really mind because almost none of the games I play use arrow or have an easy key configuration. You cant configure the keyboard when you first create your character so I actaully turned used on-screen keyboard and starting  play elsword with the on-screen keyboard haha. But it doesn't matter after that because  after I change from arrow keys to  numpad the keybindings would just reset a while. The game was really confusing at first. I had no idea what I was doing. I feel like a dumbs***. I'd give it a 69/100. C+.			"

I'm kinda bored now. Wish you could buy K-Ching over steam? Yeah, we all do. Better enter your credit card into the korean network, because that isn't suspicious.(Secretly funding north korea, not south korea)Did I mentioned how balanced pvp is?Elsword can land a combo and instakill anyone.Aisha can just spam x and you will be unable to move for 3 seconds for every ball that hits youYou can be any level and get paired with a level 87 or 90 or rank SSSDon't play pvp unless your level 90 and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Unbalanced game.

												I played Elsword since sometime after Raven came about. I started playing more when Eve CBS came out. I will say Elsword has gotten better after the revamps because it allowed me the opportunity to get better faster. I still hate how long it takes to do a second class change and leveling up takes time too. It helps to get stamina potions though. I would recommend this game for those who are looking for something different, it hard for me to describe the game to be honest.  EDIT: I had to read some other reviews first to know what to talk about. I would like to let you know I haven't used any money on this game, my k-ching comes from watching videos (like 150 times, yes I counted) and the recent check in event. I get to where I am though hardword, determination and luck.First: The marriage thing, it's something for fun that's it. It can be helpful if you use your mp up fast and loose a lot of hp.Second: Add's weakness is his hp level, if he survives for a long time it's only because of his outfit, get armor piercing buffs and you should be fine. It's the same with Aishas and Renas, characters who can cause a lot of damage, but don't have a lot of hp. Third: PVP, all characters can be used, you just have to know how to use them or have a slow computer that basically allows you to get out of the way in time. Also use skills that you use best, the guides people post are good, but if you don't know how to properly use a skill then don't waste your sp on it, I know, I learned the hard way.Fourth: The Item Shop, it's extra, that's it. I reason with myself that if I can't play a character well then I shoudn't spend money on it because I'll eventually delete it, so only use money if you really want to on a character you're going to keep, otherwise stop complaining about, I find it gets you no where.Other: The game is free to play if and only if you bother to practice, you have to fail to get better, so just keep playing to get better, it may seem hard and it will take some time to perfect your character, but at least you can be proud of yourself for a character you made out of hardword, determination and passion for the game you play. They will always be something you may not like about a game, but don't quit because of those little things, because one day the game may change and you may miss out on something you would have benefited from.

												I've got to say, I played this game around the time if first came out (before Steam) and it doesn't feel as though it's changed much. Since I've picked it up again I've come to realize why I stopped playing. It's fun if you wanna mess around with some free 2d platformer type action to kill some time, but beyond that I do NOT reccomend this as the game for you. The shop is the only way to win and leveling up becomes a tedious grind after you hit around 28-32. The characters/classes are cool and can be fun, but after you get your final ""job"" class at 35 you stagnate and you stick to the same old combos for the rest of the game. It's free though so I suppose you don't have much to lose.			"

												At one point in my life, I was a long distance runner. I ran alongside Forrest Gump, during the 2008 presidential election. We were ahead, until they added ara, add, and SEASON 3 PVP. For Gods sakes, Add can run a mile faster than you can say ♥♥♥♥. Every match you go into results with you winnging or losing, and the other player badmouthing you because their parents aren't home. Recommend if looking for early stress attacks, and broken keyboards. If i ever hear someone complaining that add isn't op, and that he is hard to play, I'm going to buy your sister and mother a pearl necklace. Basically I will track you down, and make you watch ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anime english dubs, with girls who have eyes bigger than the load of BS each pvp season is described. Have a good heart attack.			"

												The game seems to have problems with itself. It have X trap software to prevent cheating... but it also prevent using hotkeys on gaming keyboards (like changing the music volume) I couldn't change volume in windows volume control too. Sometimes It is licking up even UI in the game itself, so I cannot change anything, or in some examples I cannot move my character... why so much security in such simple silly game? Also our accounts are -banned- on elsword forum as far as we are from steam. and I cannot see content of the forums beacuse of that.. The Game also tends to randomly crash and says nothing why or what happened , it just goes off puff.It looks like community in this game is dying, lesss and less people are playing it. Maybe beacuse of the issues that I mentioned. The game may be worth trying it for fun since it is free, however I do not like the  fact that I am not trusted by such a silly game and there is invasive software installed with it that is preventing me from controlling my computer fully. including shortcuts like alt+f4 .. really? wtf game?    Try to play Planet side 2, and see greatest battles in HUGE community with plenty servers and support.. and guess what? no invasive software...  in the end :   + fast gameplay + easy interface + hack & slash - invasive software (x trap)- crashing randomly with no apologies or error message- repetetive quests, very annoying after some time- animations and text appering when our character is speking in some foreign language - is translated into engilsh text but the text is just flashing like 100 words per two seconds, unreadable to any human being..  - boss animations sometimes cause game to crash- the game level does not chagne in dungeons when there is more people, it is just quicker- the drop rate is not explained how it works - very little info in the internet about anytihng about this game in english			"

												The game has an EXCELLENT story, but only if you take the time to read the ""cutscenes"". I love the variety of characters and their job paths which all are fun to play and have great backstories.I would love to give it a Positive Review, but sadly the Cons outweigh the Pros.Pros:> Beautiful storyline> Characters have interesting backstory and personalities> Tons of character classes to play, different from one another in play style and looks> Dungeon maps are versatile, pretty, and not flat> Community is mostly friendly (outside of PVP)> Not much thinking is involved for PVE until later dungeons> It gets more strategic in the endgame dungeons (but not by that much)Cons:> No tutorial for your specific character/class. You have to eventually (if ever) figure out your character system on your own.> Pay to look good (customization) which also leads to:> Pay-to-Win skins and accessories, and utilities. You need money to get more skill slots. The skins cost either real money, or lots of in-game money because of:> THE SUPER BROKEN ECONOMY. Where you really can't make much until endgame levels.> SUPER GRINDY. You have to do the same dungeons over and over again because of level restrictions starting around late level 40s.> Unfair prize gambling system for $1 per try. If you don't buy skins off other players with in-game money, you have to buy items that have a CHANCE to give you a skin. They don't say what those chances are though. Most of the time, it gives you stuff you can cheaply buy with in-game money.> Want good PVP gear? Grind for it.> Events are terrible. You either need to grind for something, run a dungeon a certain number of times, or just WAIT 10-60 MINUTES FOR AN EVENT REWARD and you can't switch or log out otherwise the timer resets. All just for a crappy reward that usually has a 15-day expiration.> No specific roles like Tank, DPS, Healer, Support, only DPS DPS DPS DPS DPS. Which can be positive/negative depending on preference. I enjoy a bit more strategy involved.> Hackers. I didn't run into many of them in PVP, but once you do, it's annoying because it's random ranked match-ups for PVP, so they can keep matching with you.It was fun to play for a while, but then you notice the grind, the salt, the expensive items, the pay-to-win system, the time you spent waiting for that laggy person in dungeons that prevent you from proceeding unless everyone is with you, etc. etc. I had to research to figure my characters and abilities, with no tutorial for it at all in the game.It was fun while it lasted. So long Elsword. I'll read your beautiful storyline updates on the community-run wiki.			"

												I have played this game quite a bit with the non-Steam version of it, and I have to say at its heart it is a good game. However, it is also a terrible game, that you shouldn't play on the NA (North American) Server, but on the KR (Korean) Server due to some major issues with the NA server that will never ever be fixed. To be at least able to run dungeons to your fullest potential later on, you must at least invest 9$ to gain access to 4 extra skill slots, because without you will only be able to used 4 skills opposed to a grand total of 8 with the B slot (Skill Slot B). To be able to compete in combat against other players when your character reaches a high level, you must at least invest around 30$ generally, this will cover the B slot so you can use your character to its fullest potential (9$), a costume to wear and enchant for stats that are needed to compete without being at a disadvantage (20$ total for a PERMANENT -not 30 day duration- hair, top piece -shirt-, bottom piece -pants-, gloves, and shoes). Do not say that you can use the so-called ""Free-KChing (Premium currency used to purchase B-slot and costumes amongst many other things that are sort of required to get the most out of this game)"" surveys to get all of your KChing, because each survey has a 5% chance of working and can't actually be relied on to pay off the cost of fully enjoying this game. Also, even if you do pay the 30$ (or 40$ for things that help a good amount like necklaces, or trinkets, and skill notes that make otherwise sub-par skills very good), you will never be able to get rid of the lag in pvp that ruins the fun of quite a bit of your matches (especially if you are Eve, the Nasod Queen character, because she is what is called lag-sensitive meaning that lag is more likely to brush off the hit your character does, like for example you stab someone in game and lag interferes, they might take damage, but they won't react to your stab and your opponent can hit you and knock you back; leaving you open for an attack, even though you hit first. -Which happens quite often-) Your 30-40$ also will never cure the horrible community that will rage at your for playing certain characters they find are OP even though they probably aren't. Nor will it cure the amount of boring grind you will have to do (expect to pay 4-10$ on instantly completing quests for say a job advancement which is more than nessecary, or unlocking a good skill if you don't want to waste 30 hours doing that). Also if you mess up allocating skills, and you've used up the two temporary skill resets the game gives you upon class advancements it will cost _20_ dollars to get a new one. Then comes the games economy where EVERYTHING, is expensive. You may buy premium costumes for ED (in-game currency gained by completing dungeons), but this is unrealistic. You will be paying around 1 billion ED for a 20$ costume with this current economy's rate (50,000,000 -50m or 50 million- ED for every 100 KChing, equating to 1,000,000,000 -1bil or 1 billion which takes nearly forever to make without paying- ED for 2,000 KChing), and you may not buy Skill Slot B in-game with ED, or you risk account bans and unprotected trading, resulting in scamming (when a player doesn't pay you or give you the item you paid for). Because although KC (Killer Combo, this games publisher in NA) may punish players for scamming you if you video record your transactions (even though you won't get your deserved goods or ED), Skill Slot B is not giftable which is the method for trading item mall (where you spend your KChing and buy Skill Slot B and/or costumes) merchandise that is not costumes, for costumes can be traded (but other items can not be, meaning you can be scammed, because you can pay your ED hoping they will gift your item to you, but they might just leave, meaning you won't get your item, regardless of if you report with video evidence of scamming or not. tl;dr But if you want to play this game, just play it on the KR sever, EVERYTHING IS BETTER AND YOU WILL NOT SUFFER EVEN THOUGH YOU WILL HAVE TO KNOW KOREAN OR GET AN ENGLISH PATCH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVER OR YOU WILL WASTE UNNECSSARY TIME AND MONEY IN COPIOUS AMOUNTS.			"

												I played it a lot before it came to Steam and after I started playing on Steam I spent a few bucks and bought some stuff. A few months later I get an email that my account was banned for fraudulent spending, etc. I argue against the claim but there is no point in anything I say, the account is banned and there is no way of getting it back.

												Elsword is sort of like a 3D Maple Story in it's own way. So if you enjoyed that, you might like this.From the begining it can get qutie repititve really fast. It's not like most MMOs where you have an abundance of quests to do, rather, you only get a few quests per level. This can get pretty frustrating past level 40, as it forces you to either dungeon grind or field grind (Fields are areas with monsters that you can do repeat quests over and over. It's very stamina efficenet on weekdays, and gives a fair amount of xp.) Ereda Island is also a nice alternative if you're looking for PVE mixed with PVP. It's stamina efficent and it gives good exp.This game does have a stamina system. When you run out of stamina, you can no longer dungeon or gain exp from monsters in field. While most would be turned off by this, I personally don't find myself ever running out of stamina. This might be because I enjoy playing plenty of characters though, so I switch often. On weekends, stamina is unlimited. I can't really think of many things that are bad about Elsword, persay. Some would call it pay2win, due to the only way you can aquire costumes and such is through the cash shop. Plenty of players are able to play with no trouble and never spend a dime on the game. I have personally cashed, but I do remember what it was like not to cash as well. Not being able to cash limits some things, but I wouldn't say by much. You could also buy KC (The cash shop currency) from other players, but our economy is quite terrible right now so that may not be an option. Whether you cash or not does not limit your ability though, and those who think like that are silly. I think PVP is the one reason why I think this game is great. The combo system and how everything works together is very interesting. Unfortunately, many people are quite rude in PVP and those who are considered the top players have a large ego. Prepare for the salt if you decide to PVP. (I do not recommend PVPing before at LEAST 45 if you decide to, due to level differences. If you choose to PVP before then is at your own risk.)http://elwiki.net/ is a great place for game information if you're looking to have questions answered. You can always try the game's forums as well. People are usually kind there, just be careful on how you word things.			"

												Ok ignore the time, I play elsword off of steam. Elsword, without a doubt, is one of my favorite games in general.  Why is that?  To be honest, I don't even know.  Most of the community is toxic as ♥♥♥♥, people not from NA like to raid our server making it even laggier than it should be, those who pay definetly have an edge over f2p players, and in PvP (imo the selling point of this game) your rank is no longer a direct correlation of your skill level. If you can ignore these, Elsword is still a great game.  You can have stylish af combos, the effects in the game are pretty well done, and thanks to the variety of classes in the game, (9 characters with 3 classes each, soon one more will be added with two classes), gameplay is varied.  Tbh, if KoG can stop making this game super♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the freemium in this game was toned down a bit,  This could by far be one of the best games in our generation.  But until KoG pulls their♥♥♥♥♥♥together, I can't in my right mind reccomend this to random people.  If I know you though, play with me I need people to play with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

THEN DO THE SAME DUNGEON ON VERY HARD! And what sucks even more is that the dungeon doesn't change a single BIT, everything is the same. and Very hard isn't even close to hard at all!			"

												Want a mount permanantly? You need money. You want a  bigger inventory? You need money. You want to get married? You need money. You want a costume? You need money. Want to open certain items that monster drop? You need money. Want another pet? You need money. Accidentally put skill points into the wrong skill? You need money. You want extra slots for skills? You need money. You want a avatar? You need money. Other than the fact that the people behind this game are as greedy as a fat kid in a Golden Coral, it is an ok game and the only reason why I am saying that is because its a *clears throat and puts up finger for air quotes* ""f2p"". Would I reccomend? Matters do you want to get pressured into buying♥♥♥♥♥♥for this game. Believe it or not, the cheapest costume if you want it permanantly cost $30+(If you want the wings and tail). PvP is straight garbage. The PvP doesnt even attempt to match people of the same level (I can not tell you how many times I tried to PvP as a Lvl 20 and get put up against a Lvl 45+). The PvP is pretty much who ever starts there combo first wins. Dungeons, all you pretty much have to do is run through them with a mount and you will get an ss on everything (Also when you are on a mount, you are invincible). That an the fact that all bosses pretty much do is spam special attacks *cough cough* Wall No. 8.  Some of the platforms are hollow so expect to jump up to a platform and it will not catch you. For a game that begs for money for anything extra, it sure doesn't do a good job polishing it. If I was a dev for this game, I would be updating this game at least once a week, this game needs some work, badly. Still, a decent, for it being a free to play.,............			"

												 I used to have a lot of fun on this game around 1 or 2 years ago and I just quit because the economy of this game made me♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay 2 win. On the day that i'm wrote this review, i gave Elsword another chance. First thing I went on was PVP, laggiest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever and VERY unbalanced. How do you consider this an NA server?Levelling takes very long and I just gave up once I reached 60. Normally takes you about 1-2 days leveling up by 1. Level cap is currently 85.Should you play this game? No.Why? Because it's a pay 2 win and this game forces you to spend real money. You will need at least $40+ to fully set up your character for extra inventory space, an extra skill slot and a costume set to increase your characters stats even more. Want to change your class? No problem! 28 dollars! Want to buy a pet that you can control and feed random♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10+ dollars! If you want to play elsword without paying for anything expensive, I recommend playing Void Elsword. I'm never coming back.			"

												Ok, Firstly. The game is fun......for awhile. The game goes from challangely fun to lets rub your faces in deaths and rage inducing crap from zero to a thousand in a matter of days. Secondly, i have not once in my 20+ years of gaming seen anything more pay to play then this game. You want to stay in the challanging stages of the game well better toss in your CC and pay out the backside. cause frankly speaking, Gear drops sure easy enough to come by. Upgrading materials once again easy enough to come by. The rub is all that means lil to nothing cause if you dont have the ""pay to get"" costumes, pets etc. Well congratz your now reaching the rage part of the game cause your characters will all die in a matter of seconds. Want to buy those items from the player shops, well congratz your now gonna have to grind out all your stamina and days away on cash. Btw you wont be earning much each day maybe a few hundred thousand if you get lucky. ""Hint"" 1 constume item ""when theres 6 peaces basic"" costs 340million - 600million. have fun grinding your life away. Want more inv space skills to use or just simply put the ability to do much of anything outside of die 10 times a day and then log out cause well sry thats all your allowed to do before your considered useless. All in all. If you want around 15 days worth of decent game play sure go ahead install the game. If you want a bash your face into the keyboard rafe festing challange game. tada you've met your match. can't support this game. fun but not worth the stress of playing.			"

I've read what other's wrote and they are probably right, but I couldn't get far enough into the game to care.  It's a boring level crawl with an awful Cash Shop.

												Elsword Online. Not a terrible game. Not a good game. After a meager 2 years of playing this game myself (and a few hundred dollars), I can honestly say this game HAD a good conept at it's foundation. That element is still there, but you won't be able to enjoy due to a brutal pay-wall and tear-jerking balancing issues. This game should have stayed in beta for at LEAST another 2 years (from current date). if you're looking for a satisfying side-scrolling/arcade/RPG game, go play Super mario. What little character customization there is in this game is....well developed, and one of the most relevant pay-walls. Sadly, the ""costumes"" in this game aren't worth buying at all, as they pale in comparison to the fabeled ice Burner. If you're going to buy into this decent platformer, (I really can't call this an arcade-style game), don't watse your money on the costumes. Buy the B-Bar option, then buy hundreds of Ice Burners, and watch as your 1-in-200 odds steal your money away. IF, IF, you manage to get a full set for any one character, keep that character, and make all the other character-paths for that characters, as Ice Burner are the only shareable item your characters can swap between.My 1-to-5 rating?1 Phenomenal concept! Early-game must have been alot of fun! As it is now however, I can no longer respect or enjoy this pay-wall. (Not game, pay-wall).(This is an opinion. I STRONGLY recommend you read the other reviews on this game. The more you know, the better).			"

												Alright, i finnaly have a max lvl character and ive spent enough time in this game to write a worthwhile review. Ill split my review in 2 parts; PVP and PVE, Aka. Players versus players and Player versus enemies (dongeons), which are the 2 parts of the experience this game as to offer.---------------------------------------Lets start with PVE.PVE consist of a set of dongeons, you go to the dongeon corresponding to your level, get some quests done, kill some bosses, nothing really ground breaking. The part that i hate about PVE in this game is that its REALLY REALLY easy, your party will just steam roll everything even on hard difficulty, later it gets more challanging but thats 100h into the game (if you make it that far) and even then its repetitive as hell anyway.TL;DR PVE is easy, grindy and boring---------------------------------------Now for PVP.PVP is quite simple, you go in 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 and try to kill the enemy, nothing fancy or complex going on here, you kill people, which is totally fine, not all games need 12 pvp modes. But it gets ugly rather quickly, heres a list of whats wrong with pvp:1: The ranked system is based of your total win rate and ignore your level totally so having a lvl 40 face a lvl 70 happens really often and of course the lvl 40 gets pummeled.2: PVP is pay2win, not by a lot, but still is, let me explain. You are limited to 4 skills at all times, however you can pay 10$ to unlock a second skillset and have 8 instead, effectively giving you twice the flexibility in combat. If you want to go far in PVP you better have dat 10 bucks.3: Random items, there are some random items that spawn in the pvp arena which grants various buffs and bonuses, theres no problem here so far. The problem arise that you cant turn them off in RANKED pvp. Adding a element of randomness to a RANKED match is just rage inducing to say the least.4: Lag, nothing much to say here, it lag and that sucks.5: Balance issues; Some classes are just flat out broken and little is done in order to balance them.TL:DR PVP is pay2win, laggy and unbalanced.

												A game packed full of content, fun, and fighting (pvp and pve). There's not a character I've played who isn't a blast to pick up, and each character has 3 classes with entire skill trees. A bit of a grind to level up, and while the game isn't pay-to-win some of the features are much better after you've spent money. My advice: spend $40 on a character and start having the time of your life. Played for a year off and on, found it on Steam, still getting enjoyment out of it.			"

Quick Overview: Fairly entertaining. The variety and art is nice and it has a sort of Smash Bros feel to it. I definitely don't recommend Elsword for someone who's expecting a lot. If you want a nice-looking anime RPG to play for a bit, though, I recommend it. (Of course, I've been playing this for a really long time, I'm not really speaking for myself)I started playing this game last year, before I found it on Steam, and I found myself playing it a LOT, for a few reasons.- I really loved the art, and I still do. The character design and art style is great. - The graphics are good. (They're pretty smooth.)- There's a lot of variety with the kind of class you want to choose. And even after you choose your class, there are (usually) three different branches/playstyles/""new job classes"" you can take for your character, each one having their own attack range, difficulty to master, etc. If you get tired of one class, you can always make another. (with a max of 9 different character slots)- The plot is fairly entertaining, as well as the gameplay. The NPCs are great and I really love all of them. -The community on an overall is pretty okay. Generally the PvE community is really great and really friendly. (It can be an ENTIRELY different story for PvP, though, because the PvP community can be really toxic sometimes) As much as I like it, though, there are quite a few cons to consider. - The play-to-win problem is pretty bad. KOG sets it up so that it takes hours of heavy grinding and keyboard smashing if you don't want to pay money/k-ching. Costumes are your best bet for stat increases, and your default one expires after 15 days. After that, you have to pay. A lot of the features are also money-locked. Skill Slot B? Unless you stick around for the Grand Chase Event, you have to pay. The really nice skills? You can either complete killer quests that are designed to make you pull your hair out and give up, or you have to pay. - As I said earlier, the plot is pretty entertaining at first. After a while, the quests get pretty old and it's pretty much just completing dungeon after dungeon for PvE, until you run out of dungeons. (There aren't that many, especially if you're going for a long-term game) - Pay-to-win is pretty relevant in PvP. I personally don't have a ton of experience with PvP. But, from my experience, if you don't want to spend money on costumes to up your stats, forget getting up to an SSS rank. (I don't play much PvP for that reason.)-The PvP community can be toxic. People are constantly complaining about how bad you are if you mess up, or if your'e lagging. It's pretty bad sometimes. You learn to deal with it (It doesn't stop me), but for some people it can be enough to ruin the game.Final Words: Despite the flaws, I do still enjoy playing this game a fair amount. I find myself going back to it a lot, each time playing a different character. It's enjoyable, but I can't really recommend it to other people because of the cons.			"

												I'm addicted. Horribly, horribly addicted. Don't be me. Don't sacrifice your life to this pay to win game. The leveling process becomes tedious and dull around Fieta; if you win pvp at all, you're a ""noob"" for some reason or another; you never feel like you have the full experience because of the cash shop; and the dungeons have little to no challenge to them aside from occasionally having to stop fighting and move out of the way of some super armored boss, and even then that's more annoying than anything else. I may be addicted, but you still have hope. Go. Leave this page now, and never return! In the name of all that is good in this world, don't become like me!			"

												This mix of manga, fighting and MMO is unmatched and fighters will actually find a find home here on PC while the RPG aspects with CONSTANT events and large, hyped community will keep non-fighters from immediately getting intimidated and high-tailing it. Beginners will find that the game doesn't feed anything to them but, as you look and see veteran players flaunting power and status, you'll find that putting forth the time to delve in and figure out the game enough to become a feared fighter in the community is one of the most ego-boasting rewards you'll experience in gaming.

												+Overall-This game is awesome Its a fighting game an a MMO all in one. I personally love playing RF because you punch everything but it has a variety of play styles for everbody for example Deadly Chaser a job class for chung is the Guile of Elsword an Elsword is kinda the Ryu. Not only does it contibute to the fighting Genre of fans but also anime fans because it has that feel but not too much to make both sides even.+Classes-So basically how it goes is you pick a character instead of a class (like a fighting game) an you proceed to level up the character and once you reach lvl 15 you get your first job change an after you reach 35 I believe you get your 2nd job change which is going to be your character from then on. each character will end up having 3 job classes and each one will be extremely different from the others, I'll use Raven as an example.-Reckless Fist is basically a character where he can take hits but aslo dish out damage aswell an uses his nasod arm instead of his sword doing high magical damage with super armor most of the time.-Blade Master focues around using his blade with very fast attacks before his opponent can but is very vulnerable to magical and a little bit to physical but he avoids this by being very mobile.-Veteran Commander is a cross between ranged and close combat basically a shoto character in a fighting game he isnt very tanky but he has good combos, good mobility and has high damaging specials making him a really dangerous class.Overall the class system is really good because there is something for everyone, If you like a powerhouse but like to be a little tanky go for Raven, if you like zoneing your oppoenent go Rena or Aisha, You wanna be in the opponents face almost all the time being very mobile and have good reach Ara, You just wanna go on full dmg not caring about defense Add is a good character to do that awell. Overall there is so much variety right now in elsword everyone can find a character.+GamplayNow this is the thing every person in a fighting game cares about and also in MMOs the gameplay. -PVPright now Elsword has a balanced system after a certain amount of hits a persons KDR(Knock Down Rate) will go up an make them fall ending the combo, but people can work around this and do something called a KD reset where they hit the oppoent in the air most of the time and bring them back down before they fall to the ground allowing them to continue the combo. Now before you think the first hit decides the match, MP (Mana Points) is a resource which everyone has and once you reach a hundred you can hold Light or Heavy attack and Mana Break forcing youself to fall ending the combo but like any other fighting game being on the ground is a big dis-advantage so stay mobile is key in elsword there is no true block button aside from one of Elsword's actives(I mean the character not the game, confusing yes I know). But like most fighting games it comes down to skill who can utilize his kit better then the other player, but like all other PVP games there is something OP once in awhile right now Ara and Elesis are very strong character being very mobile an sometimes having super armor and MAJOR damage moves one example to prove this is that in all big heard tournaments in Elsword usally Ara's always win because one of her jobs is insanley powerful. With the recently added character Add he is probably the most damaging character once he gets his conditions set but he has 0 to none defense being half healthed usally in one combo. But everything is usally patched or buffs are given to other character to balance it out, Elsword does a pretty good job about this so dont judge the game by a few characters.-PVEThis is something Elsword is minorly known for but before you go saying, ""I side scroller? Thats probably so easy!"". You are wrong because in dungens later in the game become really challenging making you follow mechanics so you cant have an easy time. It also has insane raid bosses that have tricky patterns to memorize making it a real challenge, also seasonal raid bossess so you get something new most of the time. I will say that some dungens can be done pretty easy if you got or bought a ""Mount"" basically these things only use is for dungens doing insane damage for a set amount of time but it doesnt entirley break the game one because they are expensive and they only have 100 stamina an may only last around 5-6 minutes at a time. Overall Elsword PVP isnt boring because it most of the time comes up with something knew almost every month or so actually quicker then that sometimes, it is in no way easy or boring.+GraphicsThey have simple graphics that look good, its not next gen realistic graphics its just simple but they somehow make it seem really appealing with their character designs and NPC design aswell, then the monsters arent those stupid over anime monsters that you see in other anime MMO RPGs, they actually make wood golems that wear a mask looking like they are hiding a scary face or something, overall this is short  and sweet to the point its nothing special but it isnt bad in the slightest way. If you want a comparison go look at Grand Chase compared to this game.+FinalI am probably skipping some points but this has been written long enough the overall game is good its fair to people who just want to play the game and not spend money in some aspects its a little bit like ""Pay-to-Win"" but overall no people buy accesorys to make there character look cool and the buffs they get from them aren't that big so it doesnt make a huge difference, if you dont want to spend money thats fine Elsword gives pleny of oppurtinitys to get accesorys for your character absolutely free for just playing the game. It is in no way a pay to win game. Gameplay is solid most of the time aside from some character being a little OP an some character having unfair moves but I say again it comes down to raw skill...most of the time! PVE is not boring an doesnt lack excitment with over the top bosses like a giant mecha robot with wings that fire giant lasers at you an can back hand you and instant kill you. Graphics are nice and simple also are really well used, this game is awesome at keeping to a fighting game Genre and MMO aswell I recomend that you try it atleast once if your a fighting game fan, get to the 2nd job class get to around 50 and start pvping after you get your gear (which is really easy to get) an start playing, watch some videos of people comboing learn an I gurantee you will have fun.I forgot to mention so many things in this review but this is basically the meat of it all so if you think this sounds awesome to you go join the community because its growing very slowly each day,			"

												Ah Elsword, I gotta say, this is one of the best Anime MMORPGs I've played in my experience as a gamer.Don't throw your F grenades yet, (and by F i mean F@%*) I do know about LOL, Diablo, WOW, and destiny, so hear me out and take your fingers out of the pin hole. Now I don't know about you guys, but when I'm about to jump into a new MMO, I tend to do research.I start with the little things, is it visually appealing? Does it have PVP and if it does is it well ballanced? Can I see my character fully instead of just the top of it's head? and most important, is it fun? In my opinion Elsword has everything an MMO should, awesome fast paced gameplay, unique character styles and combat, beautiful scenery, and blood pumping PvP action. And this for free!Dispite the gender locked characters that all start out the same, you are somehow able to still feel unique and different from any other player. Be it cosmetically or combat wise. You don't ahve to spend DAYS!!! trying to level up just to get past a stage. And admittedly, the dungeons can and will get kinda repetitive, this happenes in all gaming, the only way to avoid it is to keep coming out with new missions and updates. Which, as far as I know, Elsword does. Remember what I said about balanced PvP? Well this isn't exactly the best example. While it may seem impossible for a level 4 to absolutely destroy a level 70, I gotta say in Elsword, this isn't all that uncommon. What I like about ES's PvP is that it gives all players a chance, if they are skilled. What I don't like is that the new characters are automatically stronger and more efficient, which, outside of context makes perfect sence right? New meaning improved and more efficient. But honestly, its like you don't even need skill anymore, I normally play as the star character Elsword himself, but I tried one day as a new character named Ara. at level 10 I effortlessly conquered a level 64. and don't get me wrong, this was an A class player, he had experience! but Ara is absolutely unstoppable and has seemingly endless combos, thats absurd to me. But like I said, if you are more skilled than the other you will win. All in All, Elsword is a great game to play if you have patience and are a wiz at combos. I'd always recomend it to anyone who calls themself a gamer.                                                                   Gameplay: 9/10Story: 7/10PvP: 8/10Visuals: 9.5/10Community: 9/10			"

												This game is hands down one of the great MMOs. I would highly reccommend it for its class stability and its dedication to its players. It never fails to be a good game in my book and I hope that they continue to bring such great content as they always have.Pros:-Multi class system-town centers, open mob sections, and dungeons-easy party system-cool worn items that you can get from bosses-great pvp arena and system-very easy to level at the beginningCons:-community (but thats most games)-there are some classes that too many people play (personal issue i'll get over someday XD)-its a 2D side scroller so you have to get used to that type of play style			"

												Oh Anime, some hate, some love, and as you can tell I love it. First off, if you love anime you already are downloading this game.If you don't, well...Anyway, this is a 3-D side scrolling beat-em-up with anime elements with the average cuteness. The game is an MMO but its a small data consumer with just over 3000 MB not GB, that would be your entire life right there. The game gets updates now and then and has stuff you can buy with real money but the games money is insane. First time players see 5,000 coins for an item, but you can get 10 times as much buy going into different areas. Before I end this, the specials are always so cool, and the story is acceptable.			"

There is a bug/glitch in the game that doesnt allow me to play because my character is constantly moving right. After multiple tests of my own and looking up on the elsword website and other areas, there is no solution to this problem and therefore I am unable to play this game at all.			"

												Awesome game overall.  Requires buying to look nice, but I don't see that as an issue.  Higher levels require a lot of grinding, but this is a Korean RPG; what did you expect (*cough* Maplestory *cough*)?  Gameplay is smooth and connection is not really a problem.  PVP is tough, but I personally don't PVP too often, so it doesn't realy concern me.  Harder dungeons require more people, and unless you choose not to, you have to wait until you get into a party to enter hard and very hard dungeons.  It's quite hard to get into parties, but when you get in, it's really nice.  Really well-developed game, highly suggest to people who like rpg's.  Really don't suggest this to people who are impatient or get really annoyed by costumes or pvp.  But yea, try this game out.			"

												An interesting MMO. Sure there are other side-scrolling multiplayer games, like Awesomenauts, but that focuses more on team versus matches. With Elsword you have quality visuals, done in an anime-esque cell shading style, character voices are done in Japanesse (text is in English). What's different here is that the vast majority of the time, you don't need your mouse. All combat is controlled from the keyboard, from movement to attacks and the mouse only seems to be used for menus. Also, this game uses a Stamina system; killing monsters in dungeons uses stamina, the more players running that dungeon, the less you use. Stamina refills daily (3am PST), but is unlimited on weekends, and honestly, you can get at least 3-4 hours of dungeon time in on your daily stamina, so it's not a huge deal.What can be a bit confusing are the costume pieces from the real-money store. While they're nice and they can make your character look decent, they all seem to be limited-time use items. I may be wrong about that, but when you look at them the price is listed twice, one for a 30-day use and one permanent for 2x the 30-day price. You can get by without them, as they only apply stat boost on top of whatever your getting from armor/weapons/ect.That aside, the game is highly addictive. However, for most quest you seem to have to repeat dungeons over at least 2-3 times, often at specific difficulty levels or higher, but said dungeons have 3 difficulty levels and you can always just join a random group to take on the highest levels or run solo if you're feeling up to it. Dungeons are also split up, with some not letting you progress till all enemies are dead. One gripe I found was in the Skill Notebook quest where I had to run two dungeons over and over again in order to kill one enemy type because I need to collect 20 items, which were rare drops (I'd get 2-3 per run, max with some runs giving none). But most times you're asked to collect 20+ of an item you get it from every avaliable enemy kill, so it's only a problem in specific quests where the item is listed as Rare.In-game currency is easy to come by. At only 6 hours in I'd already accumulated over 300k, and probably spent even more upgrading my equipment as well, since you can get a lot of use out of equipment via enchanting, enhancing and repairing before you need to get something new.I haven't delved too deeply into crafting, but item/weapon enhancement is done two different ways, each adding diffrent things, so the system there is robust enough to allow for customization to play prefferences.In all it's a solid game with solid mechanics, detailed characters, both NPC and your own. My only real gripe is that unless you pay K-Ching (the games real-world money) you're limited to only 3 item quick-slots and 4 skill quick-slots, you're inventory is also limited, with 8 slot upgrades costing 200 K-Ching. However, 1 K-Ching is ~$.01, so it's not that big a cost (This is based off the 500 K-Ching pack costing $5US). But be warned that such upgrades are bought on a per character basis, so it costs about $14 per character to get +16 inventory spaces and all 8 skill quick slots, but you can play just as well with the stock free setup.

												I give it a thumbs up, although don't assume I would recommend this to everyone. This game is nice. It has a variety of aesthetic and different backgrounds for eachc character. However, it's a pay2win game. Therefore, in order to do better you are going to have spend money. You need to buy costumes which you are allowed to give it stats which increases your power making those who don't pay in a disavantage.			"

												Played this game for hours on the original non-steam version and had a blast. Pretty original mechanics in compared to alot of the other F2P mmos out there, but it did get a little repetitive/boring after a while. All and all it is a pretty fun game to at the least try out.			"

												Hands down, this game has the best fighting system of all mmos. One of the problems that i have with other fighter mmos is that the combat are too slow. In this game however, it's fast just like how a fighting game should be, fast and intense. The dungeon can get boring after a while but the pvp is where this game shines. It is where you put what you have learn to use against other people, but I don't recommend you start pvping till you're level 35.2015 Update: There are now some balancing issues. Some characters/classes are just outright overpowered the other classes(Crimson Avenger/Diabolic Esper). Thankfully there is a patch coming that will be nerfing them.			"

												I love this game! Its style is totally what I am into a heck lot. Though it may not work for everyone's liking.In terms of gameplay it can be rather fun and different from other games you may play.Characters:In this game all play differently, each and every individual character and class has its distinct features and all tend to accelerate in different ways.The characters all have very diverse skills and playstyles, surely it will make you feel like you're playing a manga/comic.Aside from the main topic, if you play in-game many people may complain (that's an NA server for you), however, each character has it's proper work around to getting through each task (including PvP which most people get salty at lol). I do have my fair share of getting frustrated, though after all it might just mean you may have been outplayed. (But this is a F2P game LOL, so expect overgeared players too... [Totally worth getting mad for sometimes])Dungeons:I have to say the dungeons in Elsword are also rather diverse xD!The scenery of each place tends to have a different feel.Oh, and not to mention!... There is also a dungeon to run through all the bosses, IT IS NOT A CAKEWALK AT ALL.Arena:The arena (PVP) in this game is hilariously fun.1v1 being the most skillful played in. Doing 1v1 truly shows how skillful you are (Or how much you can spam x_x... that can be useful I guess?... Not entirely a good thing to see.)2v2 being the most competitive. While doing 2v2s brings on teamwork, making tactics important to play with.3v3 being the most fun and chaotic xD! The amount of spammage is hilarious and you may not even be able to know what is going on, it's great, yet annoying. If you're too serious then it may not be as fun as it seems.(This may stand for everything in-game though, but it's best to have fun in PvP than get frustrated.)			"

												Awesome game overall.  Requires buying to look nice, but I don't see that as an issue.  Higher levels require a lot of grinding, but this is a Korean RPG; what did you expect (*cough* Maplestory *cough*)?  Gameplay is smooth and connection is not really a problem.  PVP is tough, but I personally don't PVP too often, so it doesn't realy concern me.  Harder dungeons require more people, and unless you choose not to, you have to wait until you get into a party to enter hard and very hard dungeons.  It's quite hard to get into parties, but when you get in, it's really nice.  Really well-developed game, highly suggest to people who like rpg's.  Really don't suggest this to people who are impatient or get really annoyed by costumes or pvp.  But yea, try this game out.			"

												An interesting MMO. Sure there are other side-scrolling multiplayer games, like Awesomenauts, but that focuses more on team versus matches. With Elsword you have quality visuals, done in an anime-esque cell shading style, character voices are done in Japanesse (text is in English). What's different here is that the vast majority of the time, you don't need your mouse. All combat is controlled from the keyboard, from movement to attacks and the mouse only seems to be used for menus. Also, this game uses a Stamina system; killing monsters in dungeons uses stamina, the more players running that dungeon, the less you use. Stamina refills daily (3am PST), but is unlimited on weekends, and honestly, you can get at least 3-4 hours of dungeon time in on your daily stamina, so it's not a huge deal.What can be a bit confusing are the costume pieces from the real-money store. While they're nice and they can make your character look decent, they all seem to be limited-time use items. I may be wrong about that, but when you look at them the price is listed twice, one for a 30-day use and one permanent for 2x the 30-day price. You can get by without them, as they only apply stat boost on top of whatever your getting from armor/weapons/ect.That aside, the game is highly addictive. However, for most quest you seem to have to repeat dungeons over at least 2-3 times, often at specific difficulty levels or higher, but said dungeons have 3 difficulty levels and you can always just join a random group to take on the highest levels or run solo if you're feeling up to it. Dungeons are also split up, with some not letting you progress till all enemies are dead. One gripe I found was in the Skill Notebook quest where I had to run two dungeons over and over again in order to kill one enemy type because I need to collect 20 items, which were rare drops (I'd get 2-3 per run, max with some runs giving none). But most times you're asked to collect 20+ of an item you get it from every avaliable enemy kill, so it's only a problem in specific quests where the item is listed as Rare.In-game currency is easy to come by. At only 6 hours in I'd already accumulated over 300k, and probably spent even more upgrading my equipment as well, since you can get a lot of use out of equipment via enchanting, enhancing and repairing before you need to get something new.I haven't delved too deeply into crafting, but item/weapon enhancement is done two different ways, each adding diffrent things, so the system there is robust enough to allow for customization to play prefferences.In all it's a solid game with solid mechanics, detailed characters, both NPC and your own. My only real gripe is that unless you pay K-Ching (the games real-world money) you're limited to only 3 item quick-slots and 4 skill quick-slots, you're inventory is also limited, with 8 slot upgrades costing 200 K-Ching. However, 1 K-Ching is ~$.01, so it's not that big a cost (This is based off the 500 K-Ching pack costing $5US). But be warned that such upgrades are bought on a per character basis, so it costs about $14 per character to get +16 inventory spaces and all 8 skill quick slots, but you can play just as well with the stock free setup.

												For the arcade/Beat'em up fnatic. Elsword is classic 2.5D sidescrolling fighting fun, with tons of ways to play....Just make sure you're ready to cough up a few dollars to keep looking pretty.The combat is insanely fun and you can pull off pretty lengthy combos with only slight effort. However, if you're not willing to pay you will literally be playing in your underwear. You think your character looks cool? It won't once the ""Expiration date"" of your clothes comes in. Not only does it cost money to not look like an idiot. You have to pay a ton of money just to get items that you basically NEED to get ahead in this game. And for that reason I have to give this game a negative score, no matter how fun it is.			"

												Elsword is an awesome game.But why i do not recomend this game?Elsword is broken, it is a fact.And the Developer (KOG games) just seems to be obssesed with pleasing themself (and their wallet), lets break it down then.Every new character, the developer has stated that they intentionally overpower this new character, making it a biased game everytime a character is released, then nerf it a little and continue with the cycle.Nerfs are nice now and again, but they do not listen a single suggestion the community has given, reason why overpowered characters remain overpowered even after nerf.Equipment, any game that rely on equipment on PvP is bound to be pay to win, people may say it is not, but tell them if  a +10 weapon will not win a +7 weapon? The boost from +9  to +10 is just too significant.Lag, oh lord, save me here. This game is infested with it and it means so much while in PvP, does not matter how fast or good you are, you lag or the enemy lag, it turns the table way to significantly, this will not be fixed because of how the game is developed (Peer to peer)For an old game it is odd how high the prices are in the cash shop.Elsword is pretty much the Perfect World of action/2D genre, that pretty much sums it up.

												I have played and enjoyed my fair share of hours in this game, that being said the microcharge for everything they can.You can buy a lot of advantages so it can be quite unbalanced for the true Free-to-play player.Examples:Magic Necklace - Improves your mana aquisation by +30% when attacking or being attacked. 800KC/8$Full Costume Packages - Can be socketed for additional stats 2390KC/23.9$B-slot - Allows you to use 4 more skills in PvE and PvP - 900KC/9$Item mall rings - Adds additional skill points to some of your skills (depending on what ring you choose) 700KC/7$Items can be gifted so you CAN aquire theese items by buying them from players who sell their KC, but the economy of this game is so broken and the prices are absolutely ridicoulus. Futhermore, it still requires someone to actually pay for and support this kind of business.What makes this game worth playing is that it is the only one of it's kind out there for anime-style slice-em up fast paced PvE and PvP, had there been any other game similar to this, with better balance of prices and general management of the game I would have choosen that any day.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is very stale and repetative, people say that ""it is what you can expect from an Korean MMO"" but it doesen't change the fact that it's a grind-fest. In order to level you are required to spam the same dungeons over and over again, and when you run out of story quests for your level, you get to farm fields until you level up, only do open your new story quests and spam the same dungeon over and over. Some bosses in the game are fun mechanicaly but most of them are hardly worth the mention. PvE is super easy, with the exception of some of the end game Secret Dungeons, which sometimes just feels like are made hard on few areas to make you buy resurrection stones.Overall, unless you want to burn your money, grind forever, I would find another game. However, as said before, there hardly exist anything like this out there yet. Which is too bad. This game has a lot of great potential but it is wasted on KoG/KillerCombo trying to suck every penny out of you. While playing, you are often left with a feeling of being a mindless consumer, which is not a good feeling for any game to leave you with. "

												I accidentally registered with a typo in my email and the link was obviously never sent. Now when I start the game it just says, your account is not activated, please check your email and try again. I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling to see if it would allow me to re register but it didn't. Guess I am not playing this game.			"

												I've played plenty of Elsword on the stand alone client, and saw that it was on steam. Great. I play it, and I remember why I stopped playing. PROS-- Art style is pretty fun and cool.- movemnt is fluent and seemless.Welp thats it,CONS-- PVP is a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm of the character ""Add"" and he is the least skillfull character in the game. But here's the catch... everyone plays him. His ""combos,"" are repeating x and z a bunch and win.- The developers babysit the players and give you free things that are too good. Free max level? The ♥♥♥♥? It devalues the people who earned the level 70 like me. - PVE is boring			"

												The Only MMO I have placed more than a total of One Hundred hours on even before I played it on steam. Controls are fun and simple enough to understand, graphics are pretty good at presenting the atmosphere of a field or dungeon. Music is phenomenal, and one of my favorite game soundtracks period. My only gripes are with the lack of customability for the characters on an Asthetic level without having to pay about five dollars for a wig. I wish you could at least change the hair color or eye style. My second gripe is with the PVP. It is INCREDIBLY unbalanced. Often times, I found myself as a fresh character of level ten or even five going up against a level 80 player. It's like sending a kid with a stick and a pot on his head out into a battle against Beowulf or Hercules. But overall, I believe this game to be a fantastic Multiplayer experience with friends, and I am looking forward to the upcoming Elsword anime. But hey, who am I to judge? Try it out and judge it for yourself.			"

												Oh gawd,,,, Sidescroll Fighter. One of most epic MMORPG. i know that its not like WoW or GW2 but it have genius atmosphere. Graphics is not bad but it should be better. i like anime style of it. o of bad things in this game is finding players to make a dungeon...  sometimes after 5 min u have 2/4 players. same situation in PvP. When I mentioned a PvP i must say about balance. its horrible. sometimes u have have teams 24 lvl, 25 lvl, 45 lvl vs 50 lvl, 30 lvl, 47 lvl. What the heck,,..  ranks on pvp are bugged and after 10 wins u can get nothing or C for example. But another good thing is community. one of most friendly guys i met. 0 flame etc. overallGameplay: 9/10Graphic 7/10Community 10/10PvP 5/10Dungeons 7/10~~~~~~~ 7,6/10			"

												The good-~ Fast-paced gameplay.~ Skill and Class variety.~ PvP.~ PvE.~ Character customization through outfits and accessories.The bad-~ Gender-locked classes.~ Certain skills are locked until a tedious quest is completed to unlock them.~ Character balance is thrown off with each new class or character addition.~ Exploiting a certain stat (Add/Red Dmg) can break the characters in PvP and make them ridiculously ""OP"".~ Most outfits used to customize your character can only be obtained via the Item Mall, using real money.

												It's a perfect blend of harmony. everything u want from an RPG is right here. well...i shouldnt say everything but if u like PVE or PVP action here u go! Like Fanservice? Here u go! i do have some issues with the game like the new classes being too OP during PVP matches but still if u learn and master the other characters u can dominate the new classes! From my perspective if u play this game or anygame too much at one sitting u will get bored of it.sure grinding lvls are a pain but i say lvls dont matter its all skill and experience of the game. quick to start easy to learn!

												You have to seriously dedicate yourself to this game to thouroughly enjoy it, and I honestly think this can be an amazing game at will when you want it to be. I pearsonally think this game is great for some and clearly not for others - but it has incredible action and satisfying battles that can reach to so many epic proportions. And although this is the game that i've probably spent most of my life on, unless your into hours of wierdly enjoyable grinding then you should just play dungeon fighters.			"

												I must say, I've played this game for quite some time and it's stuck with me. If you love manga/anime and you're looking for a great online RPG to get addicted to and emersed in, this is the game for you. A one-of-a-kind hack and slash fast-paced side scroller.Pros:- Excellent customisablity of gameplay- EXCELLENT COSMETICS (reason enough for an anime/manga fan to play)- Fun and enjoyable graphics/themes- Highly addictive playstyle- Flexible combosCons:- Hard exp table->> You're going to really feel the grind with this one- Cashing has huge advantages (+50% exp medals, BSlots, Mana necklaces to name a few)- Hugely inflated player economy->> It's going to be hard to get anything near luxury-tier if you start out and don't plan to cash- Server locks (You're usually not able to play cross-continent, which isn't great if you have overseas friends)- Genderlocked classes (if you want to shoot arrows, magic or play with drones you have to be female, if you want to wield a sword or cannon you have to be male...)- Stamina system (restricts how much you can play per day)Overall, I'm well aware that this game has it's downfalls, but again if you're an anime or manga fan with a love for online RPGs, then I wouldn't hesitate to reccommend this.Feel free to chat to me in game if you feel like it. ;DIGN: Primacy			"

												A vindictive, malicious, and deceiving game. To sum up the entire game, without any loop holes. The entire game is a bull$h11t piece of garbage with many unbalanced characters and deceives you with the ""revamped"" and ""balance"" changing updates. Everyone knows that this is a pay-2-win game that requires you to buy useless piece of utter♥♥♥♥♥1NG garbage. This is a representation of what truly happens with this pay-to-win option: You notice the game has a major update + Sum up the cost of the total items = $40 for costumes + $10 pets + $20 equipment + another $10 accessories + Stupid desperate lazy pieces of f4gg0ts = Overpowered players that spam and cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. [Final verdict]5h1tty gameplay involving dungeons and PVP + Sweaty Germans + Garbage updates + paytowin scumbags = Terrible garbage paytowin sellout. People who give positive rating are the fat sweaty paytowin Germans and those who give a negative rating are the true experienced and pro dank memers. Overall, if you wanna give this game a chance go for it. Give a PVP a chance? Well you can go FI_ICk yourself! Give dungeon a chance? What a boring repetitive piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ So, do you still wanna play? YES and you're a retard, NO and you're a dank memer.			"

												I've been playing this game for maybe three and a half years now, it's been a long time coming. I'll tell anyone now.THIS GAME IS COOL. IT REALLY IS. Just not the NA server. If you wanna pay for microtransactions, you have to pay a TON because of how inflated item prices are. Just play Void Elsword instead. It may not be as good in terms of connectivity because the server is based in the UK, you can get significantly better price ratios for the money you pay out of pocket, and the exp curve is a lot better. But if you love the grind, and you don't pay micros for games, NA is for you.			"

												leveling in this game is fairly decent and fun till you unlock your fifth skill which would make you realize this game has tons of restrictions on free players with little hope of catching up to to players that use real life money some people will sayyou only need 4 skills but that doesnt explain the fact 8 skill slots is simply more fun and adds more variety and options in combat and the game by design feels pay2win you only get 2 charcter slots with the same process of each charcter needing simlar items from the cash shop a shame this game apears to have potential of a great game but the design of the charcter progress being heavily dependant on cash items is a true shame.

												Don't get me wrong this game is fun to play and the style of the characters, levels, enemies and weapons are interesting however.Due to certain reasons i'm unable to actually launch the game since the game forced me into having it into windows however that can be due to my own end.Also to my own opinion theres to much information and text going on around the screeen for you to enjoy and due to that reason the text it self is also kind of small so for people with damaged eyesight like me will have trouble same with people who have problems when it comes to keeping up with things that popping up within a few seconds, also people with epilepsy (sorry if i spelled it wrong i'm very dumb) should not play due to that certain attacks have bright flashes and such.Plus if you want to play with friends in different countries/regions then you cant becuase of the fact that the severs you play on are based on where you region is so that option is directly ou the region and to be honset I am not sure if there is but personaly I belive that there should be a hide other layers option because there are a lot of players so it can get confusing at times.In the end I say if you are sure your computer/laptop/mac can support it and you dont mind confusing text and random stuff then your should try this game however if your more for the simplistic and fun type of games then you should think about downloading this game and probably not download it and try to find another game.

												Pretty Straight forward. Move to either the left or the right (depending on where the game wants you to go) and kill everything in your way. With 8 characters each with multiple job changes for each to keep combat exciting with more skills added to the skill tree. As the game progresses the dungeons get harder, monsters get stronger and the importance of a team is almost required by level 40+. As a person that has used all of the classes, I can firmly say that each has it's advantages and drawbacks, some more than others of course, but that does with any game. This is not your typical MMO with healer, tank, and DPS. Each character is equally capable of dishing out death and destruction across the 2-d dungeons.			"

												""This game is ok in my book, if you’re into anime, indie type games and got friends too willing to spare time with u in this game, then you should be ok for you. The game can be over price, a little repetitive and can get boring from time to time. I only play it still because I still got more friends on it and I spent a lot of money but I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not willing to shell cash into it. So you decided if its your kind of game, for me it’s not so I’m stuck with it.""			"

												Elsword is my all-time favorite PC game and I've been playing it for a little over 3 years now. Some people give it a bad reccomendation because of it's claim to be a ""Free to play game"" and say that it's a ""Pay to win"". I will admit that I have put quite a bit of money into Elsword, but that's simply because I love the game and have an addiction to the PVP side of it. However, if you play mostly for dungegon and aren't a PVP type of person, you can surely get by perfectly fine without paying a dime. Putting money into it is all up to you and your preference; I mean, really good equipment sets can be obtained through doing secret dungeons too, and that's always free, just a lot of work. Elsword is not ALL ""Play to win"". I would totally recommend trying the game out.			"

												     This fast-paced fighting game is a 2-d phenomenon, making what you see in animes possible.  There are many classes to choose from to better suit your fighting style.  One of the stand-out things in this game is the creativity of the abilities.  Most games will have a spin attack and some buff moves for a sword class, but instead you get a variety of flying blades, explosions, and other amazing attacks.  The artstyle is fresh and the music never gets old.  Cosmetics are quite different compared to most games, and are worth the money if one would want to spend it.  Oh yeah, and by the way,  this game is not pay to win.  Paying mostly only gets you cosmetics which don't affect stats.  The combat system may just look like a skilless beat em' up game from outside, but when you get into it you realise it goes deep with mechanics and techs.  Overall, this is a masterpiece of a fighting game that should have a long life to entertain for years to come.  It just never gets old!			"

												This game its top of the list of good MMORPG's that should be played. If you wana play an MMO for the first time, this I'll deffently recomend. great overall gameplay and level design is well done, tons of classes that are TBA and tweaking/adding new stuff to old classes, random lol moments when playing with groups, bonus dungeons, just a load of content for all to play.Pro: loads of gameplay and the worksCon: really tedious xp grinds, never play pvp its full of rage and op easy win people that has dumped tons of money into the game.Edit:aside from pvp and the pay wall *cough velder cough cough* this game is a solid pve game.I still have fun playing the game its a good team effort game when u get farther in the game, you can pay money into game to get stuff but if u just manage ur invintory it still a playable game for Free to Play people.don't pay if you don't wana, its all up to you, but if u do don't buy costumes cuz they are soooo over priced.

												Hiya! I'm uh, rather new to this whole review thing, but I'mma give it a shot anyway! Ah, Elsword. A game I've gone on and off playing constantly (Which right now I'm currently in the on stage), with characters I've grown to love such as Add, Eve, Elesis, Lu/Ciel, and so many more. To be honest, if I wrote this review when I first started playing it would be negative. Plenty of reasons why, all of which I'll go into. As you can see, though, I'm giving this game a positive review, which I will also go into! Don't worry, don't worry, TL:DR will be at the bottom. :PNow lets start with some negatives.-Let's start on matchmaking for PVP. Holy crap is this bad! Like, completely unranked level 25 goes agaisnt a S rank level 90? How's that fair? What chance do I have? I haven't even earned my first rank, yet I'm stuck against people of a rather high rank! What do I do against that? Well, besides be either Rena or Rose and spam X. (I do not hate either character by the way, I've seen skilled players for both that don't only hit X. It's just that most do the X strat.) KoG seems to have this problem of ""Let's rebalance the characters guys!"" Rather than ""Let's fix the matchmaking!"" The characters are fine! Yes, there are a few that are pretty strong, or nigh unbeatable in PVP if played well. There are characters like that in big tournament fighting games too! The big problem isn't the characters at this point! The characters have been buffed/nerfed enough for people to live! It's now the matchmaking that needs to be fixed! I'm sick of trying to get into pvp with my level 45s or such and getting stuck against S+ ranked max levels that roflstomp me in the ground. -On to one of the biggest issues of this game now, the cash shop. Holy crap is the cash shop an issue. Not only are the costumes pretty damn valuable (I mean have you seen their buffs?), but their almost necessary for PvP! Not to say you can't win without em, but they're pretty worth while, and more often than not those with a costume will beat out those without one. Plus all the buffs and boosts you get using K-Ching? It gets ridiculous. Now, I get that you can sometimes get costumes and such from the big bad board, but those get sold for like, over 100,000,000 ED each piece. For a whole set (That's being sold cheaply mind you) you need about 400,000,000/500,000,000 ED? That's kinda ridiculous! Now, I may be speaking out my booty here, I don't have a max level who gets whatever ED a max level gets, but for us lower/medium levels that seems pretty hard to reach!  Then the free costumes we get? They aren't permanent most the time! And when they are they're those pretty bad outfits, like the Steam Halloween Pumpkin hat, or the new Thanksgiving outfit you can earn. It just kinda sucks how much good stuff is in the cash shop you just can't get otherwise.- Okay, okay, I may of said that the characters weren't thaaaat bad, but I may of pushed past one little thing...Or a lot of little things. Certain characters can spam a liiittle too much honestly, or are just too hard to really do anything against. Lets see some examples! We gat Nightwatcher Rena and her endless traps! All of which she stands on so you can't combo her! And all the while she's pressing X! Then we got Rose and her auto guns! Pew pew pew! That's all there is to that! We got Blade Master and his Slicy Dicy tricks which give him super armor! Speaking of Super Armor, Infinity Blade Elsword! Not much needs to be said about that lil rascal and his endless Armor!  What about Iron Paladin and his inability to be damaged due to his damage mitigation, all while having super armor? Yeah, it can get pretty bad. However, realistically, all these strats CAN be countered or beaten out. I've not only seen it (Using super armor effectively against Nightwatcher traps, or taking advantage of the Auto Guns mana giving.) but I've also done it plenty myself! (Dodging Raven's initial slashes when he starts up his Super Armor combo leaves him pretty open for counter attacks, and IS Elsword isn't impossible to deal with against his super armor, it's just pretty damn annoying.) However IP Chung? Naw, that guys a jerk. Okay! That may not be all the negatives, but let's just move on to the more positive aspects!-The characters! Oh my god I love the characters of this game! Their personalties are so wonderful it's not even funny. Well, okay, it's a little funny at times. I think I'll only go into my favorites, I don't wanna explain the whoooole cast. So we have Add, the mentally and emotionally scarred Nasod obesessed scientist with a horrific past that drove him to the depths of madness! Then we have Elesis, the serious yet bubbly Red Haired Knight and the older sister to the games main character, Elsword! Then we have Rena, the bubbly, happy, motherly figure of the group! The personalities are all so different, and sometimes the clash rather greatly. For example, we see Aisha and Elsword bump heads plenty, and we see Add's difference in views compared to the others when he finally joins the group. The characters are just so much fun, and watching them all interact in the little quest dialogs is a lot of fun. - The combat is actually pretty dang fun honestly. Yes, it can get repetitive, but so can anything really if you do it enough. It's all about taking it in strides and not just over saturating yourself to the point you feel sick of it. The combat is pretty easy to grasp. Arrow keys to move, Z and X to attack, A S D C to use abilities (With added QWER if you get the medal thing), and different attacks depending on your motion, from running to jumping to double jumping. However, to actually be good at the game? That takes a lot of practice. The combos can get pretty intense honestly, and learning how to string different attack patterns into a long running combo is both challenging and pretty satisfying. It takes practice and work, just like any other game that you wanna be good at.- The job change system is absolutely wonderful. I know this isn't the only game to have it, but none the less in this game particularly it's beautiful. Each character has a choice between 3 jobs  (Besides Rose who has 4) which then get a second job change to a more advanced version. Like Add goes into Time Trace at level 15 which upgrades to Diabolic Esper at 35, or Rose goes into Bloodia at 15 which then turns to Crimson Rose at 35. Of course not at those levels, unless you buy the cash shop items, since you gotta do quests to reach them. The reason this is so wonderful though is for one simple fact. Each job change technically has its own personality, even if the lines don't fully change. Like Grand Master Elesis is technically one of the lead knights of the Red Knights. Meanwhile, Crimson Avenger led the Red Knights into an ambush that led to them being killed and her being corrupted by Dark El to survive. While GrM is far more bubbly yet serious, CrA is far more dark and agressive.  I think that makes the characters more interesting, simply because you see how they do/react in different situations.Okay, that really wasn't everything, either good or bad, about Elsword. It's just that I write a lot, as you saw, so I didn't have room. So, for TL:DR Negatives are really the PVP matchmaking, some character issues and the Cash shop, while the Positives are the Character personalities, the story, and the combat. Honestly, I do recommend this game. I think it's wondeful, it just has plenty of issues that need to be worked out or changed. I don't think it's for everyone of course. If you want to be competitive without spending a dime then you got a lot of work cut out for you, but if you just wanna be a casual player who doesn't care too much (like me) or you wanna see interesting characters interact, then this game can provide a lot of fun and can be one great time killer. So this game gets a thumps up from me!			"

												Ok I don't really know how much time i have clocked on the steam version but I played this before it was on steam and I must say the game is enjoyable. I played Elsword with friends and guildies when we were bored and over time we quit the game for one main reason. Pay to Win.The game is a fun game. It is a good side scroller and always makes me want to go back but.... IT'S A TRAP!!Pros:+Good Graphics and Animations on skills+Good Characters with Good Backgrounds+Decent Storyish and Fun people+good System and overall Good gameCons:-Pay-2-win Gear-Pay-2-win Pvp-Pay-2-win Life-Pay-2-Win GAME!!The storage, the bank, Pvp....  EVERYTHING is Pay to win. Want extra stuff? Buy it or else you will never have it. This is coming from someone who has played since the release of almost all the characters and extra Advancements. Eventhough it is pay to win it is not a bad game in the slightest but the pay to win aspect kills me. Though at one point in the game i had to delete characters to try one of the New Characters before I had to be more slots after 3 characters were made but when i get in there and I can't even PvP because of the pay to win. Nobody wants to run late game because you don't way to win.Other then that, enjoy the game. I don't recommend it but still. Enjoy it. Enjoy wasting $$$ on a Side scroller that i doubt will keep you on the same character more then 1 year or even in the game. Enjoy the Hole in your Pocket and the Emptiness in your heart after you know you have spent money on this Pay-2-WIN sack of garbage.I F*CKING HATE PAY TO WIN! THE GREEDY C*NTS!  "

												So I will try to not sugarcoat it - Like many games from Nexon Korea, this game require sooo much cash to play if you want to win at stuff like pvp and everything.. The costumes usually come in sets, which allow you to gain additional stats with more pieces of the outfit.. However, not all of the pieces might be appealing on your chosen character so you will probably end up mix and matching outfits to make your character more appealing.. I mean you you are trying to prettify your character to make it unique as compared to all of the other similar characters. But if looks don't matter go ahead and spend the money.. Unlike other Nexon Korea game, say maplestory, every equippable item has the option to buy permanent costume pieces, much in the way that Vindictus (Mabinogi Heroes) does, with the expirable version costing less based on duration.

												This is a pretty good game for an anime RPG, It's has a colourful design, lovable characters and it's overall fun. sometimes your inventory slots can be full the more you progress through the game and you would need to pay 'Ka-Ching' (the online currency in the game) to unlock more spaces. But thats not the main use of Ka-Ching though, you can buy costumes and stuff to make your character unique, and you don't just have 1, you can have up to 3 or more slots by default and you can expand the number of slots depending if you are willing to pay a tiny amount of money to gain an extra character slot. (which I did, because I wanted to try out all the characters)Quests can sometimes be repetitive, but if you have friends or party members to do dungeons with you, then it should be a walk in the park. It's not hard to play, the turtorial is very clear and the quests are simple, so there is nothing to worry to get used to playing this game.I really do enjoy this game overall, the only flaw it has that it limits you for inventory slots which can sometimes be annoying since you have to sell some stuff to get more room, I'm not too bothered since the stuff I sell are low level items.But don't be discouraged to play this game, it is free-to-play game after all and you can play through the game happily without spending a single penny like I did.

But, you should only play this game if you are wiling to spend 100s of dollars and 100s of hours into it. I know most people can agree with me in that playing dungeons over and over again can get quite boring. On top of that, in order to get any almost 80% of the items you need the ""K-Ching"" which is impossible to obtain without spending real money. And as far as i see, there are imbalance within the game everywhere.			"

												This game. Haha, I've put in so many hours... So much money, and I keep telling myself I don't have to, and yet I still do. You don't have to pay money, but it is worth it in the end becaue well... IN A WAY, it's one of those pay to win type of games. Pros:  Access to ALL characters Each character has something special about them, I LOVE the variety of skills with the different classes as well.  FUN, You don't get bored. Cons: When they give you a free lvl up to 35 for a certain character during special events, people using the new character will RAID pvp and it gets a little annoying.  You have to pay a lot to keep certain items from the item mall for 30 days, so if you're going to buy an outfit or a boost, just buy the items permanent.  Repeating a certain dungeon more than 6x can be a little annoying. (To complete certain quests) "

												I played this game since it first came out. I tried to love this game, but I couldn't. I came back to it recently and the game has changed a lot since the last updates. The skill points have been removed, making skills much more balanced and easier to manage, dungeons have been made shorter and easier, allied npcs have been added to replace missing players in dungeons, most of what prevented me to enjoy this game has been fixed. The only thing left that I hate is that it's still a bit pay to win with slow leveling up and overpriced items.			"

												I recommend this game for several reasons.1) If you love to do combos in games you can figure out what combos are good for you.2) Also if you just want to play with friends and just play together you can dungeons in regions.3) If your a competive person you can do PVPs and use combos that are best for you.4) If you just want to play want to train with friends you can set up a lobby and just train with your friends in sparring.5) You also can create guilds and earn guild points to level up your guild and make your guild stronger.6) There are different characters you can choose from and each character has there own job class you can choose from. There are 3 job class you can choose for each character (Not including Ara Haan) and those job class enhances your abilities.7) Also there are events you can do and they can get you new equipment and help enhance some of your skills in your skill tree.

												Before I had Steam about a year ago I started playing this game. At first the prostpect of ""Living in my own Anime,"" was more than enough to get me to download and make an account. At first it was intresting, the story line was great, the attacks were decent, the graphics nice. I kinda got bored of it though (or busy, either one) and put it aside. When I found it on Steam (new laptop yay) I was greeted with memories of playing and having a lot of fun. So I downloaded it again, logged into my old account and started playing. It was not the game I remember. I was greeted with a lot of bugs and the servers were so crouded that every 2 minutes there was a lag spike. And no it's not cause I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, I actually have a very good one, better than most of my friends. The layout of the sites and the options was like they just threw everything together and it made my eyes hurt looking at it. I tried to push through and hope that maybe I would get the hang of it but to no avail. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they make everything cleaner and less frenzied. And switch controls to WASD. 3/10Characters:+Story:+Graphics:+Layout:-Controls:-Gameplay:-Multiplayer:-Overall Enjoyment:- "

												Elsword is an amazing game to play with friends and family, game is pretty fast paced and has a more in depth combo system than it may seem with two basic attack keys and 4 or so active skill keys. But I do not reccomend this version... while it may say I've been playing the game for 53 hours, I should note I first started playing Elsword as far back as Closed Beta for NA.The problem with this version of Elsword is being it has slowly creeped from something you didn't need to cash to play, into something where it seems your credit card is becoming more and more of a vital tool to keep up, speccialy if you wish to remotely even buy anything in the market that's been inflated to a point any in-game ED(Gold) you get will only really be spent on NPC services.The host as well hasn't proved shy of converting free features into cash features. Skill Notes for example have been converted into a mostly cash feature, they improve skills you can learn in some way or another. But unelss you wish to get a skill note for a lousy active skill nobody chooses for very good reasons. Due to how the skill trees work in this game, you often won't even pick up the worse skill in a choice since picking Skill X will lock Skill Y entirely, making many if not all quest earned skill notes left unused. (If you plan to play the Korea version, this point is null as skill notes are a mob drop over there.)And then going back onto the economy... an in-game gamble box will give cash players many of what they'll need.. and more. So don't expect to be able to sell your rarer drops to them except for Secret Dungeon drops. This is because the gamble box gives them much more of the same items you can find in-game form mob drops... without the grind. This has resulted in an in-game economy where only cashers can trade with cashers and very few if any F2Ps can actually buy anything of note worth, the aforementioend skill notes bought with KC can be traded after being bought... but the ED to KC rate will make it far too much ingame gold for one out of 6 skill note slots..While I do enjoy the game itself as well... a game mechanics wise and as a fun arcadey co-op beat em' up, I have to advise players to stay away from Elsword NA. Look into other servers instead, I'ms ure if you google a bit you can discover many other servers of which may be a far superior alternative.			"

												This game is made for people who can afford paying high prices por clothes, skills and power, but to be honest, even if you don't buy anything is a game where you can spend HOURS because you have to complete quests, go through a story (every character has a different one and you can have them all!) you can buy some items, you need to make experience to reach a new level... oh and also, all on this game is so damn cute! <3 But anyway, is a great game, it's free...what else I have to say?

												This game is so much fun, I was playin the the non steam version but the chars n account are sync with the Steam also.I started playin this game 2 years ago, n its still fun until now. I even made it to rank A with BM when I was lvl 42 at 2012. Tat stats was rare breed in tat time but now rank A lvl 42 is meh :/.why I not recommend this game is cuz if u live in Australia dont bother to play it, so much high ping, its hard if u on PvP.sadly this server is NA.if I could I want this game's server availabe in Australia too, so tat Australian Elsword's player can play fairly in PvP. honestly EVERYTIME in PvP I take the potions first but the opponents ALWAYS get it!!so not fair. :/its hard for me too to leave this game behind )):			"

												Stamina system: I can see why they would put this is but I believe people should be able to play as much as they want.Quick slots: Having to pay for quick slots set b is absolutely unreasonable Micro purchase overload: 1) paying money to get k-ching so you can buy good potions since the others do not heal enough2) Fossil and ice burners are useless it's costs k-ching to buy them to have a slim chance of getting something good.3) items cost more than they're worth to buy them permanently and not temporary.4) Player market has idiots that sell items for astronomic prices.5) Ed (the game currency not the paid currency) is worthless since anything good is premium currency6) It's almost as if the game punishes you for being in a party7) it's $100 for 10,000 k-ching use your money on something else. steam has a lot of good games that can give you hours of fun for a cheaper price and better graphics.It's not that the game is bad because it isn't however the Greed of the makers has ruined it, some stuff like the premium shop is understandable but everything costing money it's disgusting. they don't care about their community they just want your money it seems and it's a sad thing because the game could do so much better if they were more humble and connected to their fan base and community. Not even facebook games have so many micro payments. What the game could and should be Game: 8/10What it is Game 3/10			"

												Elsword is sort of like a 3D Maple Story in it's own way. So if you enjoyed that, you might like this.From the begining it can get qutie repititve really fast. It's not like most MMOs where you have an abundance of quests to do, rather, you only get a few quests per level. This can get pretty frustrating past level 40, as it forces you to either dungeon grind or field grind (Fields are areas with monsters that you can do repeat quests over and over. It's very stamina efficenet on weekdays, and gives a fair amount of xp.) Ereda Island is also a nice alternative if you're looking for PVE mixed with PVP. It's stamina efficent and it gives good exp.This game does have a stamina system. When you run out of stamina, you can no longer dungeon or gain exp from monsters in field. While most would be turned off by this, I personally don't find myself ever running out of stamina. This might be because I enjoy playing plenty of characters though, so I switch often. On weekends, stamina is unlimited. I can't really think of many things that are bad about Elsword, persay. Some would call it pay2win, due to the only way you can aquire costumes and such is through the cash shop. Plenty of players are able to play with no trouble and never spend a dime on the game. I have personally cashed, but I do remember what it was like not to cash as well. Not being able to cash limits some things, but I wouldn't say by much. You could also buy KC (The cash shop currency) from other players, but our economy is quite terrible right now so that may not be an option. Whether you cash or not does not limit your ability though, and those who think like that are silly. I think PVP is the one reason why I think this game is great. The combo system and how everything works together is very interesting. Unfortunately, many people are quite rude in PVP and those who are considered the top players have a large ego. Prepare for the salt if you decide to PVP. (I do not recommend PVPing before at LEAST 45 if you decide to, due to level differences. If you choose to PVP before then is at your own risk.)http://elwiki.net/ is a great place for game information if you're looking to have questions answered. You can always try the game's forums as well. People are usually kind there, just be careful on how you word things.			"

												if you are not american don't even bother PvPing in arena , you will see people lagging alot and telling you live on the woods.The game is a bit repetitive(dungeons) and grindy(fields). Each character has from 2 to 3 paths to choose,being each very diferent and unique.The Economy of the game is ♥♥♥♥ed up, people selling pieces from costumes for 1billion gold ingame(item mall items)tho there are people that lower prices and are kind(very rare to see. usually people are just greedy with trades on market.)Like i said this elsword client on steam is on American  server and its avaiable to every reagion and everyone can download it from steam. so European players like my tend to see others lagging alot on this game and others see us lagging (only happens to me on PvP) so i only play this game for PvE and i uninstal it very often. (wich is very sad.)Yes there is another Version for EU players, but ive been here for around 3 years , im not going to start allover again ''just'' for this game.so yes i recomend this game if you like anime RPGs , dungeon runner, 2D game (and if you live on USA.) if you don't , then go to EU server while you still can.

												(Has actually played more then 10,000 hours, since the beginning. Its just the steam version is werid for me, but i wont mention this issue, as i know its a me-thing. Though if your intrested, let me know!-Kuma)Oooh where to start. Well,it plays decently even though it uses arrow keys, some songs are great in the game, and the RP community are nice people. But trust me, the negatives Outwheigh the positives.The community,outside RP, Is TERIBBLE. JUST AWFUL. Sea salt levels of bad. They are so awful, there rude, they allways complain about everything, And dont get me started on the microphone chat. Essentially, its a all-channels chat that you have to buy microphones with currency that you have to buy to talk in it. Thats all you wanna know, trust me.The combat is broken, and dont get me started on PVP. Its so bad that for these past 2 years ive ONLY rped.Alot of the dungeons are not memorable, and not good music in alot. Although when they do music right, they do it RIGHT. The bosses arent very memorable either.The voice actors are..Mostly actually pretty decent. Mostly.Rose is proably the best character story&emotions wise, and with zero, shes pretty comical in cutscenes, but shes the absolute worst in fighting wise.Luciel is broken, and has the best backstory&chemestry with her partner, Lu. Keep in mind zero does not fight, unless in a skill, unlike LuCiel. I dont Spar/Arena/Dungeon anymore, so i cant tell you specifics on now shes broken, but trust me, she is.And its sorta free-to-pay? See, unless you have AMAZING armor, you cant stand a chance. You will have to spend months to get good armor.And finally, the actual story. Mcguffin magical energy called el is in everything and is kinda the ONLY DRIVING POINT OF THE VILLANS,theres fanservice..Each town has its own story, and most are okay. Although Elders is proably the weakest.And thats as not-spoilery as i can get, folks. Also demons because...Anime,i unno.BUT, all things considered, i give this game a 5.5/10. I stay because of the friends i made there,since ive been playing for years, i cant just abandon them. You can give it a shot, though it might not be your thing, or you could get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the community,sparring,and the things i listed. I wish i could give a meh rating, but since i cant, Yes for now. (Also trandesence is way OP, Get it if you wanna stand a chance in spar. Because of this, i make my rating a No.)Note:Heres a little thing about Ain. I like him. Hes relatively okay, i like him as a character, i like how different his job classes make him, and i love how he fights. This wont change the score, but he is my faviorte character all around.			"

The most important part is that, in my opinion, the game is not p2w.  This is very important for me.  Maybe one or two items in the cash shop give a slight advantage but thats about it.  The cosmetics are nice.  Oh and Chung, the gun toting character with a huge cannon, is awesome :3			"

You have to deal with the korea getting all the good stuff including better economy, quicker release dates, and better EXP table. The admins dont really care about the community. When you post suggestions to make the game better I get crap like this ""we will take it under consideration"" but they dont do anything for anyone. I bet atleast 80% of the community tried to make a suggestion and they get the same BS all the time. Nothing is balanced in this game and there is no one there to fix it >->			"

												A relitively fun game to play at first, but it quickly became boring for me. It is really just a button mashing game, where you can go through quests on ""very hard"" mode if you are even 1 level above the requirement. What really aggrieved me about this game, was the fact that the quests overlapped in such a way that you would have to go through a quest area about 3-4 times in order to complete it fully. I didn't even finish the game because it got so repetitive. Other than that though, i thought that they could have had more ""fashion"" items drop for characters to individualize their player.			"

												Graphics are ugly, it tries to have a manga type art style but it just looks terrible. Play Rusty Hearts instead. This doesn't work with a controller, the UI is awkward as hell, half the game you'll spend in with your camera zoomed in right in your characters face. So even if the game did look good you wouldn't be able to tell. The combat isn't very fluid, not much else to say. The game would be a lot more interesting if it was actually 2D instead of the fake 3D side scroller style. Rusty Hearts is just like this but essentially better in every way. Pass on it.			"

												You need to play it yourself to see what it's all about, and when something is free, give me one excuse why you shouldn't at least give it a shot.A great MMO and a great Beat-em' Up merged into one neat title which can be a little heavy on your wallet at times but is still an overall great experience. At the time of writing I've put 100+ hours into 3 characters, and it was mostly worth it. A few frustrations keep this from being a 10/10 game but it's certainly worthy of at least an 8. Great combat mechanics, fun combos, good anime-style visuals, passable story. lots of variety and lots of fun and laughs. Highly recommend.			"

It is F2P with an option to buy special items in game, but unlike most F2P games, it is not pay to win. Updates are always regular since they happen every 2 weeks. If you play this game the best thing I can recommend is to make lots of friends. While it is fun playing alone, the experience you get from playing with friends is much better. Give it it try. It's free so what do you have to lose? ^-^			"

Its a game where if your're looking for something new to try out then this will be the option. Takes time to get some of the combos down, and when its done its really fun to run up and keep other players in a constant loop of shame they can't escape from!

												I've played this game over a small handful of years and it's a game that one can have fun, but it can get really repetitive after a while. There is newer jobs throughout the times I've played the game, but they seem to throw a veil over the previous classes. (Do disregard the hours. I've played for a while mostly on the non-steam client.)= - = - = Positives = - = - =Fun with Friends:Honestly, this game can give several hours of banter and being idiots on the game. I can't normally play this game without others playing it, especially after a while of playing. Stamnia Bar:While this may limit progress, it does give you a good steady progress of leveling and not overdoing it. I've played games for 10+ hours in a row because stamnia bars weren't included or implemented and end up blowing my entire day on a game. There is ways around it with events or the cash shop, but you don't have to push it. You'll normally spend up to 3 to 4 hours, at most, straight with grinding before you'll run out.Consistent Events:This is the only thing that curttails the whole cash cow complex of this game. You need to cash in on these events, especially if they give out some lucrative items (like Stamnia Potions or Cash Shop Gear) throughout the duration. There is hardly any time where they don't have less than two events running at the same time.= - = - = Negatives = - = - =Cash Cow / Pay-2-Win Complex:This feature right here can kill a game, especially when it's tied into the game to hinder progress towards end game content. Sure, the clothes may seem nice, but they come with stats and without those--you'll be spending countless hours trying to get around it. This has been a problem for not a few months, but years actually with little-to-no resolution.  Alongside, some of the things in the shop, especially with the gear, Class Rebalancing Needed:Many of the newer classes would end up being the trend, especially when someone's been apart of the game for a while. Even if a nerf comes across, it takes many weeks to months before they actually resolve the overpowered class with a patch. I can't play some of my classes now, because they just fall off compared to newer classes.Consistent Repetitiveness:For the majority of the game, all you do is run into dungeons, kill things, and there you go. You can go out into the field and kill field bosses and trash mobs, but they don't give essential experience unlike what dungeons give you. This was a main killer of the game's attention towards me and end up quitting for weeks to months at an end.= - = - = Verdict = - = - =I have to get it a negative rating barely because this game has hardly ever kept my attention for more than a week. Don't get me wrong, this game is fun and all--yet, there's many mechanics in the game that either gets boring really quick or requires you to dump real-life cash to achieve end-game status. If you're a person that doesn't mind tossing some green around to get boosted into end-game, then by all means--go ahead. However, if you're a person that's barely making it paycheck-to-paycheck or don't have the money to toss around, then I highly don't recommend this game without putting limitations on purchasing things.

												Absolutely unacceptable basic functionality failures.First, there is no way to access any options menu, so the game starts windowed in such a small resolution as to render text almost illegible, and you are forced to select character/class in this situation.Second, the game starts with no sound whatsoever. Third, you cannot access options to rectify either until the first ""town"". This was discovered through Internet searches.Fourth, the second enemy I came across stopped taking damage, and the game would not let me progress to said town.Finally, because I could not access any settings or menus because the game would not let me progress to the first town to do so, I had no way of exiting the game. The game doesn't have a dedicated program name in Task Manager, and the actual game process refused to close. Alt-F4 also failed to work. I had to look up how to exit the game, and the ""solution"" was to disable my NIC card until the game lost connection with the server and auto-terminated.Just... Holy crap, KOG, you failed on just about every level. Congratulations, not only do I not care if the game is enjoyable after all this, the basic functionality of your program was more akin to a malware popup. Just bloody awful.			"

												Well, for starting, I hate to see all that players out there that are spamming bad reviews. Elsword is a good game, it has a good concept of ARPG. About balancing, nerfs and buffs come later to NA but that doesn't mean you won't be able to win a PvP, all classes have a general balance. It has a nice cashshop, and that doesn't mean It's P2W, it's completely F2P, you can have a nice gaming experience with Elsword without spending a penny. It has an incredible array of character customization. This game brings fresh air, it has a good combo system which allows you to do cool combos. For that RPG lovers, it has a interesting backstory. Finally, it's always filled with events. 9/10			"

												I was actually very surprised by this game. It was free so I decided to try it, and i have to say the gameplay was very pleasing. The artstyle was also a factor, it's not fancy, but it gives the world a very quaint charm that makes you want to come back.The different classes and the class evolution system is pretty solid, and each class branch certainly fills in it's own unique role. With six base classes and with 3 possible branches for each one, there is almost certainly a class suited to your style of play.The combo system isn't too hard to master, and stringing together hit after hit feels very satisfying. Each class's skills are also very diverse and different from another, adding a whole new level of gameplay to master with each class.In conclusion, I am very glad that i discovered this little gem of a game. It was very fun to play.The only drawbacks I can see is that after a while the game can feel kind of boring, and the art, while quaint, feels a bit too cute at times for my taste.			"

												Graphics are ugly, it tries to have a manga type art style but it just looks terrible. Play Rusty Hearts instead. This doesn't work with a controller, the UI is awkward as hell, half the game you'll spend in with your camera zoomed in right in your characters face. So even if the game did look good you wouldn't be able to tell. The combat isn't very fluid, not much else to say. The game would be a lot more interesting if it was actually 2D instead of the fake 3D side scroller style. Rusty Hearts is just like this but essentially better in every way. Pass on it.			"

												I like this game and all, but as most people say, it's P2W and certian characters in arena are stupidly OP, I will elaborate on this.""It's a free to play game why would you spend money on it?""That's because you can buy certian equipment from the Cash Store that gives you boosts in stats. This gives people many advantages in PVP as people who are willing to pay can just wreck others who don't have the stat boosts from the in game purchases.Now, PVP.Before you do PVP you will want to learn combos as if you knock down your opponent you cannot damage them but here is the thing.There are certian classes (Wind Sneaker I'm looking at you) who can just spam the EXACT SAME THING OVER AND OVER. This means you are prone to massive damage while you just sit there, spamming all of your motion keys, trying to move the ♥♥♥♥ out of the way.""But you can mana break to get out of it.""Yes, you can mana break but that requires (you guessed it) mana to use and that is one of your most dependant source for tons of damage during PVP.Also the matching in PVP is stupid.Right now I'm a lv 52 Yama Raja, expecting a challenge in PVP.Nope.I get paired against lv 15 - 30 people.But, even though I get paired against them, there are certian classes that just dominate the arena, here are some examples:Crimson AvengerDiabolical Esper (and all of Add's classes for christ's sake he's just OP in general)AsuraWind SneakerDeadly ChaserIf you get stuck in one of their combos YOU ARE DEADJust mana break♥♥♥♥ YOUI will admit, I do enjoy this game to a certian extent, but it requires a LOT of grinding to get the best items.Did I mention how much you have to grind?You have to grind alot.For example, with Yama Raja's.You need to kill this one boss 4 times.And another one 3 times.And those stages are looooooooooooooooooong.Then, after that, you need to collect 100 drops from this group of monster.""That isn't hard just kill 100 of them.""They don't even drop 100% of the time...In short, this game is unbalanced in some aspects and you have to either:1. Grind to get good items2. Buy good itemsWhich one do you think is easier?			"

Then I started PVPing and this second battle I had I got upset after bad community language and they were level 80 plus, too high for me to fight against.So to some it up it's slow for dungeons when waiting for players to join you, the community in PVP is harsh and doesn't give the right level of players to battle against in PVP equality.

												JUST SAVE YOURSELF BY NOT PLAYING THIS GAMEIts completely broken and is destinied to be shut down very soon. Tho the dev team said to the players they wont shut down the game, but they are not the one holding the red button. Nexon just shut down one of their game because it has too low popularity and bring insuficient income.If you are not convincing, watch this video before downloading the game.

												I just came back to play this game again. For the dungeons I had to wait for the players for a while, there is hardly anyone there who wants to do Very hard mode when I was playing.  Then I started PVPing and this second battle I had I got upset after bad community language and they were level 80 plus, too high for me to fight against.So to some it up it's slow for dungeons when waiting for players to join you, the community in PVP is harsh and doesn't give the right level of players to battle against in PVP equality.  Don't recommend it.			"

												Cons: -Game requires you to buy extra slots if you want to have a wide veriaty of inventory space, skills during dungeons, quick use items, and storage space (bank). -The game is based around a sort of time limit of play per character wich is measured by the stamana bar at the bottom right of the screen. Granted if you play dungeons with other players, the bar decreases at a much slower rate. Once depleted you cannot access dungeons, but you can still go around in the hub world and grind at the fields against generic enemies and the occasional field boss that appears about every 10-20 min if people in the feild are defeating the generic enemies. -Outfits....you can forget about full custimization freedom, most of the awesome stuff is in the store (as in IRL cash). Lvling up after lvl 34 starts to drag so be ready to take on side quests or grind at the fields. -Lastly, you will be given a quest to change job class when you reach the appropiate lvl. this isnt usually a problem, but the tick is that when you take on the second job class you will be asked to obtain a certain amount of an item that, from what ive seen, has a drop rate of about 5-8%. Depending on the character and job class path taken, you will be asked to find an item in the varrying amounts of 10-100 (research your character if you have the time and want to put in the effort for them).Pros: -Anime style 2d beatem up that can provide hours of enjoyment. Sure the cons may look bad, but ive had this game for two years and recently linked it with steam.-While you dont have full customization freedom, you have the oppertunity to find armor that looks different and cooler compared to the generic drops. They are harder to get, but get the full set and you will look cool AND get stat bonuses.-Events are frequent and sometimes give you the option of obtaining and keeping an item that will be available only within that time period. first you obtain a temperary version then engage event quests to make the item permanent. Keep an eye on the news page as this will alert you to anything of the sort and go for it as soon as you see an event like so. Usually if an event goes on and offers an outfit or costume of some type with the added oppertunity to make it permanent, it will require you to complete and event quest nearly the entire month/week/etc in order to obtain the sufficiant quest rewards to do so, but in the end its worth it, because you didnt pay a thing.-while it costs IRL money to obtain expansion to your inventory and of the like, you will not need it. What you have is enough unless you are a horder, in which case you may need some help.-P2W (Pay-to-Win)? Nope. While you can buy items in the shop, you can obtain gear just as equal or better through your hard work. Accessory drops are also available in most dungeons (at an unbeliveable drop rate for some) that will give you stats boosts and give your character some added cosmetic look.			"

												i've been playing for the first few days and yes, i have a gripe or two about it. for free to play, its hard to progress when  content and extra storage and slot space being locked. altho the sad alternative is to dismantle or sell off in hopes to create a stronger set of weapons and armor. i wish that there were some character customization. i am not a fan of everyone looking like everyone else. it is kinda sad that it takes real money to purchase something to break the mold and stand out and that too is a double-edged sword. anyone feels like going 2d minus player vs player mode, may i suggest Gaia online's  ZOMG?

												Elsword is indeed very repetative with many dungeons and quest that can often cause thge player to have frustraitions while playing the game. That however should be no reason to not try this game. Besides being repetative Elsword has plenty of features in game to make the game more fun and also entertaining. One Feature is character customization. The game has many In-Game shops where you can buy accessories and diffrent types of armor for your character. If thats not not enough the game also has a cash shop where you can buy many kinds of costumes  and items that give you mounts and many peices of gear that helps you make many diffrent character customizations. Another two features is pvp and the skill tree. Elsword has a solid base for pvp that allows you to create your own combinations of combos that can knock your opponent down with lightning ast attks to attking your enemy while their in the air with swift skills or slashes from the characters blade. with many skills and combinations to chose from the pvp has a uniqueness of its own. For players that want to get married in game there is a marriage system. The marriage sytem is broken into 4 steps. first you need to find the person you want your character to marry. afterwards you need to buy the couples ring from the cash shop (The item can only be found in the CashShop alone).once you give the ring to the person you want to marry you must wait 3 days (this time can be used to get to know eachother better ). when the time is up you can buy the marriage pakage which will have a certain number of invatations you can send to your friends and a item for using one of the chappels in the game. The final feature i'm going to be speaking of is the world aspect of the game since with all due respect i don't want to waste any more of peoples time.the world aspect may be that it is a side-scroller game but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything for you to do. this multiplayer game will have you in a single player instance to start with in the beginning but there is more to it. after that one instance you are sent into the open world. you can meet many people, make friends, even for you people that struggle with the dungeons or quest there is a large community of people to help you get through the game.

												Here we are, yet another review on this game. I'm not gonna go so deep into things but I'll make this enough to know what's going on.Been playing this for 2 years before I joined Steam and it used to be a fun game, but went downhill ever since CBS was released. There's been less and less balance between the characters since then and it's nearing a breaking point. to avoid most of the headache, don't do PvP. You won't be able to get a few items by avoiding it, but it's all mainly for looks anyway.Dungeons to me are fine at first, but get really tedious after a while because it's the same tactic. Beat the crap out of everything as fast as possible, rinse, repeat. Very few bosses either need a strategy or force you to divert your attention. They have fixed the leveling issue a bit with the new random missions, but it's still a long grind in order to hit the level cap, which needs to be done if you wanna be as powerful as possible.Speaking of power, this game is free to play, but is so Cash Shop geared that you can put tons of money into it and become nearly unbeatable. There's also players that pride themselves on this stuff, so that's even more fun removed from the game and the reason why no one really does another thing called Ereda Island despite there being less hackers in the game.What I do like however is very little. I like how the game looks and some of the gameplay, but it's (again) overshadowed by the pay to win crap and lack of balance. The soundtrack isn't bad, but hearing it after a while, you may just mute it and get your own music. Most impressive looking places are the Hunting Fields and trust me, you'll see a lot of them given the grinding issue. I do like how the characters are designed too, along with the various looks you can give them even without putting a single cent into the game.So, what do I think overall? It's decent if you don't mind the grinding and don't play PvP. But it's gone downhill so much that this is mainly to kill time or play dress-up. You can make friends, but you WILL make enemies too given the community. And in game crap is expensive, but smart players can get around that. All in all, it's a good idea gone bad and I can't really recommend it. Trust me, there's a lot more negative things I can mention about this game that I didn't put in...			"

You guys just haven't played logn enough to get the things that they offer.. I have about 7 level 50+ players. a level 70 and others all withotu payign a single cent.. Pvp is still a bit op and annoying, highest rank was rank S.. I've played this game for about 2 years and i'm fine without paying anything. Do the events they give and you'll actually get things.

												dont be fooled by my hours this game is pretty much pay to win many of my friend quit this game because it require money to fully enjoy the game.Ice burners and Icy Fossils are so stupid, you wouldnt get a thing its better playing kr version since u have high chance getting ib pieces. cash accesory are useless it does give stats but so useless. this game is not f2P more like Pay to play. I rather play kritika online and vindictus and DFO since this game require so much money to play just to be overpowered. peeps if you think this is good game nope, Play those game i recommended instead of this. if only KOG is not greedy and make everything easier and sell items cheap im and lot of free stuff im pretty sure you have more players than now. no wonder grandchase close because of everything was expensive.

												All these people whining about ""paying to win"" probably never stayed for the events that KoG keeps putting out, and why are people complaining about the unbalanced PvP when there is so much more to the game? No peripheral vision for these things whatsoever.Costumes and extra skill slots and maybe even some extra mana or anything for in-game benefit are all purchased at someone's own conscious decision, and to everyone bashing the game just because they can't get those things, you don't need them. KoG isn't innocent in this either, they're making all kinds of appealing cash items available to us, especially costumes and summons, but all of this is optional, and it does not make or break gameplay. The game itself is not ""pay-to-win"" at all, and while in PvP, rings and such give an advantage, but it's mostly skill that people develop as they play.Dungeon play is great with multiple players, and four skills usually do one enough, and people complaining about the B slot just want to have more skills to use, (when there are plenty of bread-and-butter combos and skills to use) and as I said earlier, events exist for just that. The past few events had quests that earned you a 15-day slot B medal, and it's hard to keep throwing jabs at the game after you realize how generous they're being.This is a very well developed game and it has a good team working on it still. They constantly put out new events and updates that keep the game fresh, and it makes for a broad range of things to do when you get tired of doing one thing. Basically, unless you play for 12 hours a day to grind experience points, the game will always be very fun every time you play.			"

												you know, there are just so many things that are just wrong with this game. Charachters are underpowered, charachters are overpowered, pvp is completely broken, and the entire game is pay to win. The sheer amount of level grinding is ridiculous, some of the bosses are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, mounts are op, and dont even get me started on fluorite orbs...Playing this game without a wallet is literally impossible, and makes the game infinitely harder. You miss out on pets, inventory expansions, extra skill trees, extended quick slots, and also the really important ones such as SKILL SLOT B, SKILL NOTES, RING OF FURY (which is the peak of pay to win in Elsword) and of course, benefits from costumes.If you take a few steps back, and look at all of the facts, this game is a pile of crap, But... Why do I love it so much?			"

												*takes a single step**everyone lags*gg best game ever 10/10EditNot only that, the game is pay to win.The servers are becoming ♥♥♥♥♥ier with each update.The salt increases with every new character.There is no such thing as balance.If you don't spend money on the game you won't get far unless you do some absurd sidequest.The events are trash, mostly just a thing where you have to be online every day to get a little accessory or something like that.(Miss one day and goodbye to your prize)Arena is not evenly matched.The dungeons are too easy and usually require you to grind them for no reason. (normal, hard, very hard...sometimes more than once)Admins are trash.Cringe playerbase.Overall cash cow that is forcefully pay to win or be a noobI've had nearly a thousand hours on this game only for joining spar rooms and ♥♥♥♥ing around with people but in gameplay I have many level 70's with one 75 so I've had quite a bit of experience here.This game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't get it.

The world has always been to cluttered. Game play is 10/10 for a 2D side scroller beat them up. Running the game is very poor. I've played it for 3 years and lost so many accounts out of server and game compications. Like never patching correctly.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It's kind of mind numbing. You don't really need to do an strategizing, mostly button mashing. I currently have 2 characters, Eve and Ara and each have their own little perks. It is a bit annoying that you have to do the same dungeon 3-6 times in a row in order to complete certain missions. The Arena matching is a bit unfair. A level 10 can go against a level 30. I think that they should have it where there's only a 5 level difference (i.e. level 10 against level 15 or 5). Other than that it's fun, addicting and you even get your own little pet :)			"

												I am newbie in mmo's, this is the first I ever play good (because is the first my graphics card runs well). Gameplay 8/10I've been playing about 2 hours and I enjoyed a lot. It's not too hard for newbies (like me) and not too easy for experienced players. The fighting system is really simple and dynamic, it allows you to make large combos with decent variants. It is effective but playing and playing may it turns repetitive. I've played several non-mmo plataforms before and I think it's great.The exp and levelups are well balanced. There are a lot of posibilities with many skills to learn and to upgrade. The character balance it's ok, all classes have their way to fight, weakness and strenghts.The plataform system it's like any other.Graphics 9/10I have a computer without graphic card (Intel chipset) and it runs without problems, so, it's basicaly why I chose this game. It have a really low specs that I was looking for. So I can't be too much demanding. It looks very nice for me, anime 3d desing.Story 6/10Very simple history, out of emotion.Personalitazion 5/10The weak point of the game. Having a simple history it would be worth to have high-rate of perzonalitation options. You can't change your character phisically, there are just 5 classes.Muisc 9/10As a music lover, I think music is important to games. This game has great music, being a Korean game it's not surprise to have such great tracks.General 7/10I think i'ts worth to give it a try. Especially if you haven't a dedicated graphics card, because it runs pretty well with my 3100 gma Intel chipset. I like plataforms games and this is great for plataforms lovers. If you are looking to spend moderate daily time playing one mmorpg, you better look for another game, as I said it turns off the fun after 1-2 hours.			"

												Well im making another new review to not make people think this game is terrible or anything so i will go into detail as to why i dont consider this game fun anymore but it used to be. Pros: Nice game to play if you into beat em up side-scroller games.A very nice detailed storyline and each character different dialogue.Lots and lots of different costumes to wear to look cool or cute based on preferrance.Okish PvP system if your into Arena and fighting other RL players or Epic NPCs.Still coming out with new stuff to do even if its not appealing to others.Cons: Elitist people in Arena always talking trash or showboating to sound like they the best.Whiners in the game complaining about constant lag (Even in PvE and PvP.)Just lack of people wanting to have fun and take this game way too serious and another level.People spam too much with megaphones that it gets really annoying (Goes back to Con#2)Lack of players queuing endgame secret dungeons to get gear right, only way to get endgame gear is buying with ED which takes awhile to farm up.Alot of different pvpers: Runners, Strategic Runners, Spammers (Doing same actions or combo loops), Trash talkers (I get like this when people annoy me), Trollers (Always tells players to ""Git Gud"" all the time), and finally Complainers about lag (I deal with lag all the time but never once have complained but others do its sad.)Now i know my pros arent as really clear as my cons but in my personal opinion after having to deal with season 1, season 2 and season 3 arena players people are just way too elite in this game and think they are a cut above the rest and dont consider themselves try hards. If you mash on your keyboard to bunny hop (Basically make your character force down) then you in my eyes are try hards sorry to say. Also their are those that complain constantly about lag this, lag that, your a lagger! Who gives a crap dude? You act like every person on the planet has top notch internet like you if your so pro go and learn to read Korean words and learn their language and go play on their servers and quit making the NA servers so uncomfortable for casual players. But anyways end of my rant if you all who just recently returning or getting into elsword now and can ignore all the cons of this game then this is the game for u. Would i recommend this game to you? Yes and No.			"

												It quite a simple game with alot of different character selection and weapons, the art is beautiful added along with the music that creates a great experiences all together. The game mostly revolve around doing quests and leveling up, along with a few side quest for pets or material. The battling in this game is kinda boring, since the trick is to go up and attack before the enemy hits you, but they added along with it many different attack moves varying from each class. One problem is that looking good in this game is costly, since 5 dollar gets you about 600/500 credit in the game and a even a shoe cost 200 so if the developers would lower the cost a bit the game would be prefect.The game does alot of speaicl events and offers for the player, like giveaways, 2x drops, etc. In the game you are able to get marry and create guilds (with real money) and certain other things.Overall, it's a great game and I would recommend this to anybody who enjoy mmos and anime.

												There's only really one thing to say about this game: It's very fast-paced. Unlike the automatic hack-and-slash of some side-scrolling MMORPG's, Elsword requires you to manually press the buttons and connect the attacks yourself. At the beginning, it might be boring and uneventful, but as you progress through the levels, the dungeons and the towns...you'll find that things do get a 'little' harder. And while you may have to grind more and more to get to the next level, it's worth it. WORTH. You know why? The PVP.The PVP in this damn game is phenomenal, and it's what hooked me into Elsword in the first place. Yes, it might seem easy in first glance, but experiencing it for yourself brings you to a whole new world. It's fresh. Exciting. Exhilarating. And most of all...it's addicting. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm not kidding when I say: Prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥ here comes the butthurt-whenever you step into Arena 1v1 and 3v3, or sparring. It's not easy. Not at all. It's hard, and it will test you and keep pushing you beyond your limits. It pushed me beyond my limits. Consistently. Just when I thought I couldn't get any better, I did. It's so competitive yet strangely casual at the same time that it's surreal. Honestly, for me, the reason that I keep coming back to Elsword despite the grinding and the fact that things do get a little repetitive, is the PVP. So what are you waiting for? Download it now! Even if you might not like it, just keep it and PVP once in a while to feel adrenaline pumping throughout your veins. There's nothing like it.			"

												i've read that the communities of this game and grand chase arguning because they look similar. Because both characters have red headed swordsman, female elf archers, and purplehaired mages they have an excuse to scream at each other. but where the difference ends. STORY: The story is that a stone called the ""El"" were stolen by bandits and its up to the el search party to get it back. The story moves on to each village to move the story. The ""El stone"" story ends at altera when you finish the quest ""Tunring everything back to normal."" Then story goes to Feita with an demon invasion. The story ark reminds me of certain anime like fairy tail or naruto. 9.75/10CHARACTERS: There are currently 9 characters on both versions. what suprises me about them are that 3/9 characters included demons. Chung, Ara Haan, and Elesis. The character are Elsword, Rena, Aisha, Raven, Eve, Cung, Ara Haan, Elesis, and the insane Add. I like Add the most because of his backstory, gameplay, and personality (reminds me of lasercorm from smosh games). I feel mad for raven, chung, ara, and add. raven betrayed by his fellow soldiers, his fiance and friends died saving him and became a cyborg in the aftermath who u can fight in the first dungeon in altera. Chung's dad got possesed and almost died from severe injuries. ara family got slaughtered by demons and her brother became a demon (Final boss of hamel) and add family got killed (not by demons), sold in slavery and driven insane by isolation. The backstories suprises me with any way. (thank u south korea) 9.80/10GAMEPLAY: By comboing your enimies to oblivion through special/actives skills. When u reach level 15 you'll be able to choose multiple paths. 3 for elsword, rena, aisha, raven, eve, and chung. 2 for ara and elesis and currently 1 for add at the time. You will have to go through a quest line before advancing to the next class or you can spend 200 K-ching and you'll be able use new combos with the chosen class then advance to the 2nd job at level 35. either quest line or pay 400 K-ching you're pick. what i really love about elsword is he final dungeons. The final dungeons supply you EXP for you to level up and a challengin boss. There's a dungeon called henir's time and space which actually a boss rush mode. I've seen videos of player beating it with they're best time. There are also secret dungeons when u get to the level cap (70). However there is a stamina system which is spent on dungeons and hunting in the fields. when all of the stamina runs you can't dungeon untill 3:30 A.M. 9.5/10PVP: The match making..... is absolutley broken. my level 42 elsword is set with a max level elesis. you start playing PVP at level 10 its fine at that lower levels then gone to hell later. 0.01/10COMMUNITY: The only was chatting with other players is either in a guild or in the sparring rooms. 7.89/10CASH SHOP: i can't get enough with the cash shop. costumes. check. quick slot extensions. check. pet adn mounts. check. Inventory expansion. CHECK! 10/10FINAL VERDICT: I love this gams with a passion. I have over 500 hours in to this game and my highest level is a add. combo monsters to oblivion. The gamplay is good. Pvp is below average. The stamina can get annoying but who cares. 9.99/10			"

												Now this is overall a mixed review of Elsword, as it has its pros cons. I'd like the start with the cons as in my opinion, the cons should come first, (I apologize if this review isn't all that great, it's my first one haha). Okay so where to begin...The community is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the way I've experienced it. You either meet people who don't talk at all, or you meet people who do talk and are just down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s(this game as I have noticed mostly consists of kids who still think the term ""noob"" is a legit insult). The community isn't as bad if you don't mind playing with kids who age between 13-17. Now I know there are good people on this game, older or younger. I've met tons of friends on here. Just don't get your hopes up with finding people in game to group with. Oh and the North America support for Elsword is crap compared to Korea where it originated... Just saying:PThe combat can be repetitive if you find doing almost the same thing all of the time repetitive. Now I say almost because, depending on your level, things can get a little spiced up. But it's a 2d sidecroller what else is there to expect right?Those are 2 of my biggest cons, obviously the community being the big ol♥♥♥♥♥♥pile at your school's bathroom it is. I hate playing with people who don't understand that (competitive or not) games are meant to be enjoyed. Lots of kids these days don't get that, and it's quite sad to be honest...Now for the pros:D The game is fun, for me the simplisity of the game is the star of the show. It's something to just sit back and play(if you have friends who play then that really helps). It's not a difficult game unless you want it to be, such as getting into combos, pvp, (which I forgot to mention is also♥♥♥♥♥♥ and etc.The skills and moves you learn are nice and flashy, and there are plenty of classes/characters to choose from. It's overall definetly one of the better side scroller beat em' ups I've played.The verdict? This game is a good time passer and fun for simple gameplay, or another way to put it, good for casual gamers. Would I reccomend this game to others? NO because I have tried in the past and no one I have reccomended it to liked this game haha. Would I reccomend it to myself? YES... I know that's a weird way of putting it but yeah...Anywaysm I thank anyone who read through this review and hope it helps.			"

												The game's fun but don't spend too much time on it because it will get boring fast. I wouldn't recommend  on buying clothes on this game because the prices are pretty expensive considering that $20 would get you 2000 k-ching which to be honest is way to cheap for that much money.(To buy a shirt cost 300 but to make it a permadent shirt it cost double the amount so a 300 temporary shirt or a 600 permadent.) So it's really hard to just play the game for a long time after the first   week say about 2 tops for me anyway. (Another thing is Grand Chase which is basically an older version of Elsword if you guys wanna check that out although it is old so it may get boring fast people say its more fun then Elsword but you'd have to check that out for yourself)			"

												THIS REVIEW I RATE  PVP AND PVE (PLEASE READ ALL THE WAY)Okay so i played Elsword back in season 2(2013-2014) and i recently a couple months back quit the game, I mained an LK which is one of if not the most underated class in the game. PvP is the main shine of this game and at the moment it is extememly bad, Hit detection is terrible, 13 year olds saying one of these terms ""Lagger, u suck, God your bad, etc"" Character balance is not there so most of the time in pvp around A-SS Tier you will see Adds, Ara's, Luciels, and Chungs 70% of the time. PvE is fun but the best PvE feature in this game is Henir's which is basically how fast can you defeat all the bosses (Only do this when your Max Level and have the appropriate gear). People also say this game is P2W and i have to kinda disagree, In PvP i have seen people with 1 skill slot and still wreck but if you wanna be viable in PvP you kinda need to buy a skill slot b and to get the most boosts and stats out of your character then its best to get a costume and socket it. Elsword does have plenty of events that gives out free costumes but they are a pretty hefty grind.Overall if you are a PvP type of gamer then stay away from this game as it is Salty, Unbalanced, and sometimes laggy as hell. If you like PvE and PvE only Elsword is quite a fun gamePvP Rating 4/10PvE Rating 7.5/10Since it doesn't excel in both categorys that is why i say not recommended.			"

												Elsword features skill-based action gameplay combined with role-playing elements and community features typical of an MMORPG, such as guilds, chat, and item trading. I am very addicted to the game, I personally loved it! I always like these type of games, since it has that manga/anime feel to it. Their is about 6 characters at the moment, (8/29/15) and I have a lot of stuff to talk about this game, so let's get started! The story seems to be leading a good way of what is happening, there's always a good amount of sub-quests/story quests to enjoy. The one thing I loved is that, different character have a unique skill,style,class path, ect. The voice acting is pretty nice, I don't mind too much from it since it is voiced in Japanese. The Stage/environment is a 8.7/10 since it's not really perfect in my opinion, but it's nice. There are some ""Main Story Quest"" that have a cinematic cutscene after you completed it. Very nice to the story overall.Different Gameplay Mechanics,Items,Equipment,Features and other great things that make this game alive, but then there is one problem to ""Elsword"". The PvP matchup seems to be alright, but bad at the same time, because due to having to vs lvl 70's that will 1 shot you, but most of my time on PvP, it's doesn't occur too much then it use to.I know people been saying this is a ""Pay2Win"" type of game, it's been one of those typical games, but keep it clean and have fun with your friends (if your friends play it).Overall, I must rate this game a total of 9/10, remember everyone will have their own opinion.Have a wonderful day!!  \>.< / [Elsword Main Page]http://en.elswordonline.com/[Elsword Wiki Page]http://elwiki.net/w/Main_Page "

												I love this game! It is a fun action adventure style sidescroller and ""beat em' up"" type of game with great customization, sounds, graphics, and characters. Each character is unique and has there own style of play which cater to just about every fighting style you can imagine. The story of each character is well thought out and planned and the game is a real challenge when you want it to be. There are still a few bugs with starting the game and the items in the shop can make it hard for people who are not pay to win to compete, but you can overcome this handycap with skill and strategy. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes customization and action cause those are the two things that this game specializes in. Have fun and get to work on the Space and Time temple as soon as you can becasue once you have that, you can compete against anyone and fight just about any boss without too much trouble. XD See you in the game!!! :D			"

												This game is filled with fat obeise people. Ranging from Chubby to XXL. That's only 2% of the population. The next 2% are Americans, and they sometimes coincide with fat people. The next 2% are my ancestors, Filipinos. We like to overexxagerate crap, laugh at horrendous jokes, and thinks of ourselves as the best in everything just because we envy neighboring countries like Japan and China, and worship the U.S. as if every citizen is a god. Which is true. The rest are gamers. They range from Gamers who gets *****es or Gamers who gets no **tches. Im a Gamer who get's no b**ches. Then there are some Otakus like me who reads anime and watches manga. I also play Gundams and build Visual Novels. I love Jamaican people. We are best buds now if you are Jamaican. This game is good. I lvoe the fat people in it. I love the Americans. I love the supreme race of the filipinos because we obviously have a lot going on for us. Horrendous jokes, crappy grammar, you name it. and best of all. United Statians. Different from Americans. United Statians are gods. Americans are fat people. That's what we learned in our 1st Grade Text Book. Get this game. I love it "

												After playing Elsword for some time, I would have to recomend this game,Its not to complicated, or needs a high power system to run well. It follows a simple side-scroller hack and slash format (like the Desc. says :P). At first it may seem complicated at first, but it all falls into place after a while.My only problems with ES are that the quests get boring and repeatative if you are working on many different characters,You can not get an international group of players on the same server,And how the game is updated is really unbalanced, Meaning players in Korea have the most updated version of the game, the US is the second most updated, and from their it reduces down quite rapidly, India has the least updated version of the game. It would be nice if all contries got updated at the same time, but that can be a good thing, meaning you can look at videos from people playing in a different country and get sort of a 'spoiler'Overall, Good game, Easy to learn, very addictive, Only real down side is that not all contries get updated at the same timeMy score 9/10 Totally worth it!

												tl;dr: This game is really good. For a dynamic and enggaging combt system, a less-than-toxic community, and an overall good time, I recommend this game.If you're like me, and you enjoy an mmo experience but hate repetitive combat with no real fun or purpose, then you should give this game a try. There is a huge amount of fun to be had in this game! Many MMO traditions are thrown out in favor of creating engaging, dynamic combat.For starters, Elsword takes an entirely different approach to how it is played by using a Side-scrolling Beat-'Em-Up format. By removing the average open world gameplay, and instead using this format, the game has an easy time creating a fun combat system. If one wanted to, they could forget all about the MMO aspect of the game, as it is never overbearing about player interaction, and is more about combat and leveling up.Speaking of leveling, the playable characters in this game are done pretty well. Like some other MMOs, this game lacks a true character creation menu, and instead provides several premade characters with their own moves, special attacks, and fleshed-out stories. While this may sound restricting, this was never a problem for me. All of the chracters look really    cool, and each character brings an entirely new playstyle to the table.Plus, there is a chracter progression system, in which you are able to access new special attacks and combos at certain levels. At level 15, you are able to choose a new class for your character. The class you choose can drastically change how you play, and leads into another class progression later on. A lot of the draw for playing new characters comes from this system. I spent hours just figuring out which character to play, and how they'd help my friends in combat.This is, however, an MMO, so how are the other players? Well... I never really noticed them. No one ever bothered me, which is nice. You will likely only encounter other active players in the bigger towns, and occasionally in the battlefield. You can choose whether to involve yourself in that sort of thing; I personally chose to stick with my current friends. I'll say this: The community for this game is unobtrusive, and will not bother you unless you choose to be a part of it.Overall, I enjoy this game thoroughly. At the time of writing, the Season 2 update just came out, adding upgrades and such to Elsword (the character) and Rena. I just hope that they game's creators will do something similar for all characters, as that would be a fun sight to see.11/10 would spend too much time on this review again.			"

												Elsword is definitely a fun free to play game. The game itself is 2D which is pretty cool. Also the anime characters are really cool too. Also since the game is free, you can pay to get k-coins which is an in-game currency n the game. My thoughts and opinions about this game is that its otherwise great than being pay - to -win than what most people expect a game to be. I mean if you just know how to play a free - to - play game the right way you enjoy it. If you really enjoy it, your experienced and you pretty much have that feeling that you want to pay for the game. Pretty much I'm a casual player and enjoy games. But when I find games that interest me, I pay for them. Definitely there are pros I can tell you about the game.Pros1. The game is 2.5D. This means that game plays in a side - scrolling environment which just plays that way. The cool thing though that since the game is 2.5D. It's pretty unique and cool to play in that way.2. The game is free. -  I like the game and the characters. It brings such a joy that Elsword is free and that you can pretty much enjoy the game.3. PvP and Co - op is just what I need. - Do you ever had the need to bring up a party of four and always felt alone when you were soloing through those dungeons? Well now you can invite your friends, enjoy the fun, and play with them in Elsword. In PvP, you can test your skills and see how good you are. As always, there's a training room in Elsword that can help you practice in PvP. If that makes you feel better. "

 Swank Animu Simulator Have you ever wanted to be a cliche Shounen Protagonist? Then this is the game for you!!! This game is AWESOME! well... now it is...As many of you can tell, this game has received a LOT of flak after ADDing the unbalanced charactersAdd (prompting my joke above) and Lu/Ciel (No I didn't randomly throw in a slash the character is 2 different people).These characters were able to (once awakened) keep an enemy in a combo for EVER (which broke PVP causing the outrage). So FINALLY KoG has responded by no... not nerfing the new characters but remaking all the old ones! (and the new ones too but they aren't out yet at the time im writing this so imma just assume that they are gonna be balanced)This is ADDresing (#sorrynotsorry) all of the problems in pvp (even if it does COMPLETELY ♥♥♥♥ over pve but who cares about that anyways?) All in all this game is really fun and INCREDIBLY fun when playing with friends! I highly reccomend it and promise you that you won't be let down!			"

Have a good variety of characters and classes, fast-pased gameplay and really fun combo, and also pretty good story (even though some people doesn't care about the story). Back then I play this game on Indonesia Server, too bad the server went shut down and move to Elsword NA. There are 2 things that I don't like about this game:1. Pay2Win2. Unbalance skills If this game have no P2W system and balance skills, I will doubt this game will be more popular and also memorable. For the community though, I really like the community.

												I have about over 2000 hours on this gamealso add 400 hours from steam.This game is heavily p2w but it is possible to acquire endgame stats with event items and such.I don't recommend this game only for the sole reason that new content runs out so quickly and there are gender locked classes.

												The game itself is very well built, its hard to come by a n ice sidescroller game with so many options with skill trees, job classes, and other things that are so small but make such a huge difference. Biggest problem for me is the fact that if you want to win in this game, you need to donate, the game is fun casual play, but as for wanting to get better, its all in how much you pay to win, skill only takes you so far in it. The community itself has gone very downhil since the game started as well, now its full of trolls and people with giant egos thanks to how much they've spent on it. Reason why I make I recommend it is if you can look past the pvp and dungeon things, it has some nice events to help you reach max level, some challenging dungeons and you dont /need/ to party with strangers. Its great to play with friends, as for trying to playing play it competitively, unless you're willing to spend a ton of cash, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I absolutely love this game! It's a great hack and slash time killer, and the PvP is really fun. The only downsides are the cash stop, of course. I have purchased some items but I just started and haven't had many ""unfair"" issues yet. It took a while to catch on to the way you play in PvP, but after I got it down it's pretty simple.This game is so cute! I love the graphics and all the cute outfits and mounts you can aquire. There are rewards for saving special currency so you have the option to collect them or do extra quests to get better and cuter items!I plan on putting more time into this game, for sure! Love it!

												Ive been playing this game off and on for years, getting bored with some characters i make. For a free to play i highly recommend this game. Unlike the more popular games like WoW, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. You actually have to move and do combos. I will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like 40 dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. Also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. I think out of 20 burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. The PvP is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at Pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. People also have crappy internet who PvP so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks.But still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.

												Ignore the hours on Steam, I recently switched.Having played this game for years, I have had mixed emotions. When there is not a big event, like a character release (AKA LuCiel atm), or new secret dunges or revamps, this game is bad. The events suck, and it always feels P2W. But, I have had an enourmous ammount of fun with this game. I would recommend if you want to play for a little bit, and not grind seriously. If you like side scrolling beat-em-ups, and anime, then this game is for you. If not, then stay away. You will only enjoy events that have new releases or revamps, and the game may seem fun at first, but the novelty wears off. The economy sucks too. Like, you can't buy anything really. I have no REAL quarrel with the game, it's just that sometimes the developers don't seem to care (KoG) about the NA servers. IF you can, I would recommend the Korean servers. They get free thigns all the time, but it is a long and complicated process.TL:DR This game is P2W, adn the events suck. Novelty wears off.			"

												It makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win. There is NOTHING in this game that you HAVE to buy. There are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. I've been playing this game since back when there were only 4 classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. The items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. There are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier PVE experience. The only thing that I can say is a usual must pay is the second B slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $8 other than that you don't have to buy anything, I've NEVER expanded my inventory or bank space and I get by just fine and happy. Now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2D Side Scrolling with 3D elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. Each character currently in the game has 3 jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. All and all the games PVE is superb and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. Now for the PVP, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. It comes in the form of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and a base race game mode. Where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. The biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in PVE where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in PVP along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. Overall I believe that this is a great MMO that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.			"

												I strongly urge people to avoid this as much as possible. The game has become a cesspool of people who are abusive and rude. The pvp is broken and unbalanced a lvl 10 with no rank can be put up against a lvl 56 with b rank. If you don't have the cash to spend prepare to be at the bottom of the barrel in both pvp and pve as most people have mounts and will use them all the time. In short this is just a shell of its former glory a good game that has died, this is the rotten corpse that remains			"

												Elsword features skill-based action gameplay combined with role-playing elements and community features typical of an MMORPG, such as guilds, chat, and item trading. I am very addicted to the game, I personally loved it! I always like these type of games, since it has that manga/anime feel to it. Their is about 6 characters at the moment, (8/29/15) and I have a lot of stuff to talk about this game, so let's get started! The story seems to be leading a good way of what is happening, there's always a good amount of sub-quests/story quests to enjoy. The one thing I loved is that, different character have a unique skill,style,class path, ect. The voice acting is pretty nice, I don't mind too much from it since it is voiced in Japanese. The Stage/environment is a 8.7/10 since it's not really perfect in my opinion, but it's nice. There are some ""Main Story Quest"" that have a cinematic cutscene after you completed it. Very nice to the story overall.Different Gameplay Mechanics,Items,Equipment,Features and other great things that make this game alive, but then there is one problem to ""Elsword"". The PvP matchup seems to be alright, but bad at the same time, because due to having to vs lvl 70's that will 1 shot you, but most of my time on PvP, it's doesn't occur too much then it use to.I know people been saying this is a ""Pay2Win"" type of game, it's been one of those typical games, but keep it clean and have fun with your friends (if your friends play it).Overall, I must rate this game a total of 9/10, remember everyone will have their own opinion.Have a wonderful day!!  \>.< / [Elsword Main Page]http://en.elswordonline.com/[Elsword Wiki Page]http://elwiki.net/w/Main_Page "

												I love this game! It is a fun action adventure style sidescroller and ""beat em' up"" type of game with great customization, sounds, graphics, and characters. Each character is unique and has there own style of play which cater to just about every fighting style you can imagine. The story of each character is well thought out and planned and the game is a real challenge when you want it to be. There are still a few bugs with starting the game and the items in the shop can make it hard for people who are not pay to win to compete, but you can overcome this handycap with skill and strategy. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes customization and action cause those are the two things that this game specializes in. Have fun and get to work on the Space and Time temple as soon as you can becasue once you have that, you can compete against anyone and fight just about any boss without too much trouble. XD See you in the game!!! :D			"

												I played this game way back when Raven was new in the NA server, the game is very enjoyable but is sadly drowned in microtransactions that will effectively make you stronger than anyone that isn't spending money on the game (or p2w). I thought I'd try picking it up again because I used to play it a ton with some friends of mine but I just can't get back into it. The community is also pretty childish at times and can be rather rude too.tl;dr: Game is good but p2w elements and community really ruin the fun.			"

												There's only really one thing to say about this game: It's very fast-paced. Unlike the automatic hack-and-slash of some side-scrolling MMORPG's, Elsword requires you to manually press the buttons and connect the attacks yourself. At the beginning, it might be boring and uneventful, but as you progress through the levels, the dungeons and the towns...you'll find that things do get a 'little' harder. And while you may have to grind more and more to get to the next level, it's worth it. WORTH. You know why? The PVP.The PVP in this damn game is phenomenal, and it's what hooked me into Elsword in the first place. Yes, it might seem easy in first glance, but experiencing it for yourself brings you to a whole new world. It's fresh. Exciting. Exhilarating. And most of all...it's addicting. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm not kidding when I say: Prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥ here comes the butthurt-whenever you step into Arena 1v1 and 3v3, or sparring. It's not easy. Not at all. It's hard, and it will test you and keep pushing you beyond your limits. It pushed me beyond my limits. Consistently. Just when I thought I couldn't get any better, I did. It's so competitive yet strangely casual at the same time that it's surreal. Honestly, for me, the reason that I keep coming back to Elsword despite the grinding and the fact that things do get a little repetitive, is the PVP. So what are you waiting for? Download it now! Even if you might not like it, just keep it and PVP once in a while to feel adrenaline pumping throughout your veins. There's nothing like it.			"

												8.0/10Elsword is really addicting when it comes to dungeons. Featuring exp, combos, etc. The game's popularity is still alive at this time so you should get it. Quests based on dungeons, gettings items, and more. Not much about that game that is negative except that we can be clones, meaning look the same. Its a good game, grinding just to level up, and have fun with friends.			"

												This game is probably one of the most unique side scroller games I have ever played in my life. It combines 2D combat with 3D graphics, not to mention the friendly community (Depending if you participate in dungeons or arenas with the wrong people). In my own experience, I've only met few salty people, but nevertheless, the people are nice and are willing to help you if you're new. I personally reccomend this game, because not only does is the game itself exotic and different compared to other side scrollers, this game is just awesome in many ways, and will be the best game for you if you LOVE anime.

												This game is filled with fat obeise people. Ranging from Chubby to XXL. That's only 2% of the population. The next 2% are Americans, and they sometimes coincide with fat people. The next 2% are my ancestors, Filipinos. We like to overexxagerate crap, laugh at horrendous jokes, and thinks of ourselves as the best in everything just because we envy neighboring countries like Japan and China, and worship the U.S. as if every citizen is a god. Which is true. The rest are gamers. They range from Gamers who gets *****es or Gamers who gets no **tches. Im a Gamer who get's no b**ches. Then there are some Otakus like me who reads anime and watches manga. I also play Gundams and build Visual Novels. I love Jamaican people. We are best buds now if you are Jamaican. This game is good. I lvoe the fat people in it. I love the Americans. I love the supreme race of the filipinos because we obviously have a lot going on for us. Horrendous jokes, crappy grammar, you name it. and best of all. United Statians. Different from Americans. United Statians are gods. Americans are fat people. That's what we learned in our 1st Grade Text Book. Get this game. I love it "

												i've been playing for the first few days and yes, i have a gripe or two about it. for free to play, its hard to progress when  content and extra storage and slot space being locked. altho the sad alternative is to dismantle or sell off in hopes to create a stronger set of weapons and armor. i wish that there were some character customization. i am not a fan of everyone looking like everyone else. it is kinda sad that it takes real money to purchase something to break the mold and stand out and that too is a double-edged sword. anyone feels like going 2d minus player vs player mode, may i suggest Gaia online's  ZOMG?

												After playing Elsword for some time, I would have to recomend this game,Its not to complicated, or needs a high power system to run well. It follows a simple side-scroller hack and slash format (like the Desc. says :P). At first it may seem complicated at first, but it all falls into place after a while.My only problems with ES are that the quests get boring and repeatative if you are working on many different characters,You can not get an international group of players on the same server,And how the game is updated is really unbalanced, Meaning players in Korea have the most updated version of the game, the US is the second most updated, and from their it reduces down quite rapidly, India has the least updated version of the game. It would be nice if all contries got updated at the same time, but that can be a good thing, meaning you can look at videos from people playing in a different country and get sort of a 'spoiler'Overall, Good game, Easy to learn, very addictive, Only real down side is that not all contries get updated at the same timeMy score 9/10 Totally worth it!

												Good game. Solid combat, not as grindy or RNG ridden as most quest games, overly cute and the character skill/class progression system gives this game a REALLY high-replay value. This game is also no where close to p2w for those who are willing to learn the game. There's also a character/class that fits all types of players/playstyles.Stamina bar is a real pain though. (There is no reason why a game should limit players on how long they play a game. Period. Anyone who says other wise is simply making excuses and trying to damage control for a system that hurts the game more than it helps it.)			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It's kind of mind numbing. You don't really need to do an strategizing, mostly button mashing. I currently have 2 characters, Eve and Ara and each have their own little perks. It is a bit annoying that you have to do the same dungeon 3-6 times in a row in order to complete certain missions. The Arena matching is a bit unfair. A level 10 can go against a level 30. I think that they should have it where there's only a 5 level difference (i.e. level 10 against level 15 or 5). Other than that it's fun, addicting and you even get your own little pet :)			"

												I am newbie in mmo's, this is the first I ever play good (because is the first my graphics card runs well). Gameplay 8/10I've been playing about 2 hours and I enjoyed a lot. It's not too hard for newbies (like me) and not too easy for experienced players. The fighting system is really simple and dynamic, it allows you to make large combos with decent variants. It is effective but playing and playing may it turns repetitive. I've played several non-mmo plataforms before and I think it's great.The exp and levelups are well balanced. There are a lot of posibilities with many skills to learn and to upgrade. The character balance it's ok, all classes have their way to fight, weakness and strenghts.The plataform system it's like any other.Graphics 9/10I have a computer without graphic card (Intel chipset) and it runs without problems, so, it's basicaly why I chose this game. It have a really low specs that I was looking for. So I can't be too much demanding. It looks very nice for me, anime 3d desing.Story 6/10Very simple history, out of emotion.Personalitazion 5/10The weak point of the game. Having a simple history it would be worth to have high-rate of perzonalitation options. You can't change your character phisically, there are just 5 classes.Muisc 9/10As a music lover, I think music is important to games. This game has great music, being a Korean game it's not surprise to have such great tracks.General 7/10I think i'ts worth to give it a try. Especially if you haven't a dedicated graphics card, because it runs pretty well with my 3100 gma Intel chipset. I like plataforms games and this is great for plataforms lovers. If you are looking to spend moderate daily time playing one mmorpg, you better look for another game, as I said it turns off the fun after 1-2 hours.			"

												The game itself is very well built, its hard to come by a n ice sidescroller game with so many options with skill trees, job classes, and other things that are so small but make such a huge difference. Biggest problem for me is the fact that if you want to win in this game, you need to donate, the game is fun casual play, but as for wanting to get better, its all in how much you pay to win, skill only takes you so far in it. The community itself has gone very downhil since the game started as well, now its full of trolls and people with giant egos thanks to how much they've spent on it. Reason why I make I recommend it is if you can look past the pvp and dungeon things, it has some nice events to help you reach max level, some challenging dungeons and you dont /need/ to party with strangers. Its great to play with friends, as for trying to playing play it competitively, unless you're willing to spend a ton of cash, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I absolutely love this game! It's a great hack and slash time killer, and the PvP is really fun. The only downsides are the cash stop, of course. I have purchased some items but I just started and haven't had many ""unfair"" issues yet. It took a while to catch on to the way you play in PvP, but after I got it down it's pretty simple.This game is so cute! I love the graphics and all the cute outfits and mounts you can aquire. There are rewards for saving special currency so you have the option to collect them or do extra quests to get better and cuter items!I plan on putting more time into this game, for sure! Love it!

												Ive been playing this game off and on for years, getting bored with some characters i make. For a free to play i highly recommend this game. Unlike the more popular games like WoW, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. You actually have to move and do combos. I will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like 40 dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. Also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. I think out of 20 burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. The PvP is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at Pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. People also have crappy internet who PvP so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks.But still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.

												It makes me sad to see people say this is pay to win. There is NOTHING in this game that you HAVE to buy. There are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. I've been playing this game since back when there were only 4 classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. The items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. There are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier PVE experience. The only thing that I can say is a usual must pay is the second B slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $8 other than that you don't have to buy anything, I've NEVER expanded my inventory or bank space and I get by just fine and happy. Now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2D Side Scrolling with 3D elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. Each character currently in the game has 3 jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. All and all the games PVE is superb and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. Now for the PVP, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. It comes in the form of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and a base race game mode. Where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. The biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in PVE where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in PVP along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. Overall I believe that this is a great MMO that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.			"

If you don't have the cash to spend prepare to be at the bottom of the barrel in both pvp and pve as most people have mounts and will use them all the time.

												Ignore the hours on Steam, I recently switched.Having played this game for years, I have had mixed emotions. When there is not a big event, like a character release (AKA LuCiel atm), or new secret dunges or revamps, this game is bad. The events suck, and it always feels P2W. But, I have had an enourmous ammount of fun with this game. I would recommend if you want to play for a little bit, and not grind seriously. If you like side scrolling beat-em-ups, and anime, then this game is for you. If not, then stay away. You will only enjoy events that have new releases or revamps, and the game may seem fun at first, but the novelty wears off. The economy sucks too. Like, you can't buy anything really. I have no REAL quarrel with the game, it's just that sometimes the developers don't seem to care (KoG) about the NA servers. IF you can, I would recommend the Korean servers. They get free thigns all the time, but it is a long and complicated process.TL:DR This game is P2W, adn the events suck. Novelty wears off.			"

												Elsword is one of the first games i got on steam and i can tell you first hand its a great game but has some problems... Starting off with the good the classes are really cool and all are equally as awsome as the next. Each with a cute backstory i can't find anything wrong with them.  The story is good and the cut scenes are pieces of art. They also come out with new character relitivly quickly for most MMOs. Which means theres always something new to try. But even with all that said this is just another pay to win game.. If you want anything good thats PERMINANT you have to pay for it out of your own wallet. I'm kind of getting sick of these kind of things. All in all though if you dont mind not being the strongest person out there then this game is for you.Pros:  Great characters  Amazing story  Fun   Easy to get startedCons:     Pay to win    Gliches oh the gitches (Resetting your attacks, loosing armer lvs, characters disaering.

												Wost MMO i've played in a LONG time. FREEMIUM and PAY-TO-WIN at its finest. Most free MMOs have paid ""cash"" items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in PvP or not I don't care its still BULL. This game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will LITERALLY TELEPORT BEHIND YOU breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests DON'T work properly, the options don't work properly. Now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for SOME games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2D and 3D moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to PAY for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you PAY for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or PAY to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the UI is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left CTL for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute I got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. I love MMORPGs but this is the WORST I have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will NEVER PLAY AGAIN. Only reason why I played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others MMOs with each other for a week. In short: God this was utter trash and a NIGHTMARE to play I never want to play again nor probably never will.*I was playing Add which is supposidly a ""mage class"" apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther MMOs because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game DOESN'T show your max HP so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much HP you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 SECONDS even if you have 3 DIFFERENT potions on your quick slots they ALL go on cooldown, if the potions REGENED health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.

												I played this game way back when Raven was new in the NA server, the game is very enjoyable but is sadly drowned in microtransactions that will effectively make you stronger than anyone that isn't spending money on the game (or p2w). I thought I'd try picking it up again because I used to play it a ton with some friends of mine but I just can't get back into it. The community is also pretty childish at times and can be rather rude too.tl;dr: Game is good but p2w elements and community really ruin the fun.			"

												Autistic +11 Gear Carried players can beat you in 3 hits then call you a spamming noob. As they play the most broken classes using the most broken gear. Half the community is full of fat, anti-social otaku-♥♥♥♥, who try really hard to act normal and conform to normal social standards (i.e mimicking black memes, ""what are those"" ""deez nuts"" ""♥♥♥♥♥"" etc) And its really REALLY cringe worthy because, being a lightskin ♥♥♥♥♥ myself its emberassing knowing that some fat greasy White/Asian/Mexican kid is trying to act like me and associate himself with my culture. PvE is Boring, the algorhytms for Ice Burners are broken to say the least (I had a friend open up $250 worth of Ice Burners only to get 6 Pieces of the actual set, extras included) some classes are unplayable because of how they arent broken enough to stack up with others, servers are poorly maintained and are constantly laggy, my Guild Master is laggy as ♥♥♥♥ and he lives a whole Hour away from me.  With the level boost event you would think KoG would have the idea that making bigger and more servers would be a thing to put on their list, guess not! Gotta push out another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ice Burner and Item Mall Event!			"

												To start off, let's do a quick summary of what Elsword is:Elsword is a Anime Styled, Side Scrolling, Free to Play, Class-based RPG Fighter in which you are given the choice of 9 different characters to fight with, level up and ""evolve"" so to say. Each character has different skill trees which can be chosen to fit your personal gameplay style. Like to play as a Free Knight and acquire pyromancer abilities? Choose Elesis! Like being a Tank for your team? Choose Chung! How about being an Archer to attack from long range? Choose Rena! This selection of characters is great for all kinds of players and helps broaden the audience for this game. It has typical elements which you can expect from an RPG: Armour, Special weapons, potions, grinding etc. These elements fit well into the world of Elsword, helping you defeat bosses in dungeons to earn XP and gain better armour and weapons!Speaking of bosses, there may be repetition with such bosses as Banthus but besides that, they are both challenging and rewarding. The game itself seems to get very addicting when you are trying to level up your character and get them to their next form or ""evolution"" as I've said before. The stamina bar is used to prevent addiction. This bar is gradually used up as you complete dungeons and once you are out of stamina you cannot do any more dungeons for the day. Stamina is refilled every day though as well as having unlimited stamina at weekends so all you fanatics can play to your hearts content.In closing, I believe Elsword is a fun, vibrant and addicting game and I recommend it to all of you anime or RPG lovers.

												Honestly the concept has promise but between the NA publisher's increasing drive to get people to cash, and the general incompetence (class balance, updates screwing things up, etc), I really must say: Turn back now. (I've since stopped playing)Some Pluses:the exp rates are reasonable now (surprisingly)PvE Community is tolerant of Underpowered classes.The game itself is pretty fun (before you hit stat bloatville known as Sander)NegativesCommunity is insanely greedy (even worse than before with people tradining large amounts of KChing for stuff)The publisher does do nothing towards keeping the economy in linePvP community is quick to make hacking accusationsIn game events tend to be bleh if not frustratingThings are generally much worse/cash heavy compare to KR (99% of skill notes are now cash shop only)Wonky class imbalance (not as bad as Marvel vs Capcom 2 but the OP and UP classes are pretty obvious)And for those that are interested in its beat'em up mechanics: KoG is pushing the game towards being a maple story clone and the game's design basically punishes some classes.Again I can only recommend not playing this. Play Castle Crashers instead for example or wait until DFOG beta begins.			"

												Seriously this is just like every other side-scrolling MMO there is, this is Grand Chase. I'm not sure how this game stacks up against others as it's the first I've played. I thought I'd give it a try. When I first joined the game I had a lot of fun for a couple hours, then I realized this game is the definition of repetitive. Seriously guys, dungeon after dungeon, killing something after something. I couldn't handle this. If that's your style, I'd definitely recommend this game. It has a few aspects I like, combat is pretty fun and the ""comic book"" feel is kind of charming. Not the greatest game (perhaps it's the genre I dislike). 6.5/10.			"

												A very fun game, i prefer to use the game launcher from the website but you can go either way.This game has pros and cons but is very enjoyable if you dont mind doing the same dungeon 3-4 times over and over again as it does indeed get old But lets get on to the pros and cons.Pros:-Very enjoyable for something in your off time.-PvE is enjoyable. -A nice leveling scale as it gets pretty difficult for 60-85 (I found it quite difficult)-Nice idea of job changes for each character which supplies a character with new combos and skills making it a very refreshing game if you like to do the main story over again just to try out each characters job change (each job change has a 2nd version which makes it gain more skills and combos).-Manages to pull off a good anime style type of game.-Side scrolling beat em up MMoRPG thats enjoyable.Cons:-PvP is Unbalanced (Basically PTW).-Repetitive.-New classes tend to be more powerfull then the old ones.-Can get insanely boring later on in the higher levels trying to get to 85.And thats pretty much it, there isnt really anything else about this game other than its enjoyable for awhile but gets boring near the middle of the game and the pvp is pretty unbalanced most of the times, but its a must play if you enjoy playing through dungeons over and over again or like making people salty in pvp (Beause NA is salty AF).

												While it offer a unique indie experience the many recent changes make the game more and more grindy for users, with recent changes toward implement more chance element toward the old item crafting it become rediculously hard to get some of the better gears in the game. This have negatively impacted the gaming experience, leaving people unhappy after spending tens of hours in limited time event dungeon only to be let down every time they open the box. As the result I cannot recommend the game to anyone who is goal oriented since you wil find after spending hundred of hours in the game you are often not rewarded for your effort without spending lot of real money.

												At first i love Elsword, it was a cute side scroller and the dungeons were actually pretty fun... then i got into the pvp or arena as they call it and i absolutely hated it. Elswords Arena is the most broken pvp in a online rpg i have ever experienced. The new character ADD can hit you once then constantly stun lock you until your hp drops or they fail the combo which is highly unlikely as it is just  a mashing of zzzz or xxxx constantly. Add is not the only op character that they have. Aisha's Elemental Master Job can literally just teleport all over the map gaining mp constantly to spam her most powerful skills where your stuck there chasing her the entire game. Eve's Battle Seraph job is just one big spam fest. Basically this games pvp lacks fairness and is generally just made up of spamming, running, and over powered characters compared to the others.

												The game is rather fun and the community can be tough love at points, but there is fun times to be had in the game and well. I'm not the type to tell you lies and lies would it be to say the dungeons are the main point of the game, nah they simply give you something to do until your a high enough lvl to fight in PvP or raids. Asides that character and class choices are a plenty so hell have fun picking your character(s) and well dressing them up and stuff, sure you gotta pay money for it but hey if you've gotten past lvl 45 then I can say you already enjoy the game enough to spend some cash on a few things m'kay? at anyrate if your going for dungeons expect to see some bored people who either way that item or want to finish this quest, I suggest for the greener horns ya follow the quest line until ya figure out what to do with your iron buns ya got from sitting there for so long, then question going into PvP and then find out the hard way 300 MP moves all across the board isn't the way to go, And raids will kick your♥♥♥♥♥so hard you'll be married to em. All and all once you learn what to do which isn't hard mind you, the game becomes quite addictive and fun. I mean...what can you lose? pick it up and play it and see if I'm wrong, I'm merely just putting up my due thoughts on this game.			"

												Love this game highly recomend this game to anybody who like a good Action game sure it has its ups and downs but all in all its pretty solid its a good start off to lvl 40 then grind nice and hard with high reward in the end pvp is full of spam and laggers but hey its called killer kombo which if your combo happens to last forever and you know your resets then let the spam happen but laggers i wish there was a mod button so when someone is lagging a gm poofs into the game invis ofcourse, and see who really is lagging to kick them other then that really freindly comunity (outside of pvp) and the econ is gettign kinda jacked up but all in all after my 237 hour of play and three accounts i got a total of 3 maxed out chr and some lvl 60 so for you die hards out there this is the game to play : IGN ShadowxRaven and ofcourse my MM IGN: ShadowxADHD			"

												What I like.+Simple movelist and combos.+Game load times.+Characters.+PvP game modes ok.+Customize characters.+Grinding not so bad.+PvP without lag. Without lag this game is awesome.


YouTube™ Video: Lagless Elsword 2vs2 Rank Match 

			Views: 25		

			Lagsword best way describe pvp community, but get rare unicorns have great connections. Like I was fighting my friends right next to me. Sad because I'm always thinking fighting people from Mars..		

What I hate.-Character balance is problem. Characters like Add have teleport, long range hitbox melee attacks, projectiles, homing projectiles and high damage plus a lot more crap I can't think of. What more character need get job done? Looking at SNK boss here.-3vs3 mode use be fun mode until added Hyper skills to mix. Street Fighter and Tekken did it right, Elsword on other hand f it up with Hyper spam wars.-Terrible content updates. -Events straight up joke compare to Korean version.-Pay to win.-In game money is useless.-People abusing rank system. People deranking or using low rank players get matchs.-Lag serious problem. Freaking serious problem!

 Pros: microtransactions provide minimal boost in which nothing P2w happens. game is actually rather fun. easy to play.very quick progression. (i got to level 40 in a day.) its free..... anime for people who enjoy that like me and doesn't cost money compared to 90% of Anime titles. Cons: once you complete the story it will start to get boring.certian cosmedics that look great are locked behind a paywall.no physical character creator. (change color of skin, hair, etc.)like most games like this, the actuall gear doesn't really show. (armor)some quests like the code Nemisis 3/5 will take a lot of your time. conclusion:  this is a fun game and with a 0$ price tag its a great game to pick up. go ahead and pick up the game and try it for yourself!

												Got to be one of the BEST MMORPG games I've ever played! Although the recent rating seem to be really low, the game is actually more fun than what meets the eye. Costumes, weapons, and accessories are quite easily obtained...without spending real $$$. Really, most people say it's pay-to-win, but I never spent a dime and I'm doing fine. It's really just up to the player and the time spent on this game that determines how good you are. WARNING: This is still a game that needs $$$ to obtain super rarity items! There are exceptions and ways to obtain them without $$$, but for the most part, if your luck is bad...then SORRY...maybe NEXT time~			"

												I may not have as many hourse as some other reviewers here, but I did play the game quite a lot when it first came to Steam and then some a few months down the line in short bursts. I will say that like the others here, I have noticed the game gradually try to add in more and more ways of taking your money. PvP gradually became less and less balanced, and PvE was a grindfest of repeating dungeons over and over with little reward. If you\'re new and wanting to try it out, sure. It\'s still a fun game. But don\'t expect to stick around for the long haul, where real progress actually matters.			"

												This game is very fun and addicting, it reminds me of a japanese sidescrolling beat'em up. And while it does have good gameplay, it does cost alot of money to play.I tried to play it without spending any money and it was impossible seeing the fact that I picked a character that ended up needing more slots to hold magic (In this game you have to spend 9$ To use 8 spells instead of 4). So I finally broke down and got some money on to the game and it's been more fun.I'm in a love hate relationship with this game. I love to play it, but it makes my wallet dry. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who's looking for a new and diffrent MMORPG, but watch your wallet.			"

												I just hit level 70. I'm pretty friendly if you ever see me ingame. If you ever see someone using a megaphone saying ""EVERYBODY SUCKS BUT ME!!"" chances are that's probably me. I'm not being serious though. Grats to anyone who actually gets the simpsons reference whenever I do that. About the game though...when people say this game is very pay to win, they are not joking. I've put 132 hours into this game. It took me 2 very long months to hit level 70. Towards the end I started using plus 50% exp boosts. Aside from that, I spent over 100 dollars on multiple things from more inventory space to unlocking my hot bar to accessories and what not. If you're looking for something that's completely free to play you might want to avoid this one. Personally I can't put the game down just because it has a lot of my favorite genres all wrapped up into one nice package. I also love how the main focus of it is a side scrolling online beat em up pretty much. If you're really into that sort of thing, you'll ♥♥♥♥ing love the game like I did and probably want to go all the way to 70, maybe even spend a little bit of money here and there. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed every moment from level 1 to 70. Best of luck to everyone whatever game they decide to play. This is born, signing out.			"

(theres cusomize setting for joystick but not for keyboard)this game is not free to play  . u need to pay for 2nd skill bar (its cheap to buy only 450k ching i think)be prepared to pay for the skill bar, or just dont waste ur time in this game.

												first off i have spent alot of time in this game i would would not recommend it to someone who has a low income rate or isn't prepared to spend moneythe game can be fun and has a bit of life in it each new town is awesome to go to when you unlock it and the dungeons that come with it are really cool looking but have to do them atleast 3 times to move on to the next one in the story line is really annoying(it moves up to 5-8 times in the high levels)the leveling in the game is really hard to do without getting an exp boost item(its even hard with that but alittle easier) i have a charcter in the 80(cap is 85 at time of writting) and doing one dungeon gives about 8-9% of the exp bar and dungeons are your main sorce of levelingstay out of the item mall if you do play. i repeat STAY OUT OF THE ITEM MALL. it is not needed to go into it but getting something from it costs alot of money. there are costumes in this game and you'd expect them to have nop stats and just change how you look KOG said ""♥♥♥♥ that you buy a costume it makes your stats better than a f2p"". the costumes cost around 25-31 dollars to get the whole set which also have set bonuses to increase your stats even more.pvp is not worth doing. all pvp comes down to is stun locking(its a system whereif you get hit you are stunned for a second and if you keep hitting they stay stunned there is a way to get out of it but it's crap).it boils down to who can hit first and thats it which makes so slow attacking charcters useless. if anyone losses in pvp they just complain about something you did or that a charcter is op. i will admit new charcters are pretty unbalanced and kog takes their sweet♥♥♥♥♥time balancing themover its not to bad of a game even though i have jsut been ranting. the scenery in each town, field, and dungeon look awesome but you spend so much time in town little time in fields and so many runs in dungeons it losses it attraction to be there. the charcters all have their own personalities and are really cool. each one play differntly then the other and it has a job system where you can change how they play ever further. guilds can feel like home if your in the right ones but big ones can fall very easily and not many people talk. i only have so many hours in this game because i only get on to talk to friends i have made in it.in conclusion i would recommend this game if this things i stated up above were improved and made better to make the game alot more fun but as it is right now i simply dont not recommend it if you love fantasy places and exploring or grinding a ♥♥♥♥♥on you might enjoy this game but if not stay away. i hope the review helps your decision in downloading this game and have fun if you do.

												I may not have as many hourse as some other reviewers here, but I did play the game quite a lot when it first came to Steam and then some a few months down the line in short bursts. I will say that like the others here, I have noticed the game gradually try to add in more and more ways of taking your money. PvP gradually became less and less balanced, and PvE was a grindfest of repeating dungeons over and over with little reward. If you\'re new and wanting to try it out, sure. It\'s still a fun game. But don\'t expect to stick around for the long haul, where real progress actually matters.			"

												This game is very fun and addicting, it reminds me of a japanese sidescrolling beat'em up. And while it does have good gameplay, it does cost alot of money to play.I tried to play it without spending any money and it was impossible seeing the fact that I picked a character that ended up needing more slots to hold magic (In this game you have to spend 9$ To use 8 spells instead of 4). So I finally broke down and got some money on to the game and it's been more fun.I'm in a love hate relationship with this game. I love to play it, but it makes my wallet dry. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who's looking for a new and diffrent MMORPG, but watch your wallet.			"

												I just hit level 70. I'm pretty friendly if you ever see me ingame. If you ever see someone using a megaphone saying ""EVERYBODY SUCKS BUT ME!!"" chances are that's probably me. I'm not being serious though. Grats to anyone who actually gets the simpsons reference whenever I do that. About the game though...when people say this game is very pay to win, they are not joking. I've put 132 hours into this game. It took me 2 very long months to hit level 70. Towards the end I started using plus 50% exp boosts. Aside from that, I spent over 100 dollars on multiple things from more inventory space to unlocking my hot bar to accessories and what not. If you're looking for something that's completely free to play you might want to avoid this one. Personally I can't put the game down just because it has a lot of my favorite genres all wrapped up into one nice package. I also love how the main focus of it is a side scrolling online beat em up pretty much. If you're really into that sort of thing, you'll ♥♥♥♥ing love the game like I did and probably want to go all the way to 70, maybe even spend a little bit of money here and there. I will say I thoroughly enjoyed every moment from level 1 to 70. Best of luck to everyone whatever game they decide to play. This is born, signing out.			"

(theres cusomize setting for joystick but not for keyboard)this game is not free to play  . u need to pay for 2nd skill bar (its cheap to buy only 450k ching i think)be prepared to pay for the skill bar, or just dont waste ur time in this game.

												    XD here with a brief review of the game Elsword and strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes adventuring socializing, talking and trading items. Also, who don't mind spending a few dollars on customising and upgrading the character or characters they plan on using later on in the game. This game is a side strolling 3D beat em up japanese anime game with real-time fighting doing combo combinations while using spells and magic moves and skills in your repithior to defeat your enermies. You can also use skill points to unlock new skills and new moves as you progess through the game and get stronger meaning that you and somebody else could have the same character but could fight in totaly different ways and set different  skill moves to manipulate his/her character the way they see fit. Each character has his/her storyline of why they are here and their porpose of fighting which you would find out more of if you decide to try this game which i personally think you won't put down when get heads and tails of things :). I just a few months ago tried the game myself and today still play it because there are so many things in the game that you can do and new things and great deals and oppertunities get added to the game on a regular basis. Plus you can hang out in this game with your friends form parties and/or groups together talk, trade, socialize in real-time go in dungeons together or solo talk and stratigize while fighting with your friends in real-time. Or if you got to go or stop playing for a while for what ever reason can withdraw from the group/party at anytime with the push of a button on your character's personal social option. Plus they start you off with ten resurrection stones and a long bar of life when you first start off and a combo list for your character that you can improve on as you level up and progress though the game. At the beginning of the game you can choose the character you want to figh as and that character's storyline will begin after you put your personal user name in to identify yourself in the game. If it turns out that you don't like that character you could make up to four characters or four of the same characters in anyway you see fit. From the clothes they wear to the way they fight, you controll it all. Or you could chose the character you don't want any more and press delete the game would then ask you: ""Are you sure you want to delete the character?"" Click yes and the character will be deleted no and the character will be spared. In my opinion, this game is one of the best  games i have ever played and am in it for the long-hall/run they people in this game will get tired of seeing me and say ""oh there gos XD again."" Also, after customising your character putting your moves together and learn your skills you can challege your friends and other people online in tournaments that gives you prises, sparring sessions and practice sessions for fun and to develope your realtime fighting skills that you can level up by appling SP/SkillPoints that you get when you level up from beating dungeons. There are different areas to too each with different materials you need to craft new weapons, amor and clothes, you will find out more about this in the game. Anyways, that's some of the basic things you can do in this game if interested you should give i a try and might end up liking the game more than me. :)                                                                                                                       From XD Big fan of Elsword			"

Overall the games good and people who downvote other people's reviews or say mean things to them remember they have their own opinion and you have yours. PLAY OPTIMUS TO MAKE PVP PLAYERS ANGRY!

												I haven't gotten to play the game yet even though it does say I have 0.8 hours on it. My friend told me to wait when the launcher comes up. So I do. Then the launcher will either close out, or close out and the game will open. The game either doesn't respond, is completely black screening or just closes as soon as I click on it. From what I've seen, it's a good game. BUT LET ME PLAY THE GAME FOR GOSH'S SAKE! And, on my PC I have to use Task Manager to close Steam and restart it because when the game closes, it literally forces me to use Task Manager because it still says it's running and I can't play any other game.

												I have more hours in this game on the non steam version, so I think my opinion holds some weight.Im was actually very undecided about whether I want to reccomend this game or not. Its not for everyone. Alot of the things said in the positive and negative reviews are true. Many are false. But the one thing that bothers most is the p2w aspect. Its true that there are alot of things in the game that you have to pay for. It is true that alot of these things can be earned overtime (I have obtained a couple costumes, a pet, and even the extra slot w/o paying real money). It really depends on how willing you are to work for it. You can obtain the second slot from the board, but it will cost a helluvalot of ED (around 85-120mil ED depending on current prices players are selling it for). The same can be said for alot of items you can buy with real money. Some items can be obtained temporarily and permanently through events (Good gear, costumes, pets,extra slots,etc). You can get access to things you normally would have to pay for temorarily, or get a chance to attempt to obtain money items permanently.The actual gameplay is pretty fun. Some reviews say that its repetitive. Its really up to you on this one. There are only two buttons used for basic attacks in this game.They arent light/heavy attacks, but just two different ways of attacking.(For example, if you play as Raven, pressing z will use you blade and x the nasod arm). Different combinations of presses will result in different combos(Ex: pressing xxzzz with Raven will make you  do two simple nasod arm hits and then unleash a flurry of slashes with one final slash). What combos are available to you vary between characters. You will receive two more basic moves when you reach your next job change. Try to incorprate this with your skills (your options will widen as you level up). Once again, its really up to you on how fun that will be. PvP takes alot of skill, knowing just a bit about the opponent's class, and some good gear (at least ok gear at low levels) You will run into some OP players and players who  will be of a higher level than you are by variable margins. You dont have to worry in PvE. The rank you get at the end of a dungeon will not effect how much xp you obtain and neither will the amount of players with you.Thats all I really have to say about the game regarding other reviews. Personally, I do like the game and have been playing for a while. All in all just give it a try and see if you like it.			"

												Elsword is really fun.Why?It has fast-paced gameplay, a plethora of characters- each having an unique class change with different specialties, a fun PvP system.The gameplay is fun. One might assume it's a standard button-masher, yet it is so much more. Variety of combos each requiring good timing for maximum punishment. The Characters- Each have their own fighting style. One could find any style to fit his or her gameplay, whether one enjoys shooting big cannons, stabbing enemies, shooting fireballs or arrows. PvP is exciting a chance to climb the ranks. Each having their own AP tier. Although it does have some lag and balancing issues. Overall it is a fun game and a must-play. Additionally since the NA elsword is behind the KR elsword the game is always being updated. This allows new content to arrive very quickly.If you are looking for a fun anime-like game, you should play this already!			"

												Elsword is a classic beat-em-up with suprisingly interesting strategy involved. Once past the beginning parts of the game, you might find yourself dodging boss attacks and trying to maintain your large combos in order to get high rankings in the dungeon. With its simple, yet potentially complex mechanics, comic book-style graphics, and totemo kawaii-desu characters, Elsword is a blast for casual and hardcore gamers alike.			"

Half of your ability/potion slots are locked until you pay money to unlock them, meaning people who actually spend money are at a HUGE advantage. The rest of the shop is cosmetics, for the most part, but it still irritates me how they can expect me to pay just to use half the damn hotkeys.OVERALL - 6/10: don't play unless you can payEDIT: I played this game off of Steam, so I have a lot more hours on-record than what it says			"

Well I cant decide but you might be able to if you try it. its fun you might just find yourself hooked. A note though is that as of this review the game is having all sorts of issues launching from Steam. You can download it with Steam but then you will most likely need to launch from the games exe.

												You seriously won't wanna play this game because it may be good in some people eye but when you play it, the game become a game where you have to spam. The spamming part is in arena where if you battle a Rose you can't do anything at all and make you a sitting duck. Plus this game is so not children friendly and will make you rage mostly, the arena.			"

												This game is extremely fun when you play with friends or a guild. However most people quit right away for specific reasons. One of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. In order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. Then decide if you want to PVP or PVE or both. At the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. As far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money.There's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. You have to buy a B slot so you can use your other skills. Elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.Negatives are:-Half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids.-Costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though.-Grindier at the higher levels-Not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. Since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. Guides are nice but everyone has a preference.-Events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.Positives are:-Fast paced side scrolling action. It's not a point-and-click game. It's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based.-Every boss is different and unique.-New content continously-When you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts!-Getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. El shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ED from dungeon runs.-Pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so I would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot.-My favorite reason for playing Elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!As for typical ratings here they are!4/5 For gameplay4/5 For content [We usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on NA server]2/5 For community [Good friends are a jewel and people always come and go]1/5 For affordability [Cash shop super over priced]5/5 For customization [Tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have 3 different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes! Mounts were recently released so there aren't many yet!]2/5 For customer support3/5 For gamepad support [Better off using custom keys on gamepad]			"

												Typical RPG, good for procrastination.I read reviews and decided to play this essentially as a single player game. Lowered my expectations greatly and helped me avoid disappointment.Things that annoyed meInventory is absolutely miniscule, you'll fill it up in a few hours of play. Pay to inventory.Half of your 8 skill slots are locked. No game design sense at all.Half of your 6 items slots are locked. Not as bad because most potions have a 1 minute shared cooldown.Market system has little functionality; search by name and item type and thats about it. No price sorting, no quantity sorting, just terrible.Very little sense of community; to enter a dungeon, just click the button in the top right corner and you'll be put into a queue, no matter where you are. PvP arena is the same. Players rarely congregate in any one area due to this.Questline is boring and repetitive; consecutive quests in the same questline will direct you to the exact same dungeon over and over. Gender locked class system; everyone looks the same.Features that kept me mildly interested for a whilePlayer made combos; for those who like combos based off animation cancelling, this is a good way to spice up your gameplay, takes some practice though.Gender locked class system; easiest excuse to play a loli.Designated 'training room' to practice combos; you don't actually bother with comboing in dungeons though.NPCs saying Annyeong all the time.Try it out, I get bored grinding my face off, not for everyone I guess.

Also, I probably won't understand a lot of this find hidden files stuff. So if you could explain it a bit simpler for me, thanks.I've tried deleting Elsword, and such. Doesn't work.My Surface 3 plays Elsword though. I also can't find Game Guard in ANY of my programs. And not a couple months earlier I could play Elsword, but lately this Gameguard has come up.I've tried watching videos, reading forums. But I don't understand it.I also cannot right click Elsword shortcut and pick Open as Adimastator. I only have Open.Can anyone help?This Gameguard has comepletely ruined my love for Elsword.			"

												My friend got me addicted to this game a while back and I really enjoyed it. There are lots of events and recent updates. PVP is pay to win but have real skill, max level, and decent gear you can win. I play games when I feel like and with all the constant changes I get overwhelmed and stoped playing. If you love anime and combo mmorpg's then this is for you.Pro's-Constant events and updates-Anime style graphics-High level max(currently lvl85)-Dungeons, Raids, and Fields/PVE-PVP seasons-Skills-Professions-Anime-Characters with first and second job change(aka class)-Pets-Items-Player market(list items for trade and buy items for sell by players)-You can get almost anything in game with standard currency(just need some connection)-AnimeCon's-Constant events and updates-Expensive premium currency/shop(about $40 for a costume on one character)-Pay to win pvp-Grinding for levels, gear, and items(one of the very few things I can't stand)-Hoplessly long questsReplay value: inf/10 ~ 2 addicting.Overall: 9/10 ~ Love this game too much.

There's also an arena were you can test your new found skills against deadly foes in a 1v1 match, or if 1v1 isn't enough, try the 3v3 CO-OP battles! You can also team up with friends and go on quests to fight powerful bosses! There's so much to do and so much to see in the magical land of Elrois so don't hesitate for a second, play Elsword now!

												I don't usually break my habit of lurking, so that should say something about this game. I've been playing this game for years now, having joined just after it got out of beta testing, way before it made it on steam. This game is, at its core, a game with brawling combos. If you don't like those, or sidescrolling, don't play this game. Otherwise, there's no reason not to give it a try. That being said, I've been witness to many ""problems"" people have with the game, so I'll go ahead and list them, as well as my reasons why people shouldn't be quite as put off by them as they are:1. Stamina - Stamina is infamous. When it's depleted, your character no longer has the ability to enter dungeons (disregarding the special boss rush dungeon Henir). I'm honestly not as put off by this one as many, as it allows you to focus on multiple characters without burning out one by playing that for days on end. In addition, weekends have unlimited stamina, so push your mains all you want on those days.2. The field system - this is only a issue with other players who miss the old system. I don't actually have many oppinions on this other than that the fields provide an incredible source of exp, which will prove handy later on.3. Exp tables - I will admit that the exp tables for this game seem rediculous at some times, especially when viewed in comparison to the original KR version. That being said, the fields, as well as the 15% exp medal obtainable from killing field bosses, alleviate this fairly well, and despite what many might try to tell you, NA does not have the worst tables. In the end, though, this is an MMO. What were you expecting?4. Cash Shop - Yes, we have a cash shop. The main value of the cash shop is for costumes, accessories and the like. There are items in there to let you bypass certain grinding quests for class changes and the like, but these aren't that big of an issue. There is one bigger issue, though, and that is the B-slot. Plainly stated, this item increases your skill holding section by 4 slots, which sounds like it would be a massive help. It really isn't all that much. Especially given that the field revamp made it possible to switch skills while in a dungeon, this item has become a luxury. On top of that, I've actually lost pvp matches becuase my mind couldn't keep up with the B-slot's additional buttons. Get it if you want it, but don't think it gives you a broken advantage ala play-to-win.5. Skills - This is the one most people who used to play the game before the revamp have issues with. Originally, you were limited by prereq skills rather than having to make choices. The end result was cookie cutter skill builds for everyone playing the same class. Under the new system, you have to pick one of two skills every five levels. Some people see this as limiting, but I feel it improves the uniquness of your character compared to the many others. That being said, KR recently implemented a multiple page system, allowing you to hold two skill pages where you can pick the other of the two options if you feel like it. All in all, a revamp was necessary given how the old system was abused, and for all the people who feel that classes they play are worthless now that they have to choose, I can only say I'm still enjoying my TT, who went from top tier to near bottom as a result. Deal with it.There may be more reasons people don't like the game, but all in all, most of them a tiny preferential things. This being said, there is no reason no to give this game a try, as although many of the afore mentioned people have attempted to ""rage-quit"" elsword, they have yet to find any game quite like it.

												I like Elsword, even if it feels a little ""dated"". Is the game as an anime styled mmo side scroller beat'em up, or a side scrolling beat'em up with mmo elements? Well I cant decide but you might be able to if you try it. its fun you might just find yourself hooked. A note though is that as of this review the game is having all sorts of issues launching from Steam. You can download it with Steam but then you will most likely need to launch from the games exe.

												elsword..... elsword elsword elsword.well there isnt much to saybut its your typical  pay to win type of game, but what i like about this game is that you can gain some items by just ranking up and getting them from quests.the animation and visual effects of the game is pretty good too, does feel like a comic book in a way. the beat em up mechs works fine too, but they need to put more combos into the characters since x and z are the only buttons to hit for swinging a sword or wand. theres also specials, but you need to level them up for able to take critical damage from them. one problom i have with the game tho is the limited storage space they give you when it comes to your inventory, if you want extra space, you need to buy it. the pvp in the game is ok, but will tire out your fingers if your not used to quick doging, speaking of which, its a skill you have to unlock, you only near dogeing tatic is by jumping or running away.the players on elsword are mostly quiet, rarely do you find people talking to each other, but when you do, its a guild thats doing so or a group of hipsters.but the game is quite exciting and enjoyable to play for a few hours, at first, leveling up is simple, but when you reach level 25 and higher, it slows down. not to mention some quests or equipment require a level to play or use.if you dont spend any money on the game, you can still enjoy it, but prepare yourself on spending time clearing your inventory alot, since you gather items like crazy.i would give elsword a 8 out of 10			"

												My friend got me addicted to this game a while back and I really enjoyed it. There are lots of events and recent updates. PVP is pay to win but have real skill, max level, and decent gear you can win. I play games when I feel like and with all the constant changes I get overwhelmed and stoped playing. If you love anime and combo mmorpg's then this is for you.Pro's-Constant events and updates-Anime style graphics-High level max(currently lvl85)-Dungeons, Raids, and Fields/PVE-PVP seasons-Skills-Professions-Anime-Characters with first and second job change(aka class)-Pets-Items-Player market(list items for trade and buy items for sell by players)-You can get almost anything in game with standard currency(just need some connection)-AnimeCon's-Constant events and updates-Expensive premium currency/shop(about $40 for a costume on one character)-Pay to win pvp-Grinding for levels, gear, and items(one of the very few things I can't stand)-Hoplessly long questsReplay value: inf/10 ~ 2 addicting.Overall: 9/10 ~ Love this game too much.

												Alright so.Elsword Elsword Elsword...What i like:What can i say this game is one of its kind the gameplay the style the look and feel of the controles are well, Unipue. 2 - 3 years ago I never played a game like this before it was truely a keeper for me i left alot for months but the drive to leveling up more always brings me back to it i am a fan of Anime/Manga and this game is one for me i love it. the controles are easy to get use to dont believe me try going to Spar ingame and asking for help theres always someone there to help you no matter the situation whether it be a question on how to level up or ""where do babies come from"" someone will give you a funny remark or just stay with you to see what others say. What can i say the simplest of things make this game all the more entertaining.What i dont like:Now what i dont like about this game is there are alot of childish kids that love to how say ""Troll"" others and PVP for me is uhm well i admit i lagg and win some times i mean im not always the one lagging but i still get blamed for it, its a real put off alot of rage on this game happens people spamming you saying you will get banned its just annoying and others  say you spamming skills its cheating *facepalm*, it is hard to find that one player to hangout with and just play the game enjoy the world of elsword with. When you do find people to play with the game is fun but for me it was hard to find people i can really call friends on this because its rear to find a nice person theres ALOT of trolls so so so so many and most of them just try get your rear items or k-ching out of you it really bothers me.As of now i only play this game for my girlfriend she likes it so i stick with it.If you're new and want some advice i'll do my best to help just dont ask me for♥♥♥♥♥♥aight Peace.IGN: SirWoodz Level 70 RuneSlayer~			"

												I have played few more and less popular side-scroller games and I must say that I don't really understand success of Elsword. PvE quickly gets boring and with low level I don't think there is a need to play as punch bag on PvP. Cleared few dungeons, received some stuff that made me 40 level in instant, cleared another few dungeons and it's all the same. Crafting, making (or buying) new items and stuff didn't made me to stay for any longer. Maybe it's not my kind of game. Since Elsword is free to play game, check it out by yourself and decide if you want to stay longer or not.			"

I can barely play this game anymore because of that, and I guess it'll be a nice break from all of that (even though I lost Elsword for a month, comes back a few days later and now I have BSODs) - w-...I'm sad half my characters are dead since the 80 cap.

												This is a Good Game, Fun game. I've put in almost 1000 hours here on Steam and about 500 hours on Aeria games before Aeria screwed me, I enjoy this game highly it can be Pay2Win if you let it i have worked through as a Free2Play player fully through events and stuff and i am in S Rank in PvP as a free to play player AND Using a Controller instead of KeyboardI Am Disappointed that my computer keeps having errors with it but that is on my computers end not the gamesOverall it is a very fun experience and just ignore the haters if you pvp :P			"

												good game i have been reading some reviews of this game and none of them said that you can get most of P2W item with in game currency, some of them arent but you can gift them and the prices for them arent really that high you the most must buy item is skill slot B that cost aroun 70mil to to 120mil and taking into acount that you get 100+mil doing all story quest up to lvl 85 so you will get it and once you get really late gaem you can get easily about 200mil weekly so the game isnt a hard P2W taking into acount all of this.the good thing of this game-this game is unique there isnt a lot of game like this that isnt from the same dev-is fun to play and there is a lot of variety of classes to choose from-when you find people to with the game become a lot easierthe bad things about this game-this game is all about grind-this game is way to unbalanced you have classes that are garbage at everything they can do(im looking at you CrA ;w;) and others that are plently broken in everything they do(like luciel and ara)-lag-the community is mostly edgy kids and people that do a dungeon run while they wait to their league queue-the duns are repetitive and the aimations that at the start look amazing and inmersive are annoying later-bugs-dosnt have a banana weapon skin-the game dosnt even try to explian the most complex thing like socketing and enhacing-the tutorial is the most useless and annoying in this game -dosnt release some content because of money-having to run the same dun 3 and more times is boring			"

												This game could quite possibly be one of my favourite MMORPGs. My character has always been a DC Chung (LilSealand), and I've wasted plenty of hours on this amazing game. It's colourful, lively, and full of action. It's also loads of fun! However, I find it quite rigorous and annoying how you have to do all of these tasks just for job changes. Alongside this, I dislike how you have to spend real life currency on special items such as costumes. The items are far too expensive, in the first place! I also dislike how you have wait to be a certain level until you can do a certain quest. It kind of ruins the adrenaline of doing multiple quests in-a-row. Regardless, it's a nice game to chill with your friends and help each other out on quests. I love the characters and battles. The music and animation are also really gorgeous. Elsword is a beautiful and diverse game, just get ready for some minor cons and repetitiveness! :) Not everything's perfect, anyway.			"

												I love this game, but I reccomend staying away from PVP as much as possible. I'm good at it, but that's because I find combos no one gets out of... and I got lucky enough to get gear that you really only get by paying real money. This game has a bit of a pay to win problem, so, between a player that spent only just 20 dollars and a player that uses just what they get and grind in game, the 20 dollar person will win. Even just costumes can give large stat bonuses, so, if you want to enjoy this game, don't fight other players unless you get REALLY, REALLY GOOD. Those pay to win ppl are so OP you'll want to throw out your computer.On a side note, this game used to be a lot more balanced, so you new players are kinda getting the short end of the stick here. :P			"

												This is one of the most addicting games I've ever played. Perfect for both casual and hardcore gamers since this game has difficulty options for the dungeons and if one of the tasks requires you to play on a higher difficulty, you can party with players which takes the game to whole, new level. Unlike other MMORPGs, you can still succeed even if you're F2P. The characters in the game are unique, creative, and all possess different styles of play and to add to the game's replay value, you can attain multiple classes (or awesome new forms) for each and every character. YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												First off let me say that anime games and jrpg games are not usually my thing. I know this isn't a jrpg game but you get the picture. I tried this game because it was free and had action based combat. Turns out I love it. The graphics are anime graphics but in a good anime way. Very colorful, like video game candy on your TV. The characters/classes although gender locked, are fun to use, fight with and dress up. The community is very much alive. The dungeons get a little repetitive but that is tolerable because where this game really shines is the combat. It flows effortlessly from your gamepad/keyboard to your screen. Combos upon combos with specials upon specials. Whether beating up AI or fighting PvP in arenas.. it's all good in this one. I would recommend this to fans of anime, side-scrolling beat'em ups, even those who never really play this genre. It's fun and easy to get into.			"

It does the job it promises very well, it's a pure 10 for it's very unique design, and don't mix it with Maple Story, Elsword is a new century side-scroller, Maple Story is in a different league, Maple Story is a Legend, Elsword is a Rising Star. 10 out of 10 with not doubts about it's score.

												Other than the PvP system being a rage simulator everything else is good :3 Like for real, you either win a fight to be called a ""no skill spammer"" or lose a fight to be called a ""noob"" :DHaving said that, I do recommend this to people who would like an arcade, combo system, anime styled game. Not to mention, the community is very lively and the game is always growing. A game you will run back to :P			"

												(This review will be edited over the course of Elsword updates)This game is so awesome:Pros:- 10 different characters to choose from, with 3 different job paths for each one, giving them a variety of different skills and playstyles- The leveling up for starters is uper fast, and once you get past level 30-40, the leveling gets more challenging- There's an Elsword website which keeps you updated on every single tiny thing added or announced, so that's awesome- A PVP (Player VS Player) Mode which pairs you up with a random player to battle- A dungeon mode you can play with friends or randomly matched people to complete in-game story quests- The characters' voices were originally in Korean, but now KoG is slowly revamping each character with some fresh new English voice lines, and they sound awesome!Cons:- The PVP system is kind of unfair, you always get paired up with some Elsword veteran who ends up demolishing you with an endless combo, but i don't really see any way to fix that- This game is kind of P2W, having you spend money on the in-game currency, K-Ching, to get the good costumes and stuffAside from that, the game is great! I totally recommend this! 9/10BANTHUS APPROVED.			"

												First off let me say that anime games and jrpg games are not usually my thing. I know this isn't a jrpg game but you get the picture. I tried this game because it was free and had action based combat. Turns out I love it. The graphics are anime graphics but in a good anime way. Very colorful, like video game candy on your TV. The characters/classes although gender locked, are fun to use, fight with and dress up. The community is very much alive. The dungeons get a little repetitive but that is tolerable because where this game really shines is the combat. It flows effortlessly from your gamepad/keyboard to your screen. Combos upon combos with specials upon specials. Whether beating up AI or fighting PvP in arenas.. it's all good in this one. I would recommend this to fans of anime, side-scrolling beat'em ups, even those who never really play this genre. It's fun and easy to get into.			"

												Okay, This game is pretty fun. First impressions will leave you at the conclusion at the fact Its an Anime/Manga game. A 2d/3d sidescroller with quite a few ways to play, Has a nice leveling system, The quests are fun to do and most of the time require you to wipe out a dungeon by yourself or with your friends. I Recommend this game as a F2P game.			"

												This game could quite possibly be one of my favourite MMORPGs. My character has always been a DC Chung (LilSealand), and I've wasted plenty of hours on this amazing game. It's colourful, lively, and full of action. It's also loads of fun! However, I find it quite rigorous and annoying how you have to do all of these tasks just for job changes. Alongside this, I dislike how you have to spend real life currency on special items such as costumes. The items are far too expensive, in the first place! I also dislike how you have wait to be a certain level until you can do a certain quest. It kind of ruins the adrenaline of doing multiple quests in-a-row. Regardless, it's a nice game to chill with your friends and help each other out on quests. I love the characters and battles. The music and animation are also really gorgeous. Elsword is a beautiful and diverse game, just get ready for some minor cons and repetitiveness! :) Not everything's perfect, anyway.			"

												It's an okay game with a nice amount of characters you can play as. Each of them can choose one of three classes to specialize in. The dungeons aren't terribly difficult early on (though the Secret dungeon which is essentially the area's bonus boss may murder you).The game is kinda cash-heavy. You don't need to spend any to play (though the Mana Necklace would definitely help. As will the Skill change medal for PvP) but the costumes/accessories they release tend to appeal to some people's cosmetic senses. Unless you're buying a limited-time rare outfit, you should wait til discounts around Black Friday/Christmas before buying anything. Your wallet will thank you.Sometimes the game will give you ways of earning free K-ching (their cash shop currency) so be sure to stay updated by checking out the site's news.			"

												I have played this game for awhile now +800 hrs, yes life wasted. This game can be pay to win for those people that waste hundreds of dollars to get +10,+11 for there weapon. Money is also wasted on skills, skill pages, pets, mounts, and costumes that are way over priced practically $25 just for one costume. PvE is somewhat repetitive, my only focus was PvP for that reason. Now PvP I recommend you stay away from it, its not worth the time to waste to get good. This is how practically every match goes, outplay the opponent the whole match than opponent gets one catch gg its over. PvP is filled with people that are gear carried especially in the higher ranks. Of course one would say just to get geared yourself but than another issue arises which is connection. This games connection in pvp is quite horrible I live in the U.S. I would get matched up with people in Europe or South America. Servers are bad practically every match is lag heaven. I dont mind getting destoyed by gear carried people and if it were just that issue I would recommend this game but the lag in PvP killed it for me.  If your willing to deal with the issues this games has than by all means download it and waste your life on it like I did trying to get decent gear in order to not get destroyed in PvP by laggy gear carried people. If your gonna stick to PvE than have some friends with you it would make it less boring and make it seem a little less repetitive. All in all its somewhat pay to win, with decent PvE, and PvP that would be great if I didnt always face someone from a different country.			"

												It's not a very in depth game, lacking much of a story and is repetitive when making multiple characters. That being said, this game makes up for it in it's simplicity of diverse skill trees and plethora of combos, especially if you just want to play a game every once in a while to fight on random monsters, find some items, make a party, or just kill time. It's not ground-breaking in this day and age, but for a free game in it's genre, it's definitely worth a play or two.			"

												Elsword is one of the games that i have played most. It fun, fast paced, and helped me connect with some friends. Anyone who is interested in playing this game should try it out as it allows you to fully customize your character and gives free costumes about every month unlike other MMORPG's. Although the dungeons get repetitive, they are always adding more content for us dedicated players. Whether you are a lonely old man, a nerdy high-school student or a person looking to take a break from life, Elsword is a game for you.

Well forget all that becuase after the nerf update i dont even feel the game is fun or anything close to what it used to be. Plus they added ♥♥♥♥♥♥ english dubs that sound like garabage and new uncessary combos for new or casual players for what ever reason. would gave this game 5/10 olny because I like how they added more depth to the story/lore of game.Download the game if your new, you will probably like it.

												Honestly this game does get alot of well deserved flack, and for good reason, however because I have played alot and on two seperate servers, I will go into great detail why this game is worth your time, but not to much of your time.Firstly the combat is realitively simple to get to grips with, however the depth comes when applying skills, combos, and even class play styles and changes into the mix. Each character is fairly uniqe, minus the EL siblings, and all play diffrently to one and other.Elsword: standard sword play with a gauge that rewards you for switching your combo attacks and grants bonuses for skills, has a job path that increases sword skill, a job path that adds magic projectiles and fire to the mix, and a job path that gives you a second sword that can shred through enemys.Aisha: Standard mage, nothing much more then that, 1 job path gives you more elemental magic, the second one gives you some destructive dark magic, and the third one gives you ""Kawaii Magic Girl"" powers (this job is cancer in pvp)Rena: the ranger that will kick things, one job gives more arrow combos, one gives more kicks, the other gives traps and a sword.Raven (personal favorite): Slice enemys apart with your sword then blast em to peices with your Nasod (robot) arm, one job improves your Nasod arm punches, One improves you sword skills (recomended), and the final one gives you overheat abbilitys with various buffs and debuffs.Eve: comand various Nasod's with basic comands and use electricity to harm enemys, one job gives you servents, one job gives you tools of destruction (and a tank), and the third makes you shoop da woop.Chung: small kid with gaint dual end canon, you can smack the crap out of people or blow the up with canon fire. One job makes you smacking stronger, one gives you smaller lighter pistols while boosting your movement, and one gives you grenades mortors and a LOT of rockets.Ill finish writing this later and doing the other characters. overall worth your time so long as you dont go into pvp.

												I have played this game for awhile now +800 hrs, yes life wasted. This game can be pay to win for those people that waste hundreds of dollars to get +10,+11 for there weapon. Money is also wasted on skills, skill pages, pets, mounts, and costumes that are way over priced practically $25 just for one costume. PvE is somewhat repetitive, my only focus was PvP for that reason. Now PvP I recommend you stay away from it, its not worth the time to waste to get good. This is how practically every match goes, outplay the opponent the whole match than opponent gets one catch gg its over. PvP is filled with people that are gear carried especially in the higher ranks. Of course one would say just to get geared yourself but than another issue arises which is connection. This games connection in pvp is quite horrible I live in the U.S. I would get matched up with people in Europe or South America. Servers are bad practically every match is lag heaven. I dont mind getting destoyed by gear carried people and if it were just that issue I would recommend this game but the lag in PvP killed it for me.  If your willing to deal with the issues this games has than by all means download it and waste your life on it like I did trying to get decent gear in order to not get destroyed in PvP by laggy gear carried people. If your gonna stick to PvE than have some friends with you it would make it less boring and make it seem a little less repetitive. All in all its somewhat pay to win, with decent PvE, and PvP that would be great if I didnt always face someone from a different country.			"

												Pros-Balanced , Diverse fighting styles for each character, Multiple classes for each character, Fun, Addictive, Great PvP.Cons-Region Blocked, avatars gained from class changes are only temps, voice acting isn't dubbed.Mixed Opinons-It is interlocked with the fellow KoG Games mmo Grand Chase as Elesis was one of the original 3 characters of said mmo and in the data Aisha and Rena are called Arme and Lire, the Grand Chase characters they resemble and fight like.

												i love the action combat its some of the best ive ever played even early on and the game i very beautiful but i do have a couple complaints the game gets very repetative very fast but the fun combat makes up for that some my other complaint is the combat seems too easy at time to the point that when i made my first character i didnt die untill i was level 30 and the max im pretty sure is 60 the only difficult fights i ever did have prior was the few times i tried out the pvp but it was kinda easy too becouse once you get your enemy in a stunned mode from your hits you can just unload on him and theres nothing they can do to get out of it but over all its a fun game and if you wondering about which charector to choose i chose add and he seemed pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥and very fast pace even compared to other charectors when i tried them out			"

												Elsword's leveling system is a blast. The combos. The skill. The mastery. It's all there.If you're into fast paced fighting games and want some casual character progression along with it, this game fits the bill.However PvP, the primary game mode for more competitive individuals, is plagued by lag. PvP runs via peer-to-peer connections, so if your opponent has a terrible connection, you're in for a bad time. Your competitive experience will be inconsistent, and you'll lose many matches along the way to the top due to internet connection exploits and general peer-to-peer nonsense.Casual PvE: A+Competitive PvP: C-			"

												This game has been a favorite of mine for some time. Now normally i'm not really into side scrolling games but this game called out to me for some reason when I was on an MMO kick way back. I got into the game when it originally just had three classes. The swordsman, mage, and archer. The classes themselves are gender locked so people might not take kindly to that. I originally wasn't, but soon came to tolerate it. I moved my character around, edited some keyboard settings and felt right at home with how I adjusted things. The skill tree in this game is very unique and goes a long way as you ""evolve"" your class. Now, there are many different character classes to choose from and you can choose three seperate class ""routes"" you would like to take according to your play style. While for the pvp it seems like the gear is pay to win but I found myself able to win against higher level players at just level twenty or so with average gear. THe game plays fair, the story is nor more in-depth that it was before, and the gameplay mechanics run very smoothly even on my crap computer. All in all I would definately have to give this game a 9/10 for my personal score but for publi I would say it's a 7/10 due to not everyone liking the anime-style graphics and side scrolling gameplay.

												If youre looking for a fast paced PVP gameplay or just downright grinding between dungeons and fields then this is the game for you.  There are things that would make your life easier if you use the cash shop but it doesnt mean that it is P2W.  You can do everything without having to use the cash shop.  Of course if you want to have a little more leisure and easy inventory managment the cash shop will help you.  In all a great game to try out and stick to if you like it.			"

												This game is amazing. The amine style adds to the style of combat. The items and equipment look so cool! It's not that hard to obtain equipment the looks appealing, which is a good thing if you ask me. The multitude of combos one can string together make this game's combat so much better and makes skill much more rewarding than just spamming an attack or going for the over powered spells. The 2d gameplay is fun, and add to the anime basis from which this abviously was designed. All in all, a great game with hours of addicting gameplay.			"

												I think it's a fun game. Unlike most free to play games, this game doesnt feel like you are limited with a paywall and that I cant beat this level or game without paying. Also, all the cash shop really does is sell costumes and mounts. while yes the mounts can be used in combat, they arent overpowered in any sense. I have not paid for anything in this game and i find it to be a fun sidescrolling beat-em-up. On the other hand the game can be a little repetitive for some items, but overall it's fun.			"

												Its an amazing game except for the lack of fair pvp, for example the new character luciel is extremely overpowered in pvp and some if not most classes are long range or have a way for the combos to never end which the character will never get to fight back. its a great game other than the pvp mechanic/character combos8 out of 10			"

												I remember when I first played this game and the newest character was the trap. Then we got 2 more. The PvP needed a LOT of work put inot it, becasue I kept gettting matched with people that were around level 50 or 45, when I was Lv20 and it was not fair. This was pretty much the only bad thing I remembe rfrom this game. It has an interesting world and some cool characters.			"

												This game is pretty addictive. Dont play this if u not willing to spend 5 hours a day on this game.The game is designed to be free-to-play. Well its true u dont have to spend any cash on this game,the game can be enjoyed without a dollar spent. Events frequently give free stuff. Almost all the cash shop item or stuff u suppose to get thru cash shop are  available on board (the game black market) and cost ED (money u get thru dungoen). But dont be fooled, u will eventually learn that no mattter what, u will still have to give KOG some money. All the best gear can only be obtain thru dungeonDownside of this gameThe pvp is not balanced. Even KOG admit themselve some of the class are better suit for pve, some are born for pvp.Balancing update often happen ( sometime they make good change, sometime not).Overall a well designed game. Might worth ur time. If u spend enough time time on it (not recommend) its will be really fun.Reccomend void sever (u can find it on the internet, type void elsword). If u doesnt live in United State or any region near NA, u can try the game on other region sever like INT (coming soon), Korea (hard to sign up), and gameforge sever (EU) "

												Elsword is a fun game in general with surprisingly a lot of content.The side-scrolling style of gameplay makes the game unique from most other MMORPG's and is simple to navigate through. The game can be played either on the keyboard or on a gamepad; picking either one is based on preference. The story is quite interesting but if players are not interested, they can skip through the story if they want. Elsword has a variety of characters and class progressions so players can make themselves different from one another. As well as Skill Progressions, which make players even more unique. Leveling up your character is easy in the beginning and getting to your first class makes a small giddy feeling in some people. Leveling up becomes harder as you progress through the game and so do the monsters.The PvE aspect is quite interesting. The player can either find themselves playing in a Dungeon or in the Fields. Both have monsters and bosses. The level designs are very creative and shows that a lot of effort was put into making them. My favorite dungeon so far takes place in the town Lanox, ""Ash Covered Village"". Toward the last part of the dungeon, your party are left on a giant rail cart and the cart speeds down into the mines of the village which is in the background. Visually it is my favorite dungeon. The Fields are a good place to grind up on quests and leveling up your character.The item-revamp from earlier seasons made the Equipment system simpler. No longer were characters forced to find specific pieces of gear for a specific character-class. It became much much simpler. Organizing is easy and there is a ""Organize"" button if players don't feel like organizing themselves. Just don't spam the button. Crafting is also a necessity in the this game. Players can craft weapon, equipment, potions, etc. Players can also enhance their items through the Blacksmith which enhances your stats. Or players can give their gear some valueble elemental attributes which varies depending on individual playstyles. Players learn as they play through the game learning these aspects becomes a must.If players want to give their character some flash, they can spend real money in the Item shop. There are a large variety of goods in the shop. You can spend money to buy a pet, buy accessories, buy more inventory space, skill notes, customization options, the costume sets or the Ice burners that carry mysterious and rare goodies. However, in my personal opinion Ice Burners are not entirely safe to spend on for the goods that are found are ULTRA RARE statistically. Occassional events in the game are fun. They liven up the game somewhat and allow the player to gain some special items as well. And cool new stuff gets announced in the Item Mall. Best be on the look out!The most important aspect of the game would be the community. In Elsword, I found myself participating in almost every way I could in order to find and interact with other people. In one mode in particular known as Sparring mode, I found many different people speaking in these premade sparring rooms. Conversations are fun and are a joy to have. Guilds also offer many opportunities to speak with others and as a little bonus, that guild gives you buffs to help you through the dungeons. There are a lot of people in Elsword so players will be able to meet someone they can talk with. While there are some folks on Elsword that may be antogonistic, the majority of the people online are open-minded and refrain from being negative. Besides MMORPG's are best played with friends.Overall, like I said, Elsword is a fun game. It's constantly getting more and more content and has a very nice community.I would recommend this.			"

												This game has been a favorite of mine for some time. Now normally i'm not really into side scrolling games but this game called out to me for some reason when I was on an MMO kick way back. I got into the game when it originally just had three classes. The swordsman, mage, and archer. The classes themselves are gender locked so people might not take kindly to that. I originally wasn't, but soon came to tolerate it. I moved my character around, edited some keyboard settings and felt right at home with how I adjusted things. The skill tree in this game is very unique and goes a long way as you ""evolve"" your class. Now, there are many different character classes to choose from and you can choose three seperate class ""routes"" you would like to take according to your play style. While for the pvp it seems like the gear is pay to win but I found myself able to win against higher level players at just level twenty or so with average gear. THe game plays fair, the story is nor more in-depth that it was before, and the gameplay mechanics run very smoothly even on my crap computer. All in all I would definately have to give this game a 9/10 for my personal score but for publi I would say it's a 7/10 due to not everyone liking the anime-style graphics and side scrolling gameplay.

												Played it way before it came out on steam, cool thing is you can play it with controller, not P2W, other than that...meh, just a 3D Platformer Dungeon Crawler, I don't have anything negative nor positive to say for it, I recommend it if you like platformers			"

												The best way to describe it is it's kind of like a fighting game like SSB or Street fighter, yet not as complicated. If your going to play totally free you need to spend as much time as possible with the freebe stuff they give you, because every item is timed to expire making difficult you forge ahead. Expect to pay >$10 to get a real good expereience out of this, but otherwise a solid game if you can manage to level up & take on higher level challenges.			"

												This game is fun. The combat is great, characters look amazing, and its free.... or is it?I would still recommend this game but i need to let you all know this ahead of time, the costumes don't last.you have 7 days for when you first create your character, then once u get a job change you have 10 with the new costume, haven't got to the last job change yet.So they have this feature where you can pay for outfits and skins, which as much as i hate that, i proabaly would buy it, until today where i find it says it lasts for 30 days....I'm sorry, but thats a rip off. They expect someone to shell out more then 10 dollars for a full set of outfits for one character and it only lasts 30 days? whats the point!So if you don't mind your character looking dumb if you don't play the game constantly, then get it, like i said, its a good game, just not worth selling out 15 bucks for 30 days of looking awesome.

												I've really been struggling to find a decent enough game to play. Then, my boyfriend suggested going to the ""Free to Play"" games. Which I plum forgot about to begin with. SO! Afterwards I finally found this game called Elsword. Watched the little preview on the gameplay and I immediately wanted to play it. With my internet connection it took about an hour or so to download. I patiently waited for it to come to an end. I have been playing this game for close to 15+ hours now. It's new user friendly, the screen would otherwise seem overlycrowded. It has hot keys for everything and the gameplay is really captivating. I think everyone should give this game a go. I have been chatting with no other than friendly anime lovers such as myself. Everyones super helpful and the time I put into this game is definitely well spent. I've always used my xbox controller when playing most games on here. This game makes me feel comfortable enough to use my keyboard and all its buttons with confidence. Not to mention.If you're a girl or guy that gets quite the kick out of being able to fully customize your characters.This game provides. I know what most people think of free games that require you to actually buy virtual merchancise.But, this game has alot to offer. If you dont believe me at least give it a shot.After all, it is free.Isn't it.I probably won't ever stop playing this time. Not once, have I experienced any issues with installing, booting and the servers are always open.Did I mention you can have pets and mounts?!			"

												For those who love a good strategy beat em up (also bonus for anime lovers), Elsword is a good pick. There is a variety of characters to pick (essentiallly, each character is a class) and each one has many jobs that you can gain through story quests. Although a bit slow, there is some nice progression, and a decent skill tree.My Gripes:-The building feature is to choose between two different skills-The stamina feature is a downer.

												You like manga/anime themed art styles? Of course you do that's why you're here right? Ok anyways it's a very smooth 2.5D fighting game. Think mmo Smash Bros. (Has anyone played Viewtiful Joe)? But yeah the crafting system is pretty easy to get the hang of and the community is excellent so give it about an hour of play and see what you like after all it is free-to-play.  Speaking of which, lets talk about that for a sec, you dont need to worry about pay to win because this game showers you in events for all sorts of goodies. This can also be a negative thing though because your storage is, in my opinion, wayyyy to small to begin with. PvP is ALRIGHT not perfect though. I like to think of pvp as Super Smash Bros. with friends but with PRIZES. Also pvp lobbies are  used as a chatroom often so thats kind of cool. The game music is pretty freakin awesome by the way, you can tell they know what they're doing when it comes to setting the musical mood for a good butt kickin. Anyways back to the graphics the manga-themed aesthetic is really pleasent for anime fans to look at but  some of you simply might not enjoy that art style so it could impact your feelings, but hey, thats fine because if you're still reading this then chances are you already feel comfortable with the art.Another nice thing about this game is it doesn't take up much space on your hard drive. In fact it doesn't require you to have a super nice computer. Minimum requirements is 256MB of RAM and 32MB of VRAM. Cpu speed needs at least 800MHz.     Recommended however would be 512MB RAM 128MB of VRAM and 2.7GHz of Cpu speed. So I would probably give it a 8/10 for general judgement, and a 9/10 for my own personal biased judgement  (ANIME themed 2.5D fighter!)TL;DR  Anime Fighter like Super Smash Bros, but with PvE elements a good fighter game to take casually that also has a nice sound track.

												Honestly, this game at its core is just a fun game to play. I'm not a hardcore gmer with any game, by any means, but this is one of my favorites. The level design is pretty entertaining, and the story to the game is actually pretty interesting (if you actually pay attention to it). There are peple saying that the original characters in the game can't even stand up to the new ones in PvP, but I have to say that's a load of crap. I play thefourth character made, using the class with the lowest range(in the whole game), and I can easily kick butt no prob. The only problems with this game is the low inventory space, if you're a person who needs to keep every single item, this game is not for you, you can get through the game pretty easily without buying the extra space, but you'll do a lot of item discarding. Honestly, I would just say play the game, its really fun and will keep you entertained for quite a while.			"

												Firstly, please don't let my hours fool you, I have many hours spread over various accounts.Elsword is a side-scrolling MMORPG. It has a 2.5D perspective that works suprisingly well with the game's design.It features beautiful backgrounds and some platforming elements. Even if you don't like platforming games, giveElsword a go, I hate platformers, but I love Elsword.COMBATIn Elsword, the combat is simple, but complex. You use Z and X along with the arrow keys to pull-off combos and you have 4 skills to use. A S D C. You can also buy a BSlot to get 4 more Q W E R. You use your combos and skills to kill monsters and bosses through fields (Open areas where you kill monsters along with other random players) and dungeons (instances where you team up with 3 other players to clear a dungeon area along with a boss at the end.)Now, If you are looking for an ultra-balanced MMORPG with competitive PvE and PvP, please leave. Elsword at its heartis more of a casual game. To contradict myself, it does also contain many competitive aspects, just don't expect them tobe balanced.But, please don't mistake this as me saying this game is bad and only for casuals. Elsword is very, very addicting and enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously. In order to enjoy this game, you will need to spend *SOME* money, but, contrary to what many people say, you don't honestly have to spend that much money. There are a few things that are more-or-less neccessary such as inventory expansions, but they are very cheap if you have any sort of income whatsoever. Other things such as Ice-Burners (Premium Costumes) (Costumes are cosmetic items that can be socketed in order to increase your stats) are not needed, thus you don't need to spend money on them, but they help.This is where my previous statement comes in. Elsword is a breath of fresh air if you don't treat it like WoW or LoL etc.. Its enviroments are light and airy, the music is nice and relaxing, and it's very fun to kick back and enjoy a few friendly arenas on a Friday night. What I would say to you is, try out the game, see if you enjoy the core combat and skill system and, if you do, play it. Don't worry about class balance, don't get angry, just relax and you'll love this game.Here's a list of things you'll NEED to enjoy the game if you really want to commit to Elsword. (Cost after the :.)Inventory Expansions:  Roughly $20 per character.Skill B Slot: $9 per character (But you can buy VIP, $10/month to get B slot on every character for duration of VIP).Bank Slots: $~9Overall, if you really want to commit to Elsword, buying VIP is a good way to kickstart your leveling and get some temporary BSlots (Btw, BSlots allow you to equip more skills.)If you have any more questions about the game, either message me on Steam, or add me on Elsword. My IGN is Vjyorsk. I'd be happy to help with anything you need. (As long as I'm not busy :)). Thanks guys :) Enjoy the game, it's awesome!			"

												Hello there. c: Well then, Where can I start? Elsword is a fun MMORPG game. Not the typical ""Create your character the way you want it to look like!"" Actually, that comes later. Instead, they give you several of characters to choose from, each having a different story, and three different routes to choose from. (Classes for example, If you choose Elesis, you have three Classes to choose from, each being different in their own special way, and having different combos.) The Good, Neutral, then Evil Route (In my opinion.) This is a slide scroller game, during Dungeons, and level grinding isn't that hard (During the weekends) Yet during the weekdays watch out from your Will/Stamina. Once you reach 0%, you may no longer play with that character. Yes you have the option to create more characters! Not just one, except there is a limit (I believe 6?) Now, as for customization, in this category it is a Pay - To - Win game. The customization gear comes with high stats to help improve your character to become ""better"" This is mostly used for PvP as well, yet in my opinion I would say to stay away from the PvP Community, because it's very cancerous (AKA stupid and annoying) If you're with friends, I would recommend this game because it's just really funny to see when people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. x'DFrom what I see in the community in general, if you don't pay to win, your character sucks. A lot.And it's true. For a B-Slot, you have to pay for that. If you mess up with your character skills, you have to pay for a restoration potion. Karma Koins are very expensive, seeing how $25 won't even give you a full costume. Probably a weapon and b-slot. Also, My IGN is Psychotropia (Or is it Psychotropic? I forget since I haven't played in a while.) I was a winner from one of Elsword's contests that they hold on their Facebook page. They gave me 400 K-Ching, which really isn't anything and you're most likely better off buying ice burners, yet that's gambling. So even 400 K-Ching won't get you anywhere. (That's saying something if you wanted to be cheap and input less money. Cause your wallet will most likely be empty if you play this game.)In short, Elsword is a Pay - To - Win game, I would recommend this game to those who don't mind spending money on a game. Eventually, you create a character, and you're bound someday or another to put in money. That's how I see it.I hope you guys have fun if you play this game. ; ^ ;			"

												I've been playing this game for about half a year now, and to sum it up in a general statement: the game is enjoyable as a side-scrolling RPG.Pros.-overall good community-fast playthroughs concerning dungeons (good for beginning a new character)-Good amount of events-Dont have to empty your wallet in order to be good-good handful of characters which have multiple different play stylesCons.-KoG needs to do some balancing of characters for the NA servers, not quite as smooth for certain dungeons when with other players.-Since the merge of communities rowdiness in PVP has skyrocketed (Whining complaining hassling etc.)It's a game kids. Relax.-FPS gets a very glitchy especially in situations such as henir and 3P-V-3P (Solution for the earlier note: find a program to help your FPS increase, Cortex for example- it'll decrease the whining about ""hackers"" cause you're probably facing someone with a better pc or is using a program like so because they're sick of the glitching.)And finally: -yes, sometimes a quest can be too repetitive- yes this could also be a positive thing when it comes to earning locked skills and extras for those dedicated to a character for a guild or just a general favorite, but it can also hinder progress in certain parts of the storyline.However despite the minor negatives it is still a very enjoyable game, allowing you to create a character which really fits your play syle. Whether you're into pro/casual gaming means nothing towards recomendation for this game, either way it's still enjoyable, and hope you have a blast.Rating: 9/10			"

												I remember when I first played this game and the newest character was the trap. Then we got 2 more. The PvP needed a LOT of work put inot it, becasue I kept gettting matched with people that were around level 50 or 45, when I was Lv20 and it was not fair. This was pretty much the only bad thing I remembe rfrom this game. It has an interesting world and some cool characters.			"

												I play this game for two years now (despite what my STEAM hours say). Honestly, I love the game. There is nothing like it. I main mage and archer character, and although they are mostly underrated because they are difficult to master, they are really fun. It is true that the game is kind of pay to win, but you can take advantage of events and you should be fine. I spend about 20 bucks on the game....not sure whether I regret it or not. I know there are a lot of not-recommends in this section because the balance is not exactly the best, and there are occassional lags in pvp. We've came to expect so much from this game that we get pretty upset if it doesn't meet our standards.The truth is, you won't play this forever. In fact, you might get bored in about a week, but this game does offer a great MMO experience. With only $20 spend, I would say that I am doing pretty well in the game PVP and PVE wise. I can go as far as SSS rank in pvp with just simple spar gear, but it does that time and experience with your character. I have made about 7 characters in the game that are all very useable. They are able to stand up to the game and all it's problems.Overall, this is a very good game. Try it out. It doesn't hurt. Don't pvp until at least lv 70. Take advantage of the events. I hope you find this review useful :)			"

												(NOTE): This is just a quick personal reflection on the character progression and loot system of Elsword. I enjoy the game for a lot of reasons, but the customization system can be different...This game is really fun, the character customization and progression has little to no limits, and is very great. However, most of the gear you pick up from enemies is usually unusable, with all the added classes in the past few years, which makes the chances lower and lower of getting a usable item. Most of the time, It's a higher level than you, or It's just plain useless. The majority of gear obtained from enemies just looks flat-out boring, and the cosmetic shop, where you can purchase items with the real money paid currency, has a very big inventory. However, about $10.00 worth of the purchased in game cash(forgot the exact name) will get you 1 or 2 cosmetic items pernament. because you'll probably end up renting them for a month at a cheaper cost. You can ad a few select stats. just for a boost.			"

												I have played this game for a long time 128.4 hours is just my steam account i have like 3 arc account, one on the normal  website and one on void elsword over all maybe 500 ish hours. Anyways I loved this game up untill the revamps hit. I played as an assult NW for the most part, but then the revamps hit. I couldnt play NW again it was just to diffrent. It went from a health bar melter to a stall and hope for the best class, but that is my personal class prefrence. After about three ish weeks I came back to see what some other classes where like, I found myself in love with lu/ciel it was fun simialr to NW and was reletivly easy to pick up. So if your a new player the first half of this will mean nothing to you and i would recomend this game all they way. You dont NEED to pay anything to go any were no matter what the other people say. Personally i still havent spent a cent on this game.			"

												Under documented studying and gaming of this game for almost 300 hours, Elsword is a spectacular platform game inspired with excellent 3d character based customizations, with the abiliity to get married to other characters presents a realistic experience with this excellent mmorpg. pros: 1. intense chaining of complexed skills and magic.2. electrifying and explosive skills to wreck havoc on opponents.3. optional character path for choosing and improving a players ability.4. massive boss raid.cons:1. experienced some players with inappropriate language.2. pvp's can be quite unfair.3. new character paths not available in all regions.I hope you enjoy my review.

												This game can be severely confusing at times, but overall it's a pretty good game. I've had it for a couple days, it's pretty easy to complete story quests, but standard quests potentially take a bit of time. The startup packs are quite helpful as you level up but I'm sure after level 40 it's a bit more difficult without the free packs. Anyways, I recommend it to everyone and if you need to know how to turn on sound effects let me know lol.			"

												Elsword's leveling system is a blast. The combos. The skill. The mastery. It's all there.If you're into fast paced fighting games and want some casual character progression along with it, this game fits the bill.However PvP, the primary game mode for more competitive individuals, is plagued by lag. PvP runs via peer-to-peer connections, so if your opponent has a terrible connection, you're in for a bad time. Your competitive experience will be inconsistent, and you'll lose many matches along the way to the top due to internet connection exploits and general peer-to-peer nonsense.Casual PvE: A+Competitive PvP: C-			"

												Hey I played Elsword for a long time. This game is actually pretty fun but it can be a climb on Mt Everest to get to lvl 60. But when you reach the max lvl, those days lvling and telling your parents going outside can go screw itself, you feel so achieved! (seriously I had that feeling.)Anyway, this game is not a pay to win, if you stick around long enough there are events that involve getting free costumes. Halloween is my personal favourite. However these items can be hard to get because of their rarity. People can always get the UK server for cheap costumes. This game is not pay to win, this game is a masterpiece. Beautiful anime designing, graphics and gameplay. I can't wait for Lanox (Ranox?) and Lu/Ciel's release and I have high hopes for this game.			"

												I liked the game because I liked playing the PvE of it.Not much of a PvP kind of person. But if you can deal with people getting mad at stupid things, than go ahead and try it out. (Or just try if you want to. No one is making you.)			"

												 I was drawn to Elsword because of it's graphics and LuCiel story line, however, I'm new to the MMo scene, so I was very apprehensive when I first downloaded the game. So far this game is great. It's very fun to play. I am confused with some f the controls- like how to use potions in the dungeons- but I think I'll figure it out along the way.			"

												This game has been a favorite of mine for some time. Now normally i'm not really into side scrolling games but this game called out to me for some reason when I was on an MMO kick way back. I got into the game when it originally just had three classes. The swordsman, mage, and archer. The classes themselves are gender locked so people might not take kindly to that. I originally wasn't, but soon came to tolerate it. I moved my character around, edited some keyboard settings and felt right at home with how I adjusted things. The skill tree in this game is very unique and goes a long way as you ""evolve"" your class. Now, there are many different character classes to choose from and you can choose three seperate class ""routes"" you would like to take according to your play style. While for the pvp it seems like the gear is pay to win but I found myself able to win against higher level players at just level twenty or so with average gear. THe game plays fair, the story is nor more in-depth that it was before, and the gameplay mechanics run very smoothly even on my crap computer. All in all I would definately have to give this game a 9/10 for my personal score but for publi I would say it's a 7/10 due to not everyone liking the anime-style graphics and side scrolling gameplay.

												If youre looking for a fast paced PVP gameplay or just downright grinding between dungeons and fields then this is the game for you.  There are things that would make your life easier if you use the cash shop but it doesnt mean that it is P2W.  You can do everything without having to use the cash shop.  Of course if you want to have a little more leisure and easy inventory managment the cash shop will help you.  In all a great game to try out and stick to if you like it.			"

												4,000 Hours+ Later (I was into this game before it went on Steam), this game is still terrible. Why?1. Bad NetcodingI usually get 5-15 Ping on TF2 Servers and I'm commonly accused of ping masking despite the fact that I just have good internet. But in Elsword, no matter how good your internet is, you're going to have bullcrap lag problems that can give you major advantages/disadvantages based on your character. I have people in Elsword saying that I have the ""worst internet they've ever seen,"" but they're generally new players who can't understand that the real problem is that the netcode is sh*t, and my internet is really fast.2. Character ImbalancesI have a saying in this game that perfectly describes how it is managed.""Out with the old, In with the new""Older classes/characters are generally thought of within a range of high and low. The newer characters are agreeably neither, and are regarded as 'god tier' by the community. Why, you ask? KOG likes to add ENORMOUS advantages to the newer characters for some reason, probably to get money from EXP medals and such. The Update that really started to screw up the balance many years ago was the S2 update, and it's just been going downhill from there. 3. CommunityBecause of KOG's always-broken balance, the players of the community spend most of their time ranting about how bad everything is rather than playing the game. A lot of players (specifically WS mains) tend to argue about the balance of their characters until no end just to defend their skill. There are a few good players that don't do this, but its generally something pretty dumb people do.4. PvPPvP has always been the only reason I ever still play this game. The only problem is how easy it is to get away with trolling/playing really cheaply. Players themselves have had to create a meta for how people should play so nobody gets trolled, but it still happens. Some people will stop at nothing to get those few extra rank points or another rank, even sacrificing their reputation along the way.5. P2PThere are lots of things that you can only get by being a P2P player (2nd skill slot, amirite?). The game is REALLY pay to play, and people that put their money into getting insane gear levels end up being ridiculously overpowered and can stomp on you pretty much regardless of your skill level. This has existed all throughout Elsword's history, but has become a MAJOR, MAJOR ISSUE when the economy started getting messed up.6. The EconomyProbably one of the worst parts of the game in general. Because of how P2P this game is, getting certain items REALLY matters, but that can be insanely hard with this economy. Prices are over-inflated to hell, and some sellers of Ice Burner sets are only taking cash because of how worthless ED has become. In this game, you'll find that some items are worth over 18 Billion ED. Starting from the bottom nowdays is VERY, VERY hard, and KOG refuses to do anything about it.7. The GrindIt used to be worse, but nobody likes grinding for their levels and gear. I'd much rather just PvP in the freaking game. Now the major problem is, Korea has different EXP tables than NA which makes the grind a LOT easier on them. This developers seem to only cater to the needs of the Korean players, and pay almost no attention to NA.TL;DR:Unless you find out a way to play the Korean Elsword, this is NOT a game you want to play.

												While I do love this game, there is a few problems with it.Pros:*Fast and fun action, especially with teammates.*The Graphics, while not groundbreaking, is pleasing to look at.*Every character is fun to play as and brings something different to the table, with Ara and Rena being my favorates.*There are a lot of good tracks in the game.Cons:*The game will often ""encourage"" you to spend some real money on the game. Things like Costumes, Extended skill slots, pets, etc.*Game can get grind-heavy later on, not like Maplestory grind-heavy, but in the very later dungeons you'll need to do a few dungeon runs before you can move on to the next mission.Overall, I do like this game, but I can say the microtransactions can be a turnoff for some. If you are interested in trying it, Play the game for a few hours, maybe go to lv30 or something, and then deside if it's worth investing a few bucks.*Update*: Okay, taking a look at the prices and I can say that some of these are insane. I think spending around $25 for a single costume set is a bit much. Then again, look at what we're paying Unusuals...			"

												A unique side-scrolling 2.5-D MMO with exciting events, and fun characters. However if you're interested in PVP you'll wanna make an Add character..... PVP is very broken and Add is OP as F***. The PVE is fun and interesting with a good number of updates, a recent one being the inclution of cutscenes at some boss encounters and dungeon beginings. The game is only slightly PTW, but not as badly as most other games. I wouldn't  waist my time on Ice Burners, the chance of getting something nice is.... well...... very slim. The differnt dungeon locations are nice and unique. All in all I'd give the game a 8/10 for PVE, and a 3/10 for PVP.			"

												Elsword is a great game with a fun battle system. from the manga style skill cut ins to the cute quirky characters, it's all around a fun game.However,The PvP community is one of the saltiest communities i've ever seen. for example, if someone wins, they'll likely gloat and say you suck. If they Lose, they'll call you a noob,runner,spammer, etc...The guild communities usually make up for this as well as the amazing story.  Also, despite what People say, Elsword is NOT Pay To Win. It's much closer to ""Pay to look cool in pvp"" Elsword can Be pretty grindy at times, but only when getting the final job change.I rate 7.5/10 Too much Saltwater.			"

												Elsword is an older MMORPG where you play as one of 10+ characters and go on a journey to defeat demons.The gameplay is a bit sticky at first, but you can easily get used to it. The PVE is a bit boring at times, but the PVP is where it really shines. It acts as sort of a fencing type game where if you land a hit, you need to know how to chain into other attacks.The characters each have their own personalities, and are unique in some ways or another. The game has equal fanservice between characters aswell, mostly leaning more towards males, but overall it isn't that kind've sexualization you see in other games.The music is pretty catchy at some parts, and isn't too bad, but like other games, you'll eventually want to turn it off. I keep mine on because I can ignore it.The game has a way of keeping your level the same as the area you're in, but it forces you to do the same dungeons over and over at later levels. This is both useful, but annoying at the same time.Overall, I say the game is about a 7.5-8/10. The game knows how to easily avoid P2W, and still allows you to acquire some things by using only microtransactions during events. So Elsword is COMPLETELY free.			"
