Be aware that so far only 2 episodes out of 4 are available. The 3rd episode is supposed to be released in January 2015 & the 4th about June 2015.I should start with the fact that initially i gave this game a negative review. AR-K was a total mess at launch; there were lots of glitches & bugs...BUT it changed a lot since then. All the bugs were fixed (at least the ones i've encountered), steam interface now works as well, and all the glitched achievements were also fixed, i tested them all myself. Lastly, starting episode 2,  a very cool feature was added - the narrator, which can give you clues on certain items. I was finally able to play both episodes from the start to the end without any problem.AR-K is an episodic point-and-click adventure with some very challenging puzzles, and has a very intriguing story which will keep you wanting more with every step you advance through the game. There are also a lot of funny moments which made me laugh out loud several time. One of the game's best feature is the voice acting. Simply outstanding, especially the main character. Overall, its a very enjoyable game. The only con left from my point of view is the resolution, which is 1280x768, and there is no option to change it from the launcher, it looks good enough in window mode, but if you choose to play in full screen - it will not scale up correctly and you'll also get a blurred picture as a bonus. However, the developer said, and i quote : ""The next two episodes will be made in 1920x1080"".Let's hope the next two episodes will be properly tested before released, so that players don't have to experience again similar problems, but so far AR-K is worthy of your time, and definitely deserves the attention of all classic point-and-click adventure players.

												There are two types of games I really hate to review: criminally mediocre games that you can't really say anything interesting about and games like AR-K, a game that has a lot of heart, but is like a busload of burning orphans careening off a cliff; a terribly executed, tragic waste of potential.   Update Within the day, I was contacted by one of the developers to tell me that they read my review and are working hard to make sure the next episodes live up to expectations.  That's great to hear!  By actually talking with me about my criticisms it reflects very well on AR-K's team and gives me even more reason to hope that it might come together and I can recommend it to everyone.  The review remains the same for now, but those interested in the community behind a work in progress may find that here. Back to the review How shall I start to explain the trouble that is AR-K?  I know.  Look around your computer and try and find a belt or length of rope.  Just trust me.  I'm going somewhere with this.  Got it?  Okay, now fold it in half, grab it firmly by each end and pull it taut.  Now rapidly move your fists inward and outward.  The flapping movement you are seeing is quite similar to how the main character's mouth moves in the first episode of AR-K; outside of cutscenes, anyway.You might think this is a minor gripe and adventure gamers have always had a knack for looking past poor and peculiar graphics.  And you'd be totally right.  But I'm only pointing out one teaspoon in an ocean of technical issues and bad presentation.  The volume of the spoken dialogue hasn't been normalized, there are a couple of misread lines, the subtitles have been poorly edited, you can't save on your own initiative or have multiple game files, the voices of characters are prone to change once or twice (probably artifacts from old voice actors), there's been some weird scaling when characters interact with each other, it took me about fifteen minutes to figure out how to get items from the inventory screen to interact with objects in the world, and the English localization has a few wrinkles.  That isn't even an exhaustive list.Alright, alright.  So that's all really quite terrible, but like I've said, we're fans of point and click adventure games.  We can forgive any kind of presentation in the name of good puzzles and and a good story.  Let's start with the puzzles then.  So, you've got an object on a high shelf that you want to get, a length of rope, and a large-breed dog.  What do you do?  Obviously, as an adult of average physical ability and a functioning brain, you ignore the rope and dog and climb the shelves, get a nearby box to stand on, or you just wedge your arm behind it and push it over.  But you're playing an adventure game so you're probably already conditioned to ignore logical brevity and will do exactly what the game expects you to do: combining rope A with dog B.  That's a puzzle in this game I found intuitive and logical and solved within seconds of its presentation.  So, dear god, what kind of anti-backwards madness-dimension logic must be employed for me to call this game a completely illogical mess that demands a walkthrough?Well, let's examine one puzzle from episode one that I like in theory, but was so horribly implemented it was unsolvable.  In AR-K, you play an investigative journalist and there was a puzzle based around you asking other characters about a policeman so that you could create some sincere-sounding flattery to get him to help you.  That's a totally awesome thing for a game about an investigative jounalist!  However, the hints you actually get don't correlate to the actual dialogue options you're presented with during the flattery, at best.  At worst, they're totally misleading.  For example, you're meant to get his first name from a bulletin board where various people have left posts.  Now, the names on the board include three of the four choices you have in the dialogue and absolutely none of the bulletins suggest character traits specific to an officer or to anything else you've learned about him.  In fact, the closest logical leap I could find is that one of them mentioned a feature of the specific area he was patrolling, so I assumed that must be the one.  Nope.  So to solve the puzzle you have to choose one of four dialogue options correctly four times.  The game will not tell you which you have gotten correctly and none of your hints are better than my example.  Oh, yeah, and in episode one you can't cut off dialogue you've already heard (at least I couldn't find a way).That's exceptionally awful.  And it's  doubly bad, because that's such a neat idea poorly done.  But it's not the worst.  Actually, episode one wasn't too bad.  There was one other highly questionable moment that I only solved by clicking everything I had on everything else for long enough to get a result, but only that dialogue puzzle sent me to a walkthrough.  Episode two, though....  Did I somehow kill your family without knowing it, episode two?  Is that why you tortured me so?  The first half was perfectly logical (well, dog-rope-shelf logical), but then there's a bit with a rat, and a trap, and you have to shoot it, and you have to... and you have to *rocking back and forth while crying*.  And then you're taking exams for some reason!?  WTF!?Okay, so the puzzles are half okay and half unsolvable moon logic.  That does not a good adventure game make.  But, hey, we've still got the story, right?  It's a noir thriller, with the cartoony charm of Sam & Max, and it's set in space - the best setting!  There's no way this could be bad, right?  Well, hmm.  It's okay.  Episode one starts off with a good noir hook involving a mysterious MacGuffin and ends with the uncovery of a sinister plot, a betrayal, and ominous forshadowing.  I even like the simple touch that we're playing a female investigator under the influence of a ""homme-fatale"" in a typically masculine genre.  However, episode one is just a lot of screwing around on a college campus with very little movement in the story.  It also doesn't help that the main character is kind of rough around the edges and performs some unlikable deeds.  And it's not so gut-bustingly funny that you can forgive the character's misanthropy like with your Sam & Max.  That said, episode two fixes all of those problems.  The plot thickens and things happen.  The protagonist actually appologizes for, say, maiming her mostly helpful roommate.  And, most importantly, a disembodied narrator is introduced that only the protagonist can hear.  There's some wonderfully funny lines between them and the narrator is able to voice our concerns with the protagonist's actions and manners.The narrator is also supposedly there to give you hints, but these are as helpful as the aforementioned clues with the policeman puzzle.So we've got a badly designed, technically messy game with a story that's all over the place.  No, I can't recommend this game.  I really wanted to.   If you had told me last week that I'd be playing a noir-themed adventure game in the style of Lucasarts or Telltale set in freaking space, I'd have said, ""Yes!  All of this!  Melt it down and inject it right into my eyeballs!""  I want AR-K to be the video game equivalent of the underdog kids in an 80s sports movie, where after a synth music montage with a robot, the devs crank out an adventure game that beats down the big bully Triple A teams that give adventure games wedgies.  Maybe it still can be that.  There are still two episodes that haven't been released and episode two was mostly an improvement over episode one.  In recent history, Tales of Monkey Island went from a mediocre first half to an adventure worthy of its pedigree.  I'll keep an eye on AR-K's upcoming episodes and maybe I'll have the good fortune to erase my work here and tell you how badly you need to play this game.  For now, though, I wouldn't.			"

												There's a character in AR-K who force-feeds her roommate vomit, sics her large dog on the same depressed roomie while he's perched on a second story window so that he falls, sleeps with a guy in order to ransack his apartment and kill his pets, and tricks her friend into getting arrested. The villain, you say? Actually, no. It's the protagonist.Another reviewer described the main character, Alicia Von Volish, as unrelatable, but for me it's worse than that. She is manipulative, narcissistic, destructive, petty, condescending, smug, crass, and cruel. The protagonist is a monster.			"

												Kickstarted this. Played both available episodes. This review initially did not recommend the game because of frustrating bugs. Shortly after posting it Sergio Prieto contacted me and fixed them within an hour and a half on a Sunday morning. + Fantastic customer support. Seriously, wow.+ The chains of logic are mostly reasonable so ""adventure game logic"" isn't too bad. + The voice acting for Alicia (from Ash Sroka, Tali Zorah's VA) is really, really good. It stands out above the rest of the cast, especially Episode 2's wildly inconsistent Narrator. No one in the cast is awful, just uneven in quality. Blaine and Nuno's VA are pretty good too.+/- The writing is uneven. Way too quick to break the fourth wall, characters jump from emotional state to another, the Narrator doesn't have a consistent dynamic with Alicia. It is also genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny at times. +/- Visually it is not good. It communicates what it needs to visually and cartoonish enough to Not Awful, but still not good.- The UI is awful. Example: First episode has 3 different sodas to use. Once collected there's no text identifying them in the menu. Just three nearly-identical items with disparate uses.- The UI is weird. Dialogue topics in the menu are treated like items that you give to NPCs. It is a weird choice, like it was made to circumvent some problem with big dialogue trees. Ambar is both an NPC and an item in your inventory in Episode 1, which is also weird. - As stated before: Buggy. ""It's okay for an indie point-and-click adventure game"" sounds like damning with faint praise, but I'm okay with the result and looking forward to future episodes. I recommend it.			"

												IMPORTANT - This game is half finished. Literally - only two of four episodes are done. The only reference I've seen to this is in other user reviews, so... yeah. Be aware of this.In brief: An very patchy game with potential, and it's hard to argue with the price, but ultimately not recommended due to poor puzzle design and interface issues.In boxers: Another Kickstarter project, AR-K scrapped past its $100,000 goal by promising to be an episodic sci-fi point-and-click adventure ""with an updated twist"". Sadly, that twist seems to be how unfinished the game feels - which hopefully will be fixed down the line.You are in control of Alicia, former cop-in-training who was forced out of the academy when accused of stealing a mysterious golden sphere that she finds in her locker. Now in training as a journalist, she must uncover the great conspiracy surrounding the sphere and yadda yadda yadda. After she dresses and gets to class, of course, since she was up all night partying....the sad part? That synopsis does a better job of establishing things than the ACTUAL GAME. The introductory cutscene feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute, and the haphazard way Alicia's backstory is rammed down our throats in another cutscene some 30 seconds later doesn't help matters either. We're given no real introduction to this world or anyone in it before we're asked to care about some partygoing chick, and it takes quite a while for us to warm up to her... which really isn't ideal in an adventure gameThe graphics aren't exactly amazing either. I know this isn't the biggest sin in the world - I've always said gameplay is the most important aspect of a game - but there's just something slightly off about the art style and it's incredibly hard to put my finger on. Maybe it's the character's proportions? I dunno. Have a skim through the game's screenshots and see for yourself.Another nitpick is the interface, which I don't feel is particularly well explained. All you get is two screenshots with arrows pointing stuff out, but that's hardly going to sink in when you first see it, especially when it takes a good 10 minutes for you to start actually needing to use the information provided. A slightly more in-depth tutorial at the start of the game would have worked much better here... as would being able to access these 'how to play' images during the actual game rather than having to quit to the main menu every time you want to see them.Speaking of the interface, there are things which are never explained that you need to use, and things that ARE explained which you can't use. For example: you'll need to use your dog to solve several puzzles, but it's never once made clear that you can actually select or use the dog for anything.Also, there's supposedly a 'narrator' that can give you hints if you get stuck... but I couldn't find any trace of him in the first episode, despite his presence being mentioned in the tutorial. And that's a real shame, because you'll NEED hints - there are some very random puzzles in this game (like using the cola with the sewer? Where did THAT come from?) that make it far harder than it should be.On the more positive side, the voicework is really good. The main character in particular is great, but everyone is generally of a higher calibre than I would expect for a game made by such a small team. The music, when it kicks in, is quite nice, and the story, once it gets going, is pretty entertaining. It's just such a shame you'll struggle to get to it, since it only really gets going about two-thirds through the first episode.This is a game that, at the end of the day, still needs a lot of work. There's a lot of potential there, but the problems I've mentioned are big ones, and they really do get in the way of what I hope will eventually be a pretty decent game. It's hard to really recommend at the moment - but at least you won't have to pay a fortune to see what it's like for yourself.*UPDATE* - This game has receive several updates since I wrote my original review, and will no doubt receive more - or at least, I hope it will. I'll try and update this review with each update.			"

												*Update: I have just been able to finish chapter one, so I've decided to update my review*Having just finished chapter 1, I can say I am pretty happy with this game. If you enjoy older style Point and Click adventure games then this is likely up your alley. It seems very much an homage to the Monkey Island games. I can't directly compare the two, but it has some puzzles very similar to some in those games and even a direct reference in the dialogue at one point. I will say that in comparing it to that, it is very much in the older style point and click games. If vague clues, and running around just trying to combine every item with every other item, or trying to interact every item with every interactable part of the world isn't your thing then you may not enjoy the game. My only real compaints would be it's a tad short, but I've yet to play chapter 2 which is also included so we'll see what that adds to the playtime. As well as mentioned in my original review, that I would of prefered a way to skip through dialogue with the mouse, instead of having to use the escape key. As well as the dialgue ending up being a little hokey at times, with humor being slightly heavy handed. There are still some technical issues I'd run into, the occassional game freeze with certain interactions, the sound sometimes skips or repeats itself or animations could be a little funky but if none of that is deal breaking, i'd say the game is definately an enjoyable experience. As a footnote, I'd like to say a thank you to dev team. One of them had been in contact with me the past couple of days, taking information from me and giving me updates on fixes they had been working on that pertained to my issues. He found the issue with my anti-virus and the games engine, that was causing all the crash issues I was having and got me a workaround so I was able to play. Any dev team willing to help out the playerbase like that deserves recognition.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keeping my original post here, though most technical issues are no longer appliciable. Ended up being an issue with my anti-virus and the Unity3D engine.*Update: One of the devs has been in contact with me, taken information from me on my issues and said they will be working on trying to fix what they can as soon as possible.*Wish I could recommend this game, but as it currently stands for myself I cant. When it actually works, its a pretty fun retro style point and click adventure. The story seems interesting, the graphic styling is pretty good. Solving things so far hasn't been too over the top as far as I've been able to play. The only real non technical complaints I'd have for the game is the inability to skip dialogue without having to use the escape key, I prefer to play these types of games with only the mouse, so it's a little bit of a pain. As well as the writing being a little hokey, tries a little too hard to inject humor and it falls flat at times.But when it works is not very often, between the game straight up crashing or freezing during interactions. Or the inventory UI becoming totally uninteractable without having to quit out of the game and then restart it, trying to get anything done is super frustrating when almost the entirety of the game is randomly trying to interact objects with things in the environment and its a crap shoot on whether or not the game is going to just freeze or crash every time you do. If they can fix these glaring technical issues, and the game is actually playable I'd be willing to update my review.			"

												I'm rather surprised by the amount of negative review this game has received. True: it has its share of problems, mostly a number of fairly illogical puzzles and hard-to-guess solutions to progress further into the story. And for a game that is at its core a classical point-and-click adventure game, these are really important flaws, and potentially game-breaking ones.But the strong points of the game (actually the first two episodes of a series bundles into one game on Steam) are so important that they dwarved the negative aspects, at least for me. The story is excellent and, although a bit quirky at times, original and well told. Playing as the extremely spoilt and ill-behaving, but still surprisingly likeable university student Alicia von Volisch, turned out to be a real treat with lots of twists and turns. That's no surprise, given that the well-known comics author Greg Rucka was taken onboard by the Spanish Indie developer Gato Salvaje to write new episodes following the first one. Apparently, it's the objective to deliver five episodes in this series, of which the third one has been released in 2015 (which I still need to play). A Kickstarter-project managed to raise enough funds to keep the project going, so let's hope Episodes 4 and 5 will follow suit.Even a greater plus of the game is the appearance of Ash Sroka, the superb voice actress playing Tali in the second and third installments of the Mass Effect trilogy. Her fresh and intriguing voice makes sure that Alicia comes to life in a more than believable way, and it's no exagerration to state she carries the game for a large part upon her shoulders. But the others voices are excellent too, as is the visual artwork portraying a Sci-Fi setting on a large spaceship (artificial planet?) somewhere in the future.Last but not least, this game shines in the way it turns upon its own genre  - the point-and-click andventure - and questions several of its core ingredients. Both Alicia and the ""narrator"" in the second episode sometimes comment on what the player has to do, on their own actions, or they even quarrel among each other. This kind of humour, where personages in a game are well aware of their being part of a game, injects the genre with fresh life and a lot to think about. And since it is so well done, it made me laugh out loud several times too. Not all situations or even jokes work perfectly, but the majority does, and they turned this game into a very unexpected, pleasant experience for me. It's one of those games bought as part of a bundle and started just out of curiosity, only to find out there is much more beneath the surface than I'd ever expected.Recommended to anyone looking for a point-and-click adventure with a twist, a good story and a great voice actress.

												ARK is an episodic point and click adventure quest. Game tries to revive that old quests genre charm. Adventure of the game set on a space station inhabited by humans and aliens alike. It’s the age of interstellar travel. The world itself is also fascinating filled with all sorts of technology and aliens of different species which is very appealing to me since I’m a big fan of sci-fi genre. The result is certainly very smooth and polished presentation of the setting and the characters. Great audio, with the voice of the protagonist Alicia voice being amazing and hot. In the role of this beautiful girl of the future we live on a giant space station called AR-K, moving within the AR-K, talking to citizens, solving puzzles and of course party hard. She is in college training to be a journalist after being expelled from the police force because of a mysterious sphere was found in her possession. Like most good democracies everyone freaks out about this and she is disgraced and forced to leave the profession she loves, by being charged with a crime of stealing that sphere device. Game starts with Alicia finding herself waking up after a night of wild party and a wicked hangover. From here it is up to you to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the sphere and what it has to do with you. Story can sometimes surprise and amaze you with outcome of your actions and dialogues maintain a healthy dose of sarcasm and often of craziness. My wife and I really enjoyed playing it together, episode one was her favorite, though I liked them all the same.			"

												There are adventure games with solutions to puzzles you only understand after seeing how your combining everything with everything turns out,,, in this game you're even clueless about it after you see what happens.This is a horrible abomination of an adventure game with a story that even after two episodes can be summarized in one short sentence.The only positive aspect is the animation that makes it seem like this is worth money.It's not.If you're having a big urge right now to play an adventure of a developer you don't know, browse the genre, close your eyes and buy whatever you click on. It will be better (as long as you weren't really unlucky and clicked on this one).			"

												It's a pity to see how a game with potential gets ruined by the story designer.Pros:- the game looks good, although there are a few peoblems with the animation- it's got a decent length for the price- potentially interesting storyCons- boring gameplay. Chapter 1 is really bad, Chapter 2 improves a little, but...- absurd, annoying puzzles (ex: how you get the information for the chat sheet, the CINCO letters, the way you use the mouse to scare Nuno - there is no crack in that door!!!)Actually, the story would be acceptable, but the puzzles take out all the fun. They generally feel artificial and do little to improve the gameplay.			"

												I have mixed emotions on this one.  I just finished playing thru what is currently out (Episode 2).  Game shows a promise with the story, but it is very short and has plot holes.  There should be more development of the story here.  Also the logic in places leaves A LOT to be desired.  I have certainly played worse games, but not recently made ones.  That said I can't just say pass this one by altogether.  It needs some love and attention in places but the story has an interesting hook if they can clean it up.I can't recommend the game as it currently stands but will revisit this in a few months once the rest of the episodes are out and some more bug fixes made.Positives: Interesting story that I would like to see where it goes Nice looking graphics Generally funny Engaged developersNegatives: Controls are non-intutive, particularly in the first episode.  They really need a tutorial if the are leaving as is. Story is illogical in places, particularly in Episode 2. Game requires certain actions completed in a certain order. Bit buggy still, had to restart game twice due to missing brick. Hyper-sexualized lead.  There is no reason to have her drawn/animated the way she is and it actually detracts from the game.  I found this last part bad enough to the point of being offensive.  I recommend the developer rethink their target audience for this game...it isn't teenage boys that play most point & click adventures so there is no need to have a lead with painted on clothing that sways as she walks.Unfortunately I don't expect them to correct the last point at this stage of development and that is a shame.  I like the story as laid out and will give it another chance once more comes out but this certainly needs some work.			"

Short version: 68%AR-K is a game made with lots of love but little skill. There is potential in the story and the setting– the struggles of an attractive investigative journalist student in a utopian space society–, it’s just these two episodes couldn’t use this potential too much.Long version:AR-K is a game made with love. Sadly that is all that was used in the creation of it since the technical implementation is… well…First, the good:The dialogues are great. It shows that Greg Rucka, an acclaimed writer lent a hand with them.The voice acting is superb, especially on the protagonist, Alicia.Now, the bad:The visuals. Playing AR-K is like travelling 20 years back in time. It is like those very badly animated full-CGI 3D shows of the early 90s with a very Barbie-like distorted character design.Alicia’s character. She is so sassy and snarky that she almost cracks the monitor. She also likes to shove her sexuality (and her gigantic boobs) in everyone’s face. The plot. It takes us a whole episode to even learn where this story is taking place. And by the end of Episode 2 all we have is a McGuffin, but no clue on what this story is supposed to be about.The puzzles. Partly because the interface is horrid, partly because the tame adventure game logic escalates to Gabriel Knight 3 levels of insanity.I want to give this game a better score. I love AR-K so far. The enthusiasm of the creators is radiating through the screen. But they really need to hire an actual game designer to make this work.			"

												I bought these 2 chapters on sale. It was less than a dollar so I can't complain that I got what I paid for for chapter one at least. Chapter 1 feels like it was a broken game. The How To menu was kinda broken and there also this fetch quest that initially asks for 4 items but when you ask the npc again, he ony describes 3 to you so I forgot completely about the fourth. Also, some items have descriptions, some items just have names, and some don't have any at all other than an image in your inventory. Chapter 2 starts out with an introduction of a new character that directly says its function to clear up the confusion of the first. This chapter breaks a lot of the fourth wall and I guess that's appealing, but I would much rather they go back and fix what was wrong with the previous chapter rather than make this one about mocking their old mistakes. Chapter 2 wasn't bad. It functions the way a point-and-click should with concistent interface and the right amount of hints. The only reason why I don't recommend this is because chapter 1 was bad. I see other reviews comment on the story, but I say the story is okay. If you don't mind struggling through a bad beginning to get to good part, be my guest.			"

												I felt compelled to write a review about this game because I have such mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I think the story is wonderful--very unique and interesting with really good voice over work, especially for a kickstarter funded project. On the other hand, this game is so full of bugs that it is barely playable. I have just encountered a game-ruining bug in Chapter 2 that is going to require a complete restart. (Bugs are a really big problem because there is no way to save manually, the game just saves continuously so the only options are ""start at the beginning"" or ""continue."")  I just hope the developers will take the time to patch this game or find a way to remedy the bugs that ruin the plot because I think it has potential to be awesome. I'm going to give this a thumbs up because that's how hopeful I am. :)			"

												Decent game, with some flaws that should not bother you overly much.If you're a fan of point n click adventures this one is pretty decent. It has a captivating story with some decent dose of comedy integrated into it.Not all chapters are finished yet, but those that are have been made available in a number of languages.Pros:- Graphically pleasing.- I got this game for free.- Entertaining story.- Steam trading cards and achievements.- Developer is friendly and open to feedback - if you find any bugs let him know.Cons:- Unpolished. No tutorial or proper help system to explain the interface. (like dragging stuff on top of each other / opening your backpack and being able to ask npcs about each other)- Walking is slow and zone exits are not clearly marked.- Without a guide you're going to get stuck due to the above issues.- Spelling errors integrated into the video system are hard to fix.- Over 3 GB while it could be much less.- Not all chapters are finished yet.Bottom line, if you're a fan, get it.But, I recommend waiting for a 50% - 75% discount at least, as you won't get more than 10 hours of playtime out of it and there's no replayability for this kind of game.

												As of writing this review, acts 1 and 2 are available.AR-K is a point and click adventure game starring Alicia, a young journalism student living on a space station. She was barred from her dream career as a police officer after being framed for a crime that she barely even understands, and when she finally decides to move on with her life, the past rears its ugly head again. So she's on a mission to figure out what's going on, clear her name and hopefully pass a class taught by a professor who hates her. Just another day in the life of a college student.This is very much a point-and-click in the classic style, with dialogue and inventory puzzles. There's no combat, and your character can't die.I wouldn't call it a comedy game, but there are a lot of jokes here, and thankfully most of them hold up. Not a huge fan of the whole ""Alicia hates the ex-girlfriend of a guy she doesn't even like that much with an unholy passion"" angle, but otherwise I did find myself smiling a lot throughout. The addition of the fourth-wall-breaking narrator in the second act was a bit jarring at first, but I really enjoyed the interplay between the two as the game continued. Most of the characters are silly archetypes of the various characters you'd expect to see in a college-themed story, but with a bit of a sci-fi twist to them. The game is fully voiced and the voice acting ranges from ""fine"" to ""excellent"".I've encountered a few bugs so far, but the developer has been excellent about working to address the problems that I've had so I expect that on that front the game will only improve.

												I received codes to review this game, however I was not paid for this review.     To say that I cannot recommend AR-K does not mean that I think it is a horrible game. The game looks great and the script is pretty smart and clever. The voice acting is great. However, the episodes waste too much time on their individual themes. Episode one's primary focus is showing what a horrible person the heroine is. More on her character later. An entire episode is not needed to flesh out one character. The second episode is a slow investigation that prepares the player for the action they have been waiting for, which takes place in Episode 3, sold separately. In my opinion, the wait is way too long.      I have been playing point and click games for a very long time, and I have not seen such ridiculous puzzles since the 90's. Episode 1 wasn't too bad, but Episode 2 was full  of puzzles that didn't make sense. Unless you use a walkthrough, prepare to do lots of trial and error item combinations.      My biggest problem is the heroine. I find her to be a rude, immoral, and an arrogant individual. In the beginning of the game, we learn she wants to be an officer, like her father. While in training at the academy, she is falsely accused of a crime. She is given the choice to either fight and defend her innocence or leave in disgrace. She decides to shame her family and not fight for her innocence. So she's got no backbone. She then goes to journalism school and tries to drown out the past with partying and one night stands, until she sleeps with the stranger that brings the events of this game into play. I'm sorry, but I can't stand this kind of heroine. Maybe this game will prove to be a kind of redemption story, but she's got a long way to go. Maybe the game developers are trying to show a more ""real"" person, but I just find her distasteful. I can't relate to her, and that to me is a big negative when you can't connect or care about the character. I will continue to play Episode 3 for completion sake, but it better be worth the two episodes I have played already.UPDATE: I have recently finished Episode 3.

												I won this game on Steamgifts, during a massive giveaway by the developers. I never regretted to have activated that key. Though the first chapter could have been... something that would have triggered a negative review.You're Alicia, a young student in journalism, once a promising police officer, framed for something she didn't do. Being detested by her teacher but appreciated by her friends, loved by her dog, Alicia will be confronted to her nightmare: the sphere that ended her career... and when you think that she just wanted to make sure that she wouldn't be failing her year...In the second chapter, Alicia is slowly uncovering the truth about her boyfriend of the day, one company that seems to hide something, without forgetting the police that is perhaps involved (at least, the higher-ups).The game is a standard point-&-click, you discuss, you take items, you combine them, you try to trick people, you use your dog as a sidekick and... well, you hack terminals. The only problem stands in the difficulty of using the inventory  (don't ask me why I got a serious problem to take stuff out of the bag or to combine them) or at one moment, during the second chapter, to get an item.But the first chapter depicted a heroin that seemed to have a big ego, like she was a snob, so sure of herself. The second chapter shows someone more humble and caring. I couldn't relate to her in the first chapter, as her ego wasn't even comical.The graphics are good, colorful but the cinematics are for me, a little more greyish. The soundtrack is good too.There is a problem with the achievements: the one with the jokes was a mystery for everyone as people unlocked it without knowing why it has triggered after many many tries, however, someone found the right procedure, but it took months. To find how an achievement works, you don't have to look into the code of the save file. That's what happened here.Anyway, I find 10 bucks perhaps a little high for the game, though the second chapter is saving game. Now, it's up to me to do the Great Escape, which is the third chapter and the famous achievement of idling during 8 hours ingame, without exiting. Developers and their crazy ideas of achievement....			"

tl;dr -> Watch the fall of the best potential candidate for the (futuristic) police force into a life of thievery, deceit, manipulation, petty vandalism, and other criminal acts - but beware of distraction in the form of the heroine's shapely♥♥♥♥♥ Oh, wait, she's a journalist? Okay, all those behaviours can be excused. 11/10 for realistic characters and a Harry Potter-style purse that can hold literally everything.I got AR-K gifted to me by a good, generous friend who loves to give me games to review. I've played my large share of point-and-clickers, and I have to say, AR-K is easily one of the best I've encountered. The pacing, puzzle difficulty, humor, and writing are all very well-done. The game appears to be a set of episodes, and there are currently 2 available to play at the time of writing this review.If you like point-and-clickers, a futuristic setting, good humor, and charming dialogue, then you will really enjoy this game. Fans of the genre must give this a try.The aesthetics are nice - the artsyle is good and the amount of detail in the textures is well-done. You definitely will not have to worry about the game being graphic-intensive. I have to admit, I am a pervert, and I found the main character's♥♥♥♥♥a bit distracting at times (but that's just me). The music and sounds are very good, and combine with the excellent voice acting to give you a fun, refreshing gameplay experience. Sometimes, I can find myself getting a bit annoyed at voice acting for videogames - especially point-and-clickers - however, the voice acting in AR-K (especially for the heroine) is great. You have the option of skipping through dialogue if you wish. The cutscenes are also nice, and are never too long or dull.As a point-and-clicker, the controls are fairly simple, however, there is no in-game tutorial (there is only a 2-page screen with an overview of the inventory system) - so you will want to check out how to properly use the inventory management system. I've seen a few threads on the steam forums asking about how to combine/use items, so don't be too alarmed if you are confused in the beginning - it takes some getting used to, but becomes easier once you understand how it works. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with point-and-clickers. I must admit, a few of the puzzles and item combinations were not necessarily intuitive at first, and a lot of trial and error may be common in your playthrough. In the forums, I saw a comment by the developer mentioning that the game can take around 8 hours (I am assuming for the 2 episodes, unless I misinterpreted), however, I think playthroughs for the average gamer will realistically take a maximum of 5 hours, assuming you are having a lot of difficulty with the puzzles and are also reading every single dialogue piece multiple times. The two episodes have a fair amount of puzzles and content, and I look forward to the next instalments. During gameplay, you will have to do A LOT of item combinations, both within your inventory and in the game world. I enjoyed all of the item pickup cutscenes, especially since the heroine's bag appears to be able to hold an infinite amount of objects (of any size and shape). Another interesting element that I really liked is the questioning system - in your inventory screen you can also drag and drop character portraits for people you've met onto other characters in order to ask about them. A lot of the dialogue is witty and well-written. The heroine also has a dirty mouth, and there is a nice change/addition in the second episode. I strongly suggest playing in order.IMPORTANT! Please be advised, you must be very careful when reloading a saved game - if you accidentally pick ""New Game,"" it will most likely delete your save. You must also be careful when exiting your game - I had to replay from the beginning because my progress wasn't saved properly. Overall, I strongly suggest that any point-and-click enthusiasts check out this game. It is also very user-friendly and welcoming to newbies to the genre. Give it a try!Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Every game has it's flaws; well, most of them do anyway. This game definitely isn't an exception. The big one is this: some of these puzzles are just not at all intuitive; and if you absolutely refuse to use any guide then you might end up walking away from the game in frustration. I'd definitely wish the game was a little better about the puzzles' being intuitive.In episode 1, it's that clues are really vague and don't really tell you what you need to know... In episode two, some of the puzzle solutions are even less intuitive, but the developer thought it could solve that by adding a narrator. You can ask the narrator to comment on quests or items, but in some cases he'll have nothing to say and in others it kind of remains vague. What's worse though; ""asking the narrator"" takes you out of the flow of the game, it's not fun and it's the wrong solution for the problem of the first episode.So, that's the big problem with this game... But despite that I still recommend it. Why? Well, the game has a ton of ""charm"". I really like the visual style, the voice actors/actresses are good, the game has a really good sense of humor, the characters are fun and all different, it has funny references and the short videos are well placed, humorous and don't take too long.Heck, you know what? In a lot of aspects, this game reminds me of Day of the Tentacle. If you're not familiar with that game, it's one of the best classic games in this genre. The fact that this game (AR-K) reminds me of DOTT I think is indicative of the great atmosphere this game creates with it's scenes and characters.I might not recommend this game if it were an expensive game; but let's be honest. The game is cheap enough that, even if you don't like it, it doesn't hurt the wallet too much. Personally though? I really enjoyed / enjoy this game (am currently playing through episode 3).			"

Breaks the 4th wall a lot so if you aren't a fan of that and need the immersion then don't pick this up. Also if it bothers you that the character u play as is a very very horrible person then also don't pick this up.

I also believe that characters are well designed and graphics are good too, specially taking into account that, as far as I know this is an Indie company, that was able to fund rasing through Kickstarter.Finally, I think that price compared to the number of hours I think that on average takes completing the game is a good value deal.

Posted: August 12, 2014
												*EDITED AND UPDATED 09 November 2014*This review covers the updated builds of Chapters 1 and 2 of AR-K. There was much to like and dislike about the original builds of AR-K, and I'm happy to see that the team at Gato Salvaje is committed to fixing their game while doing their best to finish Alicia's journey. When I played it the first time, I couldn't overlook the gamebreaking bugs I found as well as some minor annoyances that cropped up here and there which hampered a quality adventure experience.What hasn't changed from the past builds is Greg Rucka's solid writing. While I think he was brought in at the end of the development of Chapter 1 and had to work with what he had, he does a good job at imbuing the various characters in Alicia's world with mostly believable dialogue. Alicia's voice actor, Ash Sroka, aka Tali from Mass Effect, still is the best of the bunch at making Alicia a prickly character but one I can follow for this adventure. The other voice actors are serviceable, although I noticed that their audio levels in Chapter 2 seemed louder in a few places, like Mr. Wallruss in the diner. While the design of the game feels odd to me still, complete with some puzzles I think that could use some better hints, I'm happy to see that Gato Salvaje has started adding in descriptors for items in your inventory. Unfortunately not all items have them and I hope that they continue to add in good, solid description for items that, on first glance, you might be clueless as to what they are or where they came from.Tonally the game is all over the place, but after at least three playthroughs now I'm used to its strangeness of being serious and ridiculous at the same time. Chapter 2 introduces a narrator that only Alicia can hear, and it's that coupled with its odd fourth-wall-breaking insistences that it knows it's an adventure game that make the story move at a weird pace. It feels a little like a game from the early years of Pendulo Studios, where you couldn't decide just with what tone their games wanted to run. There are still a number of typos to be found in the game's text but nothing so bad that a player can't follow along with the story.Now for the bug fixes; I still found some but the good news is I think they caught all the ones that were game breaking in the first two chapters. I hope this experience will bear through repeated playtests as well as going forward into Chapters 3 and 4. Also the horrendous audio pops that seemed to manifest after playing the game for extended periods was gone, which made playing the game much better. Alicia herself responded much faster I felt while clicking around the screen, moreso in Chapter 1 than 2, and her walk animation ran more smoothly. It was not game breaking but there were a few instances of characters being replaced with bright pink rectangles in Chapter 2, namely the robot butler in the apartment later in the game and also the professor in the test room after he's been distracted.AR-K is a strange game; It feels like a first time adventure title from a studio that wanted to break the mold when it came to how you interface with the game and organize your inventory, much like how Resonance from Wadjet Eye Games more slickly let you put research topics into your 'memory inventory'. While the first two chapters showcase a studio that's still finding their feet and their voice, I am happy to see them take responsibility for AR-K's faults and do their best to fix them. I'm not expecting them to fix any strange design issues; Deadly Premonition in its original form was a beautiful mess of game design that somehow worked, but most importantly it ran without any major bugs that glitched out the gameplay. I'm willing to forgive AR-K's design shortcomings if they're able to keep up with tackling any flaws that keep cropping up during the game's lifecycle. And for what Steam Achievements I found, they fixed! I'm currently unaware of how to get some of the achievements, but I suspect some may still be bugged, such as doing Chapter 2 in one sitting. The story progression achievements are working now, which is fantastic.The length is decent for its price point. I think they could have bumped it up a little bit to make it fair when the studio gets chapters 3 and 4 out, but the price is enough for people to try it if they're curious for a new adventure game.Is this game worth it for $9.99? I'd say yes. It doesn't have Chapters 3 and 4 yet, but they are much more stable. Just be prepared while playing that you may run into some rough edges, but that doesn't stop it from being charming.			"

												Fundamentally lacking in fun.  The graphics are painful and dated, the controls are a slog; using items in the inventory can be frustrating when trying to apply them in appropriate areas.  The plot itself is extremely short and contrived.  For an adventure in a science fiction space station, dealing with cover-up mysteries and police politics, everything boils down to petty revenge and an unfortunate one-night stand from an aggravating protagonist (who does not have the redeeming value of being written in a compelling fashion).  None of it compels significant interest or a need to keep playing, save maybe to get your money's worth from this game.  There have to be countless greater point & clicks on Steam.			"

Posted: November 15, 2016
												I've played through chapters 1 and 2 twice each, and grew up playing old Sierra Adventure games. If I could, I'd give this game a rating of ""meh."" It just doesn't really click. Here are 10 issues I had with it:First, it doesn't really have any kind of tutorial. You're left trying to figure out how to use the interface. Which could use some tweaking. Specifically, the way the inventory works. Getting in and out of the inventory is simple enough, but trying to drag an item out to use in the scene is annoying. Many... many... times I've got the object off the screen, shaking my mouse around, trying to get the inventory to dissappear so I can use the item. The interface was improved slightly for Chapter/Game 2, but it still left me wanting.Second: When you click to move the character across the screen, all your controlls are locked up. You cannot do *anything* until she stops moving. No changing direction, or bringing up inventory, or even the menu. Not to mention the character is so slow to move about. Some games let you adjust the movement speed, or double-click on an exit to just jump there. Third: The game is incredibly short. There's even an achievement for beating the first chapter under 10 minutes. Fourth: In the second chaper/game, the devlopers introduced a narator in order to add a bit more color to the game and offer some support to the gamer. Neither really worked out. The narator rarely was funny, nor did he offer any help. Despite claiming I could drop objects on him for hints. Only a few and very specific items could be used in this manner. A poorly implimented feature.Fifht: The developers claim this game contains humor. I didn't see any. Anywhere. Not a single joke.Sixth: Scene exits are not clearly marked. In several scenes I was left randomly clicking about trying to find the exit.Seventh: Character Development. I'm gonna assume this game was made by guys. Especially development of the female characters. It just screamed of guys writing for women who think they know how a woman behaves. For example, her language. I feel like they were trying to make her ""edgy"" and down-to-earth. And she just comes across as empty.Eight: Voice Acting. Empty. Dead. Phoned in. No emotion.Nineth: Background Story. Where are we? Are we on a planet? A space station? What are we doing there? Where did these aliens come from? You've created this world, but you don't tell us anything about it.Finally: The plot is confusing and difficult to follow. The story jumps, leaving my wondering what I missed. Example, in chapter 2, after launching the table out the window, when you return to the University, you can hear someone screaming in the background and the lead character (I can't even remember her name. Even with 4 play throughs.) commenting on how he must have flown here. WHO? Who flew there? There are other points in the game as well, where you're left wondering what you missed.Overall, I can't really recommend this game. Clunky controls, poor character and background development, and a jumpy storyline. If you pick it up for a buck or two, maybe. Just remember, you'll probably beat the entire thing in an hour.			"

												There are a few good things about this game. I like the characterization and the and the overall plot. There are quite a lot of bad parts though. The biggest part are the ""puzzles"". They barely even qualify as puzzles. Most of the time you're just collecting and combining random stuff from around the AR-K, and you hope that it's useful later. Many just never make sense. They tried to fix this in the second episode with the narrator, but he's such a bore to listen to, and the fact that he's overall pretty useless, makes it another failed part. I've heard that part 3 of this game is much better, however I'll never know because the developers decided to be asses and make us pay more to play the second half of the game. It's like playing a free demo and then buying the full game once you've found out you liked it. Except you pay for the demo and pay even more for the full game. While I said I liked the overall plot fo the game, the execution of the plot isn't done well. I spent the first half of episode one trying to wake up my roommate for no reason other than I had nothing else to do. The game gave you no reason to wake him up until right before you were ready to wake him up already. The progression of this game has the logic of a three year old. You most likely won't complete this game without a guide or spending days trying the most obscure stuff to see if it does anything.			"

Game is quite frivolous and puzzles were finally incredibly silly so I ended up looking for walkthrough.

AR-K - A point-and-click adventure - Graphics: the graphics requiring getting used to but are not bad and I like that style. (see pictures above) - Sound: There is no real background music, only in a few screens there are some background sounds like the tweet of birds. But I like the voices.- Language: This game only supports English language AFAIK. But the language is not too difficult, and you have subtitles, so for me as not a native English speaker it was easy to understand.- Story: I like the story as far as I am.- Traveling:  You can get fast from one screen to the next with only very short loading times, and you only need a few screens at the beginning, so you can get really fast from one “end” to the other “end”.- Difficulty: Very Hard. There no really much hints. That you can control the dog gives you more opportunities, but that’s not really advantageous. After half an hour I needed to look into a walkthrough to get further. Over all I can suggest this game if you like point-and-click adventures and like to solve difficult puzzles. "

												Bad. Crude graphics, absolutely awful and confusing inventory menu, very unfair at times (example: making an object non-interactable until later, which means you check it and it seems like part of scenery, mousing over it has zero effect, doesn't display object name or anything, and then later you have to use an inventory item on it, because suddenly now you can interact with it, ANNOYING). Performing some actions or observing certain things often blocks other actions later in the game, as well as making some achievements impossible to get - this kills the usual tactic of doing and observing everything. Sometimes you cannot progress in game due to previous actions (bugged), which means you have to start over (no, I am not stuck, I checked several guides trying to fix this and that is the only logical conclusion).The main character is an awful representation of women - she apparently has two modes: dressing like a stereotypical nerd, and dressing like a stereotypical tramp (s*ut is apparently a bad word). Not to mention the terrible boob job and the obnoxious, entitled personality.			"

												After I saw the intro video I was sold, I got the game and really wanted to experience the story.This is just another of these, ""move the mouse until the cursor changes"" and ""try each object with each object"" adventures.The story is told in a wonderful way, the protagonist is funny and kind of cool but the puzzles are not really straight forward. The voice info about hotspots is not smart, when you get the 20 seconds joke about some hotspot, do something and click the hotspot again because you hope you changed the behavior, then you get the 20 seconds joke again. And again.You can interrupt these infos with escape, but it is not funny to always have one finger on the escape key.This should be a story where sometimes there are puzzles because of the story.This IS a series of puzzles and the story is there ""too"", they are not really integrated, at least it feels that way to me.- interesting story start- some cool dialogs- some puzzles- lots of running and trying- hoping for more story- still running and trying to solve the puzzles- exiting the game because there was 10 minutes story in 1 1/2 hours of gameplaysorry, I say: only buy if you really like these search the pixel adventures(this is kind of not fair from me, it is NOT pixel searching, the hotspots are large, I am just very angry because I WANTED the story)			"

												Utterly, amazingly, BAD!Only played it to the end (if following a guide from beginning to end can be called ""playing"") only because I had already bought the third chapter, which people seem to like.Actually, chapter 1 is not THAT bad, just some puzzles are illogical. But, chapter 2... Oh!!! That's a new level of craziness! Completely wacko, illogical to the 10th power!!!!! Alicia pokes fun on you on the first chapter for combining everything with everything, little did she know that you would have to do this on chapter 2...			"

												This is a classic point & click game with short but interesting story. I'll sum up the game in following points:Pros: Good voice acting Some dialogues were really funny Interesting game setting Game quality overall increases in episode 2 Some interesting puzzlesCons: Some minor bugs (so far in episode 1 I think, but nothing game breaking though) Short game length Game has somewhat unfinished feel as if it was released in a hurry Game renders look a little low resolutionIt feels like the idea for game was really great but technically it wasn't executed that well. This game has 2 episodes. Episode 1 had a slow start, as I didn't exactly knew what exactly was happening around or where exactly I was but as I ended episode 1 and started episode 2, things started to make sense a lot more. And as I already mentioned episode 2 is actually far more interesting than episode 1 with a teaser ending. Now I would be starting the episode 3 to make comparison between these two and third.P.S. I purchased this game on sale, I would suggest others to do the same. Its a good game but with its own downfalls!			"

												This game, or at least episodes I and II, suffer(s) from nonsensical puzzles -- e.g. stealing large letters which the narrator explicitly admits, in the dialogue, is not motivated -- and from things that have to happen in order with no link between them -- e.g. using a magnet on a table must happen after picking up a crowbar, but with no logic to dictate why this should be so.  The dialogue needs to be tightened up and things need to be described as e.g. ""stuck fast"" if you can later pick them up, because currently it's not at all clear what is a useable object and what is window dressing.I'd like to recommend this game -- it's nice visually, the characters are fun -- but I can't.  I'm sure the next game this studio makes will be great.			"

												The game has character and made me smile. Its doesn't take itself too seriously and was a refreshing change of pace from the depressive post apocalyptic/war genre i usually play. The developer also actively seeks feedback negative or positive which I like. The voice overs in the game are solid and the point and click gameplay was done well. However the character animations in the game often looked stiff or odd to me and could do with some work (knowing full well that animations are possibly the hardest to do). Overall I thought the art design was good and i liked the concept of the Ar-k. Definitely recommended.			"

												This honestly was a nice little game. It forces you to use your brain not only to figure out how to solve a puzzle but also kinda think about what you may have to do later on to go further on. I am not gonna lie, some of the puzzles and questioning that you do to some of the characters can be dificult at some times. Missing one little clue or not seeing one little thing can mean you being stuck for hours :P (im joking about that) You can get stuck on what to do and sometimes the hint isnt always there so it makes it that much more challenging for a point and click. I would indeed reccomend this game again if you are a great thinker and like to investigate or use your mind a lot more than youd think for a normal game. Another thing that made it interesting was the dialogue. It has its funny parts and can definitely make things seem a lot more fun in the game.Over all I'd gave this game an 8 out of 10.			"

Enjoyable despite flawsAR-K is a game developer's dream, finally Kickstarted into reality. But like many, there are some painful compromises. The game itself is a solid, enjoyable — at times, hilarious — point-and-click adventure game in the modern style, there are several issues that linger. Despite those issues however, I player through Chapter 1 in about an hour, and had fun.Most glaringly, localization is an issue. Name structure and voice acting is inconsistent. On the other hand, the game is fully voiced — the player dialogue choices being the only exception. Also, some items don't update correctly, and require a restart. Some FMVs didn't end correctly and required a prompt.As of Chapter 1, the logic puzzles are fairly starightforward, with small inventories reducing the need for much trial combining, which reduces a lot of the frustration. Alicia is snarky, and a moderately believable young adult protagonist, although she does suffer from Adventure Game Hero Syndrome — for an ex-cop, you sure commit a lot of misdemeanors!If you liked The Longest Journey, or Deponia you'll probably like this. Here's hoping the rest of the episodes will be released, and as good.			"

												I like the resurgence of quest genre, and the game is one of.The game is quit simple. I mean, there are only simple activities which can be solved via mouse-brute-force. Likewise, the content is not so big, maybe 10-20% of one Space Quest V, and without little puzzles. Developers go on with the content (here are only 2 episodes, and they're going to add 2 more).The story is intrigued (I like it). The ambience and style definetely is for teenagers, and style is quite strict and you can feel the uniquness of the game and joy.I'm looking forward to the next two episodes. I hope that they will be enriched.If you remember good old quests, you should like it.			"

												This game feels a bit like it came out some time around 2003 - and if it had, some of its flaws might be acceptable. The graphics would be alright, the terrible UI could be overlooked - but for a recent game - a Kickstarted game, mind you, that had plenty of funding - it's unforgivable.As a point-and-click adventure, it's pretty atrocious. The tasks you have to perform to progress generally make no sense at all, not to mention that the inventory/topics-of-conversation screen is terribly managed. Partway through the first chapter, the game resorts to breaking the fourth wall to avoid having to explain itself, and by the second chapter, there's practically no fourth wall at all (there's some sort of omnipresent narrator who the main character just accepts as totally normal) because the developers apparently realized that the game was hopeless on its own. It's still pretty hopeless, and the handwaving of plot holes that happens as a result doesn't feel great. Which is also worth mentioning - some of the reviews argue that the miserable gameplay is worth it because of the story, and I'll agree that some of the dialogue is pretty good (the grammar falls apart pretty badly near the end of the second episode, though) and there's a decent amount of interesting worldbuilding (if you ignore that the leader is literally named Bossman and most of the characters are caricatures). The story, though, the story itself? It's plot hole after deus ex machina after inexplicable coincidence after plot hole after terrible plot gimmick (especially anything to do with the never-explained teleporter terminals that appear in episode two) after I-just-gave-the-alien-barkeeper-a-giant-wrench-and-apparently-this-causes-him-to-act-on-some-plan-that-was-never-mentioned. It's a mess. It's a slog. It's not worth it.			"

												This modern take on classic point-and-click adventure, developed by Spanish studio Gato Salvaje, is able to make you spend some quite entertaining hours.The story is a fundemental thing for any good adventure game. The one you find unfolding as you play AR-K may not be the most original or complex, but definitely an interesting one. It also has a nice little touch of humour to it that, while will not make you roll on the floor laughing, still will give you some smiles.Another important ingredient is memorable characters. While the main character seems more like a typical adventure protagonist, there are still some characters worthy of attention, like her manic depressive roommate, nasty alien ticket vendor or a politician that only uses streamlined phrases.The music and the voice-over are nice, but nothing special. Still, the actors do their jobs well.The only real downside is the interface that is not very comfortable and gets some getting used to. I highly reccommend you to choose ""How to Play"" in the menu before starting the game.All in all, AR-K is a very nice game. Though, nowadays the point-and-click adventure lovers suffer not from the scarceness of good games, it still deserves its place in your collection.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Point and click puzzle game.Interface/Menu/SettingsDoesn't have alot of resolution sizes.You can play in windowed mode or fullscreen.About the game.You play as a lady and she has a dog that travels with her.She always walks, she walks very slow, getting to point a to B will at least take 10-15 seconds. It would have been better if there is some teleporting like in other games. Walking animation is just weird.. She is also able to talk twice on the same time and saying totally different things.There is a small tutorial.You do can skip cut scenes, sometimes the game is a bit buggy. but do-able.The game has an okay story.The graphics are fine but sometimes the animation is weird and not working correctly (like walking animation or talking).Has some jokes, Sometimes abit pervy or deep thinking.Clicking on one of the other episodes, will shut down your game and brings you to the store page if you haven't bought it yet.Other things.If you get this game in a discount or sale, it would be worth while, if you are interested in point and click games + story, this could be your thing.There will be 4 episodes in total they say.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												What a very unpleasant little game. There is scope here for an interesting episodic story, but the awful interface and technical aspects of the game make it an utter slog to play, rather than an enjoyable experience.I have no idea if the developers speak English as their first language, but there are a lot of spelling mistakes in the subtitles, and they often don't match the spoken dialogue anyway. The spoken dialogue sometimes has the wrong inflection, so when a character is obviously supposed to be screaming in frustration or annoyance, the actor just reads it in a bored, disaffected tone.The lip sync is all over the place in the cut scenes, and the sound sometimes drops out all together. The animation itself looks very cheap and nasty, like one of those demo CDs that were around in the 90s showing off ""new"" 3D rendering software. But I guess the budget ran out at some point - when you're handing over the items for a cocktail, the game shows the same animation every time of the character handing over a plain cardboard box... It's also possible to end up in a situation where the game is playing two conversations over the top of each other, for example if the main character is monologuing and you click on an NPC, she'll start up a dialogue but the game won't cancel the monologue. There's no way to skip lines of dialogue.The interface is clumsy too. It's not possible to cancel an action once you've started, and there's no way to quickly move between locations (many games would use a double-click for that). Items in your inventory aren't labelled, so if you don't remember what they are you have to try and guess what they are because the game won't tell you. You also can't save and load, having to rely on the game's autosave. There's an options screen, but the only options seem to be ""Continue"" and ""Quit""The puzzles don't really make a lot of sense either, and I had to resort to a walkthrough several times. The game will sometimes stop you boarding the subway because the character ""doesn't want to run away from [her] problems"" but then after picking up a completely unrelated item suddenly it becomes an option, but you're given no indication it's possible. A dialogue based puzzle gives you no indication you're on the right course, so you have to try every single possible combination to see if it produces the desired effect. The ""clues"" the game gives you for this puzzle also don't seem to have anything to do with the solution.Oh, and the lead character is VERY unlikeably and unrelatable. I think we're supposed to find her ""wild"" and a rebel, but she's just very annoying. Hahahaha! She gets drunk and can't remember what she did! So funny! Oh, and she's completely sociopathic too...hurting and maiming people seemingly for the sake of it, with no consequences for her actions. In the second episode for some reason she actually starts cursing with no censoring, which might surprise people if they weren't expecting it....Interesting setting for the game - sci-fi detective story (even though the character spends most of her time at school or in her local bar she's supposed to be a journalist or something)...kind of like Blade Runner without the dystopian aspects.....but a very unpleasant experience.Oh, and achievements didn't work for me.

												Changing my review since the last update. The bugs that I had playing the game have been resolved and achievements seem to be working. The game is very pleasing to the eye, with well-rendered cartoon-like characters and an interesting world in which to explore. The voice acting is well-done, though there are a few instances where the subtitles don't match up, which is a little strange because they are mandatory. For future episodes, I would like to see the puzzles telegraphed a little better, since there were a few times where you had to take the try-everything-with-everything approach. The ending of ep. 2 sets up a nice cliffhanger, where you want to see where the story goes next. Props to the developers for taking the time to listen to players and doing everything they can to make them happy. Bring on Ch. 3!PREVIOUS REVIEW: Until this game receives some MAJOR bug fixes, I cannot recommend it. It is probably somewhat telling that  0%  of ALL the people who have played this have gotten the ""complete episode 1"" AND ""complete episode 2"" achievements! I have run into multiple bugs in both episodes and so am unable to finish the game. The funny thing is, I played the first installment before it was on steam and did not have this happen. It's great to have Steam achievements and trading cards, but if you cannot play the damn game to completion, it means nothing! Don't even get me started on the screen resolution problem...			"

												IMPORTANT - This game is half finished. Literally - only two of four episodes are done. The only reference I've seen to this is in other user reviews, so... yeah. Be aware of this.In brief: An very patchy game with potential, and it's hard to argue with the price, but ultimately not recommended due to poor puzzle design and interface issues.In boxers: Another Kickstarter project, AR-K scrapped past its $100,000 goal by promising to be an episodic sci-fi point-and-click adventure ""with an updated twist"". Sadly, that twist seems to be how unfinished the game feels - which hopefully will be fixed down the line.You are in control of Alicia, former cop-in-training who was forced out of the academy when accused of stealing a mysterious golden sphere that she finds in her locker. Now in training as a journalist, she must uncover the great conspiracy surrounding the sphere and yadda yadda yadda. After she dresses and gets to class, of course, since she was up all night partying....the sad part? That synopsis does a better job of establishing things than the ACTUAL GAME. The introductory cutscene feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute, and the haphazard way Alicia's backstory is rammed down our throats in another cutscene some 30 seconds later doesn't help matters either. We're given no real introduction to this world or anyone in it before we're asked to care about some partygoing chick, and it takes quite a while for us to warm up to her... which really isn't ideal in an adventure gameThe graphics aren't exactly amazing either. I know this isn't the biggest sin in the world - I've always said gameplay is the most important aspect of a game - but there's just something slightly off about the art style and it's incredibly hard to put my finger on. Maybe it's the character's proportions? I dunno. Have a skim through the game's screenshots and see for yourself.Another nitpick is the interface, which I don't feel is particularly well explained. All you get is two screenshots with arrows pointing stuff out, but that's hardly going to sink in when you first see it, especially when it takes a good 10 minutes for you to start actually needing to use the information provided. A slightly more in-depth tutorial at the start of the game would have worked much better here... as would being able to access these 'how to play' images during the actual game rather than having to quit to the main menu every time you want to see them.Speaking of the interface, there are things which are never explained that you need to use, and things that ARE explained which you can't use. For example: you'll need to use your dog to solve several puzzles, but it's never once made clear that you can actually select or use the dog for anything.Also, there's supposedly a 'narrator' that can give you hints if you get stuck... but I couldn't find any trace of him in the first episode, despite his presence being mentioned in the tutorial. And that's a real shame, because you'll NEED hints - there are some very random puzzles in this game (like using the cola with the sewer? Where did THAT come from?) that make it far harder than it should be.On the more positive side, the voicework is really good. The main character in particular is great, but everyone is generally of a higher calibre than I would expect for a game made by such a small team. The music, when it kicks in, is quite nice, and the story, once it gets going, is pretty entertaining. It's just such a shame you'll struggle to get to it, since it only really gets going about two-thirds through the first episode.This is a game that, at the end of the day, still needs a lot of work. There's a lot of potential there, but the problems I've mentioned are big ones, and they really do get in the way of what I hope will eventually be a pretty decent game. It's hard to really recommend at the moment - but at least you won't have to pay a fortune to see what it's like for yourself.*UPDATE* - This game has receive several updates since I wrote my original review, and will no doubt receive more - or at least, I hope it will. I'll try and update this review with each update. "

												I actually played this for quite some time, even though Steam apparently stopped counting after 0.4 hours. As much as I wanted to like this game and get into the comedy side of it, I just couldn't. I came into the game expecting a point-and-click adventure like my childhood game Grim Fandago, maybe I was aiming too high. I didn't really find much of the witty comments or any of the jokes that funny, I actually only remember giggling once in the game. Obviously this is a personal opinion of the game, some people will like it, some will not. Cannot recommend a game that relies on comedy, but is not funny.			"

Also the game is episodic and at the moment only a couple of episodes are playable.

The game-play is pretty typical of classic point and click adventures. Interact with objects and characters, get a description or begin a conversation, pick up certain objects and figure out where they are used. I took a while to figure out how to play this game. I overlooked the 'how to play option' in the menu so that may not have helped. I often spent a lot of time scouring over areas over and over again trying to figure out what to do next. Often I couldn't find obvious clues and resorted a lot to just randomly attempting to use every item I had on every object or person that I could find. The protagonist rubbed it in by frequently making sarcastic remarks like 'or we could try something that works' lol. I eventually had to refer to a walk-through. I don't really think this can be considered a problem with the game. I think it's very typical and just the nature of titles in this Genre.I like how the game looks, I think it is well done. I like the dialogue, it's little naughty and sometimes there are some pretty amusing lines. I also think that the voice acting itself is good. The game brings back fond memories of Full Throttle and the Grim Fandango.Any gripes have about this game aren't really a big deal, just stuff like not being able to skip dialogue that you have already heard. I didn't come across anything to really dislike this game for. I certainly think it's worth a try especially if you are a fan of these sort of games.Click here for more videos =)			"

												I see too many unfair critics, please consider this is a low budget indie game made for fans of the point'n'click golden era, don't expect this to be the new Monkey Island. If you judge AR-K in the right context IMO this game is solid and the improvements are very notorious on the second chapter. Also enjoyed those acid dialogues and a couple of puzzles were a little bit unintuitives but sure i'll buy The Great Escape as soon as I can.			"

												Bought it on a sale.  Wasn't worth it.  Game gives no sense of direction & the UI is glitchy.  You can't cancel actions or skip conversations that you've already seen.  The only good thing about the game is the voice acting.  Everything else is abysmal.  I can't even progress through the game because it gives you no sense of direction of what you're supposed to do at all.  All I know is I gotta wake up some dude in a bar but the bartender says to bring him 3 things that he vaguely describes in a way that makes no sense so he can make something to wake him up.  The game's world is so small you'd think it'd be easy to find these things but nope.  There's pretty much nothing except a vending machine & I thought that was it but nope. I bought all 3 drinks, none of which did anything.  I mixed 2 of them together, still nope.  Tried buying the drinks again, but couldn't. A purse with a brick? Well, you can't wake someone up with that.  Then my game froze after picking up the brick.  So I restarted the game & went back to the bar.  Then I had the bartender make me 2 nasty looking burgers & tried to give them to random people.  Nope.  After wandering back & forth for a half hour trying to find something I missed I realized what a complete waste of money this game was even on a sale & uninstalled.  I might come back & play this game again at a later date but right now it's just not worth the headaches.			"

												AR-K may be a study in how to have an okay story, okay graphics and good voice-acting and still come out with a bad game - soo manyy problems.This title consists of the first two episodes of the game, ""Gone with the Sphere"" and ""The Girl Who Wasn't There"", and the second feels way better than the first. Still, we see a lot of beginner's mistakes in the handiwork. Basically every aspect of the game is flawed in some way or another.Note: Review was rewritten to fit Steam's transparent character limit.HintsIf you're playing this game, remember Space toggles inventory and Esc skips dialogue, e.g. failure-to-combine messages.Not getting a comment when using an object usually means you cannot use it just yet.+ Good voice-acting+ Pretty design, although not necessarily humanoid proportions (note down-scaled graphics)+ Basically interesting story+ As of episode 2: Narrator / hint system0 Largely showing off main char0 Subtitles not always fitting0 As of episode 2: Fast travel stations- Layered execution model (see below for corresponding problems)- No options inside episodes- Two-screenshot tutorial with false information- One, in numbers 1, save state- Basically very short episodes artificially extended by missing guidance- Insulting the player- Numerous spelling errors in the English version, including inconsistency of names- Inconsistent controls, e.g. description of objects, skipping of dialogue- Over-specific interaction areas/hitboxes, unclear transitional areas, a bit of pixel hunting- Out-of-screen labels- Sometimes shoddy walking animations- No scanning the room or changing interaction during walking animation- Background music playing with statics- Recovery times before letting the player interact again- Inconsistent story-telling, e.g. logical errors, continuity errorsVoice-actingAs stated before, this is pretty well done. There is only one line missing in episode 1 (Franky), and one line in episode 2 sounds like it was recorded in a setup different from the rest of the lines.Graphical designThis is no Final Fantasy or WOW trailer but it looks nice enough. I'd say a lot of work has gone in the animation of the main character, which makes sense, and so some scenes feel a bit like they are meant to show off the main character, which is fine. Her ankles looked odd in high-heels, though.There were a few graphical glitches.StoryThe game is based on an interesting crime story but I don't feel like paying 8 Euro for an experience similar to the first two episodes. The player often doesn't know why they are doing something or why they cannot do something.Narrator, Hint system, Item descriptionsEpisode introduced a narrator giving multiple hints on topics but none on items.The narrator replaces the description system from episode 1 where right-clicking an item resulted in a description of the item - except for a few items where it didn't.Fast travelEpisode 2 introduces fast-travel terminals which allow for skipping of up to 2 screens. But each station equals its own screen and there are  screens 3 screens away from a terminal.Layered execution model, CrashesStarting the game from Steam gives you a configuration screen. Clicking ""Play!"" closes configuration and opens a window where you select an episode which closes the window and opens a new one running the episode.The configuration shows a number of option types but all you can really change is the graphics quality (which I didn't) and whether the game runs windowed which the configuration checked automatically for me every time except for the very first run and independent of the setting for the last run.Episodes run without screen overlay which is available in the episode selector. No overlay means Steam won't capture screenshots. Play time is recorded and Steam achievements gained, though. From the community hub it seems this produces actual problems for Linux user - search for overlay in the discussions.Episodes ignore resolution settings set in the configuration.I had the game crash several times.OptionsThere are none.Help screensThe game offers two screenshots with instructions pasted over them in part confusing and false. The player is told about the narrator which doesn't exist in episode 1. The help also states ""touching an area transition will cause you to instantly travel to the next area regardless of the distance"" which is simply not true. I really like it when games have that kind of travel and was subsequently disappointed.Save statesThere is one save state, the one currently used with auto-save. No manual saving.Subtitles, SkippingThe subtitles basically fit what is said. Sometimes a word is missing. Spelling errors are numerous. Some names keep changing their spelling (Eduard, Schlozten). There are also unintelligible alien voices which must be read but ""translation"" of a 1-second sound piece may spans three lines of text.You can skip subtitles but may skip more than the displayed text. In episode 1 it's possible to skip animations which was removed from episode 2 - I never again want to see the barman put down or take up his magazine again.Guidance, Game lengthYou can play through both episodes in short time (with skipping and a plan) - not optimised I timed 7 minutes for episode 1 and 27 minutes for episode 2.Unfortunately, the first play-through of an episode may take hours because the game is very bad at giving directions. There are clear objectives, e.g. ""get me something to wake someone up."" But often the player doesn't know what the next objective or even current problem is, e.g. at one point the main character tells you she has determined the next place to go but then she simply won't go there, no explanation, not even naming the place. So you advance the story elsewhere getting a concert ticket which suddenly allows you to go to the place. There is no connection to the concert and the ticket are not used after getting them.At one point the main character actually directly insults the player - generally a bad idea but adding to injury in this game.You can use your dog to do stuff but that is never properly introduced.Beginner's stuffOften interaction areas are over-specific, e.g. Ambar's interaction area is sometaimes way smaller than Ambar, similarly with the university building. If the player is supposed to interact with a thing let them interact with the whole thing or make a special thing in the thing to interact with.Labels of interaction areas can go outside the visible area, even completely so. Check the cursor's position and position the label of an interaction area accordingly, i.e. so that it can always be read in its entirety.While walking around you cannot scan the room (labels are inaccessible) or switch the current interaction.There are a number of logical glitches, basically anachronisms, e.g. you can get your purse from the Lost&Found multiple times (not the brick though). When you deal with the coffee machine the first time the reflection in the cutscene doesn't correspond to the machine's state. The robot's final state in episode 1 is reflected wrong. The porters keys randomly appear. Franky's toolbox changes designs. Alicia says, access to photos on Nuno's requires a code, but Bollizei goes through photos without a code. Corpse Reviver dialogue available even after Nuno left. ""He's standing right there"" after Blaine left. No scaffolding visible from Nerd.At some point the Exit from TFTF vanished (menu, exit and continue helped).I think, area transitions should be clearly distinguished from other interaction areas. This can be done by simply giving them a special cursor, e.g. a door or guidepost.AR-K is pretty bad. I guess one to three more weeks basically fixing guidance could make this into something worth a player's time and money. As it is I will not recommend AR-K.			"

												I tried starting to play this - twice. Now, the art style is nice-ish, with a 3D animated cartoon feel to it. I'm not the biggest fan, to be honest.Despite being given a bit of back story, cut scenes and intro, I still found myself not really caring so much what happens next, or what the mysterious golden sphere is. Even the constant attempts at being amusing didn't work too well on me. Titles like Simon the Sorcerer and The Monkey Island are head and shoulders above this one in humour - as well as in the feel of the gameplay.I also found myself agreeing a bit with the professor that she had no good excuse to be late handing in her coursework.If an adventure game has you not caring what happens next, then why play it?So, in conclusion, it might be an okay game, but not for me.

												Quite an awesome play on a Point and Click sort of Visual Novel.  The universe was a joy, the characters fun.  The main character such a cute flirtacious tease.  A real joy to play, just wish we could have worn the black dress more.  Was really getting into the story, then suddenly it was time for episode 2.  I didn't even realize til episode 2 got over that episodes 3 and 4 were actually games that had to be bought totally seperate with a different title.  I love episodic games, but would have been nice if the other episodes would have been part of the same game as DLC(s).  Seemed like we got barely any of the story, just enough to get into it like a demo.  Didn't seem long enough or with enough stand-a-lone content / side-story(s) to compose a whole new game(s) of their own each episode.I'd keep in mind that it's short and has a few hickups in places causing a strong need for using a walkthrough when you actually get stuck, or so to not get stuck.  But with that said, I'd suggest the game for guy or gal a like if you enjoy visual novels, point and click story games, or a female main character who speaks her mind and looks good doing so.  A fun playful game with some good spirit to it.  Just remember that just cause you see the main character do something, doesn't mean you should as well... some of the things she does may get you in trouble... or in jail.			"

												I don't really know how to explain how I feel about this game. Though straight from the beginning it isn't being much of a fun ride but I do plan to finish it since I sadly spent money on this thing.I'll probably amend this later with better written out information but I just had to make sure I remember how much I disliked this game over all.The characters are not fun, the hero is terrible, disgusting, abusive, but let's forget that. The main thing that bothered me was voice acting, character design [how does the hero even work? She doesn't even stand like a human], and the terrible programming of the game itself.I don't know if I am the only one with the issues but the game itself has a lot of glitches I experience. The tutorial little help section didn't even load. It doesn't actually tell you how to work things otherwise. The character will walk in cycles for some time before they actually transition to the next screen. I don't even remember what I was having issues with yesterday.			"

												Jesus Christ this game makes me so angry. I'm glad I wasn't one of the kickstarter supporters who paid for this. I paid around £0.50 for this and it was still too much. Bear in mind: this is after the supposed fixes so I can't imagine what a collosal ♥♥♥♥ up it must have been before.There are STILL glitches (inventory clicks on the wrong thing, no audio when there is meant to be), and most importantly the puzzles are pretty terrible; not only are most puzzle stages complete non-sequiturs, some stages can be completed before you've received any hints/instructions about them, so you end up with a load of stuff in your inventory with no idea what you're meant to do with it - or even what it is.If it wasn't for all that I MIGHT be able to overlook the terrible, repetetive, unhelpful dialog and frustrating interface (non-intuitive controls with no tutorial; controls help is located in a menu that you access by exiting the game; controls change location from chapter to chapter; inconsistent 'hint' mechanic that even the game itself admits was introduced in chapter 2 because chapter 1 was ""confusing"" - ♥♥♥♥ing hell). But as it is...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

The 2nd chapter evolved the game with some new features and according to the creator this will continue!I enjoied the humor and even the interactions of the futuristic environment and I am certain that I will play this again in the future.I will update this once I play chap 3!

												The graphics is too old, like 20 years ago.Alicia’s character. She is so sassy and snarky that she almost cracks the monitor. She also likes to shove her sexuality (and her gigantic boobs) in everyone’s face. The plot. It takes us a whole episode to even learn where this story is taking place. And by the end of Episode 2 all we have is a McGuffin, but no clue on what this story is supposed to be about.The puzzles. Partly because the interface is horrid, partly because the tame adventure game logic escalates to Gabriel Knight 3 levels of insanity.			"

												Okay. this game had a few things wrong with it, let me tell you.The graphics were flat and overall it reminded me of one of those really old point and click games that just made you want to either keep playing to see if it got better of you just quit the game (like I did). It has a lot to improve on. I really liked the voice acting and the cutscenes, but that was about it. Most of the time, I had no idea what I needed to do. The story lost me in the first 10 seconds. But after the first 30 minutes I got bored and it lost interest to me.I don't normally give games such bad reviews but geez. Indie games are amazing and this game has potentail but in the end, only two things make this game okay to play - Ambar and Skunk-Cola.UPDATE-------------One of the developers got in touch with me saying that they are improving the game and taking suggestions on how to improve the game which mainly come from the negative reviews. He told me that the chapters further along are much better than the first and there is much more to the game.Don't get me wrong. It's a really cool idea, since there aren't many games like this out there. Anyway, they are improving it, so don't get me wrong, this isn't the final product.			"

												The game is not worth it. How this heap of garbage was priced at 10 euros is beyond any common sense, luckily I got it in a bundle. Refund if you got it from Steam.- The launcher always has ""windowed"" option ticked for some reason. If you forget to untick it, there is no way to go fullscren from the game.- The image is blurry on max settings- There is always some static noise present on the background, depending on the scene. Thought there was something wrong with my speakers and headphones, but it happens only in this game.- Inventory cannot be opened using the ""I"" button on the keyboard. You have to click the icon to open it.- There is no running/quick travel option. So you always have to wait for the character to move at its own pace.- Loading times between each and every scene.- The puzzles are...  obscure to say the least. There are absolutely no hints to solving them and they don't really make that much sense.- Bugs. Encountered a walkthrough breaker early on, when you have to mix the ingredients for the ""corpse reviver"". Gave all the ingredients in the wrong order, accepted and stuck.- VERY slow paced. SO BORING.			"

												Easily one of the worst looking and worst written point and click games that I have ever had the missfortune to play. Within 10 minutes I was already wondering what was going on when all of the characters decided to look away from me for an entire cutscene, then my dog tried to lick his balls only to twist his torso into some weird mesh of horrible goo and dog innards. Then I walked into a cafe and it happened to be owned and run by a giant cow person...no one mentioned this in any way shape or form. After walking through 15 screens of different parts of the university I was greeted by a kilt-wearing welrus who provided me with directions to my teacher. Once I arrived he told me he wasn't going to give me an approved subject to write my final about then told me to have my final written by that night on an approved subject in an evil plot to get me kicked out (which he admitted within 1 minute of dialogue).The main character preceded to chat about the things I had just seen her do for a few sentances of the worst writing I have ever heard before her animation broke and she started shaking like a 90s nokia...That is as far as I got.

Note: After posting this review, I was approached by one of the developers through Steam and we had a chat about what could be done to improve the game as well as discussing the bugs I mentioned. This doesn't change the review (yet), but it's something that I never see on Steam. Definitely a huge plus if you're looking for developers who care about their game and the community playing it!Original ReviewAR-K is a point-and-click adventure game. It's seemingly set in a distant future where aliens and humans co-exist. The player controls Alicia Van Volish, a young adult who was making it far into the police academy before mysterious events resulted in her departure from the force. She has since become a journalist, returning to school to do so.That's pretty much all I gathered besides some other introductory details before I got bored. The story was vaguely interesting, and Alicia's voice acting is really well done (most of it is, to be honest), but it's hampered by really odd graphics (why is the professor's head three times as big as Alicia's?) as well as the uninteresting point-and-click mechanics. This is ntohing that players haven't seen before. Walk around, click on stuff, click on stuff with other stuff, rinse and repeat. I barely made it through the first couple of story-driven sequences.What seriously brought the game down was its functionality. Launching the game brought up the typical Unity launcher for settings (which doesn't bother me, but I know some other people do find annoyance in it), followed by a separate launcher for the four ""episodes"" included in this game (two of which have released at the time of this review, two of which are still to come), followed by the actual episodes themselves. This is an awkward setup I rarely see on Steam, and it resulted in 1) my friends being notified three times that I was playing AR-K, and 2) not being able to use the Steam Overlay when actually playing one of the episodes.Additionally, the game itself seems to be sporadically riddled with weird bugs or glitches, or other things that seem like should happen but don't. Some objects that seem interactable aren't, or aren't enough, and some areas that seem like Alicia should be able to walk to, she can't. On top of that, there are typos here and there that really should have been noticed, such as ""Oh my godness"". There's also some lines written into the game that are voice acted completely differently, which was really odd to see.All in all, AR-K has a semi-interesting story, but it's brought down by the uninspired point-and-click mechanics, odd and low-quality graphics, and minor bugs and typos. If you're deeply invested in this genre, I would suggest getting it on some kind of sale and giving it a try. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Easily one of the worst looking and worst written point and click games that I have ever had the missfortune to play. Within 10 minutes I was already wondering what was going on when all of the characters decided to look away from me for an entire cutscene, then my dog tried to lick his balls only to twist his torso into some weird mesh of horrible goo and dog innards. Then I walked into a cafe and it happened to be owned and run by a giant cow person...no one mentioned this in any way shape or form. After walking through 15 screens of different parts of the university I was greeted by a kilt-wearing welrus who provided me with directions to my teacher. Once I arrived he told me he wasn't going to give me an approved subject to write my final about then told me to have my final written by that night on an approved subject in an evil plot to get me kicked out (which he admitted within 1 minute of dialogue).The main character preceded to chat about the things I had just seen her do for a few sentances of the worst writing I have ever heard before her animation broke and she started shaking like a 90s nokia...That is as far as I got.

												AR-K tries really hard to be edgy with its snarky, hipster female lead, but the script and the voice acting are hokey.  I know that might sound unfair, since this is a point/click with limited NPC interactions, and I like Greg Rucka's comics, but I think maybe this isn't his medium.  Every time the main character curses, she sounds like when your ten-year-old little sister tries it out to sound cool around the older kids, but it sounds really unnatural.  Frankie's ""accent"" is terrible.Worse, it's a puzzle game in which too many of the puzzles don't make sense even in hindsight, and you're just combining things with other things at random to get something to happen.  Episode 2 was worse than the first in this regard, which is likely why they gave you a ""narrator"" that you can drag things to for hints.  Ultimately, I don't care why she has the sphere, which is why I probably won't play episode 3.  It seems like it's supposed to be a focal point of the story, but the intrigue never really develops.  4/10			"

												Graphics and voice work are nice.  I quit because it was too difficult.  I enjoy some point and click adventures, but not ones where I'm stuck for longer than 15 minutes.  Maybe I'm not the target audience.  I will give it one more chance with a walkthrough.The protagonistic seems more of a male sex fantasy than a real character.  That's not necessarily a bad thing if the game features good pornography but this game is rated PG so that is quite unlikely.			"

												At the time of posting this, the game is pretty fail and its only at E2 of 4. Finding my character stuck in front of the graphics for amongst other things, Ambar and buildings, the dialogue and written script conflict a lot and such simple things as gorge and gored are somehow beyond the QA of the company, episode 2's pointless narrator addition basically leaves the woman looking like shes lost her mind and all he does is serve to slow the game down even more. The games window is somehow synced about 5% off the screen of a monitor in fullscreen leaving you with clicking around in the dark outside of the visable screen or sitting in an otherwise terrible windowed mode.Voice acting itself is overall fairly mediocre with a lot of the people sounding disintrested in everything they say. The ""use this with this"" system is horrendus and finding the right part of an object the game wants you to click is increasingly problematic as the game goes on even area transisitoning gets fickle and that just involves clicking the sides of areas. Dont set ya sights too high when going in to this and you might barely feel like you got your moneys worth, barely.			"

That's the front of his helmet, like we saw in the opening video.So yeah, in addition to the animation looking like an even-lower-budget ripoff of Tripping The Rift, the voice acting is amateurish, there doesn't seem to be any option to skip through the boring dialog to see if the game actually gets interesting, and the game just generally didn't grab my interest.

												I thought Episode 1 was poor.  Episode 2 started off a bit better, making it up to merely mediocre, then spiraling back to poor.If you got it for cheap on the Humble bundle, and just careen through on a walkthrough, and REALLY want a point-and-click adventure?  You would be hard pressed to do worse than this.  But if you're bored, eh, why not.  I guess it not crashing is a point in its favor?  Don't spend money on this, though.  This game is interesting in the way that a train wreck is interesting.Where do I even start.  The voice acting for the NA version was tolerable, at least somewhat.  But the dialog skipping is poor.  If you miss a scene, good luck, because you will have to replay the ENTIRE episode.  But will you care enough?The plot is contrived.  At best.  Complete career destruction with the planting of ONE stolen sphere?  No lawyers or due process?  To a rich kid with a connected father?  REALLY?The models.  Tiny hands.  TINY HANDS.  I've seen fan-made Skyrim models that were really well made.  AR-K was not well made.  This modeling was ""professional,"" yet it looks like it was crapped out by someone who barely knew how to do modeling of ANY sort in a week or so.The motion capture seems okay, oddly.  I can deal with her shoving massive objects in a tiny purse.  And having a fast-travel terminal in nearly every room is pointless.And the adventure game logic.  Get a walkthrough, because this game is NOT worth your time of trying every item on every other item.  Ep1 was relatively straightforward, but Ep2 degenerates into *especially* crazy adventure game logic.I should really go play Longest Journey and Dreamfall again.  Those were actually good.  And Dreamfall was actually made (BEFORE this game) with models that don't make me wince!			"

												This game takes you back to the old Sierra Online games like the Leisure Suit Larry games. Sadly though, the game also has the graphical features of those (extremely) old Sierra Online games. This while the publisher had a kickstarter campaign to overhaul the graphics (think I don't wanna see how bad they were in the original 1st episode of the game :D).When I look at the game itself it TRIES to be funny, but it feels extremely forced and therefor becomes ALL BUT funny :( This is a real let down, certainly when you look at the awesome and funny trailers for the game here on the store and the greenlight campaign.Gameplay is also an issue. It's an adventure game with point & click features (it's not a hidden object game!), but most of the time you just move your mouse over the screen in the hope that the cursor changes form so you can do something. With that, the adventure is set in the distant future, but there's not even a journal in the game. You 'pick up' your quests, your objectives are told right away, but you don't have a notepad of any kind to look back what you have to do. This is the main feature that made me turn away from the game. I mean, I'm not playing a game like Morrowind (release around 2001) where you have to keep track of your objectives by physical pen & paper.In short, this game is not worth the €10 asked for it. Better wait till it drops dramatically in price or is dumped in a bundle if you're REAL curious about it...			"

												First the main character that you control is an arrogant a**hole with a huge pair of boobs who is dressed like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you can bear that, you’re left with a semi-functional adventure game where it’s apparently impossible to use any object. The help tells you there is a ""narrator"" who can help you but there is none. I was still able to progress a little bit before getting stuck, which may or may not be because of a bug, I don’t know.Assuming there are no blocking bugs and I’m just stuck because I didn’t find the right thing to do, it’s a playable adventure game so if you’re desperate you can buy it, but I definitely cannot recommend it, at any price.Oh and to leave a review you have to let the launcher open for at least 5 minutes, or Steam thinks you didn’t play at all.

												The short version:  Give this game a pass unless you get it for a couple bucks on sale.The long version:  This game looks great from the trailer, but don't let that fool you like it did me.  For starters, the game *only* launches in the maximum resolution of your main monitor - no lower resolution windowed mode - and since the game appears to be made in 720p, it comes off looking blurry when stretched higher than that.  If the graphics were sharper and in the appropriate resolution, AR-K might look really good.  As it is now (with only the promise of a possible future patch), the game is more than a bit on the ugly side.The characters and story - The main character is a sharp tongued and witty young lady, but the game is so poorly written that she still comes off as bland and uninteresting, and you never really care about her.  The same can be said of the story.  I love a good story in a game, and often that will outshine gameplay and graphics, and that's what I was hoping for with AR-K.  Sadly, I never truly felt invested in the story, and after a couple hours of the tedious and often confusing ""puzzles"", I found myself just waiting for Chapter One to be over so I could move on to something else.The gameplay - Point and click adventure games are a dime a dozen these days, so it amazes me that there are still developers out there who just can't get the gameplay formula right.  AR-K's puzzles are so entirely random that at times I felt I was just clicking and combining everything in hopes of moving the story along.   Very few clues and lack of clear direction to the story often left me wondering what to do next, and in a couple of cases I had to refer to a guide, which then left me thinking ""how the hell would anyone figure that out on their own?!"" Future chapters -  Be aware that the game isn't complete.  The store page is very misleading in letting you believe you're getting the full game all in one go.  Nope, you're only getting the first two of four chapters, with the next two chapters being released separately (and charged accordingly), unlike most of the Telltale games, which let you buy the entire game and enjoy the chapters as they're released.Overall, I was looking forward to AR-K, but ended up extremely disappointed.  At this point I won't be purchasing the last two chapters, regardless of the price.  This game had a lot of potential, but the convoluted storyline, poor character development, and poor graphics options left me feeling like I wasted my time with this one.  I'd avoid it unless you're feeling brave and have a couple spare bucks to toss at it when it's on sale.			"

												AR-K had many good points and only one flaw, but the flaw was lethal.On the plus side, the voice acting was surprisingly good.  The visuals were crisp and the animation was good, with a '90s CGI aesthetic.On the downside, the game design was badly lacking.  An adventure game needs to either make puzzles reasonably intuitive, or provide hints through dialogue, item descriptions, or readable messages.  If you expect players to do bizarre things like, just hypothetically, mashing bread in a helmet with a golf club to create itching powder, there must be more guidance involved than just expecting that the players will read your mind.  If players are thinking in terms of ""I could try this... or maybe this... or else that..."" the adventure is working; if they're thinking something more like ""What does any of this junk I've found have to do with anything?"" it's not.  AR-K falls into that latter category.Too frustrating.  Too much reliance on guesswork.  Too unrewarding.  Too bad.			"

												AR-K just feels... stale...It tries to recapture the magic of old school adventure games, but it ultimately just seems to recapture the frustration... Puzzles are often nonsensical, and progression grinds to a halt when you run around the same four screens over and over again trying to figure out what to do! For instance, early in the game, you're supposed to pour a soda down a street grate in order to make it explode, and an angry neighbor will throw a wine bottle at you. WHAT?!? There was one line of dialogue about the soda being volatile, but why would I even, and wuhh... ? :| Even worse, one of the early gating puzzles has you find three objects to make a miracle hangover cure, but it turns out, without any prompting from the NPC making the cure, that you need FOUR OBJECTS! FUuuuuuddge monkey man...To top it off, the protagonist is generally unlikable. I think she's supposed seem snarky, independent, and competent, but she usually just comes across as rude and arrogant. One example: The plot introduces the fact that she was an ace pupil but ended up being booted from the police academy after she was found in possession of a plot mcguffin. When a local police-man says something along the lines of, ""gee, it was a bummer you got kicked from the force, you were a star pupil!"" She basically turns around and says, ""Ugh. If one person can read in a sea of illiterates does that make them a queen?"" Her attempt and ""humor"" just serves to alienate her to the audience, and disconnect her from the events of the story, events that are happening to HER!The other NPC's aren't much better. There's an underdeveloped minotaur bar-keeper, he's nice I guess, a pretentious and petty professor, a roommate who's manic depression is often the subject of derisive jokes... classy... a racist alien, an alcoholic desk assistant, a guy who's only defining characteristic is that he likes the protagonists buzongas, an inept cop, and... a dog... that's everyone I could remember from the point I played up to... yikes...It isn't all bad news, however. From what I hear, the later episodes of the game (as in past episode 1) were more well received, so if the concept or visual style of the game look interesting at all to you I would check out those and skip 1, because to me at least, it isn't worth slogging through.EDIT: Upon closer inspection I'm not sure if it's possible to jump to later chapters in the game without playing through them... that's... unfortunate...Overall:Pros:+Passable sounds and visuals+Nostalgic adventure game setup+The later installments might be better?+The one joke about the desk in the beginning was funny kind of...Cons:-Janky facial animations and cutscenes-Unlikable main character and cast-Nonsensical puzzles-Making fun of the mentally impaired			"

												What is AR-K? It's an episodic point and click adventure made by Gato Salvaje, with only two episodes released so far (They're planning on releasing two more). Playing the first chapter was something I kind of did not feel like doing. I disliked Alicia (the main character), I disliked most of the voice acting, and some of the dialogue was, in my opinion, sort of shabby.However, most of these were improved in the second episode. the voice acting and the script got way better and more enjoyable (At least in my opinion), making me laugh quite a lot, especially Nuno, Alicia's emo friend. I actually grew fond of Alicia, who I found quite unbearable at the beginning of the whole thing.While the plot starts quite stale, with Alicia having to finish some research for her journalism classes and having a terrible hangover, things start to pick up by the end of the first chapter, with a certain object making its first appearance.I think the game has a lot of potential. It has some issues, like most of the puzzles being probably a bit more difficult than what I'm used to in a point and click game, and there might be some translation errors (Not quite sure about this.). I'm sure most things will be improved in the third chapter, considering the wonderful work they've done with the second one.AR-K is an enjoyable experience in spite of its flaws. Is it the best point and click adventure ever made? Probably not, but it's still worth giving a shot.			"

												I felt this was a good point-and click game. The story and the puzzles were enough to keep interested. The animation and graphics, however, felt very early 2000's due to some bad lip-synching but that's a minor complaint. The biggest let down is that you have to pay extra money for the last chapter which I will not be doing anytime soon but the main game is certainly worth buying on it's own or in a bundle.			"

												This game is very buggy.  There's plenty of time where the audio doesn't play, and sometimes it looks like there might be a missing clip from an animation video.  Story wise it's sub-par, nothing special about the dialog and the plot seems under developed.  The game tries to make jokes but I wasn't finding myself laughing.  I trying to give the game a good chance, I beat the first episode and was working on the 2nd, but after a game breaking bug I've given up.			"

												AR-K is an enjoyable game for fans of Point & Click Adventures. This is a decent effort for an indie developer with a limited budget. While you may encounter the occasional glitch, there is nothing insurmountable. There is some nice humor and the amount of mayhem that can be caused through simple actions is amusing. I'm looking forward to future games from this developer.			"

												AR-K had many good points and only one flaw, but the flaw was lethal.On the plus side, the voice acting was surprisingly good.  The visuals were crisp and the animation was good, with a '90s CGI aesthetic.On the downside, the game design was badly lacking.  An adventure game needs to either make puzzles reasonably intuitive, or provide hints through dialogue, item descriptions, or readable messages.  If you expect players to do bizarre things like, just hypothetically, mashing bread in a helmet with a golf club to create itching powder, there must be more guidance involved than just expecting that the players will read your mind.  If players are thinking in terms of ""I could try this... or maybe this... or else that..."" the adventure is working; if they're thinking something more like ""What does any of this junk I've found have to do with anything?"" it's not.  AR-K falls into that latter category.Too frustrating.  Too much reliance on guesswork.  Too unrewarding.  Too bad.			"

												I'll be quick here: As some other reviewers have stated, this game has great potential, but in trying to get through the first chapter, the messy controls, less than perfect subtitles (great voice acting a humor though), and strange logic make it hard to suggest playing, but I really do want to see these things improve and pick it up again because of the heart and potential this game has.UPDATE: One of the developers went out of their way to contact me and explained that they are taking all the feedback into consideration and want to improve the later episodes. I think this is really admirable and I will definitely be playing more to see the progress they make. I don't usually like point-and-click games but the world and humor has potential and I may very well change my review as the development progresses.			"

												This game isn't necessarily bad, but it falls pretty easily into the ""meh"" category.Chapter 1 is unpolished (missing audio, spelling errors) and Chapter 2 isn't very straight forward.Both chapters are incredibly short, I think I spent more time trying to find out what I was supposed to do than actually playing the game.On the positive side, the characters in it were interesting... but that's about it.

												Even though it has some little issues with its UI and controls (it just feels impractil and doesn't always do, what you want it to), I would recommend to pick this one up, when it is on sale.The story is entertaining, the graphics look fine and the style fits the game very well.The puzzles are not always logical, but hey, it's a point and click adventure, what did you expect? :P7/10			"

												...I have this in my mobile (so I may end up playing more on that) - but as a point-and-click adventure it looks to have a good sense of humour (if slightly cliched) - and the graphics do look like they're from the 90s... but normally with adventure games it's more about the story / writing / puzzles... and from what I saw I would recommend it!

												Terrible puzzle ""logic"" coupled with a horribad UI, and then throw a dash of typos into buggy subtitles...  The colors are colorful, at least.  If you like female protagonists who are so ""sassy"" as to almost be mean, you'll probably enjoy this -- but only if you play it with a walkthrough because of the terrible ""logic"" employed by the creators of the game.  I would recommend ONLY buying this when it's on sale, and even then only if it's 75% off, or more. (note: I only got it because I had a bunch of money in my steam account from selling trading cards, and I like point-and-click style games, and it was heavily discounted on sale.)			"

												Skip. Harkens back to the very worst of the ""click everything on everything"" era of adventure gaming. The controls/interface are an unintuitive mess. You have to revisit locations and click items that you've already clicked before, with no cues that they'll behave differentlythis time. Plentiful typos in what is a sometimes confounding translation. The storyline is gibberish. They've also managed to come up with adventure history's most relentlessly unlikeable protagonists--I think we're supposed to think she's ""cool,"" but she's just a sarcastic jerk who makes terrible life decisions, then blurts them out to total strangers.Even the voice-acting is obnoxious. Game is just not good.			"

												The setting would be interesting if they ever talked about it. Graphics and voice acting are nothing to write home about but for me the worst part was the dialogue and the puzzle logic. Nothing seemed to make any sense and it felt like they really skimped on the writing because it honestly feels like they cut every other line so it ends up being very disjointed.Puzzle logic is traditional old school moon logic where you're given a very vague directive and left rubbing everything on everything until some baffling ""solution"" is found.

												I personally liked it. it might not be your type of game thoits kind of short, puzzles are easy and fun, not the best voice actingbut when it comes to story, sadly it doesn't really show much until the next gamei dunno, it might not be the best option for you but if you are willing to take the riskof spending 7$ and trying something new for a change.. then get this :) "

												This has the potential to be a fun game, but one thing makes it horrible:  You cannot skip dialogue.  So you are forced to sit and listen to the same dialogue over and over.  If the developers added a way to skip hearing things you've already heard, this would be much more tolerable.  But I can't stand playing it.			"

Product received for free
Game is not tragic, but some polishing would do wonders.AR-K is game with sexy female protagonist (b00bs). And some not bad voice-acting and not spectacular visuals. But I like it. It's 'rich in animation'.I got it for free and had some fun, so I can't downvote this title.Edit: Okay... inconsistency with translating strings and some useless dialogues and anti-intuitive goals in the game makes me go with downvote.Seriously, they need to upgrade those 2 parts.
