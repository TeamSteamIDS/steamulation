												A disgustingly bad business model on an otherwise fantastic game..**UPDATE!!** I just wanted to say that I recently gave the game another go and apparently they've added a free rotation to what kinds of animals you can hunt, kind of like different FTP games like League of Legends have a free character rotation that cycles week to week on what you're allowed to use, or in this case hunt. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! It certainly does not turn the game completely around, but it's a start. I'll give credit where credit is due, but the problems that were always there still remain. The problem with this free rotation is that.. if your basic free ammo or gun can't hunt that specie.. then it's pretty much useless to you. You still have to buy the correct gun and the correct ammo to be allowed to hunt it. I'm not going to change any of my review beyond this part here, as I believe it's important to maintain records like this. Some info may be slightly out of date, however. Just keep that in mind.OLD REVIEW:It's such a shame when you come across a fantastic game that's ruined by one of the worst payment models in any game you've ever seen. TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.Can you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.Want the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.Oh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete ""missions"" which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.Would I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.Also, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party ""offers"" infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you ""aren't the target consumer"". For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.If the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.			"

												Hello everybody,I play this game since nearly the beginning, have seen the initial developer go bankrupt and the new developer take over. I have seen month with nothing happening in terms of developments and I have seen the last few month after multiplayer was released with new stuff released every few weeks.If you love hunting simulations, theHunter for sure is the game you want. It's way more realistic then Cabela's games, it has pretty nice graphics and huge different hunting locations with many, many animals to hunt. Every species feels special and there has not been a really good hunting simulation since Deer Hunter 2005.- Pricing - The downside: You need to invest a whole lot of money. To really enjoy the game you need a membership for about 5$ a month. No membership and you can only hunt very few species, need to buy ammo for all but the default rifle and can't create multiplayer games. Sure you can stick with some basic guns, but to take part in competitions and finish missions you need a whole lot of different guns. Each between 3 and 5$. Not to forget, there are tree stands, ground blinds and tents you would like to use sooner or later because there are very few fixed hunting towers on the maps and... yes, each of these items is another 4,50$ from your wallet.Just a few numbers for you:All weapons with scopes (not caluclation different skins or ""premium"" skins)more then 150$All callers (no decoys, no consumables like scents):about 20$Decoys for one full area for each species:about 30$Clothing depends on what you want, so I don't add a number to this, but each clothing set is about 5$... and you guess it: Some work better in different areas or against different species.Stands and tents... lets say two of each for each reserve, you place them permanently, you don't want to pick them up after each hunt, so you can't really use the same two everywhere.more then 200$Sure, you are free to choose if you want this items, but to get everything out of the game you want this stuff. And more, every few weeks there is a new weapon, new cool cloth and your membership runs out every now and then. - Earn ingame money -There are ways to earn ingame money: Win competitions, but without spending money you can only take part in very few competitions and so the chance is low (and the prize money gets you nowhere). The developers also have partnered with third-party pages who offer you some money for playing other online games, taking part in surveys or downloading and using different applications. The results are spam on your email address, malware and a lot of these offers simply don't reward you.There is a different ingame currency you earn completing missions, but you can only use this ""money"" on consumables and you need a good bunch of weapons to finish most missions, so again: No way without spending money. There is no way to grind the gear inside the game.Without spending money you stick with the .243 for the free Mule Deer and you can unlock the Single Shot Shotgun to hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but you need to buy the ammo for it. That works with earned money for some time, but sooner or later you will run out of missions to do without buying weapons or a membership for real money.- Bugs -The game is full of bugs. I personally can't say there are gamebreakers, but animals getting stuck in trees, climbing trees, nearly all weapons stuck into your arm and broken reloading animations and other smaller and bigger bugs are around since a long time and often they return after a few patches. Gamebreaking bugs get fixed pretty fast but smaller bugs are often not relevant enough (and the fixes can't be sold like new weapons or cloth) so we will for sure see this bugs for some more time.- Community -Just have to add it now, after multiple insults from fanboys. This game has a small die hard community that are happy to have this game, due it's the only one of it's kind. This makes them accept and defend every action the developers take. Since this review I often got friend requests from some of these guys that have nothing better to do then to tell me I'm a hypocrit to play this game a lot and not remommending it in my review. That's what you get from the community if you are not a 100% fan and don't think it's okay to pay a small fortune for this game.- Conclusion -As said, I'm into this game since years, I love it and I will keep playing it, but since about a year this game is all about money and everything ingame is pretty expensive. Like with this the pre-release review postet on Steam, my personal experience showed me, that the developers break promises and contracts, lie in some cases, solve things always to their best and only communicate public what makes them look good.- Tipp for beginners -If you enjoyed the small free part, go to {LINK REMOVED}bit.ly/1oEMUr0 or google for ""theHunter 2014 box"" and purchase a key from the boxed edition of the game. For about 17 € you get 6 month membership (hunt all species, get free ammo for all guns) some starter weapons that allow you to hunt all species ethically and some additional gear. It's the best deal you can currently get as a beginner. This box is also available at Amazon and some other retailers if you want the box itself.- Update after some actions taken -Today the developers release a new .22 handgun and to make the game more realistic, changed the existing and wide spread .357 handgun and made it unethical for some species. What might be realistic is clearly forcing players to buy the new gun for about 4$.Changing already sold virtual items might be common but this change make this weapon pretty useless. Why? Because a lot of players have it. It's not a good weapon against larger animals and was pretty often used against birds, now the only animals it's good for are fox and coyote.The new reserve released some time ago included the new ""feature"" of climbing walls... what simply is a bad mini game and asks you to buy a new consumable: Climbing gear. Some would argue that it's purchaseable with gm$ and you can take 75% back if you remove it, but it's again something that will eat up the earned gm$ from free players and make this game harder to play for free (besides, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic that has nothing to do with hunting).

												EDIT: People are actually defending this? Compare the amount of free content to the amount of content you have to pay for. It's unacceptable to make me pay money to access that much content in a free to play game.It costs nothing to download, but I feel entitled to a refund.First of all, there was no tutorial for this. I was just thrown in, and expected to know how to hunt. I wandered aimlessly for a while, until I found some tracks. I followed them, and found some more tracks and some scat. There was so much scat, that I began to wonder if this animal was sick. I followed the trail for about one in game hour unril I saw it: a whitetail deer. Living in an area with a lot of rednecks, I was excited. Apparently deer are something you should want to hunt. I readied my rifle, and clicked the fire button. Nothing. Was the left mouse button not the fire button? The right mouse button readied the gun, so I figured the left would fire. Then a message popped up: ""You don't have the required license to hunt whitetail deer"". What? I just spent almost forty real minutes tracking this thing down, only to not be allowed to shoot it. This is a video game! I shouldn't need to buy licenses to hunt animals! And, since this was my first time playing, wouldn't it be nice to give me some licenses for free, so I can get a feel for the game before investing money in it (it's free to play, so I shouldn't have to pay to play it)! I quit the game, went to the store, and looked up how much licenses cost, only to see something that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. The licenses are temporary! Are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me!?If you don't buy the licenses, this is just ""Hiking Simulator"". I live in an area full of hiking trails. I can literally drive five minutes, and find a hiking trail. I do not have a gun, hunting equipment, or hunting licenses. I played this so I could hunt. After playing this, I might as well just get all of those things, because it would be something I could make memories out of, actually go outside, and do with my friends.Valve, I am begging you, set standards for what can and cannot be free to play. I am asking that either this game be removed from Steam, or you make the developers add free content. I am not going to pay to play a game that is listed as ""free to play"". I will pay for extras, but only if the game is good.EDIT: Okay, so apparently I didn't notice that there is a tutorial. You people can stop commenting on it.Some people are saying ""well, it's a simulator"". Simulators don't have to be one hundred percent realistic. The buying lisences part did not have to be in it, and made the ""realism"" (it's just a excuse to have microtransactions) too much.			"

												How dare anyone call this product Free To Play [F2P]? The free content in the game is limited to one kind of animal, one map and default equipment. It is worse than a demo, or even a trial. Everything in this game is available after paying, constantly paying. Forget about ""I paid once, I will have it all forever"". Pay and play, pay and play.I wrote this review nearly a year ago. I just got in to the game, to see if anything changed, but nope. Hermetic and toxic community of theHunter, still does not know what Free To Play is, and call this neither demo, nor trial a Free To Play game, blaming everyone but the developers, for the reviews, and everything else. I do not recommend./Update.With 27.01.2016 update whitetail deer and pheasants are now free to hunt, while mule deer that was available, is no longer free. They gave us a whitetail deer, but took a mule deer, so just ignore that part. Pheasants are new, and on top of that 12 ga single shot shotgun, with replenishable ammo. Still far from calling this game FREE TO PLAY, but that is a step in the right direction./Update 2.You can earn em$, but beware, most of these offers are a SCAM, they either ask you to provide cell phone number, then ask you send a text message, and type in the number you received. It costs $, you do not earn anything, you pay for it. Sometimes you will albo be asked to put in all your details, as well as, credit card details. Do not ever do it.			"

												To get any weapons and to be with any chance of actually finding something that can be killed you must pay a small subscription fee of £15.99 a year. After hours of searching I finally found a rabbit.  I tried to shoot it in the head only to be told that I am not permitted to kill it. I moved on and found a small bird. I tried to shoot it. The game crashed. 10/10			"

												Please read this if you are thinking about it!This game has potential But there's a Catch! (there is always a catch) Its Free to play, YesYou cannot shoot animals that are RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU if you dont have a License to kill them.EM$ = You use real money forGM$ =  you earn with missions etcI have played 74.4 Hours and in that time I have earned ""1721 GM$"" sounds like a Lot, What can I get for 1721 GM$?1799 GM$ gets me 1 day of Turkey License!!!!!!!!!!!!!!7 days = 3799 GM$28 days cost 7599$If you use real money1 day = 45 EM$7 days =95EM$28 days = 190 EM$£3.99 gets to 500 EM$ which is such a stronger currency by a stupid amount, So stupid that when my 3months expired and I checked out the prices, It wont even let me host a game because My subs ran out, But ive spent around £100 on items on this game,The items you PAY real money for ALSO have a durability, So that Premium item you bought gets deleted when you use it enough times, Oh right ok, Its a good game, But its a game they want you to get your money out so you can unlock the dam game thats ""FREEE TO PLAY"" other wise its just a Forest walk simulator, p.s Doc ALways messages you if you dont collect an animal that ran 342434 miles away to die.So over £100 spent on in game items and now I need to pay to unlock them again. ONLY HOST CAN USE ITEMS! So i cant use my ducks and canadian goose set up with my mates now unless I pay, Wrong wrong wrongDont regret wasting your money on this game like I have guys, Let me set an example for you.Thanks if you made it this far!

												It may be free to play but you have to pay for a subsciption (example: xbox live) to be permitted to hunt certain wildlife, tags for said wildlife can purchased with in game money and real money but it's expensive(small amount of tags for 12$-20$) and certain wildlife can only be killed by permitted weapons (example: rabbits may only be killed by a .22, shotgun, or bow) . Weapons and equipment can bought as well but the points to buy the items can only be bought with money in real life making it more difficult for the player to enjoy the game, if there was starter items such as tags for animals or in game money i would recomend it to friends. 4/10: score will change if listed above have been altered or more store options have been added			"

												You can only shoot 1 of the 18 animals for free. Solution: pay for hunter licenses.You can only shoot deer, fox and coyote with the free gun. Solution: pay for more guns.You want to play with friends in multiplayer. Solution: pay a sub so that your computer and your internet can be used to setup a server.You don't get the carry capacity to do even semi-long hunts. Solution: pay for extra carry capacity.You payed for extra carry capacity but you still don't have the carry capacity to do awesome long hunts whole day long. Solution: NONE!!!You can travel free on maps from lodges but on all maps this is very time consuming with how they were layed out by the developers. Solution: pay for tents and camping equipment.You don't get free ammo for 32 of 33 weapons in the game. Solution: keep paying money for new ammo (hardcore simulator?) or buy a membership.You don't like your clothes or the fact animals can see you from miles away because there is no telling which bush actually gives you cover or not. Solution: Pay for clothing items.You're tired of stalking animals for hours before you get a shot at them. Solution: Pay for callers, decoys, ground stands, tree stands, tripods, scent lures, feeders, bait.I'm surprised the developers don't ask money for every footstep you take into the game.If you buy the $15 starter pack, you will be missing tons of guns and all other equipment that are simply needed to enjoy the game. But even if you spend $50 on the biggest starter pack, you still miss many equipment to hunt half the animals in the game and the weapon selection in the biggest package is rather sad (I wouldn't dare to say it was done deliberately to lure you into buying the more fun/better weapons later seperately wasting all the money you gave in the first place on guns that will be gathering dust).This is the best executed hunter game ever if money grows on your back. We're talking at least €200 here to start enjoying most of the full game. If you really want to hunt in luxury (it's a game, who wouldn't want to?) you'll start looking at a lot more money than that.The game is easily 8/10. The amount of money you have to throw at the game to actually get to that 8/10 makes it a 1/10 at best.My library hopefully shows I'm not one to be afraid to spend money on games. But these guys brought it to a level that I have never seen before. Congratulations on surpassing Korean MMO's EW.Addendum: subscriptionAnd what are people paying subscription for?Retextured or new weapons? Because you have to pay to get those.New animals? Because you have to buy licenses to hunt those.New equipment for the new animals? Nope not that either because you have to pay for all the new callers and feeders and stands.Multiplayer? Well they did add MP afterwards but it can't be it since an MP game is hosted on our computer with our internet connection. And they didn't spend any effort on making a standalone server or adding any useful filters in the client browser to warrent anything special. That is if you are lucky enough the client browser is working without big lag and there are none of the many connection and disconnection issues.New clothing? Again these cost money.New maps? Well it must be maps then since there isn't anything else. So we're paying €35/year for the 4maps? they added in the last 5years. Those are some damn expensive maps!We're not paying for continued development of the engine either.- View distance of 210m for weapons that can make accurate shots of 500m.- Trees that are literally square with highest ingame settings and the leafs are just flat green 'sheets'.- Game settings can only be adjusted outside of the game.- A fox and pheasant can just walk next to eachother because it's a fairytale land where all animals are big friends.- Mouse often feels laggy/jaggy however you want to call it. Many people have these small FPS drop problems and support just ignores it all.- The surface has the most annoying edges which makes it very awkward to crawl up to an animal and finding an angle where your gun gets enough depression.- Floating rocks, plants and trees everywhere you look on the map.I can go on further with a list of technical stupidities that were allready old tech 5years ago.

												I really had some good few hours. This was the first time I played a hunting game and I really expected nothing from it.But I was surprised how how good the game was from its technical view. It's not the best looking game but the flora and fauna really got some love and detail, the sound is awesome and the lighting and sun effects are also really nice.Really felt like being in the woods.Now here's the negative trait. This game's free2play model is nowhere near anything you might consider as free to play and fair. Everything costs a lot of money and either you join the membership or you have a walking simulator (you're only allowed to hunt rabbits and mule deers).It's more like a demo when you don't plan to invest money. The game even calls you a guest.  And oh boy, the pricing is insane. Probably a good hunting game, but I can't recommend it. It's a shame cause it was really an atmospheric experience for me.That said I think if you are a really passionate hunter in real life you would probably gladly spend money on this one and you would probably go nuts about all people who complain abouth the subscription model.

												This game is perfect for the adventurous gamer who enjoys spending real money on memberships, buying virtual items and buying the privilege of clicking on things that look different from other things. It comes with a decent selection of weapons - all you have to do is buy some ingame cash with your actual cash. Is a bear threatening your backside? No problem - just buy the bear hunting licence for a few dollars and he'll be toast. Wanna play with friends? That's great - slap some more dollars their way and you're good. As a free-to-play character you get one rifle and you get to hunt a whole two animal types.The visuals are fantastic for the year 2004 - I especially enjoyed having the animal I was watching at one point twist its head around and give me the bedroom eyes from behind before it vanished into the ether. Then my buddy sank into the river, where his eyes separated from the rest of his head.The F2P experience is, in short, a complete waste of time.			"

Except instead of firing I was told for the first time that I needed a hunting license for that specific animal and that I had to get one before I could hunt that deer.			"

												First of all - This title is fake!!! Is not Free to Play.If you are looking for a free to play hunting title i have to start this review with some bad news: this game is not free to play by most interpretations of the term ""Free to play"". As a limited member you can do the following:You can enter all the reserves and wander around.You receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller.You can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers. Hunting all other animals is prohibited!!. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.To shoot them you need to buy a license with real moneyUnlike other free to play games you can make points to unlock new content like weapons and other stuff. You are stuck with what you have and that is it.			"

												This game looks like it has potential and is fun. However the 'Free-To-Play' label is misleading. After downloading the 2GB game I looked forward to shoot some helpless animals but, as soon-as I loading in the open world I had no idea what to do or get started. No controls or help menu was available in-game, so I had to resort to an online video on the internet.After getting used to the main controls I ventured out to hunt… I found a trail of a Blacktail deer and ID’d it with my gadget. A pop-up appeared saying I need a licence or a membership to hunt this animal. I then looked up to see what I could kill. Apparently there are only 2 animals you can hunt and 1 weapon you can use in this F2P game.I now know this Free-to-play is actuallya Fee To Play and Pay-To-Win game, with micro transactions, donations and memberships everywhere. Sorry, but I looked forward to play this game and not Pay-To-Win… It has really good graphics quality though.Rating: 2/10			"

												Holy money hungry game.  Everything except deer (a certain type of deer) is locked behind pay walls.  I'm not talking about low pay walls, I'm talking about high pay walls.I just about bought the 3 month membership for all licenses because I thought.. Why not, looks like it could be fun.  But then I went to the store to check out the guns and stuff I could buy.  Well EVERY SINGLE GUN costs EM which is bought with REAL dollars.  There is no way at all for you to buy these guns unless you open your wallet.  Basic guns cost 5 dollars each and better ones well over 10.I don't mind the freemium models and actually spend a lot of cash on them lol.  But I have NEVER seen a game that is so blatently money grabbing as this one.  It is absolutely astounding how much  money they want you to pay to have access to the full game.  You could spend 100's on 100's of dollars and still not have unlocked all the content (and its not because there is a ton of content..).  Plus no matter how much you play you will not be able to unlock it without using a ton of REAL money.This game should be removed from Free to play because all it does is give you a VERY limited demo (I didn't have a license to shoot the anmal I found in the starter area) and then want money to do anything.Dev's like these should be BANNED from steam.

Not at all a free game but fun to try it as a demo version. still a thumbs down for calling this a F2P and implementing a freakishly expensive System, with monthly fee AND having to pay for weapons that are needed to play. Really cant recommon this game with other alternatives out there to try.			"

												If you've actually come to read these reviews before just downloading the game because its free, good on you. Dont be fooled, this game says ""free to play"" but is actually one of the most expensive games that exists. You have to pay to shoot animals, and if you dont pay, you can shoot like 2. You also have to pay for all the guns, all the maps, all the clothes, all the items, and everything else. The only things available to purchase with the free play ingame currency, are licenses to hunt other animals, but you need ALOT of money. One mission, say, tracking a deer, takes at least 15 mins, and at most (usually) 2-4 hours. This 2-4 hour mission, tediously tracking down a deer, making SURE that you never, ever lose it, and that you get all the tracking markers, will get you around 100-150 gm$. The first license available to purchase, is SEVEN THOUSAND. Thats 140-210 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HOURS, to be able to kill ONE MORE ANIMAL, that you will most likely, NEVER SEE, and if you do have the grace and patience to track this animal for another 2-3 hours, killing it would be hard, and JUST LIKE KILLING EVERY OTHER ANIMAL. One last thing, you have a weight limit on what you can carry out of camp, and there are tons of different ammo types. If you bring ammo meant for a deer (that wasnt labeled as ""Deer Bullets) and shoot ANYTHING else, it just does not count, at all. So you better be prepared to not find an animal, and not shoot it with the guns, license, and ammo that you dont have, all during time that would be better spent buying a real gun and shooting yourself in the testicles, all so that another human being never has the horrid chance to experience the ""free"" travesty that is, ""The Hunter"".   11/10. Masterpiece.Also, credit for this review goes to my good freind, Wolf_Hunt, please, add him on steam. ;)			"

												The steam page may boast the idea that  theHunter  is a  free  game. However this is more or less a downright lie. TheHunter is a game that is designed to make the free to play version of theHunter be extremely linear and boring but show enough promise into what the game  could be  if you payed for the membership. These micro transactions are thrown upon you at almost every second of this game. Want to play with a friend? Nope you have to pay! Want to use a bunch of cool weapons? Nope you have to pay! Can I at least hunt and kill alot of animail's? Nope! Without membership you can only kill and select amount of animals. Even if the shady transactions and free to play model were not present it doesnt get rid of the fact that theHunter never stops being a boring and extremely glitchy game. Actully shooting an animal is near impossible due to the very laggy movement. I found myself having a hell of a lot more fun using the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick breaker app on the hunters phone in game than actully hunting, which is never a good sign. Hunting games can be fun and interesting but theHunter with lack of a better work screwed everything up and created a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥which is a disgrace to good games trying to get on steam these days.-AUS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :DPastry2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired.

												this is probably one of the worst free to play games for one reason: its not pay to win, not pay to have a chance to win, you have to pay for every little thing from hunting licenses to new guns to basically what you need to have fun for more than 2 hours, so would i recommend it? ♥♥♥♥ no unless they remove their paywalls			"

												BIG THUMBS DOWN.. I really like this game but well ya know since 2009 the game has been crashing and the fact that nobody can really host a server without it crashing and having to respend more EMS for more items that go away each time the server crashes.   Instead of fixing the game it seems like the development is finished.  THe only thing the devs are working on now it seems to be adding more micro transaction items that are not even part of the average hunters game/experience.  FYI Em$ 9362.00   That's my toal EMS Spent  Gm$ 3836.00 and that is my total GMS.. EMS is real money and GMS is in game earned currency.  Can you see the difference ?  I have almost $100 worth of real money transaction items and in 80+ hours of playing the game (check profile) I still have not made enough GMS (in game currencey) to even buy a gun. ALl you hear is people complaining about not being able to get anything without buying it.  THis is PAY TO WIN AND PAY TO PLAY there is nothing free about thehunter.  The Game Suport Is Non Existent as well..			"

												Hello,This game could have gone somwhere, but seeing as the devs just want you to pay every few months or so to hunt all the animals I don't think it is going anywhere. If you just jump in you only get to hunt 2 animals, from what I have seen there is no tutorial to help new players out. Animals very rarely spawn in the time I have played 2 animals spawned and I coulnd't hunt eitehr of them because I'm not going to pay like $10 for 3 months to hunt animals.... The map is very bad it doesnt even tell you what the places are, most of the time I played it I was trying to figure out what the ""!"" sign on the map was :/ I do not recomend this game to ANYONE even if you love hunting games it would cost less just to buy like a $20 hunting game and hunt ALL animals instead of paying $10 for 3 months of hunting all the animals. If you want to even have a little fun in this game you HAVE to pay...I would probably give it a 2/10 and thats because I'm feeling nice today....			"

												Hi everyone! Emotions overfilled me so i decided to share my thoughts about this game//Firstly it seems to be pretty nice game. I watched trailers and saw a man hunting with a bow!!! Its actually my dream ! So..I launched the game and some kind of menu in browser style opens.. WTF? I was scared :p But then i got used to it its actually pretty convinient thing. Then i pressed *HUNT* and spawned in some kind of camp. Graphics in this game are nice. The movement is awful because when i pressed *c* button to sprint it was a ♥♥♥♥ing walking speed  -_- But its okay too. Then i saw my first animal! It was a deer i guess..) I wanted to shoot it but didn`t want to miss so tried to get closer and spooked it away. I was a bit sad about this but i had even more enthusiasm.. Right after that i saw a rabbit and shoot it. IT WAS AWESOME!!! But i didn`t know what to do with the body. Like how to kinda claim it.. And so i went on.I found deer traces and tracked it down my GPS. After 30 minutes of walking ( actually it was nice cause the world detalised beautifully) i found My dear deer drinking water from the river. That time i was really carefull and started crouching from 2 km long)) And i crouched for my ♥♥♥♥in entire life but it was nothing because i enjoyed it. BUUUUT when I finally got to the      *sniper point*  and aimed at deer head IT SHOWED THAT I CAN`T ♥♥♥♥IN HUNT CAUSE I DONT HAVE THE ♥♥♥♥IN LICENSE!!! I LOOKED WHERE CAN I GET LICENSE AND SAW THAT IT WAS ♥♥♥♥IN 100000$$$$ This how my story ends. ♥♥♥♥ this game. It`s better be paid then be free but BASED ON THE ♥♥♥♥IN DONATE!!So decide. All things considered this game is really nice in gameplay way but ♥♥♥♥ the system of donation in this game. You can play this game with satisfaction only if you`ll buy this crappy license. I SAY NO!HOPE I HELPED YOU GUYS :PSorry for a mistake!!! There actually is few hunting available animals like deer and maybe others i dunno... But anyway. I don`t like this certificate paid system. (Edited here)			"

												Thats f*cking it! I'm going to write a review.. This is my first review and probably my last because if I write a review, trust me I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off as hell! And hell, am I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of now!As you can see I played 700+ hours in this game and long story short, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. Believe me the game is worth paying money for, it’s WORTH IT’S MONTHLY prescription and please if you are here to play the game for free just turn around the way you came, this is not for you. It is only free to play as a DEMO, you get extremely limited options and playability. If you want to put money in this game it is definitely worth it IF NOT FOR;1)	The lack of multiplayer compatibility; (300 servers and only 5 you can connect to due to “could not connect to host”, “host has quit the game”(server still in server list 30 mins after the host quit the game already),  “lost connection to host”, server of my buddy up and running (TeamSpeak confirmed) and not in server list for about 45 mins, “error 16005” “I GOT IT”, “error 404 developer’s f*cks not found”2)	Abundant bugs (which NEVER EVER GET FIXED) and I’m not talking about the bugs previously discussed as connection bugs, I’m talking about bugs of getting stuck in scenery, floating ducks that stay stuck in the air (due to connection error again though), animals stuck behind trees and rocks, animals that have died on player side but not harvestable because of server misalignment,…,.., and the list keeps going and going3)	The developers don’t give a f*ck *(this is the most important part for my experience); They keep hiring new people with great new ideas about a new species like the “polar bear” (which you’re not allowed to f*cking shoot!, PUT YOUR DEVELOPING TIME IN SOMETHING USEFULL YOU IDIOT DEVELOPERS), persistent problems with connections which have been an issue and have been addressed numerous times by the community but have been left aside because getting new weapons and new animals is more profitable, priority is giving above all to getting a new skin on a new weapon which costs you another 5$ because the colour has changed on the weapon or because the colour of the animals has changed.4)	The game is not even near a complete stage, with its developers building on a broken game and making it more unplayable than it already is. They keep adding sh*t without fixing previous errors and by doing so they make the implementation of anything REALY worth it get drowned by the everlasting errors and bugs that follow it. The implementation of something good is followed by weeks, if not months, of issues resolving from this add-on and by getting the public back to the game the implement something new, which starts the hole sh*t train from the beginning.If you have not already turned around and decided not to look at this game, I tell you again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR PUT MONEY IN TO IT IN IT’S CURRENT STATE. I don’t think this current state is going to change to anything good in the foreseeable future as the developers just don’t give a f*ck or are trying but are so inexperienced that my 6yo niece can make a better running game. This game has potential but it should have been a Steam GreenLight game and not a finished one and the enormous ego that makes the developers not think about gameplay but all about money made me vote this game as DO NOT RECOMMEND. I hope to god that the developers are reading my review and start working on the issues that need to be fixed to make this game worth it. If they are not, be wary of my next review, as I will be even more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off as I keep playing this game in the hope it becomes something it should be.(PS: this review was 16 pages long but I removed a lot of the swearing, reducing it to 2. If you read this all please rate funny or helpful in the hope it reaches the developers of Expensive Worlds) "

												I downloaded this game because it peaked my interest from the videos and because it was ""free"". I have never really been interested in hunting, but  I was pleasantly surprised with how fun and relaxing it was for the first few hours. After I finally hunted down my first deer and killed it, I was really excited to go back to the store and see would I could purchase with the money I recieved from my hunt. It was then that I realized this is absolutely not a ""free to play"" game. I understand that the developer has to make money, and I have no problem with them making the free to play members work hard for what they get, but it is literally impossible for free to play players to progress. The only thing you can really afford without paying is ammo, and it still takes a while to get the money for it. You don't even get money for harvesting your prey. You have to complete missions (which by the way, most require items that you have to buy in order to complete) to get the in game currency and the prices for the items that you are allowed to purchase with in game currency are astronomical. All of the weapons have to be purchased with real money. All outfits must be purchased with real money. The licenses' are available through in game currency, but it will take you a year of playing to get a 7 day license for one animal. The worst part is that the items in this game aren't even cheap. Almost everything is $3.00 and up, and that money will add up considering you have to buy basically each individual item (with the exception of some bundle packs).Most free to play games offer premium and free to play. Usually, premium makes it a little easier to progress and adds more content to premium members. Not in this game. ""Free to play"" in this game is literally just a demo. You have to pay to play if you want to do anything other than hunt mule deer, keep the same weapon, stay on the same hunting ground, make your own game, and constantly get kicked from games after doing nothing wrong. So basically.. you have to pay if you want to do anything fun, and that's why I got this game to start. I would not recommend getting this game unless you plan on spending loads of money.I also want to add a note to the developers. People will still spend money on this game if you make it more friendly towards free to play players. You are severely limiting the crowd of people playing your game by making it ""pay to play"". I know a bunch of people that have never had the slightest interest in hunting that would love to play this game. If you open up the game more, more people will come, and more people will be willing to support you and pay money. However, as of right now, I would not support this game because you have mislead me and many others that downloaded this game believing it was ""free to play"".My review will change if the developers ever decide to remove the extreme restraints that they have placed on the players. If nothing changes, they need to list this as ""demo"" and put a price tag on the actual game, because the store page is very misleading.			"

												Combine this game with your TrackIR: It's like I'm really outside!But seriously speaking, I used to play this game a bit before it was on Steam. If you actually pay for your subscription and buy some guns and ammo, it's a very fun, comfy hunting game. If not, then you're♥♥♥♥♥♥outta luck. Don't believe the 'free to play' advertisement, this is subscription based game through and through.I'm still gonna recommend the core game itself since it's enjoyable if you jump through the hoops. I'd still rather just pay for a full game for $30 or something, though.			"

												I want to love this game. Which I do enjoy it alot, but what it comes down to is what everyone else says, PAYWALLS. When you start you get 3 days of unlimited tags for any animal which sounds great right? The catch is that you only get two guns, sure the 12 Gauge is permitted to use on A LOT more animals than the .243 they give you as well but once the three days is up don't expect to be able to enjoy the game until you spend $3.99 on some game time. But wait there's more! You still only have the two guns, one blind, one bottle of decent scent remover, and one call that only works for deer. So in other words expect to spend a ton of money on this game if you really want to play it. It's not my kind of game for that exact reason. Other than the paywalls this game is amazing. If they were to remove the paywalls and make you pay $30 for the game I'd be all in for sure but there's no way I'm playing any more of this. Hopefully the new one will not have paywalls but I'm not holding my breath.			"

												TL;DR Great game, horrible pay to play system.This game would be great, if you just had to pay, say, $20 a month and have access to all content, but this is not the case.First, you pay about $3 a month to be able have infinite liscenses and shoot everything. But you can't shoot everything because the starting rifle only has specific species it can shoot. In order to get more powerful guns, you must pay real life cash. The conversion rate is rougly $1 to 100 ingame currency, but many weapons cost more than 500.This means you must pay $5 for an ingame gun along with the $3 a month to shoot a virtual deer that will most likely see/smell you if you don't pay for ingame camo which is even more expensive than the gun.*Edit April 11th, 2016, I accidently a word			"

												I noticed theHunter was free to play so thought I'd give it a go. This is how my experience went:I load up the game and jump straight into the hunt! I familiarise myself with the controls and get ready to begin.I hike through miles of woodland, meticulously scanning the area for my prey. These are my woods. I am the apex                     predator. A god among mindless furry beasts. After what seems like hours, I see it. My prey. A 33.4kg female Mule deer. It hasn't seen me yet. My primal hunter instincts activate and I stealthily approach.I zero in on the deer. My deer. My trophy. It is in my crosshairs, I hold my breath, ready to fire, I was born for this. Everything I had accomplished in life leading me here, to this very moment...Balls! It suddenly spooks, and trys to run. I panic and let out a squeal, firing blindly. I see blood spraying everywhere. I had hit it, but the poor thing just keeps on running, trailing blood the whole way.Still panicking, I chase after the deer, following the trail of its blood. After 10 mins I find it...The deer, my deer, has collapsed from exhaustion in an alarmlingly large pool of it's own blood.It's in so much pain.It looks up at me.It knows.""Please, kill me."" It tells me with its eyes.Those eyes.I start to cry.I can't do it.I walk away.I uninstall the game.I still have nightmares about the deer.I start drinking heavily and consuming opiates to cope with the pain.It helps me forget.Life will never be the same.10/10 would suffer from PTSD and ruin life again.

												There are so many negative comments on this game because 'expensive worlds' want you to pay a lot of REAL money for weapons and equipment to play smoothly and comfortably. This is most annoing problem with 'expensive worlds' game. It is far too expensive compared to even better stand alone titles. You quickly find yourself spending over hundred dollars per year, while you can buy good new title for 30$ !!! check prices of equipment for only OnE GOOSE !!! - you can buy separate game for that money!! paying for ammunition for weapon you bought without membership??? are you kiddin??? they are just greedy thats why there is so many negative comments. like mine;) I'm not so stupid to pay them anymore, They won't see any of my money till they won't change their policy and prices. I prefer to invest in Far Cry Primal for example. Much better investment of Your time ad money. TheHunter community? mostly bunch of paid funboys, sorry to say that. Good bye Hunter			"

												YES....and.....NO!After playing this game for an unhealthy amount of time both on Steam and before it was released on that platform, it is probably time for a little review of this game that I love to hate and hate that I love. First and foremost: calling this game a ""Free-to-Play"" is like calling Donald Trump ""Mr. President"". They are both technically true but just seems like stretching reality a bit too much. Though it has to be stated that it has become more ""Free-to-Play"" than it used to be. Once there was a time where you could hunt one animal at one map/reserve with one weapon and be left with overwhelmingly many messages about all you are not allowed to do, what you can't shoot and where you can't go. At the time of this review you now have a couple of animals you can hunt for free with a couple of guns and even a couple more animals on rotation every week. Still you will not have a great experience with this game if you have no interest in putting any money into it. And that is what it boils down to....For hunter enthusiasts and others that are looking for a mostly realistic hunting simulator with a lot of variation, weapons to use, scenery to explore, competitions to enter and have a lot of free time on your hand, this would probably be the best thing you can find out there today. It becomes even better if you put in some extra money to buy additional equipment to make your hunting experience even richer. But you need to know in advance that it will cost you. There's a yearly subscription (can also get 3 months and 6 months) and tons of  weapons and equipment you can (and probably need to) buy. It uses an in-game currency, which you can get by winning competitions (for most animals every day in 3 levels of experience). Seems like a lot of chances to win right? Not so much. It is not often you get that winning animal, and it is not much you win for each competition, so it will take a long time to save up for useful equipment. If you really get into this game, expect to open that wallet to get stuff faster.That being said, I rarely feel ripped off with what I have put into this game. Sure, I feel that for what you get of updates and new things in the game you don't really get enough for that yearly subscription. Any new added weapons and equipment is not included in this subscription and has to be paid for seperately.  Expect to get one new reserve and a handful of new animals to hunt, plus up to three hunting towers included for free a year. It has to be said that of the vast amount of equipment and weapons are optional and very few affect your chances of placing higher in the competitions, but rather make it more convenient when hunting. I.E. buying and placing tents gives you more places on the map to spawn, other items makes it easier to get in closer to the animals, like blinds and tree stands, while you can also buy camping equipment (consumable) to fast travel between spawn points. Next to the joy of just hunting pixelated animals that behaves relatively realistically and animates well and joining competitions there is a rather large set of missions to complete based on specific animals, specific maps or specific weapons. Unfortunately to complete all these you will have to buy a lot of the weapons and equipment as they are simply needed in certain levels of the missions (Like ""shoot two Cotttontail Rabbits with a longbow from a tree stand""). Completing missions earns you a secondary currency which can be used to buy certain items (mostly consumable ones).There is also ethics to consider. You can't just run around shooting any animal you see with whatever weapon you have at hand. Specific animals have to be shot with a proper weapon and with proper ammo. You can't shoot a rabbit with a shotgun with slugs or shoot a grizzly with a .223 bolt action. Each weapon lists what animals it can be used for and you don't really need many to cover them all. If you buy one of the Starter Bundle Subscriptions you get a selection of weapons and equipment.There are also achievements to be earned in the game. They are not of the most creative part and mostly contain harvesting  a set amount of a specific animal and harvesting a set amount of animals using a specific weapon next to walking distance and time spent in the game. The points you build up here is basically your hunterscore that is used to progress you through levels from beginner to intermediate and further to elite. The higher the level, the bigger prizes in competitions too. Other than that it doesn't do much but placing you somewhere on a leaderboard.The graphics in the game is quite nice, though a little bit dated. The graphic engine used is the same that was used in Just Cause 2 I believe, with a few modifications. The reserves are rather huge and it will take you hours to walk from one side to another. There are 36 animals (soon 37) to hunt on 11 reserves as of november 2016. The reserves offer variations in terrain, animals, geography and seasons. Something for everyone in other words. The sounds of the animals and the weapons are also mostly well made with the occational time when you can clearly tell that it is a recording and a bit too loud when it rains. Speaking of weather. That is probably one of the things that is not technically good in this game. You wander around and you see sun and blue sky in every direction and then suddenly it starts to pour down like there's no tomorrow a second after. The weather effects in this game needs a big overhaul.Then there is of course a handful or two of small glitches and bugs that never seems to get fixed. Rarely gamebreaking but can be irritating non the less. Even more irritating when it seems the developer is too busy creating new things they can sell with ""micro""transactions to do anything to fix what is broken. One has to take into account that it is a niche game and a small develop team basically working 9 to 5, so one can't expect too much. With the resources they have they have certainly made quite a game over the years and it is ever evolving, so there's that atleast.It is worth mentioning that the game has to have an online connection too, or you won't be able to play. If the server goes down so does your game. An unfortunate but nescessary evil in the game model they are running. Luckily it doesn't happen too often, but if it happens friday night you might likely have to wait to monday before they fix it, as it seems the devs have a monday to friday work schedule. Well, to end this rambling and finish this review:If you like a realistic simulator where you sneak, stalk and search for that one big animal to win you a competition and if you aren't worried about paying for your entertainment then you should definitely check out this game. It can be highly addictive, but relaxing. Slow, but thrilling. It is a game you might find yourself coming back to over and over again.However, if you are looking for free entertainment and a actionful game with a lot of running around then this is definitely not for you. You can walk around here for an hour without catching a glimpse of a single animal. Running scares the animals away as they can here you from a long  distance. It does not get much slower paced than this.You need patience in this game.If there was a neutral grading of this game I would probably neither rate it up or down, but seeing that I have had countless of entertaining hours in this game I feel I have to recommend it, even though it is definitely not for everyone and I would never ever EVER call it ""Free-to-Play"".Side note: You do not need to be a hunter in real life to enjoy this game. I have never in my life hunted or killed a single animal and probably never will. Pixelated animals however needs to watch out ;o)For what the game is, not looking at what it claims to be, I'd rate this game a 7/10Happy Gaming!			"

												Most of these reviews are compltely inaccurate, mostly in the form of sarcasm. Facts:Alphafact: I have killed everything in the game without paying a single penny. (read below) 1. This is a free to play game. It costs absolutely nothing to play this game. 2. You are given a .243 riffle, and a single shot 12 guage shotgun, both with unlimited ammo. 3. You can go into any map of the game. An immersive and realistic environment that sits on my top 3 most realistic of all time, in any game i have ever played. 2x Geforce GTX 970. At full detail levels. On the other hand player avatars can use a realism update, but the animals definately do not, and as this is a human vs animal game that is what counts.4. You can hunt Whitetail deer, pheasant, and 3 varieties of rabbit. (to start; fact is it cost nothing to hunt the other animals)5. The ballistics and damage models are by far the most accurate in any hunting game to date. Source: My opinion; I have hunted just about everything legal on the north american continent in the last 35 years, Including 6 Alaska hunts. and i have played Cabela's [titles here] hunting games as well.5. You can take part in in-game missions (quests) that reward you with in game currency (gms) To purchase perishable supplies like scents and baits, as well as licenses and ammo. (pssst this is the how-to)Biggest problem with the game is:1. Most people dont know what the hell they are doing they are running around like they are playing Battlefield 3 or Gears of war....this is the playstyle that they are failing at with this game. While you don't have to be a ninja to aquire a target in this game, you will need some patience and a little stealth to get anything in the trophy range (hello...real animals spook as do these, if they hear or smell you, you probably wont see them)  2. You arent getting any full auto weapon in this game. Every shot (except those made at the range) are tallied to your permanent record. The only semi-autos in game are a few select shotguns.3. No grenades, sachel charges, land mines or tow missles, sorry.4. People think programers work for free. They don't and this game wouldn't exist if players didn't take ""shortcuts"" and buy weaposn, gear and licenses and instead used the gm method of hunting to get the very same things.Bottom line: This game is free to play and you can hunt everything in the game without ever spending a dime of real currency. If you cannot do that, you are doing something entirely wrong and likely not in the scope of the game i.e. hunting and harvesting game. If anyone really needs any more clarification on the how to hunt all animals in this game as a guest, send me a message and i'll try and simplify it further for you.			"

												*Just scroll down to the lower half of my review if you want proper Pros and Cons instead of a story*This game caught me off guard. I was bored one day, hopping from store page to store page of F2P games. All of them seeming like the same cash-grab garbage. So I stumble upon this game with it's Mostly Negative rating and assumed it was another cash-grab that needed to be purged.I downloaded it because I had been angered by the sheer amount of F2P cash grabs and decided I should throw a negative review at one of them.So I played this game for a bit. I enjoyed the game-play quite a bit actually, perhaps the only good hunting sim out there at the moment. Played without paying any money for a little over a week and was ready to post a nice little negative review. However, I noticed people that posted positive reviews did not seem like blind fan-boys trying to avoid regretting the money they put into the game.Noticed the monthly subscription fee was among the smallest I had ever seen ($3.33 per month) and there are 3 Starter packs of different prices that offer some items along with a few months of membership. So I decided ""F*** it"" and bought the Wayfarer Starter Pack.I eventually came to the conclusion that this game is pretty damn good with a low price. If you want to play this game without spending a dime then run fast and run far.The nice little ""Free-to-Play"" label next to Play Game isn't quite true. It should say ""$14.99 | Add to Cart"" and have ""Download Demo"" off to the side. So for the game:PROS:+ Slowpaced relaxing game-play.+ Many species of animal that require different methods to hunt. (Many share different styles while some are unique)+ Rather low-entry fee compared to other ""Free-To-Play"" games.+ Decent community. Only encountered one troll in multiplayer who was quickly banned by the admin.+ There is an in-game currency earned by completing missions which can be used to buy consumables and temporary licenses for non-members.+ Still supported and updated by the developers. The developers have also relaxed some of the restrictions for non-members, such as adding a free animal rotation and making all the reserves free.+ An actual hunting simulator with tracking, flushing, etc. Instead of those low-budget shooting galleries that are on store shelves.+ A huge variety of equipment to allow constant play-ability and variation.+ Low cost membership grants access to all animals to hunt. You start with a 12 Gauge shotgun which can be used to hunt every animal except for Bison.+ There is a wonderful satisfaction in going for a group hunt then taking a group selfies in front of the kill.+ Nice sound design.+ Looks decent without causing FPS drops on my potato rig.+ Servers are stable most of the time.CONS:- All equipment cost real money.- The ""Earn EMS"" system to gain money via methods other than directly paying does not work at all. I've taken enough surveys to earn over $100 in in-game currency and haven't received a dime.- Some animals are clearly added just to sell specific equipment. Bison require high-powered rifles, Black Bears are so skittish you almost always need a bait barrel and you cannot hunt ducks without buying a plethora of equipment to the point it feels like you purchased the ""Duck Hunting"" DLC. I personally haven't delved into most of the equipment yet so I cannot say if they're worth it or not yet.- Slow-paced gameplay is not for everyone.So far I have spent $60 on this game. 15 of which went into the Wayfarer starter pack.Overall I recommend this game IF you are willing to put some money in it. If you're open to putting money in it I recommend getting it for free and seeing if it is for you. If you are adamant about not spending a dime then stay away.			"

												This game looks beautiful and plays really well. It has some major flaws though.First I'd like to state that I never bought the game, but played it as a free to play.First thing is the wind, the wind always blows from the south-west, making it quite boring and inefficient starting from any souther point on a map in my opinion. While a small problem, it is still an issue making the game dull at that part. A wind change every X hour or having it randomly set to one thing at the start of a map would be better.The biggest issue is the microtransaction part. As a free to play game you can only hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits. You get all the equipment for the mule deers straight away, but in order to get the weapon required for cottontail rabbit, you have to go through microtransactions or watch ads/register on sketchy sites to obtain in game currency. There is a currency in the game that you can earn by doing missions, like shooting and confirming the kill of an animal or tracking and spotting a certain animal. But this currency cannot be used for buying weapons, only ammunition and other items such as scent removers etc.Paying the subscription allows you to hunt every single animal, and some packs give you weapons and sights to get started. But none offer said air rifle for use on rabbits, mallards or pheasants. I find this a huge problem as I wanted to shoot rabbits.The game could go very far if it had better ways of obtaining things. The ads for currency should be removed, everything should be purchasable with the free to play currency and it should be possible to obtain it from successfully shooting and killing animals that give points (mostly male animals)			"

Posted: July 15, 2015
												I've got about 140hrs in this game before it came to steam, which gives a total of ~200.I have also spent over 100$ for in-game items and licences. I'm guessing the only reason why I played it for so much was the fact, that there aren't any other decent hunting games.Unfortunatelly I really can't recommend this game to any new players.First of all, it gets more and more outdated because engine is getting old and has plenty of limitations.Secondly, the game is not Free to Play at all. Free accounts have access to 2 terrible guns, one bad scope and can only hunt a few animal species. You might be able to spot a boar but you won't be able to shoot it. Frustrating.You have to buy licences to hunt all the animal species, and you can buy a licence for 3, 6 or 12 months. Yeah, it's a subscription fee, to play this game. And that's not everything.Then you learn about ethical weapons and the fact, that you need different weapons to hunt different species. Quickly you realise that you need to buy extra wepons and you can only do that with rl money.So you spend extra 50$ on a proper rifle with good scope, a revolver, pistol holster, a bow, a backpack to carry all that stuff, maybe some camo clothing or a fancy binocs with rangefinder.Now you can start to hunt and it's quite fun. For a while...Then you get to the same point I did. You have killed every single animal species, long range, short range, revolver kills, bow kills. What can I do next?Misssions. Missions reward you with in-game currency that can be used to buy mostly consumable items. Honestly, there is nothing usefull that you can buy for that. Forget about buying guns  or even callers.It gets worse. Many, many of the missions require you to use a specific weapon to complete them. You either spend rl money on some crappy gun (but I need it for a mission) or just ignore missions completly, since they are a waste of time.Then you move to competitions.Some competitions require specific guns but there should be plenty available where you can compete with any gun. To win a comp, usually you need to harvest a highest scoring animal. Most comps last 48hrs, some of them have limited attempts.Winning a comp gives you a trophy and some em$. That's the currency that is usually only purchaseable with rl money!You might think that this is solution to all your problems. Win enough comps and be able to afford guns and items.Sorry to disappoint you.Unless you are willing to spend countless hours, you won't win a thing. You might get lucky and bag a winning animal on your first attempt, but chances for that are extremly low. From my experience: winning a comp that wasn't even very popular (not many players competing) required around 12 hours of playing (6hrs a day).You will find out that most of the players, still playing this game, are massive no-lifers. MASSIVE.There are competitions that require you to bag as many animals as possible in 48hrs period of time. Regularly you will have players that are willing to spend up to 40hrs online in that period (forget about sleeping etc) just to win a reward that is worth 1-2$.Soon you will realise that you're better off paying 5$ for a new gun that spending 100hrs doing competitions.Eventually, there is no reason to keep playing this game. You got every animal, had some fun. Missions are pointless and a cashgrab attempt, competitions are for people with no jobs, who can pay 10+ hrs a day.			"

												Don't bother downloading this game unless you are hardcore right into hunting sims. Hunting sims, not games..So this is not an arcade hunting game whatsoever. You will spend a lot of time running around tracking or even trying to find anything moving at all. The graphics are actually pretty nice looking, and the game runs very smoothly.The main problem with this game is that it is listed as Free to Play. It should really say Demo with paid content. or Pay to Play.You start out being able to only shoot mule deer. Doing this will earn you points (that don't actually do anything, it seems). There are quite a few animal types in the game, but if you want to go after anything other than mule deers, (oh yeah, rabbits too) than you have to get a license to hunt them. How do you get a license? Well, by spending in game money. How do you get in game money you ask? Well, you can do missions... 3 of them. Once these 3 missions are done you will get a small portion of in-game money, however, not enough to actually buy anything. These are not daily missions either. They don't reset ever, once they are done they are done. The only way to unlock more missions is to buy a license to hunt a new animal.. So how else can you get in-game money then? Well, the only way is to buy it with real money. This is not free to play... this is actually more expensive a game than most AAA big name games.If you want to play the full game expect to pay a ton of cash, and then, only for whatever time limit you have bought for your licenses, then you have to rebuy them again. LolTerrible terrbible terrible pay model. One of the worst I have ever seen. I'm not saying it should be totally free, but this is absolutely just not the way to do it.I don't recommend this game at all.			"

												Free to play? No. It's free to walk around, aimlessly, for as long as you want. You can also; ""track"" an animal, however, unless you SPEND REAL MONEY on a monthly subscription, to obtain a licence for that SPECIFIC animal, you can not SHOOT it. This hunting simulator, has brilliant technology that is aware of whether or not you have a specific licence, and if you do not, your character simply aims the gun down when you try to click your mouse button. Very realism. For someone that has no real experience hunting, but does enjoy spending hours in hunting games, this is extremely disappointing. This game has potential, the multiplayer aspect of the game with friends is also fantastic, but if I have a friend who has given the devs money, he gets far cooler stuff than I do, and can hunt far more things than I can. I am aware a lot of developers do this, and I don't have an issue with paying members getting cooler stuff, but I disagree with the fact that I lack the technology to pull the trigger on a rifle to SHOOT an animal, whether I have a licence for it or not. I'd also rather a 1 off payment to own the game and have full access to everything it has to offer, than continue dishing out money per month to have access to certain features. So remember, this isn't free to SHOOT at animals, but it is free to run around aimlessly like a d*ckhead.OK I cannot reply to anyone directly as Steam will not let me, so I can just continue editing this. Let's set some things straight:@Mathia$ - Yes, it does give you a little taste. I became addicted and ended up paying for a 3 month subscription - so I guess their method of making addicts has worked. I've also paid again for a .300 rifle and a scope, another 10 Euros spent lol@Dannj90 - Yup. Like I said, the game has potential and is addictively fun. I just prefer the method of buying a game outright and having everything it includes, instead of monthly this, and pay for that etc etc: completely my personal preference.@HaddockA - When people review things, they're reviewing them from their own personal experience. I can't imagine reviewing something without experiencing it. I wrote this review after the 3 day trail had ended, and I couldn't shoot anything. THAT was my experience, hence this negative review. Game's great, if you're willing to pay a lot for it (when you're under the influence that it is free).. So yeah, good luck finding someone's review of something where they aren't referring to personal experience.@darkfitz - lol I don't know where to begin. I'm not going to judge you on your computer terminology as that's uncalled for and unjustified. I don't know about real life hunting as I've not experienced it. The only killing of innocent animals I'll ever do, is in a game. Oh, and before anyone wants to educate me on the killing of innocent animals for the survival of mankind, and our lust for eating meat, yeah - I get it. No lecture required. I eat meat too. I'm aware of animals being slaughtered for that, it's just not something I would or could ever do.So, are we all happy now? The game isn't ""bad"", I just personally dislike having to continue dishing out money for something I've become somewhat addicted to...... Yes, that's a drug reference. Goodnight.			"

												i came into this expecting to write a really negative review because this game is marketed as free, without the DLC its basically a demo. yet, a really enjoyable demo.to the people who say this game is slow pace: well ofcourse it is its a hunting game genius.to the people who say there are almost no animals: in my first 30 minutes i had to decide between 3 different animals to track, a rabbit, a deer and a cayote. first i went after the rabbit since that was the only animal i had seen myself.this game almost geniunely makes you feel like you are outside, because face it, thats the closest thing to outside (or the route from your house to the closest grocery shop, the few times you dont order pizza) you will ever see. if you were to turn a fan on so you can also enjoy the wind this will get an immersion rating of 9.9/10.i see myself playing this semi-often, its super relaxing and yet very entertaining.but!there are a noticable amount of really small yet obvious bugs that you cant help but notice, and question why the dev hasnt fixed these yet? does he not play the game himself? and ofcourse the DLC drama this game has, to be fair its still pretty entertaining but i can see it getting old without the DLC's. and i dont want to spend 15$-50$ for a game marketed as free.i would normally say ""but hey, its free, play it yourself"" but no, this game requires an account first of all and secondly the download is massive for a 'free' game. if youve got the time and the space on your computer and you like slow pace games sure, try it. but in most other situations contemplate if youre willing to go through possible trouble and annoyance for a hunting sim (a good one might i add).

												Welp I wanted to retry this game and so i deleted my past review...So here's an update:Cons:-Walking simulator -Chase an animal for over 9000 hours to then when you finally shoot it, ""you dont have license for this""-Extremely slow paced-I'd rather watch paint dry-IF you were to put together Trion, Nexon, Aeria Games, Blizzard, EA Games, Bethesda, Gaben, Soros, etc; all together they still wouldn't compare to this company in terms of greedyness.-Free to download, buy to play, buy to (expiring) licenses for 90% of the animals, buy to weapons, buy to look at it.Pros:Uninstaller works.To anyone still reading this.. Save yourself a headache. Go play something else. The graphics are nice and so is the concept but this is one of the WORST game companies I've ever seen.I hit recommend for those ""optimist"" types that like to filter the obvious large amounts of negative reviews in place already.(((I've heard the government tortures terrorists to get them to speak by making them play this game with a 'free to play' account for hours.  So far it works and it can't be proven that its anti-humanitarian, the government doesn't even bother to ""dispose"" of their captives once they talk because by the time their done with this torture method the captives are FUBAR and usually end up commiting suicide via 6 bullets to the back of their head while trying on their new concrete shoes on the middle of a crocodile infested river.)))

												This is the hunting simulator I've been wanting for years, and you can love it too, if you keep a few very important details in mind:1. Despite its claims, this game is not really free to play, or at least, the free to play model is not great. To really enjoy it you need to invest a good $30-$40 to get some good equipment (so you don't scare every animal away immediately) and licenses (so that you can hunt any animal). 2. This is NOT an arcade-type hunting game. It actually requires you to hunt, tracking your prey and occasionally losing them. It takes time and patience. There will not be ten bucks popping out at you every five seconds. This is actually what I love about the game, but I can see how some would not take to it as easily if they were expecting something else. Besides, the world is gorgeous. Take time to walk and enjoy the sights along the way. Pro tip: After the first 150 yards or so after leaving your hunting camp, don't use the run button. It can scare the animals away. Again. you have to be able to enjoy a slower-paced game.3. The user interface takes some getting used to. It doesn't work like your average first-person shooter, and there is not a great tutorial that teaches you everything. Most of your important items, like your weapon and deer call and such are mapped to the number keys. Watch a beginner's guide on Youtube or on the TheHunter wiki page before diving in.If you can handle those three things, you are in for an incredible hunting simulation. The slower-pace makes the successful kill incredibly satisfying, and the online tournaments you can enter (you don't play with other people; just submit your best kills to see who scores the highest) add tons of incentive to keep playing. As I said, part of the joy of this game is just enjoying the world. I don't know how many screen shots I've taken during my time in-game. It's beautiful. Happy hunting!Pros: Excellent hunting simulationBeautiful worldStellar sound qualityCons:Not really Free-to-PlayUser interface could be betterSome might not like the slower pace8.5/10			"

												I noticed this game in the F2P section and I was very eager to play it. Afterall it wasn't all that 'free to play'.. Basically to kill almost 90% of the animals (which takes already 15min to track one down) you need to pay membership. I don't think this game will ever succeed as a F2P.			"

												There are so many animals in this game its like you are acually hunting. Spend hours hunting down animals alone or with your friends. Hunt down deer, bears, ducks, pheasants, rabbits, boars, ect. The amount of hours that any player could have put in to this game would have been amazing.Sounds like a good game right, well if its a good game why am i not recommending it, well here is the reason why. The store page is lieing, to you there is nothing in this game that makes it free-2-play. The 4 hours i spent playing this game i was so confused on why i couldn't shoot a boar THAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Turns out you need a liecense for almost every animal. You can only kill 2 animals if you are a free-2-play player, which is mule deer and rabbits (which in my opinion the hardest animals to find). I spent 2 hours looking for mule deers, I looked up guides, I tried different approaches, and still couldn't even see one. i was following a mule deer's tracks for a full hour and everytime i would get close it would run away (now keep in mind I was crouching the entire time and I didnt even get to see the damn thing). Also, while I was looking for the mule deer i found a whitetail deer, a pheasant, and a boar, WHICH WERE EASY KILLS. So this the games logic, I have to pay in order to click on animals. Yes that makes so much sense, my god i would rather go hunting in real life. Oh and i didnt even get to the equipent, guess how many weapons you get, just guess, ONE. It makes no sense to me how you only get ONE weapon in a hunting game. Ok let me tell you everything you get when you first start the game. You get a sniper rifle, a huntermate (a GPS/tracker), a mule deer caller, a camera, and binoculars. Now you might think that that is exactly what you need to go hunting. Well your wrong, because the full 4 hours i was playing the game i kept finding everything other than mule deer. Oh and I almost forgot mule deers are only found on one map, and there are i believe 8 maps. So let me get this straight there are 8 maps in this game, the animals that you are able to kill are only available in 1 map, and you only get 2 animals that you are able to kill. Yeah this is definatly free-2-play. Oh yeah also, if you want to be able to kill all the animals in the game you have to get a license. If you want to know something similar to this system, its like Xbox Live. You pay 14.99 for a 3 month license. WTF thats criminal now a days, now if you are the kind person that doesnt mind paying, then thats great this game is for you. But its still very stupid that you have to do such a thing like that.Hey Expansive Worlds and Avalanche Studios, let me teach you something about free-2-play.In order to make a good free-2-play game you must be able to make sacrifcises. Sacrificises such as being able to hunt down every animal in 1 map (not 2 you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), be able to give the player 1 of every weapon, and a caller for those animals. Now is that so hard. If you listen to this review and do what i say this will definately make this game, The Best Hunting Game Ever Made. It has the potential.The final verdict for this game is:3/10and if you listen to my suggetions it would probably make the game at least:7/10Think about it			"

												I have never though about playing with a hunting game. I thought before, hunting and sport games are the most boring and pointless games ever made. But one of my older friend asked me if there are any hunting games out there, so I had searched and found theHunter for him, and helped to install and play it. Then it has shocked me how beautiful the graphics are, and how deep and complex the simulation is. So I have installed it on my PC too and spent a few hours to try it, and I was astonished by the quality, complexity and scale of it. The nature, landscape, weather, animals were so perfectly, and so beautifully simulated, that I have never encountered anything close to it before. And there was enough variety and complexity in gameplay (lots of species, equipments, methods) that I would not say it is boring.BUT the whole thing is messed up with the financial model of the game. There is actually no reward and no progress with successful hunting, you can only buy new equipment/new possibilities with real money. But if you would, for example spend at least 50-100$ to be able to have all the possibilities the game has to offer, then you would also loose the reward for hunting, you can not cook a dear stew or roast a boar with hunting friends in a wood camp, drink beer and sing etc. ....If you would spend such money, I advise you to buy a real gun, and try out real hunting, I bet its much more worth it.As for the game, I would even pay a fixed price of 30-40$ or even a monthly fee around 15-20$ to be able to play in a classic MMO style, where you can unlock stuff gradually as a reward for hunting. And no microtransactions and real money purchase for stuff. For nobody playing. Everyone has to earn equipment as a reward, so the game would get some kind of point and progress.Other really good idea would be to embed the game, in a full scale survival based game like Rust. The hunting simulation is very-very simple compared to theHunter in those games, and none of them has such a good simulation and landscape graphics. But serious and complex natural simulation and hunting mechanism would really add to those game concepts, and the hunting part would be well embedded in the reward cycle of a survival game, where the meat, hide, bones etc. can be used to survive after processing.

												Whenever a game says ""free to play"" you know that there's always going to be those people who have better gear than you, but you can deal with that because the game is fun as it is however, this is not the case with theHunter...I really want to like this game, I really do but the fact that it has pay to win written all over it is some-what depressing. The Graphics, great. The shooting, great. Co-op, great. Tracking, great. Buy ways (with real money) to hunt certain animals and almost everything else required for hunting, not so great...In conclusion I would say not to download this game unless you are living on your own private island and have the cash to spare.

												I am changing my review for this due to the recent change as far as privileges for free members. You can now hunt Whitetail, rather than mule deer, and you may hunt Pheasant and Rabbits. The single shot shotguns is also free for said Rabbits and Pheasants. For people like me, the standard ""no frills"" hunter, this makes for a sim I can appreciate at a free level. I hunt mainly deer and pheasant, so this game will allow me to continue doing so without spending a dime. I reccomend this game, since it isn't going to mug you as hard as it did before.Also because I like Whitetail more than Muleys, but that is beside the point.			"

												The gameplay is ok but the restrictions are not. I can understand premium weapons and stuff but not premium only animals. Free players are restricted down to two animals and there are 18 therefore a lot of the animals you encounter you can't shoot at. Free players can't even create their own servers, making it difficult to play online.I can't believe I'm saying this but this is the WORST free to play game I have ever played (yes that's right I have played Star Wars The Old Republic). I couldn't get into it enough. The gameplay is all there (shootin' stuff) but the restrictions are too and they are horrible. The idea was good but if they made it a normal game which you pay for and unlock everything It could actually be good but no, they went down the Free to Play route.A good game but bad F2P Method.3/10			"

												Wanna play a game that requires the patience of real hunting, a game with worse microtransactions than Candy Crush?Wanna pay 30 whole bucks to hunt one more species than the one you can get in the begining?

												First thing i have to mention is, this game is DEFINITELY pay to play.F2P is a LIE,This review is made on the mindset that you paid upfront anywhere from 20usd-40usd for Either the Wayfarer Bundle or the PathFinder Bundle.-----------------------------------The Difference between Wayfarer and PathFinderThe only things you need to consider are-Another 20usd for a silent bow and a backpack.The extra 3 months membership is not something you should consider.If you want to try using a silent bow to hunt animals ,and would like to carry more than 1 weapon, then you should consider the PathFinder Pack.------------------------------------Now then,Why is the hunter fun/not fun.+Authentic* hunting (Close enough i think, i never hunted IRL)+Multiple animal varieties+Multiple Types of guns to use(Rifles,Shotguns,Bows mainly)-Very slow game-a Kill can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 90minutes, depending on your skill level and luck-an Animal might survive after getting shot and escape so far you might not find it, wasting another 10-30minutes+That said a kill is more gratifying because of this-----------------------------------Should you buy a bundle and play this game?If you want to find a game where you can have fun killing animals easily-     NoIf you just want to kill animals-    Maybe                                - if you have the patienceIf you would try and experience a new type of gaming, of Slow pace and patience-YesIf you are willing to crouch/walk 85% of the time, listening to nature, scouting for animals-    Yes-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             TLDR-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game is slow, expensive, and might not be worth your time.But a kill you gain after hunting it for 30-90 minutes feels great.EDIT- i realise i could get 5 kills in a 72minute session, so if you have a decent amount of skill in the game , you are able to get consistent kills every 10-20 minutes or so			"

												Feels like a good game being hijacked by Wall Street.1. It's a demo, not a F2P game by any regard. There's no logical way to progress without paying.2. It's subscription-based despite being mainly a singleplayer game with token multiplayer.3. Even if you subscribe, there are semi-arbitrary limitations on what guns can be used on what animal, forcing you to A. Buy two more guns B. Buy a shotgun and then continuously buy special ammo. C. Buy a bow, which is far harder to use than any other weapon. Either way, you either pay more or pay some and gimp yourself.4. Even if you buy the subscription and then guns you've only made the game passable. Forget about accessing any other guns, utilities or clothing without paying even more. So be prepared for about $18 just to get the very basics, and at only a 3-month lease to boot.5. The retail version of the game right now is about $16, for which you get 7 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. The 'Starter Pack' closest to that one is $32 for 4 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. Here's a hint. The first one is a decent price. The second one is deliberate milking of its customers for even less content.So yes, the game itself is something I'd definitely see myself playing, but even after subscribing I can't motivate myself to throw more and more money at it to get anywhere. It's a nice enough game, with well-made environments and soundscape, but without a campaign of any kind or more elaborate multiplayer experience it's more of a 'pick it up every now and then to relax' type of game. Which is fine, but completely hampered by the constant money grabbing - as a one-off I'd happily pay $25-40 for it, but for that kind of money now you'd barely get 10% of the full game and a subscription ending to watch out for.[edit] Turns out that even if you have the licensing and the appropriate gun, you need to shell out more cash for hunting some species (e.g. mallards) for decoys and whatnot, or get shafted. Neat.			"

												Occasionally I'll think about this game and wish I could play more of it using all of the mechanics. This game has an incredible amount of potential and the developers seem like hardworking people that have made a really good game. Unfortunately, the way they delivered this game was incredibly poor. I would happily buy this game for $40 and start out with everything you would normally get starting for free. But I should be able to hunt animals, then sell the meat, hide etc. to earn ingame money and purchase licenses to hunt bigger and better animals and buy more equipment. Sadly they instead made you have to pay real money overtime to play. I just can't recommend that.			"

TL;DRF2P is a Demo-Mode only. Solid hunting game with detailed hunting grounds, cheap MMO-like payment model, rare but large actual content updates but loads of optional microtransaction material.F2P and Payment modelThe F2P content contains the license to hunt Whitetail Deer, Pheasant and three kinds of Rabbit only. As of the latest major Patch you now get a shotgun for free as well, so the grindwall for hunting the rabbits and pheasant is gone. One ingame currency ""GMS"" can be obtained by doing missions like ""Track a Mule Deer"", ""Harvest a Mule Deer"", ""Spot a Whitetail Deer"". Its a pretty useless currency though.The payment model lets you pay per month in order to get a license for all animals, so think of it as a ""cheap MMO-type payment"". However in contrast to MMOs, actual content updates to be played by you as a license holder appear only a few times a year. On the other hand these updates usually contain a new hunting reserve with new animals, so they offer quite some content.There are a lot of weekly minor updates with new guns, clothes and other equipment not really needed for playing the game though.The GameIn my opinion thehunter is a well-made hunting simulator with decent animal behavior and very well made highly detailed hunting reserves.The negative points I want to mention are random fps-drops in certain areas of the map which many players seem to encounter, ""old animals"" seem a bit lacking in texture quality compared to the new ones as well as ""old reserves"" are not as diverse and different from each other as the more recent ones. Some reserves are considered lackluster by a majority of the playerbase due to ""recycling"" of animals, e.g. the Australia reserve only contains the kangaroo as a specifically australian animal.Some content patches in the past caused problems for players to connect in multiplayer games.How much does it cost ?If there is no sale going I can not recommend buying a membership via the Ingame Store at all. Instead, I highly recommend to get the DVD Version of 2013 for ~10 € which is a far better deal.Basically this DVD Version comes with everything you need in contrast to the ingame-store sets. Even if you want to extend your membership, the DVDs offer much more. For some animals, callers are quite handy, so you might want to plan another ~10€ for callers. For fox and coyote I think the ""Jackrabbit caller"" is essential, for the rest of the callers you dont own it is really dependant on your playstyle. The same goes for any more ""advanced"" hunting clothing.To summarize, I think buying a DVD-Version which offers a fair deal, if you can not get the 2013 Version you will need ~5€ for a decent big-game hunting rifle, depending on the ongoing sales.Important:Do not buy any of the starter packs unless the largest one gets a hefty discount on Steam, because the other ones will leave you with the lack of a big-game rifle as well and are lackluster in value proposition compared to buying any DVD Version.One thing that should be mentioned here is goose and duck hunting. Though you can find those animals without any special equipment, you will need this equipment should you want to hunt birds in large scale.Since geese and ducks require dummies and a special hunting setup you need ~15 €, depending on the current sales for a goose or a duck setup, so these act as ""DLCs"".AlternativesMost of the ""Cabelas"" Hunting  games are just mass animals shooters, the ""Cabelas Big Game Hunter Pro Hunts"" is not bad though, just simplified mechanics.If you enjoy the detailed landscape and the ""slow"" gameplay, you might want to look into ""Fishing Planet"". This one actual is true F2P, but comes with a high grindwall.			"

												I have played this game off and on over the many years it's been promoted and advertised.This is a fenced in game riddled with micro transactions that require you to spend money to get new items and gear along with actual Hunting licenses as a Monthly Subscription.I am not a Fan of the Micro store requiring actual money, but they do offer missions to get consumables through in game currency for hunting contracts. Granted, the game is enjoyable as a Hunting simulator and challenging. But, the game has evolved since I first started playing.Beta (2009): free to play limited to 10 bullets and Mule dear for hunting only2012: free to play limited to only Mule dear Hunting only with unlimited ammo2016: free to play limited to a rotation of various animals for hunting *at time of review still needed to playI am going back to the game during different times of spurts for hunting enjoyment, but from past experience you will always need a hunting buddy with plenty of equipment for a well rounded enjoyment on many of the Hunting Maps available. *NOTE* I will be updating this review after I play through this years newest content.*Edit 9/03/2016* : OK the game still requires guests to miss out on alot of things, but with the rotation of different huntable animals it does allow for those that still want to hunt with out paying a Chance to partake in hunting.Now if you wanted to see what I am talking about I have done a Stream with a Buddy of mine and the first 30 minutes should help shed some light on the game play as a Guest.- Also to note later on the guest gamers ended up getting Starter Packs to allow for unlimited hunting of any and all animals.

- The Newest addition of Dog's is a Nice addition that was a LONG time coming. Granted you still have to train your hunting companion through the actions you need them for.- Guest Rotation of Hunting changes the type of Animals you can hunt every week on Thursday, During the time of the Video it was limited to Water Fowl as the new rotation Free hunt.- You can still attempt to complete missions for in game currency but you will still only be able to spend them on Consumable Items.- Every beginner to this game will always have questions that might take some time to learn. There is a Wiki Page that was put together by the community to help with virtually anything you can think of related to the game. - - Shopping - - Equipment - - Hunting recommendations - - etc.Please take a Chance to check it out if your having trouble with your decision on spending money on the hunter.http://thehunter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hunter_WikiaThe wiki will help even further if your not sure on equipment purchasing, for the type of hunter you would like to try and become or focus on.http://thehunter.wikia.com/wiki/Buying_Guide*edit*If there is something that is not helpful about the review let me know in the Comment's, so I can help you further.Nominated this game for the Steam awards.

												I say it's disapointing. The reason why is because it's sorta like a buy to win game,expect in this case you have to buy things to literally do ANYTHING. I loaded up the game,got used the controls and set off on a hunt! I then found a trail of a boar which i encountered a few minutes later. I aimed at it ,and pulled the trigger and i was stopped by a message stating ""YOU DO NOT HAVE A LISCENSE TO HUNT THIS ANIMAL"" I then quit to main menu and went to the site to look at the stuff. I think you can only hunt a rabbit,and a deer for a starter thing? When i went to the site everything had a price tag.Then i uninstalled this game forever.It's an okay game but the get it's true potential you gotta pay! For some this may not be a problem,but i want a game where the content is in the main game not the things your purchase on the side. SO IN CONCLUSION.0/10. FOR MAKING ME WALK 100 MILES,For letting me shoot birds or anything else!,You gotta pay to play.			"

												If you're willing to pay the monthly fees, you're going to have a good time. It's a fun game that can kill a lot of your time. Probably the best hunting simulator in the market.However, if you're going to play for free, which is how this game was marketed, you're going to have a bad time, because all you're going to do is go around, find an animal, attemp to shoot it and get a message saying that you have to pay to be able to hunt it. You're only allowed to hunt one type of animal, and it's moderately hard to find one, let alone hunt it.Do I recommend it for how it was marketed? Of course not.Would I recommend it if it were Buy2Play and not Pay2Play disguised as free to play? Absolutely.Don't mind the low play time. I used to play it in the standalone launcher before it was on Steam. I decided to check back if anything has changed. It didn't. They only added more packs to be bought.			"

												As so many reviewers before me I have to demand to get rid of this F2P tag. You have to pay real money on a subscription based model to play the game as the developers intented it. Otherwise I guess it is a great game. Kind of costly though, because nearly everything you can buy is only temporarily. With the free membership you can only hunt mule deers. This wouldn't be so bad if there were only mule deers on the map, but no, every animal that is huntable, you can find and thats where it really gets frustrating. You are hunting a deer for 40 to 50 minutes, get to the best shooting spot you can find, only to find out when you pull the trigger, that it is a white tail deer and you dont have a license to shoot it. The free membership is a farce. It is a really bad demo at best. I guess it would be a great game if it wasn't for this ridiculous payment model. Please Valve, do something about this F2P Tag.			"

												I have been searching for a good hunting game for awhile now and this gem popped up. Its a beautifully crafted game and you can tell there was love put into it. It is a solid title, however, I cannot enjoy the Hunter because I am constantly stopped by pay walls with it. Microtransactions are abundant and the game takes the fun out of it being a video game by making you have to pay for (like in real life) rounds, rifles, pistols, holsters, hunting licenses (which are temporary) and all sorts of other manner of hunting equipment as well.Its a great game, it could use vehicles, but the major downside is how all the equipment is blocked by constant cash fees. You can't just go out there and hunt whatever you like without paying the developer something and that is definetaly not what I am looking for in a hunting simulator. I will say you start with some basic equipment and are able to hunt hare and whitetail deer (correct me if I am wrong).I could understand and appreciate mechanics that dealt with ingame currency by rewarding you with cash for trophy kills, but that is not the case. I wish this was a standalone title, but sadly it is not. There is a multiplayer aspect to it and I really did not delve into it. If this is a MMO-like/multiplayer game with a deep community I could slightly understand the microtranscation fees. I still however in my good conscience cannot reccommend this game. If there is a standalone version where I can just buy the whole product and am not blocked by microtranscations, I would gladly pay for it. It would be well worth it in my honest opinion, but until that point this game is a no from me.			"

Posted: October 23, 2014
This review mostly discusses the main issue the game has for most people – the pricing model. If you are looking for a gameplay or more balanced review, please Google for a “Let’s play” video or read another review instead. The positive recommendation only applies if you deem the pricing model as discussed acceptable.First things first - This title is not Free to Play.If you are looking for a free to play hunting title i have to start this review with some bad news: this game is not free to play by most interpretations of the term ""Free to play"". As a limited member you can do the following:  You can enter all the reserves and wander around. You receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller. You can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers. Hunting all other animals is prohibited in the sense that you cannot do so at all. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.Unlike other free to play games you cannot feasibly unlock new content by playing the game a lot or by being good at it. You are stuck with what you have and that is it – and it’s admittedly not too much. The pricing model.So, you made it past the initial post explaining the game is not free to play and might be considering picking the game up? In that case, let us talk about the games pricing model and what it entails. The games pricing model is twofold: there are both subscriptions and items purchases. Subscription:  Subscription starts at 9.99 for a 3 month period which is arguably quite good compared to most MMO's. In exchange for your subscription you will receive unlimited ammunition for all the weapons you own, and a license to hunt all species of animals in the game. It is also possible to buy ammunition and animal hunting licenses as separate items though the monetary exchange rate for this is fairly bad in comparison. (But perhaps worthwhile if you are a very casual player)Items: Buyable items cover a broad range of possibilities. There is weapons, scopes, clothing, deployables (Hunting towers), utilities (Animal callers, storage increasing backpack) and temporally power-ups (Wind indicators, facial paint et cetera).Except for the power-ups all items are permanent once bought, with the caveat being that you will need an animal license and ammunition to hunt specific animals. There is an additional caveat as well: Each weapon can only be used on a subset of the animals in the game - you cannot use a pistol on a bear or a rifle on a pheasant for example. If you want to hunt all animals you will need to buy multiple weapons. The utilities sold are somewhat more optional though a huge convenience: callers enable you to coax animals them out of hiding or locate them, while specific clothing will provide superior camouflage thus fewer running animals as you try to sneak upon them.Bottom line? Expect to buy a membership and - depending on playing preference - one or more weapons, scopes and clothing if you wish to fully enjoy everything the game has to offer. The cheapest variety would be buying the wayfarer pack for about 15 Euro's; this includes 3 months of membership, a shotgun, a pistol with scope and some consumables. The shotgun itself is - with different ammo types - able to take down every type of animal in the game. Alternative you can do some research and find yourself a relatively cheap combination of items that allows you to hunt virtually everything the way you want it. Still, don't be surprised if you end up forking 20-30 bucks over initially if you chose this route (that figure includes a 3 month membership). Final thoughts.Despite the games price model arguably being steep I personally find myself enjoying the game quite a bit, so for me it is well worth the triple-a equivalent price I spend on it so far. Considering my current time invested, the subscription fee and my lack of a need to buy new items the game will be cheaper than a regular subscription MMO if I keep playing it another month or two, while spending a similar amount of time on it.That said: I can only advice the game to people who – like me – enjoy hunting simulations quite a bit. If you plan on picking up the game you should be able to live with the thought of having to possibly do a relatively sizable investment initially, followed by a fairly mild recurrent billing scheme. It is not a good pickup for people looking exclusively for a free to play title due to the rather sharp limitations and the inability to unlock content by playing a lot or being good. Still, the game itself is a lot of fun if you like hunting sims. If you can stomach the need for payment and don't mind doing some research into the items you want i can hearthily recomment it.Addendum - How to make the most out of your game without paying a dime: There is an excellent guide on the forums by Maverick that discusses the topic of getting the most out of the game without paying a dime for it. The method discussed will not grant access to all content indefinitely: You will be reliant on missions and counting your bullets. Even so it will allow you to access more content (Including hunting other animals) on a temporary basis. If you are strapped for cash but really want to play more of the game the suggestions in it may be a viable alternative - at least for a while.			"

												The only way to earn money to buy better things is to pay with real money or sign up on other websites that this game is advertising for because all the developers of this game care about is money. This is ""free"" but there is very little gameplay to be had for free.This needs to get taken off steam.			"

												This game is so misleading as it could be. Now why the hell doesn't Steam put the ""this game has pay offers"" (I don't remember exactly what notice says but you know what I mean) note on this game? This game is basically PAY OFFERS ONLY!!!""Free to Play"" my ***!. Be warned people, this game is NOT FREE TO PLAY in any sense! To lie on this level is actually somewhat impressive. I have never before encountered a game like this. When developers want people to pay for stuff in game they try to be suddle. This game however straight up lie and honestly think people will fall for it.TL:TRGame NOT free to play! Developers lies...badly!			"

												Atmospheric and beautiful FPS where you're not shooting terrorists, zombies, aliens, demons or even dinosaurs. This time... it's bears. Bears, elks, pheasants and other wildlife roam the wilderness for you to track and hunt down for that perfect trophy. Gorgeous nature scenery and a wide variety of weapons keep the shooting fresh and relaxing.This game is one of the best examples of combination of realistic graphics with amazing gameplay. The game perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the hunt, level of interaction with the environment is extremely high. ""theHunter"" impresses with its proximity to the reality and the different variations of action.The game is free to play. If you are not a member, you can hunt 5 species for free a week. 2 of the 5 species are always the same, but 2 species change every week so you get a chance to hunt all animals. It is a simulation, so it is important for the player to take the right ammo when going on a hunt, otherwise some shots will be disallowed(Company promotes ethical hunting).			"

												THe hunter is what they say it is. its the most realistic hunting game out there. the game isnt like the cabelas games where you find an animal in the first 10 mins. sure in this game you can find animals but if u want a real trophy its gonna take time. it says its free to play. it is free to play but to hunt anymore animals you will have to buy a membership or just wait till they are free to hunt on certain weekends.

Posted: June 13, 2016
												Let me just start off by stating that I’m giving a positive rating because I think TheHunter is a decent game, but despite this I’m going to get pretty negative in this review, mostly because it’s essentially one very long complaint of a problem that I think is crippling to the game. I’m also not going to summarize how the core game works at all, so if you’re looking for a review of that then this probably won’t help much.As you can probably already see from the Steam reviews, there’s been a lot of controversy about Thehunter’s Free 2 Play model. I never had much experience with this, as I started out paying for membership, but the controversy eventually led Expansive Worlds to revise their model to a slightly less intrusive one, but asides from the confirmation that is was indeed a pretty bad model I think that maybe a lot of the negative reviews are undeserved.In general I think that periodical charges are perfectly reasonable in a game which offers continuous updates and new content, and TheHunter is one of the better hunting games in a video game genre otherwise marred by some pretty embarrassing design standards. It should be pretty clear from my playtime here on Steam that I like it. Despite a visible need for polish in terms of the games UI design and how the game conveys important information, as well as a pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥decision to make everything including the launcher fully dependant on Expansive Worlds’ servers (which means that when there’s problems on their end you can’t play the game at all, not even singleplayer, and sometimes a host can lose connection to her or his own game). However, the main problem that I’ve chosen to write about in this review stems from how the ingame store operates.For all means and purposes, TheHunter is a stealth game where the primary goal is to kill animals. In a stealth game about killing things, what are some of the general design elements that are the most crucial to providing variety and thereby prolonged engagement, i.e. fun, to the experience? Well, having different environments to play in and having different ways to kill things.If you pay for membership, (or if you use in-game currency to buy permissions for hunting different animals) you’re provided with the rudimentary means to hunt all animals within all 10 different reserves, and the environments of the different reserves do impact the difficulty of the game and the way you have to play in order to hunt efficiently, so in that case the game fulfills the first of those requirements.There’s also a large variety of different weapons to use and different equipment to use, and they all impact the way you can hunt significantly. Some weapons are silent, some weapons are light, some weapons are powerful and heavy, and you can get hunting blinds, bait, camouflage clothing, dogs, bows, and all other sorts of cool stuff to hunt animals in different ways,-BUT ALL OF THAT COSTS MONEY.-Like most Free 2 Play multiplayer games with microtransactions, there’s two kinds of currency, gm$, earned by completing missions ingame, and em$, earned by paying for it with real money. What is different and ironically worse than the microtransactions of most other Free 2 Play multiplayer games is that the stuff which can actually be bought with gm$ is currently limited to only the absolutely most pitifully uninteresting consumables that the game has to offer;You cannot buy weapons with gm$. You cannot buy tents or hunting blinds with gm$. You cannot buy bait barrels, which are required to use bait, with gm$. You cannot buy dogs with gm$. You cannot buy clothing with gm$. You cannot buy scopes with gm$.Essentially, any digital items which are permanently added to your character, or which actually do something significant to the gameplay requires payments in addition to your membership subscription, which to me is much more significant assery than the notorious former Free 2 Play structure. The concept of having to buy ingame equipment in order to have fun in a game that you’re already supporting through periodical charges is ludicrous.TheHunters main equivalent of points in its semi-competitive community high-score system is HunterScore, which is rewarded for getting ingame milestone achievements, like “25 Mule Deer harvests” or “100 .243 bolt action rifle harvests”. There is a maximum limit to the HunterScore which can be achieved, but since getting there requires killing animals with all weapons in the game, including those which cost money, it effectively acts as a Pay 2 Win structure if you really want to spend the ridiculous amount of time it requires to actually compete with the top players.The problems of the cost structure are slightly alleviated by the retail packages, which in some areas are actually way cheaper and offer more value than just buying membership online. With my first retail package I felt that I was getting significantly more value for my money than the 14.99€ “Wayfarer” starter package I bought on Steam, and this led me to later buy a couple of other packages from a german website in order to get some more new equipment and some added membership time. This time it was far less of a satisfying purchase, though, partly because it was less cheap and partly because only the membership and the single “special edition” weapon I got from the packages was actually useful to me. Most equipment offered in the retail packages is the same as every other retail package, save for usually one “exclusive” premium item, usually a weapon.You can stack multiple pieces of the same equipment in TheHunter, but it seems like an oversight much more than anything else, because you can’t actually do anything with spare pieces of equipment. There’s no trading system, you can’t sell them for a bit of money, and there’s no point of having two of the same gun with you on a hunt since you’re limited to the same amount of ammunition as when you’re carrying one anyways. If anything they do make navigating your inventory more tedious, because you’ll eventually see, like, 6 .243 bolt action rifles and 6 12 gauge single shot shotguns because you’ve activated 5 different packages which all contained roughly the same guns and because there isn’t even any option to discard them. In fact, with one of the recent updates the 12 gauge single shot shotgun is now the only weapon in the store which costs 0 em$, so just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles I bought 100 and now my ingame inventory is cluttered with them.Anyways, now that I got the retail packages from Germany and activated them, I haven’t really ended up feeling like I made a good purchase. Instead, I really feel like a gullible idiot, and probably rightfully so. It’s mostly this feeling which is the reason as to why I’m writing this review in the first place. The weapons in TheHunter are only digital trinkets after all, and I don’t think it’s right to spend money on digital trinkets like this in the first place. I don’t understand the need for it either, if it was possible to at least also buy weapons for gm$ in addition to em$, it would provide a major incentive for players to keep playing the game, and since membership requires a subscription already, then what’s the problem?Shouldn’t the membership subscriptions be paying for the maintenance and content updates of the game so that these seemingly kind of greedy and seemingly unnecessary micro transactions wouldn’t be needed? What’s the point of having two separate payment systems operating in the same game?I like the game, but looking at the store really just makes me annoyed. After the tremendous amount of negative reviews following the former Free 2 Play model, though, they did revise it in the end. Maybe one of the next priorities could be revising the payment system?

												Ok we'll try keep this short and simple. Yes this game CAN cost a lot of money (I've put in around $500 USD just because I enjoy it and my financial status allows me to) to play but there are lots of things you can do for 100% free. First off do the missions they give you gm$ which can in turn be used to buy ammo, camping supplies, licenses, and a lot of other stuff.    After you get enough gm$ buy a license for a different animal which you can then activate the missions which require you to kill said animal (if you don't have the weapon needed for the mission just ask players that do have that gun many will be glad to help you.) Oh and some missions can be done by just tracking or spotting an animal so theres some gm$ you can get and not have to buy a license. I would buy the Trailrunner membership it gives you tons of things like weapons, camoflauge, scopes, calls, stands, tents, camping supplies, etc. Along with a memebrship to hunt all animals ingame for one year. The cost for the trailrunner is $49.99 USD which equates to 7 cents a day (rounded) It costs more to live per day than it does to play an awesome game!    Oh and after your year is up if you decide to keep on playing, the basic one year memebrship costs $34.99 USD and you still get to hunt all the animals and you get 3 of the deployable hunting stands. Another thing is that 90% of the negative reviews never put at least 50 hours in the game they play for 10 minutes then cry because the game isn't free to play. Another thing you can do to earn em$ is the ""earn em$"" option where you watch videos, read articles, download stuff (I do not recommend you download stuff unless you're a betting man) I have some friends which only play by this method and are quite effective at it.    Oh and for the waterfowl it does cost a lot and i do not recommend it I only hunt them a couple times a year so save your money and look for someone who already has a setup. This game is also very realistic there are more animals than in real life but the developers needed to make this game a bit more fun, which they did perfectly. This is why I recommend this game, if you need help with anything ingame add me on theHunter at Charlielolyoloswag I've been playing for a bit over a year.  Also the devs recently did a lot for their Free to play memebers they gave them 5 new species to hunt 2 of which switch every week, and they gave us all the Single Shot shotgun with free ammo for it. So much for making this short and simple haha :)			"

												The game is beautiful and the animals are pretty realistic, the immersion is great. However the economics of the game are fundamentally broken. In order to hunt and enjoy you need to spend a lot of money, real money. Before anyone jumps to conclusions I should make it clear that i have already spent 57 EUROS (more then 60$)  on this game. Because it wouldn't allow me to hunt anything I've purchased a 50 euro annual membership, i chose that one because it also gave me alot of ingame items and I'm comfortable spending that amount on a game. OK. I got some things like weapons, clothing, a tent, a caller or something. After I have spent some time in the game I realized that even that won't be enough. I spent another 7 EUROS for a crossbow and some callers/lures. Now I'm at the point where i realize that even though i have spent this amount of money I won't be able to enjoy all the features of the game without spending further money. But you see I am not comfortable spending any more money on this game and if any of the developers are reading the review, i will tell you this: I WON'T SPEND ANY FURTHER MONEY ON YOUR GAME. EVER. In fact i won't even play because i just can't enjoy a game that has no progression, a game that i know that no matter what i do ingame i will never be able to unlock items without paying for them. And playing without those items is possible but is artificially made harder in order to trick you into buying them.As someone said in another review theHunter is the perfect example of what is wrong with today's gaming. Some people believe that everyone is a millionaire and can afford to spend 500 EUROS on a game. I repeat i am perfectly fine spending 50 EUROS on a game (buying it outright) but I won't be someone's milk machine.			"

												This is a somewhat lengthy review, so if you're looking for a simple answer, this game may not be for you, or you may want to look at other reviews. Let's be super clear about what this game is, and what it isn't:What it is:1) The most realistic hunting experience to date (IMO).2) Offers a plethora of options, weapons, locales, and equipment.3) Beautiful, even by today's standards. It's starting to show it's age, but still has wonderfully beautiful moments.4) Content is updated weekly, with new equipment, animals, new locations, etc., added regularly as well.5) Enjoyable, with patience. The game mostly calms me.6) Offers a fun multiplayer experience, including competitions and cooperative play.7) A free game, that allows you to hunt some species, and are given a few weapons to help you get along. There are weekly rotations on animals that non-members can hunt.8) A membership service for a larger experience.9) The free version is essentially a demo.What it isn't:1) A game that allows you to hunt everything, with all the equipment, etc., without spending money.2) A pay to win game. Winning is only in the eye of the beholder. You're generally only competing with yourself.3) A game with a low learning curve.4) Perfect.I've put over 500 hours into this game, and likely a few more hundred if you include my time spent in the game prior to transferring it to Steam. I feel as though I might have a complete view of this game, flaws and all. This game certainly has it's flaws, some of which stem from it using an older gaming engine, some of which stem from a team switch (probably some legacy code), and some of which stems from a misunderstanding of the payment model. Simply put, when you get this game for free, you're given a limited amount of items and weapons, and can only hunt a limited amount of species. To some, this may seem like a pay to win game, but there is no ""end-game,"" and ""winning"" is subjective at best. About being a new player, this game requires an investement of time. First, you have to learn what the game is trying to teach you (there's plenty of tutorials, videos, etc., available to help you understand some of this). The developers sometimes keep rather quiet about certain aspects of the game, such as where animals spawn, etc., but this is purposely done to keep you guessing, and never 100% sure about the mechanics of the game. This keeps the game lively, and allows you to learn from others. Many of my conversations with other players center around the best spots for hunting, and other unknowns, with a large amount of incorrect information. I don't mind this, because as I said, it keeps the game interesting, and even after this many hours, I'm still learning.Seeing the game advertised as free, then realizing you can't hunt everything in the game can put a lot of people off. I place blame on the way the game is marketed, but if you enjoy hunting game experiences, don't let this put you off. You do NOT need a membership to enjoy the game, although you're going to be limited to a few species, and two species that are rotated weekly. You get free ammo for the weapons you get as a non-member. You can hunt on any reserve, but are limited in the species you can legally hunt. In order to unlock the game fully, you must get yourself a membership. Alternatively, you can purchase licenses as a non-member to hunt specific species. If you purchase a firearm, you will have to purchase ammo for it. As I said, this can be daunting, and put new players off. Let's talk about memberships. A basic membership allows you to hunt all species, on all reserves, for a period of time. This will also allow you to get free replenishment on ammo for all weapons you own. Some memberships last for up to a year, which means if you pay into this game, you'll eventually be paying to upkeep your membership (I pay about $30 a year my membership). Some memberships come with equipment, which help you get started, and are cheaper than trying to buy the equipment indivudually. Once you have purchased equipment (via membership or otherwise), you always keep it. Some of the equipment is centered on equipment bundles for species, such as ducks, etc. It's up to the user to decide which membership they want. Let's talk about equipment. As a new member, you're given some basics, which is helpful for most deer species. You're give a rifle and a shotgun, which allows you to hunt anything in rotation or that comes with a non-member. Should you upgrade, the weapons you have allow you to hunt everything except one or two animals species. Everything else in this game is entirely optional. Many of the firearms are redundant (same weapon, different or unique skins). Some weapons are better for certain types of species, such as the .22 (useful for rabbits, geese, etc.), while others such as the .370 are excellent for very large game. There are decoys, dogs, blinds, stands, and all sorts of items that can be optionally used in your hunts. Some of this equipment makes it easier to hunt a particular species, such as a duck caller, and a blind, but they are not essential to getting them. These items cost money. Again, this can be daunting for new players, because there are so many species, and so many items. Certain memberships provide you with everything you need to hunt the vast majority of species with ease. If you were, however, to buy everything in the game, especially if it's not on sale or in a bundle, you're going to drop a huge amount of money (perhaps upwards of a thousand U.S. dollars or more).Buying items should only be done in the long term, when you realize your issues in hunting specific species. It requires you to invest some time, and to educate yourself so you get the best bang for your buck. It's part of the reason why this game has a high learning curve. In this way it mimics real life to some extent. You wouldn't use a bleat deer caller, for example, to call a moose. Throwing money at the issue won't assist you in becoming a better hunter, but time and patience will. Spend your money wisely, if you choose to spend money.When I first purchased a membership with this game, it was prior to Steam, but there was only one map, and a limited number of weapons. For me, over the years, I have been able to attain everything simply because it's within my gaming budget. I spend less on this game than what I would spend on buying other games during a month, and it keeps me coming back because of the high diversity, skill, and serenity the game provides. If you're someone going after achievements, you may be frustrated, and I would say this game isn't for you. As I said, this is about the long term. If, however, you have a lot of patience, and are looking for a deep hunting game experience, I highly recommend this game. There is just simply nothing else out there that can do what this game does.			"

												Looking a gift horse in the mouth is your passion? Welcome to the review section of theHunter:""home of the reviewing cheeky brats""I´ve just browsed those negative reviews and looked for some criticism beyond the popular ""mememeeep, but it´s labeled free and there´s stuff I´d have to pay for"". The devs gave a lot more content to those free-players in the last weeks (at least 5 free species with a weekly rotation, enough weapons to hunt everything, special competitions for non-members) and all new reviews still concentrate on ""not free to play""!It´s remarkable that giving the basic access to a game away for free is leading to bad reviews. Most reviewers got less than 50 hrs ig and are just annoyed that they aren´t gifted the complete package. We are talking about steam users. The concept to pay for games isn´t exactely unknown on steam. Take Fallout 4: just to try the game you have to pay 50 bucks and if you don´t like it it´s a case of tough luck. It started in November 15 and until now there´s DLC for another 70 bucks to be bought. To enjoy the whole game you´ve got to empty your wallet regularly. Any complaints about that rip-off in the review section? No, since you´d have to admit that you´ve paid 50 bucks just to witness that you´re excluded from large parts of the game until you pay 70 more bucks.10 days ago the devs of theHunter released a patch that solved a lot of problems. Since then the game´s been running stable (even with 4k settings). They add plenty of content on a regular basis and since the free animals are changed weekly, even the for-free-players can enjoy that content. All that AND being the best hunting simulator on the market is obviously not enough to get comprehensible reviews on steam. I´ll suggest that they should take 50 bucks for the package that´s free at the moment in order to get great reviews from satisfied consumers!			"

												The actual game isn't bad. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is good, but a little slow, and there are a lot of animals to hunt. The biggest problem is that the game has been developed as though it's an ipod app. Even though the game is free, to be able to do anything other than shoot deer with the most basic gun. you have to be investing about £5 per month into the game. This is annoying as it could be a good game, if they made more of the content useable for the people that just want the game for free and not have to invest more money into it.			"

												If you are looking for a ''real'' hunting experience, this is probably the best game out there, without a doubt. This is not like Cabela's hunting games, where you massacre animals with assault rifles and machine guns, this is a realistic hunting experience. This game actually offers a real hunting experience, where you have to track down animals, and when you get your first kill or track down an animal that you have been searching for in hours, you actually feel like you have achieved something.Sadly, this game, in my opinion, fails at its F2P model. If you actually want to hunt all sorts of animals you will have to invest some money into the game, otherwise, There is only one type of animal that you can hunt. It feels more like a demo than a free to play title, this is sadly what scares a lot of people away. But if you can cope with the F2P model, and are willing to invest money into the game, this game is amazing.			"

												This is hands down the most realistic hunting simulator available today. It's not easy and it's not cheap. But nothing even comes close in the hunting game genre. Yeah, it gets negative reviews from people who either have no clue about hunting or can’t afford the game. But it's an awesome game if you like to hunt or think that you’d like to hunt. The landscapes are immense, detailed, and very realistic. Each of the many maps is a work of art. The sounds are realistic and captivating. I wish it weren’t so expensive to play and maintain membership.  But, once you have all of your favorite gear, the membership fee really isn’t too bad considering what I’ve already said ^^.  If there were something better for less I'd definitely be interested. But I've looked and there isn't. So until then this is my hunting game of choice. It's free to try so why not try it and see what makes this the best hunting simulator available today.			"

												Don't waste your time, although there is no charge for playing, the amount of gameplay you get (even after buying a subscription package) is minimal. There are very strict (and never explained) regulations on what you can shoot with what type of bullet (to be bought for extra currency you need to buy, or earned via a method that is never explained). If you're looking for an enjoyable experience, drop some money on a proper hunting game, unless you like getting messages from 'Doc' about the long list of ammo you're allowed to kill things with.

												I love playing this game. I don't love having to open my wallet for every single piece of content that the game contains. You have to buy the weapons, the ammo, anything else you can think of, and you have to buy eM in groups of 500, which is the worst way of doing it for everybody but the developers. I'm all for paying for certain content, think Rise of Flight or Iracing, but this is way worse then any of those. Buying a car or something that took ALOT of time to create is one thing, but having to pay for something that really should just be a part of the stock game... It's a cash grab, and its a sin because its ruined what could be a very fun game.			"

												I had heard that the game was a poor excuse for a free-to-play, but I still decided to give it a try.  And, in my honest opinion, it is a really cool game.  The visuals, sounds, and atmosphere are great, it's a game that's relaxing to play, and it's cool to simply explore the areas.  But I cannot recommend it to anyone and have decided to stop playing myself because it really is the most incredibly money-grabbing game I have personally ever seen, especially for one that claims to be free-to-play.  You can't hunt almost any animals without spending money or earning a lot of the in-game currency, you can't get new weapons without spending money, you can't get get ammo without spending money or earning a large amount of the in-game currency, and you can't get almost any (if any) other equipment without spending real money.  And missions, what seem to be the main way of earning in-game currency, are incredibly limited in what you can actually do without spending money on the game.  It even claims to be multiplayer, but you can't host that to do with friends without spending money on the game either.  I wasn't even able to participate in their Halloween event without buying some form of weapon and/or ammo.  If the developers decide they actually care about their players instead of milking as much money as possible I'd gladly come back to the game, but not until then.			"

												Not a very good F2P game. You can only hunt Mule Deer and Rabbit without buying a monthly subscription or paying real money for licenses. Although multiplayer is available and is a great option for friends, it is still a hunting game geared towards single player. Why this is a subscription-based game is complete non-sense. I've played everything from the Deer Hunter series to Cabela, Trophy Hunter, etc, all of which were great hunting games that you purchased once. To try to justify server costs would just ridiculous. They are using the wrong sales platform for this game.			"

												Love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. I would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. It is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. With that being said, I'll continue with why I love the game.It is an EXCELLENT pay to play game and literally the only online game I have subscribed to aside from World Of Warcraft when I was younger. Me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing Elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. This helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. This get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. I've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.I also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency ""em$"". Aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. You can also earn ""em$"" by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an E-mail. I've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although I have spent real money on the game, if I really wanted to, I could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment I wanted.Finally I'll talk about the dev team. With regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. New areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.Many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and I can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games I've ever played and although I hope they change their pricing model some day, I'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.Edit: Also I should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). The first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. If you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (Gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. Since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. Keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. Also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours I have in the game so I'll explain why I have so many. If you leave the initial ""thehunter"" browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. I leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so I can get the latest news they have updated the game with. So if you think it's sketchy that I have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because I leave the main browser open.			"

												Ok then - theHunter. It's rivalling in terms of hours played my other big favourite of the moment, DayZ, and I'd like to tell you why.Firstly I am a real life hunter and shooter, but living in the UK access to real weapons and hunting isn't always easy. So when I saw this game for free, I thought it's worth giving a go. I haven't seen another game in this niche for 10 years, so I was keen to see what it offers.I'm going to deal with the free to play issue. This game can be played for free. You can access all areas of the reserves straight away, and beautiful they are. Yes you are given two weapons for ffree - a scoped .243 and a 12 bore shotgun, but these two weapons are good for all but one species on the many reserves you can hunt on, and have limitless ammo. In terms of what you can hunt, you are restricted to one species of deer to start with but can also hunt three variants of rabbits plus pheasants for free. Additionally you will get two extra species free to hunt every week on a rotating basisYes there is downloadable content to buy - if you want to - but it's not at all necessary for the enjoyment of the game. I compare it to a well known MMO tank game; you can do it all for free if you want and earn your way to stuff in game play or you can add real money and do it quicker and funner. TheHunter's the same - it gives you the option to use real money if you really want to.Pricing if you want to use real cash? Well it's minimal. Yes there is the option to buy a membership which for me is 8 English pence a day giving me licenses for all animals on the reserves plus free reloads of ammo. In terms of £ spent to hours played, as I have bought some extras, I'm on about £40 for over 200 hours, and I can see the hours going up and the £ spent staying at about £40. Considering I was charged £1 to aprk for 30 minutes today in town, I don't find this bad value for money at all.Game play and graphics are ok - I do find it very immersive with TrackIR and Dolby 7.1 headphones. 60fps at highest graphic settings doesn't strain my middle of the road desk top PC.What makes this game a challenge is that stalking and fieldcraft are probably more important than the shooting element. This is not some sort of immersive shooting gallery. Game can be elusive, wary, spookable, and even dangerous. If all you require is a game to blast holes in things try Sniper Elite.The only downside for me is that the designers have had to make some gameplay approximations and simplifications which make the game less realistic, and less of a challenge. The most notable one for me is that the rifle trajectories are effectively flat, and range finding isn't really part of the game as your encounter ranges tend to be well under 50 metres. There's no wind effect on the shot either, so real life skills of range finding, usind hold over for range, and allowing for the wind don't appear here which is a shame.Game play summary: you will spend a lot of time walking slowly from cover to cover straining your ears and eyes for the signs of animals which you can then track and if you get it right you will eventually see them and get in a position to shoot. A critic called it a walking simulator - sounds like he was a poor hunter as stealth is the key.So thinking of trying it? Well all you have to lose is the download time to your disc. If you like the first couple of hours you'll probably decide to splash a little cash for a basic membership to give you quicker access to hunting species other than the free mule deer.I've seen a review below where someone makes out that if you want to play the game you need to buy this and buy that and the sums run into large amounts of $. It's not so. You do not need to buy every bit of kit in the game - one shotgun with its birdshot, buckshot and solid slug will let you take on every single species on the map.So that's it for me. It is a good hunting simulator. There is Gucci gear available for real £ but you can do a lot with a very little £. You can do massive amounts with no £ at all as long as you accept: a) you need to work your way up the game to earn in game currency b) you need to use the right skills to do this - play like a CoD buffoon and you'll never succeed c) that people with real £ can buy goodies if they want to without stopping the game being free to play d) that there is no 'win' in this game other than the satisfaction you get from hunting with skill			"

												I tried it, having not listened to the other reviews, and I am sorry to say that this game is NOT worth it.For starters, there's no Tutorial. The game tosses you in without any little hints and stuff.Second, You can't hunt anything unless you have a permit for it or the game's membership.There's also the fact that the running and several of the controls are just completely whack.Oh, and did I mention that your character holds the ""sniper rifle"" butt against the middle of their chest and hold the stock like some wand? Because the stock CLEARLY DOESN'T go against your shoulder.Next, the graphics are Playstation 2 style. They're outdated and poorly done. I know, graphics don't make up a game, but it's still a factor.The controls are slow and it's basically very amateur and a sad attempt.			"

												After the apocalypse, Steve and his family moved to the coast of Norway. All was good and well until the family ran out of food supplies. Steve, who had worked in an office before the apocalypse, didn't really know how to use a gun, and had never killed an animal. But his family was starving, so he decided to give it a shot. Steve found an old rifle and som bullets in the cabin where they were living, and set out to find some food.He hadn't been searching for long, when suddenly a wild boar appeared. Steve laid down, pointed the hole-y end towards the animal, and pulled the trigger.  Nothing happened.  He was shocked at first, but later realised that the gun didn't want to cooperate beacuse he DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING. Dissappointed, Steve set out to find some other animal. After a while a Peasant appeared.  Steve pointed the gun towards it, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened again. HE DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL PEASANTS. No matter how he tried, Steve couldn't find an animal that he owned the license to kil..  After a couple of days he was awfully thirsty, hungry and stressed out. That gun started to look very very compelling.He pointed it towards his head, pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. HE DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL HIMSELF. Instead he decided to jump of a cliff, and shortly after that his family starved to death. THE END.Seriously though, are there any animals that you're actually allowed to kill in this game? Havent found any yet, and it's annoying me to death :P			"

												PRELUDE: If you're mature and appreciate high quality games continue reading. The rating on the review is because of immature idiots who want everything for free - got nothing to do with the game. If you're a spoiled immature brat wanting more handouts to go with your welfare cheque, mark it down and ♥♥♥♥ off. Don't bother with entitlement whining in the comments, I'll just kill it...oo00oo..Now, the game.- GRAPHICS -This is gorgeous. A 6.00am start at Redfeather had me mesmerised. There are some placing issues, grass and trees above ground etc. but it's really only aesthetics and does little to detract gameplay. With my trusty 670gtx/i7/8Gb rig this game shines with only minor fan speedup when scene changing. A steady 60fps with only minor tearing (I haven't bothered changing the default yet so could probably be sorted easily enough).Very easy to look at and the animalation (now there's a word) is very attractive. Slightly robotic at times but hey, if we had 500,000 vectors to plot per animal we couldn't play without a Cray.- SOUND -There could be a little more control over some of the ambients, eg: ocean waves, as sound is a critcal and tactile sense in this game and some of it gets over the top. Rain, wind etc. is good and animal calls, while lacking in some bearing seperation, is true to form.And the guns? Wow. Crank it people. It might take 2 hours of tracking before you fire but I get great delight hearing the .308 reverb off the valley walls. My kids, avid fans all, bounce off their chair! The bang-ratchet-bang of the pump action while pheasant shooting is as sweet as.(Err.... an 11.00pm .308 shot scored me some wife-wrath so headphones people!)- GAMEPLAY -If holding shift + W is your only way to get somewhere this is NOT your thing. If the destination is more important than the journey or you're expecting a gluttony of ""shootables"", DO NOT BUY.This requires patience and lots of it, much of it is tedium. This is hunting. You are a hunter. Stealth. Cover. Shadows. Crouching. Camoflauge. Downwind. ALL of this comes into play.  I've even suggested on the forums that you need to move like YOU are the hunted for best results. Animals, particularly those munched on by predators have an uncanny sense of smell and hearing. And it IS fascinating to watch animals through a scope pausing, sniffing and treading lightly. ""Wary skittishness"" has been modelled beautifully and really adds to the sense of the hunters plight... Let's face it, we're blundering lunkheads in natures true arena and you'll pay the price for it.-Shooting. In RL, I have probably loosed close to 10,000 rounds. Mostly night shooting for foxes and roos. As a staunch user of the .243 in that era I took great delight in how well this acts, sounds and plays like a .243 ingame. I can ""feel"" the shoulder kick and smell the powder. (I know, it's psychosomatic but you get what I'm saying....)Scope tracking is well mimiced and looking downrange for a headshot @ 150m is frustratingly difficult. Zoom capabilities are also true-to-form in that higher zoom will produce greater scope movement. Nice work in this department. Note that there are many scopes, sizes and types, many aimed (yck yck) at quality shooting and range judgement.- The shotty is divine albeit a rather blunt instrument. - The .30 is popular and goes off like a firecracker on steroids.- The Anshutz .308 -a spend money on it- gun has just entered my inventory and is a darling to use. I linked it up with a 9x50 and I'm REALLY loving this outfit.I've made mention on the forums that I'm concerned that there is no score rewards based on target range despite the obvious (monetary) push to high-quality equipment. In my view this is wrong, both ingame and economically. My weapons and equipment need to be valuable to me but there is no reason to use anything other than a 12 gauge with the right ammo for the kill. Why charge up to $15 RL money for a gun and scope that counts towards.... nothing?-Animal TrackingI like the way this has been done. It's very difficult to mimic the senses from a 3D enviroment in a 2D rectangle and yet this gives a sense of tracking success with target sighting as the eventual reward. The kill itself does become secondary on the harder to track species and I've once or twice found myself shooting only a photo and simply walking away. Seriously.-CompetitionsGood fun and ultimately (at least for me) is the reason I play. Nope, I haven't won any as I write but I've got close. The planning and dedication required to win a trophy is high level stuff and really needs to be worked at. I'm loving them. Soon.......- GENERAL -In the interests of brevity I'm going to mention the words achievements (LOTS of them), missions, multiplayer, XP building all in the one sentence. The reasons will be quite obvious. You gotta pay to play, not a real lot, and it's worth every cent.- UI - In a sentence on the launcher windows. Messy. Clunky. Confusing. EW. Get someone on this. Rule of thumb, evaluate your UI on your grandmothers. If they're confused it's bad OK?  Even ingame I find some ""habit formed clicking"" breaks on some changes to equipment. ..oo00oo..- SUMMARY -CONSTedious at times with all that walking.Could ultimately cost quite a bit.UI.Scoring is errr.... pointless. (pun intended)As an Aussie, I find it filled with Americanised hunting claptrap and hyperbole. Less Greenpeace and more hunting is needed, it's a GAME :)PROSAwesome sound/graphics on good/high-end systems.Great immersion and true-to-life animals and in particular their behaviour.Good choice of weaponry and associated peripheral match-ups.Provides a very real sense of hunting.If you're an RL hunter but can't get out enough. GET THIS. No question.9/10 (amended score and review*)gg*Amended review to reflect continued use. 1000+ hours now and still immersed. Heavily. :)			"

												Take a tideous walk through nature. Encounter tons of animals you can't hunt. Find trails that lead off into the boundaries of the play-field. Pay for features not in the free version that might help you bag something. If you're looking for a reaslistic hunting game, this isn't it. It fails to capture the fun and enjoyment of hunting in the woods.  "

												Okay, where do I start with this?? I am going to start out saying that this will be my first lengthy review about any game in my Library. Why?? Because I feel like this game is NOT getting fair feedback looking at the overall reviews. Even when you read the Posotive Reviews of this game, NO ONE sheds light into what this game is AND why they rated it a Positive. And I hope that this review will ease your mind into actually giving this game a try, and finding out for yourself that the reviews either consist of .....1. People who does not have a job as of yet, want to play the best hunting game around, but can not afford this.2. Trolls just hating on the game because of the Free to Play aspect of this game and NOT the overall game itself3. People that has a COMPLETE wrong mindset of the Pay to Play factor and NEVER even tried to pay to play the gameand that I will go into bigger detail about those factors and why the review score is Mostly Negative because of those 3 points. In the process, I will also clarify a few things for anyone reading this review, and I hope you stick around to read it all. I promise it will be worth while, and that it will change your mind towards things to actually give this game a shot. Because, I was just like you (The Reader) at the start of it all, and also just like you (The Reader) my reaction to this game, the reviews and the Pay to Play factor just drove me away from this game COMPLETELY. When in the end, all that was needed to enjoy this game to full, was $49.99. How is that for Pay to Play??Okay, now for the actuall review.I will go as far as to say that this is the best hunting sim I have ever played, even though I was sceptical at the start because of the whole Pay to Play aspect of the game. At the time I HATED this game because it was Free to Play, but I cant even shoot anything in the game, because everytime I want to shoot, it tells me I need a license for this and license for that. I just got mad, and at the moment I felt like this game is the biggest pile of crap I have EVER played. Who even plays a crap game like this AND pours money into it?? What is this, another World of Warcraft??Till one day, I just felt like wasting money, and decided to waste money onto this game, because why not?? I went to the store page of this game's Launcher, and I went to purchase a Membership. Looking at the options I had, I decided to go with the Trailrunner Subscription ($49.99), which gives me a 12 month (Year) Membership to shoot what I want, where I want AND to ease me into the game, I got 9 extra Weapons to start off my game AND 35 other items to accompany me. Ranging from scopes for my 9 Weapons, Cammo, Lures, Backpack and much more usefull items. Eager to start out the game AND still keeping in mind that there is still MUCH MORE to purchase in the game store than what I got with my Subscription, I started a new game, and made due with what I had for the time being. The game started up and the hunt was on. With my lure at hand and my trusty .300 (Gotten from Trailrunner Subscription) I was determine to shoot some Deer.I set out with my trusty HunterMate, and I started learning the game and what goes for what. My first encounter was a Turkey. I went to the location of the Turkey call, and saw the tracks. My HunterMate told me in which direction the Turkey has fled, and I just follow along the path. The path led me through the Forest and Swampland areas, and I was soon greated with a Deer Grunt Call in the distance. It was at that moment I paused in my tracks. I took a crouching position, I got my Lure ready, and I called the Deer in. Sitting in the bush, looking left and right past the trees, through the bushes I am trying to find the Deer AND be as quite and low profile as I can get .... at the same time worrying about a stupid Turkey ....I saw the Deer peeking he's head over the scrubs infront of me, I bring up my .300 to scope .... I line up my shot and I just let it go. The Deer fell on the spot and I jumped with joy. I went to collect the Deer and I was happy with what I got. I went back to the tracks of the Turkey, and continued my journey.Its been a year later, and what was once a piece of crap game to waste money on, is now the best game I ever wasted money on. Funny how that works right?? Its also been a year later, and I only spend $49.99 on this game since then. Yes, you read that right. After one whole year, the Trailrunner Subscription for $49.99 was AND is all you need to enjoy this game to the fullest. I now renewed my Subscription for another year which is now $34.99. I used the other $15 and I bought myself more Lures to use on for the other animals, and I still only use my weapons and equipment I got from my Trailrunner pack. NEVER bought anything extra than what I got for spending $49.99 on this game.If you have sticked with me up until now in my review, I am sure you are now more convinced to actually try this game out INSTEAD of just looking at the Pay to Play factor and relying on the Review System of Steam.In general, all you EVER need to play this game is the Trailrunner Subscription. NOTHING more and NOTHING less. The other items you can purchase is just for better convinience and a better overall gameplay to make your life easier. In truth, the Weapons and Items you get in the Trailrunner Subsciption is MORE than enough to play this game to fullest of experience.Pros.1. Great Gameplay2. Great Hunting Sim3. A lot of Game Reserves to choose from4. Each Game Reserve has its own Game and Hunting tactics to adapt5. Overall very good hunting experience6. New Game Reserves was added (with Game) and is still being added (with Game)7. The game offers a level up system for each Weapon and Animal the more you use your Weapon and Track an Animal8. The game offers multiplayer where you can hunt with your friendsCons.1. Game engine is a bit out dated2. Devs does not seem to listen to its already small community to improve on overall user experience3. The controlls are kind of clunky and stiff, but you get use to itPutting it all together to sum it up. Purchase the Trailrunner Subscription ($49.99) and try this game out for yourself. Do NOT purchase the other subscriptions as you will not enjoy the game to the fullest, and they dont offer you as much gain as the Trailrunner Subscription does. Thats all you will EVER spend on this game in your life, and as you play the game, you will soon relise that you gave the game a unnecessary hard time BECAUSE of the overall Steam Review AND the fact that it is Pay to Play.Thank you for sticking with me the whole time through my review, if I helped you out, dont forget to click ""YES"" on ""Was this review helpfull"". And put your own positive review on this page.			"

												The title ""free to play"" gets abused allot lately.theHunter is a good example of this. Once playing theHunter you will realize you are not playing a F2P game, but you are playing a demo. Yes you get to play with a starter gun, get unlimited basic ammo and you can shoot mule deer but that does  only scatch the surface of what game is available. That content you will see prancing around you as you are powerless to engage these creatures.Mechanics in the game like ethic hunting (not shooting a bunny with a 50. cal) are warped or solely exist to force the player into a pay to play model.Multiplay hosting is tied into a member subscription. Making you reliant on the scarce and mostly unstable starter area servers. The MP client is tied into a peer 2 peer model reminiscent of oldentimes or grand strategy or RTS games, halting everybodys client if one player is having a connection issue. The server browser is pulls uncomplete list and is severly lacking in search options.Trying to earn EM (Currency) points through the games disgusting partner ""task sites"" full of adware and survey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is not a good idea. 3/4 of the time they site will not pay out its ems like promised. but it can be fun trying to get some point with fake personal information like some sick game of minesweeper.The only good thing about this game has to be the trill of the hunt and your success in the field after considerable effort.4/10 ♥♥♥♥♥ adicting yo, and they want all your monies.

												Graphics, animals and surroundings are beautiful, but this game is not really free to play.  Here is how my game experience went. Started my hunter's day at 06:00 and began walking, 30 minutes later I track a pheasant, but I have no license to hunt it.  35 minutes in I track White Tail deer, no license, poop.  50 minutes of walking I track coyote, no license, oh come on!  Then after an hour of walking I track a Mule deer, got a 12 point buck in my sights and one shot one kill later I could not find any more Mule deer to track or hunt, just animals I do not have licenses for since I do not have a membership to unlock them, so I uninstalled.  This game is a nice hunting simulator, but falls short when it comes to f2p variety of huntable animals.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this since this the first actual hunting game that I have played that had fantastic graphics and well mechanics and variety of great looking maps. But on the down side its a free to play that should be more ""Pay some you can actually hunt something good instead of♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. You can only hunt two animals which are the Mule Deer and Rabbit, when trying to shoot anything else you will no be able to till you buy a basic account which is about $5 USD. Sure its not much, but for a hunting game its got to be really ♥♥♥♥ing good for me to lay down $5 every month. Same thing goes with weapons, you get one RIfle and if you want anything else it also cost $$$. Really wanted to like this, but wish it was a one time purchase for the whole game, and if I wanted other stuff such as guns or something I wouldn't mind laying down the cash but the way it is right now its not great.

												DO NOT BELIEVE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS...THIS IS A GREAT HUNTING GAME!Q. Is it TOTALLY FREE to Play?A. Yes & No. This game has enough to play for free if, (A) you are just a casual hunter playing now and again,    (B) you don't mind only hunting 5 types of anaimals (Whitetail Deer, Cottontail & European Rabbits, Snowshoe Hare, Pheasant),    (C) you play to earn gm$ (in game money) by doing missions, then spend that on other game licenses.Q. Do I HAVE TO SPEND A LOT of Real Money to play?A. No not at all. If you want to hunt all the animals you can get a subscription that only cost $3.33 a month (less if you get a longer sub)   If you want to own a lot of weapons, clothing, hunting dog, etc. to customise your character you'll have to spend some real money to get em$ (the in game money that you buy with real money) but how much is up to you.   *If you buy one of the ""DLC"" those are the subscriptions (3, 6 & 12 month) with bonus items, they cost slightly more then normal subscriptions, BUT you only by those once for the bonus items then resub at normal rate. The bonus items are worth the extra as it will save you money over buying them separately.As a FREE Player you can hunt the 5 animals I mentioned above, you can track and spot any animal in the game. You start with 2 free weapons (.243 Bolt Action Rifle and the Single Shot Shotgun).You can hunt on anywhere on the map (some areas will have nothing to shoot for free players).You can hunt with you friends in multiplayer...No You Can Not Shoot Your Friends No Matter How Much You Would Like To!Q. Can you walk for long periods of time and not spot anything? A. Yes, just like in real life you can hunt for long periods without spotting anything, you'll find lots of tracks to follow...   Also you will want to walk not run, this isn't CoD. Take your time walk crouched, listen for movement around you, just like you would have to do if you where really hunting.If you like hunting games give it a try...it's got a great community, nice graphics, good hunting and it's somewhat Free!

												edited august 2016after 2 years playing that game, i decided to turn my 1st positive review into a negative one. i'll try to explain why here. i used to play that game a lot but i discovered another nice game called Cabela big game hunting pro hunts 2014. i recommend Cabela BGH instead of TheHunter. here's why- TheHunter is not a game you own, it's a membership. You spend hundreds of euros in equipment, but the game doesn't belong to you. If you stop your membership, or the devs stop the game tomorrow, you loose everything. this is an unpleasant feeling-TheHunter is a game full of bugs. the devs release stuff every week so the bugs stack, and right now it has reached a point of you can't play a single session without facing a bug-TheHunter is an expensive game. the membership doesn't cost a lot itself, but the most simple rifle/equipment will cost you 5 euros. buy 5 rifles, 3 tripods, 3 treestands, 5 tents, and 3 bows, do a simple maths (5x5)+(3x5)+(3x5)+(5x5)+(3x5)=80+membership (40)=120 euros, and i didn't count clothes, dogs etc ..- if you hunted irl, animals calling system in TH may be very problematic. in TH animals call all the time. and they do it so you can hear them. been hunting years irl, and over that whole period i heard only a fox once at dusk- personnally i have a real luminosity problem here. the environments are dark. and you can't use sweetfx, because the publisher policy toward modding is 0 tolerance. i understand they don't want modding because of their commercial strategy. but they don't allow the use of reshade.me because they say it would be problematic for the competitions. yeah, that's true that hunting has always been a competition affair ...-Cabela will cost you 5-20 euros depending if you get it on a sale, but it's a one time purchase-in Cabela animals have better behaviors, they turn into your direction, and look at you when you approach. pigs eat etc-animals are beautiful in Cabela-bullet time is really fun, especially with the bowsTheHunter is free to play, you can hunt whitetail for free, and see by yourself. but before buying a pack have a  look at Cabela's pigs			"

												The game scenery is beautifuly made. Controls needs more improvements. The whole time that I played I only saw a few birds and thats it. No other animals was to be found. I went to different places on the map and no animals. I used the deer call and waited in tower stand and nothing. Then I walked around for awhile using the deer call and nothing. I've played other Deer Hunter games that is way better than this game. I'm glad it was free and I didn't pay for it.			"

Gets boring after hunting your first deer because thats the only type of animals you would be able to hunt with your ""freetoplay"" membership.No bears,coyotes,whitetail deer, or pheasants for you unless you wanna pay $15 every 3 months (doesn't include any weapons, still have to use the basic hunting rifle.)or download some really shady apps and software for miniscule amounts of in-game currency. Would of definitly paid for a full $60 dollar game. Hope to see a change in the future.			"

												This game has two sides. On the one side, there is a fantastic, nearly beatiful game with (old-fashioned, but) realistic graphics, a ton of environmental sounds and a really cool gameplay with all the hunter gadgets you need and maybe don't even know yet. Everyone should really try this game, it's worth a look, definitely.On the other side, it is a pay-to-play game and does not deserve the ""free to play"" in the title. It is not free to play, as you have to pay money for hunting licenses (you may hunt 2 different animals for free, all others do cost), you have to pay for an own spawn point, pay for most of the clothings, weapons and gadgets. You can't do the game missions for free, because soon they want you to hunt down animals you have to pay for.On every corner of the game they want you to pay something here, something there, or choose the monthly payed membership.Worst marketing model since 1998.So test the game, but don't put any money in it.

												Truelly terrible experience, the game seems really gripping though not only is the conectivety to any servers bad but they force you to renew a membership subscription when the game is advertised as being free. Poor form. Highly not recommended. "

												good gamebad microtransactionsto actually play it and to have the full expirience you have to constantly pay real money and that sucksif you dont want to constantly spend money you will be able to hunt only 3 species out of 32. the ♥♥♥♥ is this. you have to pay for weapons irl money and there is no option to earn these weapons just by playing the game.you can buy a premium, but its only for a limited amount of time. you cant just play a game and enjoy it.there is no ""ok, today ill play it for 24 hrs and then i can buy this rifle and hunt some wolves"". its only ""ok, today ill work a little more and i will be able to buy this rifle and some ammo and then i'll have to buy a license and then i maybe can hunt something""just no.the game is not that bad, its kinda good actually. i absolutely love the ai of the prey and the feeling of the hunt is so cool i cant even tell you how do you feel when you finally find the deer you've been tracking for the last two hours.the landscapes are beautifull, even though the graphics are not the best for todays standarts, the design still does the workand the map is SO BIG. if it weren't a hunting game it could be just a walking simulator where you just explore this beautifull gigantic map.you can just try it and see if you want to play a hunting sim at all.the game has potential, but the urge to get money from players just ruins it.

												This is NOT a F2P game.It's a disgrace that Steam allowed added this to the free section instead of calling it a demo.You can literally only hunt two animals on two maps in singleplayer.If you hunt any others, you are kicked.It requires a 3, 6, or 12 month membership to upgrade the game.This piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥should be removed from the Steam store ASAP.1/10 stars.

												It's a nice game if you want to waste your life : I walked for an hour long, in an ugly lang (nature sounds were good, that is the only nice thing I saw anyway), I met only 1 animal, but I didn't paid in real money to have the permission to kill it (that was a fluo bird by the way, the first flashy yellow partridge I've ever met in my life).If you don't have any aim in your life, play this ... uh ... ""pay to have the right to do something else than walking quite quickly (yes the character run like a paraplegic snail)"" thing.If you have something to do (eat cookies, watch all Dallas episodes, learn Kirghiz), run away and do it!

Posted: June 11, 2014
												Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing well today. So I gave this ""f2p"" a try and found it's simply ""f2t"" which means it isn't really free to play at all. It's free-2-try. The pricing is ridiculous. If I'm going to spend this kind of money, I'll be doing some real hunting. If you have tons of money and think you might give this a try anyway, I suppose it might be fun practice for some folks. Anyway, let me tell you how my hour in the game went, and you can judge for yourself if you want to try.I play on three monitor Nvidia Surround. Some games have built in limitations to make it fair, but I don't think that's the case with this game. The resolutions given in the options appear to support my setup, so I made the switch and bam! I get what looks like a normal widescreen view squashed flat and stretched across three monitors. Needless to say, I don't think the game looks very good that way. So I see a cabin and decide to walk up to it, but can't get up on the porch even though it looks like I should be able to step up. Maybe the front of the porch looks lower to me because of the stretching effect, so I walk around to the steps on the side and get up on the porch... only to find I can't open the door anyway--or at least I couldn't figure out how. So I look around and see a shooting range. I head over, pick a spot, lay down, and cannot clearly see all targets because they are obscured partly by the targets in front of them. I don't feel like creeping over to another spot because this one is clearly marked as viable and the movement mechanics are so slow and clunky, so I do some practice shooting with the one free weapon you start with by default. Wow! My persona must be a complete jitterbug because I can't seem to hold the weapon even moderately still. I open options and look for a key to let me either empy my lungs or hold my breath, find it, and... heh... not much help at all. After practice, I get up and just start wandering around the woods. I see a lot of bugs and a few birds. The sounds are great, and I think I might like this game for meditation if the view wasn't squashed flat and looking so completely odd. I do glimpse one deer off in the distance, but if I'm supposed to be able to track it I'll never know because I can't seem to find the spot where I spotted it. So I wander. And wander. I find a nice peaceful spot and sit down. And I wait. And I wait. And then I leave.If they fix the resolution, I might come back and try my luck again. If walking around and waiting seem like a good game to you, give it a try. I know this is supposed to be realistic hunting, and I'm okay with that. Really I am. But when the view is squashy, the shooting mechanics are clunky, and the movement is so darn slow and irritatingly stupid, it gets tedious to say the least. If I could at least enjoy the scenery, it might not have been such a terrible experience for me. As it is, I can't even do that. I read that if you keep practicing, your ability to hold the weapon still gets better, but I'm not sure the rest of my experience rates a keep-trying approach.No, I can't recommend this game. You might try it and like it, but for me, it just doesn't work. I'd rather be out in the real woods hunting real animals for practice. At least then, if I see a porch I want to hop up on, I can do that without having to creep slowly around to the steps on the side. Talk about silly.			"

												Where do I begin? If this game had a ""you buy it, you get everything, all guns/licenses/reserves/etc for a flat $50.00"" (which is a new release AAA price), I probably would've done it. But the nickle-and-diming ridiculousness of their membership plans is something I won't accept. Even most MMORPG's have a hard time maintaining a monthly subscription, yet theHunter thinks that people will keep doling out the money to retain to their guns/licenses/access to certain parts of the game.What if I don't want to play for the full 3 months? It makes the customer feel like they're flushing money down the drain. I'd rather hand over a big chunk up front, get my entire game, and be able to pick it up when I feel like it. Not, oh 5 months down the road I think about trying it again, and they want even more money.The real trick is that if they do sucker you into paying for a membership, at the end of that time, you suddenly realize... I'm going to lose all my access, but I've got all this progress I want to keep working on, I don't want to lose it and should pay more to keep going! That's how they'll hook you and keep the cash flowing in endlessly, as opposed to simply letting people buy the full game normally and be done with it.As to the actual gameplay... The animals are few and far between, and most of the time when you find a track, it's frequently not going to be the kind you're allowed to hunt. Which is pretty much only mule deer, and you have one gun. So every time annoying pheasants or whitetail deer pops up on the Huntermate tracking device, you get reminded to either fork over the money or you're blocked from certain content. It's irritating.The game world itself is gorgeous, and the tracking system is uniquely detailed -- but that's not nearly enough to make me overlook the above issues. I would be a customer, if it weren't for their greedy scheme.The other hysterical part is that they actually asked their fans to leave positive reviews, because they think all the bad reviews ""create a distorted picture of the community's feelings."" How about you stop trying to cover up people's genuine reactions to your greediness? The majority are voicing their complaints that this is a bad business model.			"

												If you like hunting mule deer, and only mule deer, then this is the game for you. The Pay-to-Play model strips this game of any real potentional. I wanted to hunt ducks more than deer, but that isnt an option unless you pay with real currency, to get a license and shotgun. It had so much potentional, but the F2P/P2P model ruined it. Would not recommend to anyone. Still waiting for a good hunting game to hit the market that isnt half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												if this was a $15-20 game for sale and thats it for full access to the game then id probably buy it for the hell of it atleast, but as it is its a ""free to play"" game with the sleazy mobile phone game recipe of locking up everything you want with a different currency wich is pretty much only obtainable with real money, and then it goes even sleazier by adding in a subscription as if it was a mmo, now i did try it out and with exception for the wonky feel in the movement controls like you see in most games that are hellbent on being as realistic as possible, and the crappy draw view distance on certain objects and foliage it runs fine. but in my personal opinion no matter how awesome this game might be with access to everything in it i dont think it even slightly makes up for the disguting business model they have adopted, i didnt bother checking the subscription prices but even $1 a month is more than id be comfortable paying without feeling so dirty id be crying in fetal position in the shower afterwards as a result.

												While I do enjoy the game, I really have to say only 1 thing about it. THE PAY WALL IS REAL.You can earn in game currency, however it only allows you to purchase licenses, lures and ammo. Every other item in the game is bought with real money, and even then the prices on these items is outlandish.Almost every gear item costs about $5.00 each, and you can't create multiplayer sessions without upgrading to the subscription account, so unless the pricing model is changed, I can't recommend the game to anyone.

I think the developers should have done was made  this a 15$ maybe 20$ game and no micro transactions it's very fun and could just be like similar games with a underlining currency such as kill such and such and it was big you could either keep it for yourself or sell it for a some credits that. I would very much enjoy that.Untill they do something similar to what i say dont get this game its a 4/10 in my opinon but if they were to get rid of the micro transactions then i think it could be a solid 7.5/10			"

If the tracking didn't take so long, I might enjoy that aspect more too. But for the most part, this game is really freemium and is only for the most patient. Play at your own risk.			"

												I'll make this quick,This game is a ton of fun espically if you're a hunter in real life, there's a lot of negative comments here too about how this game isn't free and it's posing as one (last I checked).  It is free indeed, you can hunt three or four animals as a guest and those animals are as followed.WhitetailCottontail rabbitPheasant.There's also special events that go on that allows you to hunt certain animals for a certain ammount of time for free, however. If you wish to invest in the game, it's actually a fair deal and they're not asking for a a lot either. 500 ems is worth 4.99 USD and 3 months of memberhip is around 10$ USD, there's obviously other options but those are the two cheapest and it's quite fair if you ask me.Overall, I really enjoy this game, it's a lot of fun getting to hunt the animals in the map locations, plus it's really good for time consumption as well. After all, I play this game when I do my homework while sitting in a tree stand or hunting tower lol.Either way to sum things up, don't judge this game by the negative reviews until you actually tried it yourself, you may or may not like it and this is as close as hunting I can get when the season for whitetail irl isn't opened.So overall, if you're a fellow real life hunter as myself here, you'll enjoy the game!

												OK...heres the real story. YES...you need a membership to hunt all animals, but you can try the game for free  and hunt muledeer, with a rifle they give you for free. If you like the game then fine, you can order a 3,6 or yearly memberships, and its fairely cheep. The bigger the memberhsip you order the more free stuff you get. I ordered a 6 month membership and got everything I think I'd need to play forever, in guns anyways. If you have to collect everythign ingame yes it gets expensive but why do it? A shotgun can hunt anything...ANYTHING IN GAME ...because it has 3 kinds of ammo.there are fancy guns with ingraving for people who need those, but never for free..doh....and several types of bows and arrows and sights scopes, etc and on and on...but you don't need all that. For less than the cost of lottery tickets you can play all year long, and hunt every animal you ever wanted in  great detailed forests and on cold snowly mountains. No...its not all free, but trying it out is, so try it or leave it, no problem...but its a good game, just not what many people hoped for.			"

												Just to many restrictions and such to be even called ""F2P""Though i would like to add that for a hunting game this is as good as it gets. Very detailed and true to real life and it looks gorgeous aswell.But if you don't wanna fork in alot of IRL money into this game  to be able to get all the guns (and ammo. Yes the ammo cost money aswell) or licences to hunt the animals it's pretty much a no go. The only currently positive thing about the payment model of this game is that it's cheaper then IRL hunting.The recent addition of 2 free species to hunt every week is a nice step towards the right direction though and the dev's should get credit for that.

												Alright Guys, I Have About 570 hours in this game so i guess its time for a review. So As You All See it says its a free to play, it actually is though. But heres the catch, that ""free"" word can be quite tricky. you see when you start playing the game, you get all pumped ""Like oh boy im gonna kill everything"" well your wrong because you're basically gonna be playing a demo, you get a few animals to shoot as long with 2 animals you can hunt that rotate through out every week. you can't create your own multiplayer server but you can join others. The Game will always make you feel like you have to buy more and more and sometimes you give in, but if you dont want to spend money thats fine but before you go all ""oh i hate this game, free to play my♥♥♥♥♥quot; why dont you just give it a shot and spend atleast a few hours (2-3) trying to find a male whitetail or something, it also helps to have a friend there with you that knows this game better, this game almost sucks without a friend when you first start playing, theres a hunting forums for this game and this community loves to help out new players. My Point is this game isnt that bad if you just give it a shot.			"

												I played the game for around 40 hours on my other steam account, and i truly enjoyed it. This is the best hunting game out there. Unfortunaately, my expierience was VERY limited due to the microtransactions which are almost essential to the game. I would rather just spend 10- 20 bucks on this game and have  it include everything. i am very dissapointed, although i cannot say this is a bad game. I think you should try it out, and maybe you will even decide to spend money on the game for the full expierience.			"

												Really Injoy this game. To other reviewers, yes you have to pay for a license to hunt game. Different states in the USA handle this differently, but it is pretty much the same. You buy a license to hunt at a certain time an only the game that is allowed during that time period. This is a hunting simulator! You can do things go earn money in the game to use instead of paying for the in game money. Aside from that, this game has some of the best graphics I have seen in a while. Also, it is nice to play a game where your movement isn't like supermans. The distance you travel in 15 minutes is pretty much like what you would travel in real life. I do plan on getting a month membership for the perks, but this game is fun to play even without them.			"

												The best hunting game hands down!! The only people that complain are those that are broke and looking for anything free to play. If you enjoy hunting then this is a no brainer. This game is not difficult as some n00bs here on steam complain. Once you get the hang of things you will be cleaning the forest out. I recommend watching lots of YouTube videos to find out more info and how to play the right way. I have been playing this game for over 5 years now and still not tired of it in the least bit! 10/10!!GunninGamerz on YouTube			"

												Guest players are given a singleshot shotgun with buckshot, birdshot, and slugs, all that can be used on all ingame animals(check store in launcher for singleshot shotgun for more information), and a .243 rifle with a scope. Guest players for a short time(3 days) have membership are allowed to hunt all animals, after it expires whitetail deer, pheasants, and European rabbits, and several animals are the only animals allowed to hunt, including a random selection of animals are open for an entire week that are free for guest players to hunt.I reccomend players who have mimimum knowlage in hunting and have patience to download and play. Don't buy membership if you're not sucked into the game for at least a month.			"

												99% of the reviews on the hunter are negative because people complain about how it is marketed as a ""free to play"" game. If you want to play the game properly you will have to spend a bit of money. But after you get a membership the game becomes sooooooo much better. You need to be patient to play the hunter and by the looks of the other reviews, not many people on steam are. Make sure you play the tutorials or you will have no idea what you are doing and maybe watch a youtube video or two (e.g. theHunter Beginner's Guide 2016 by HooCairsTheHunter). If you are a new guest I recommend sticking to the towers and calling the deer to you, as they can see, smell and hear you alot better with guest clothes on. There is free shotgun in the store which I dont think many guests know about, so get the shotgun and go clay pigeon shooting (don't worry about wasting ammo because it is unlimited in the vacinity of a range or lodge) or go pheasant hunting and if you like it, buy the membership. I also recommend going to thehunter on wikia as it gives you tonnes of information on reserves and where you can specifically find the animals.			"

												TheHunter, Why I enjoy this game.1- For everybody who appreciates realism, I belive this one is as close as it gets.2- A very mature community (usually older people who have the patientce to hunt, yes less than in real life but still this game  requires patience to bring home those beautiful animal trophies).3- The game is constantly updated and it keeps a very strong data base tracking every animal you hunted/spotted, every shot fired with each weapon so you can see how you are doing comparing to others not to mention that daily there are competitions with trophies and prizes.4- Beautiful graphics and sounds (especially when maxing graphics), makes you really feel like hiking in the wild.I would like to say a few words about why this game is unjustifiably ""trashed"" on steam.1- Notice, that absolutly 99.9% of all negative reviews are by people who barely played and just seem not to understand the bussiness model, no single negative comment is actually made about the game it self.2- The bussiness model of this game is different and it requires understanding.Bussiness model:1- As a ""Free to Play"" what you get is a limited experience of being able to visit all the maps  but to hunt only 2  species (Mule Deer, Cottontail Rabbit). Clearly this will not last you for hundreds of hours but you must consider this as a 5-10 hours of ""demo"" that will show you wether you would like the game or not.2- TheHunter is constantly being updated (Its the same game from 2009) so the bussiness model here is a subscription bussiness model. In reallity depending on the time you commit to 3-12 monthes you can pay as little as 3$ for a month (35$ per year).3- The items/ gear that is sold in thehunter is also sold for real money, you must consider this as DLCs (steam languge).4- Even if you absolutly want to a lot of new content yearly it shouldnt cost you more than 50$ per year.In case you are intrested in trying:1- Just download the game.2- Tune up graphics in settings to max (relative to your rig ofc.)3- Start and finish the tutorial.4- Start / Join a hunt in ""Logger's Point"" and go on tracking and hunting ""Mule Deers"" and ""Cottontail Rabbits""5- After a few hours you will see if the game is for you ;)			"

Posted: June 14, 2014
												Firstly I'll just say this is the best hunting game I have played and by simply buying the $15 subscription and spending another $5 on EM to buy yourself a 300 magnum you can do basically everything in the game. free to play is very limited but still fun. (you cannot host multiplayer as a free to play) Secondly there claims about being able to earn currency is a sham dont do any of the survey offers and especially dont do any of the offers that say pay $20 on such and such a service and they will credit you so much EM. I have spent about 8 hours filling out serveys and watching videos and doing all sorts of things and even useing all my correct information only to have my information stolen and nothing given in return, all the EM providers just claim you have not completed the requirements, even after I sent them all the copys of the email confirmations. and the hunter accepts no reponsability from what they link from there own game. Its a scam. I payed for access to software in one deal to try to get a good rate on EM currency which never arived and after speaking with their support staff found out that that company claims no affiliation with either the advertising company or with TheHunter so in the end lesson learned.Granted a small few of the ""download and open this app"" ones worked for a small amount on EM but nothing else did. TheHunter are advertising this service of earning EM inside there own game from and ingame window and should be held responsable for the clear violation of the fair traiding act in false advertising.

												Hello All HuntersI been playing this game before it even came to steam. I been on it for almost 3 years I believe. I really enjoy this game since this is the closest I can come to being a hunter without buying a hunting license, a gun and ammo, and a lease. I find the graphics to be pretty detailed and all the ambient sound makes it feel like I'm actually in the wild. As a F2P (a term everyone hates) shooter, its fun and relaxing at the same time. The game isn't perfect by no means with some AI bugs, pop ups, limited draw distance, and other hic-ups. But everyone grips about hunting only mule deer and having 1 rifle and deer calls. You have to buy a license to hunt other animals in the game that roam around in the same world. They grip about license expiring after certain set times. People forget that this is cheaper than going out and buying real life guns, ammo, leases, and a hunting license thats good for 1 year. Enough of my short rant. Only thing I don't like about the game is that to get em$, you have to ether buy it or do third party surveys, apps, videos, or other stuff they want you to do for the em$. The missions are a nice touch but only reward you with gm$ which you use to buy different ammo. And to buy extra guns, stands, and other calls you'll need em$ which is hard to come by. Other then those grips the game is a pretty run and relaxing hunting trip thats so much better than a Cabela's hunting game any day.Multiplayer - Basicly if you are a guest (F2P) you can't host any multiplayer game but you can join but due to the restriction of the guest, you can only hunt on Logger's Point. But members can host any game and set any restriction on who can join.			"

Addictive Gaming ExperienceAbout Me:  I only show to have a few hours into the game since it recently released to Steam, but have played since release & have over 1500 total played hours over the years.  I enjoy both Hunting & Gaming, so finding & playing the best hunting game comes natural to me.TheHunter:  First things first...this is not a shoot-em'-up game where you sprint through the woods guns-a-blazin'.  You will often be crouching through the woods or sitting in a stand, if that's your preference.  Some will see this game style as a bit slow or even boring at times, especially if they're used to playing a FPS.  That being said, theHunter is a good compromise between Hunting Simulation & video game.  StrengthsVariety:  There are currently 18 different species that you can hunt in theHunter, and that number continues to grow as they add new content.  There are the small deer species (roe, blacktail, whitetail, mule deer), larger deer species (roosevelt elk, moose, red deer), waterfowl (mallards & Canadian geese), canines (fox & coyote), hogs (wild boar & feral hogs), bear (black & brown), birds (pheasant & turkey), and small game (rabbits).  There are also 7 different maps for you to hunt these animals, containing anywhere from 4 to 6 different species in each map.  You also have access to 32 different weapons with which to choose from, which allows you to hunt with a variety of rifles, pistols, primitive bows, compound bows, shotguns, a flintlock muzzleloader, or even an air rifle, each with different scopes for you to use.  Further adding to the variety offered in theHunter are the different types of camo & large equipment, such as treestands, blinds, feeders, bear bait barrels, etc. Replayability:    When you start a new game in theHunter, the animals are randomly generated on the map.  This only happens once, which is right when the game starts.  There are no “respawns” as you harvest animals throughout the course of your game.  Nobody knows exactly how this works, but suffice to say that you have close to an equal number of each species on the map that you selected.  There will always be animals that are trophy worthy, and it is up to you to use your skill & patience to find them.  Along with the trophy animals are rare variations of almost every species offered.  This gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you find an albino bull elk, that trophy piebald whitetail, or the rarest of rare bears.  All of the deer species use a system called TruRacs that generates the antlers that you see in-game, and it is different every time.  All of these things, combined with the variety above, give this game a great amount of addictive replayability.  In one hunt, you might be shooting for a red deer muzzleloading competition in Hirschfelden wearing the trapper outfit & in the next you might be hunting mallard ducks in the swamps of the Rougarou Bayou online with your friends.  Even if you start in the same location & hunt the same species repeatedly, no two animals you kill will be identical & no two hunts will be the same.Adding to the replayability in theHunter are Competitions, Missions, Achievements, & Skills.  There is at least one Competition available every day for each species, most often lasting a day or two each.  There are also 250 different Missions available.  These are optional, but now earn you a currency called gm$, which can be spent on some consumable items, such as scent eliminator spray.  You can also increase your Hunter score by earning Achievements, which are mostly earned through killing x number of species or x number of kills with each weapon.  You also increase your skills along the way, making you better at tracking & spotting game.  An expert tracker can tell the sex of the animal, along with good estimates of the track’s age & the weight of the animal, while an expert spotter can give you a really good estimate of the animal’s score.Developer/Community:  This is easily the best gaming community that I have ever had the pleasure of playing & communicating with.  The developers are actively involved in the Forums, and allow the community to make suggestions for future content.  They send out surveys regularly & then deliver the content that the community wants.  The community also hosts their own competitions that pay out significantly more than the official ones.  Special Events:  theHunter throws out some pretty cool special events for certain holidays.  Sometimes, it’s just a special item (see Xmas beanie or St Patty’s Day hat) but sometimes it can be weeks’ long competitions that award guns or special trophies that are only awarded during that time.Graphics:  All in all, the game is absolutely beautiful, with nice water & weather effects.  Inside 200m the game is breathtaking.  The graphics do show their weakness if you’re zooming in with binoculars or a scope beyond 250m or so.  That is an engine issue, which I will talk about below.Weaknesses:Dated Game Engine:  The biggest weakness in theHunter is it’s dated game engine.  Specifically, the draw range of animals & most objects is limited to somewhere around 250m.  While the game boasts realistic ballistics & has beautiful scenery, that immersion is broken when you reach the summit of a mountain in Hammerfel and can’t spot animals on the opposite mountain.  You see, due to the limited nature of the engine, the game doesn’t draw those animals.  They exist, but you can’t see them until they come inside that 250m range.  Cost:  I personally don’t agree with this being a weakness, but I’ve been around theHunter long enough to know that most do view this as an area of concern.  First, let me say that the “Free to Play” is extremely limiting, and it should be.  I wish they wouldn’t even market it this way, as it gives people the wrong impression from the outset.  The bottom line is the game offers you a ton of content, much of which is not necessary, but costs money.  You can hunt every species in the game with the basic single shot shotgun that can be purchased with your gm$ earned through Missions, you can spend a little extra for gold engraved shotguns & rifles, or you can land somewhere in between.  Purchasing the Trailrunner membership is easily the best bet for the new player, giving you all you need to hunt every species on every map for a year for $43.99, and is my advice for anybody that is just starting out.  If you still want to play after that year has expired, then in my opinion, it’s well worth the money to extend your membership.OVERALL:theHunter is an addictive blend of hunting simulation & gaming, offering high replayability through randomly generated animals, enormous maps, variety in hunting methods & species.  You always have a carrot to chase, whether it’s finding that next trophy animal, looking for rare variations, trying to win competitions, reach the leaderboards & hall of fame, or completing achievements, missions, and increasing your skills.  If you can afford the Trailrunner ($43.99) membership and don’t mind the slower playstyle of a hunting simulation, then I wouldn’t hesitate to pick this game up. "

												Welcome to The Hunter the most realistic hunting simulator in existence...This game is filled with so many real world aspects that you , wait for it .... CAN'T SHOOT ANYTHING WITH YOUR BLOODY GUN.I spent the first 4 hours of the game treading throught the moutainous terrain to reach my friend which was 2km away from me before getting kicked off the server we joined because i didnt speak GERMAN !!!The rest of the time was spent pondering in a cheerful denmark man's server before realising that you as a player are only allowed to shoot ducks... Yes , ducks and only ducks . In order to shoot anything else besides the ducks in the air and the bloody molecules in the air you need to buy a membership... which is not even permenant...I'd rather go to aussie land and go shoot me some bloody kangas .

												I recommend The Hunter for anyone that has ever wondered how hunting really is. It's a free game that allows people to hunt Whitetail Deer, pheasant, and all types of rabbits. The graphics and realism of the animal's detection system is as realistic as hunting can be. Hunting is a game of patience & stealth and always has been - elements that are accurately instilled into this game. Don't anticipate collateral noscope headshots playing this.~Pros~-Amazing Graphics & incredible terrain with 60-80 fps-Diverse hunting terrains from swamps to dense forests to the arctic circle-Great AI and animations that replicates animal's mannerisms in real life-Very realistic ambient sound effects that are unique to each map-Surround sound footsteps, calls, & noises help narrow down your prey's location-Play with friends (for free!)-9 of 10 maps have something huntable for free accounts-Realistic Ballistics-Licenses to hunt other animals can be acquired from completing missions~Cons~-(Biggest)You need to pay a monthly subscription for licenses to hunt any other type of animal -No lump sum payment to just buy the game for all of its content - you must pay monthly.I have only played the free version of this game and still enjoy it everytime. It is a very relaxing experience that grows in intensity once you're stalking your prey. Once you get your first kill, you'll want to come back for more.Give it a try, after all, it is free!---------------------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------Recently purchased the 12 month Trailrunner subscription ($50) and I could not be happier! They give you 8 guns & an awesome bow, excellent camo clothing, callers, 3 deployable towers, a tree stand, wind indicator, a tent along with licenses to hunt every animal & host your own server.I absolutely love the stealth aspect that comes with stalking your prey. Using the bow is even more challenging since you need to get very close to your animal to get the best shot. Never thought I'd enjoy the bow better than guns, but when you can silently take out a flock of turkeys/deer/elk etc. it is very fun.I'll continue to revise this review as time goes on.			"

												A great hunting game if you are into or want to learn more about hunting.There are a lot of people who complain about the licenses needed to hunt various animals, however thats how hunting works.You dont just grab a gun and randomly go shooting stuff, you need an actual license, usually for the region as well as the type of animal, not to mention you often also have to pay pr animal you kill, and thats separate from the license.There are free guns in the game as well as animals you can hunt, so yes the game is free to play, however to fully explore everything you should grab one of the packs that go with the game, not to mention you will help support the people who made the game and that keep adding content to it.Only downside in regards to the game is that id like more ballistics and more weapon and ammunition brands, but in all fairness there is plenty to use already, just not a huge blaser fan myself :P "

												It is best to think of TheHunter as a full-priced game in which you have to invest atleast 50 euro's: a pathfinder-membership for half a year and an additional twenty euro's for buying some necessary gear which will make hunting a lot easier. This investment is only worth it, if you enjoy a slow-paced realistic hunting game with hours of walking around, tracking and preparing. That is not to say that it will take you hours to make your first kill. With some due dilligence, a quarter of an hour is enough to encounter a deer that walks past your sights and gives you the opportunity to collect your first trophy. And that's what makes this game not only good, but at times even masterful. The satisfaction of landing a kill is immense if you spent a lot of work preparing for the perfect shot. If all this appeals to you, TheHunter is a great game. It is beautiful, immersive, dense, packed with wildlife and loads of equipment and weapons to explore; that is, provided you pay for them...

												So here we are again, out in the wilderness, days gone by and your hard, throbbing member has yet to be planted into some raw, juicy rear.You sit out in your scrawny little watch tower when suddenly--Bluargh!That's it, all you've been waiting for, that one handsome and musculant call from the woods.You take out your Deer Homo Caller™ and let out one equally as homoerotic call, hoping that it'll react to it. You patiently wait out those painstaking minutes which feel like hours.You look through your binoculars and you see something, something in the bush, that isn't quite right.It's the antlers, those big, pointy and majestic antlers, piercing through the foilage, Your nerves are going haywire, your breathing is out of control, but you manage to keep your binoculars steady, as you focus on the beast.It breaks through the foilage, there is is, muscular, sweaty and musky stag just waiting to be plugged.You stow your binoculars away as you approach the galiant beast, every step you take towards it makes your heart beat faster and faster, you can see it, you can smell it, you can feel it.And there it is, right in front of you, just a stone toss away, you're ready, you've prepared your whole life for this, your senses are going through the roof.You reach into your pants, unbuckle the strap, whop out your throbbing and well-greased 'gun'.You clear your mind, slow down your breathing, and take aim.BANG!Everything quiets down, there you are, right on top of it, you stroke your hand over the fur and gently carass the antlers.After filling it up with your munition, and just as you're about to pull out, a mysterious man walks out of the woods and looks you straight in the eyes.""It has come to my attention that you've been dropping Whitetail Deer with unpermitted ammo.""To hell with you, Doc.

												My friend and I one night were looking for something to play together and goof off in. that's when I stumbled across this game.  It looked like exactly what we wanted, it was someting we could goof off in with no real objective and the co-op functionality seemed like a good time. As we waited for the game to download we got a little excited at the prospect of sitting in a tree stand waiting to snipe bambi. once we created a profile we both saw that there were options for a membership which  we both assumed ment premium guns or rare hunts. when we tried to make a multiplay game we were told we couldn't host unless we had a membership. no matter we thought at least we can still join a multiplayer game. After about 10 min. of struggling with trying to get in the same game we found that when we both joined there was nobody else in the game. I mean nobody, none of the other players that were there when we joined, and not eachother. We were in our own individual game. ""Oh well."" we thought at least we can still play and talk. That is when IT happened my friend scoped up on a buck and was told that he couldn't actually HUNT it (in a game called ""The Hunter"") unless he payed atleast $10.  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ GAME. This game is not free to play. this game is free to look at. free to walk around in by yourself. free to pretend to enjoy. but this game costs atleast 10 dollars to play. This is ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting and not at all what free to play games are ment to be. also the game just plain looks like♥♥♥♥♥			"

If its free make everything free. If has content that you have to pay change the price tag on the game so the content does get included with that purchase.The most realistic game with the biggest let down 4/10			"

												The business model on this game is literally a complete rip off. Don't get me wrong, I'm not always against pay to play games. But, when you pay for a monthly membership on this game, you literally get no decent updates at all. They never come out with anything new or groundbreaking. They always just release new store items and gimmicks to try and siphon more funds from you.  That's right, once you are already a paying member they still try to extract more money from you without giving you the content you are already paying for.  It's a shame really. Hopefully another company will come out with a decent hunting game.			"

												This game is TERRIBLE.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS!This game shouldn't be in the free to play section. Its not free to play at all it is FREE TO INSTALL!I was looking for a hunting game when I came across this piece of work. First of all you have to spend stupid amounts of real money for guns, ammo, hunting gear AND hunting licenses for almost every single animal in the game. The hunting licenses aren't even permanent when you buy them. They expire in a matter of hours. So basically you have to keep donating money to a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game that isn't worth it. You as well take your money and buy Cabella's hunting games or anything other than this RIP OFF. It isn't even a hunting game it is a ♥♥♥♥ING WALKING SIMULATOR. You can only hunt 2 animals which are the mule deer and rabbits and it wouldn't even let you harvest the rabbits because the default rifle they gave you is the WRONG CALIBER for that animal.Mule deer are NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND so you might as well enjoy the damn scenery in this piece of ""art"". If you enjoy this game you need to see a doctor because you are absolutly CRAZY if you think this game is any good. 0/10 this game is possibly THE WORST GAME ON STEAM.			"

												First of all let me make this very clear. Yes, this is a free to play game but it's pay to have fun. There are 18 different species to hunt and only two are free to hunt. You cannot buy anything on the store as it all costs Em$ and the only Gm$ items are 1, 7 or 28 day licenses(Which are impossible to buy with Gm$ unless you buy the membership upgrades that cost money to unlock animals so you have missions to do.) Other than that this game is completely pay to play. The Dev's basically went ""We're releasing a new game, let's put the minimum amount of things on free to play so we can advertise it as free to play, get a bunch of people wanting to play our game and once they realize they cannot do anything on the game without paying money we get a bunch of cash in our wallets.""

												Let me start off by saying, this game is in some ways a pay to play ,only you do not have to pay to download and you can hunt two animals Mule Deer and it says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but here's the catch,you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.. You need to buy a membership to hunt all of the animals, if you do not buy a membership then you will be allowed to hunt only mule deer and rabbits. So I do not recommend it to people who do not wish to pay. But if you like pay to play games this just might be your game. Other than that it is a great game, but it might be good for you depending on what you like. I hope this helps with your decision. But it is still a great game. It plays good, its graphics are amazing, and it is a very realistic hunting simulator. Keep in mind this is just what I thought of the game for the little time I played it. It is very free but to truly experience all of its content you need to pay a small monthly fee to keep your subscription going. Remember it is absoleutly free but to access all of its features you will have to pay for a license and or gear. So do not comment or go on ranting about how I said you have to pay to play the game that is not true, but on the other hand it is NOT completely free.			"

												Its great besides the prices of the items in the store, I mean I dont mind if its like $10 for lisences even if it was every 3 months, but $60 for just duck decoys and $20 for just about everything else, and no ingame way to purchase these kind of throws you off the game. It is great gameplay for the first day or two you play, but shooting at just whitetails and having to shell out money for any other animal is a bit steep, They would get so much more buisness and better reviews if they just lowered the prices a bit.

												Pease read this short review. Btw i RECOMEND this game with all my heartRight now only 12 hours played and it feels like 3or4 , this game is not fun in his free to play mode(still posible to hunt like 5 animals), if you can spend 3.30Euro per month you can have ALL THE FUN IN THE WORLD. It is by far the best hunting game EVER made so far. I hunt in real life so i get my opinion matters. Dont expect to kill 10 rabits 25 birds and 1 bear in 20 minutes or so, its exactly the opposite like it is in real life ;).Last but not least, the game have HUNTING DOGS. Add me on friends and lets have fun ;)			"

												Let me start off by saying, this game is in some ways a pay to play ,only you do not have to pay to download and you can hunt two animals Mule Deer and it says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but here's the catch,you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.. You need to buy a membership to hunt all of the animals, if you do not buy a membership then you will be allowed to hunt only mule deer and rabbits. So I do not recommend it to people who do not wish to pay. But if you like pay to play games this just might be your game. Other than that it is a great game, but it might be good for you depending on what you like. I hope this helps with your decision. But it is still a great game. It plays good, its graphics are amazing, and it is a very realistic hunting simulator. Keep in mind this is just what I thought of the game for the little time I played it. It is very free but to truly experience all of its content you need to pay a small monthly fee to keep your subscription going. Remember it is absoleutly free but to access all of its features you will have to pay for a license and or gear. So do not comment or go on ranting about how I said you have to pay to play the game that is not true, but on the other hand it is NOT completely free.			"

												Well what can I say? The reviews are right! This game is in no way free and this is in fact a demo, an EXTREMELY limited demo. If you're looking for a fun free to play game which is probably how you were falsely led to this one KEEP LOOKING because for you this game isn't worth your consideration. If you're looking for a game where you can blow hundreds of dollars so you can hold ""W"" for multiple hours to find and kill the animal shaped group of pixels you had to paid for, this is YOUR game!You can go hunting for cheaper than you could appreciate this game and hunting feeds you.Bottom line: Anyone falsely advertising their product deserves a 0/10.

												It's an overall waste of time, if you don't purchase a membership. The animals to find are scarce. When you do find an animal, it will most likely tell you that you don't have a license to hunt it. The memberships is too expensive.			"

												Well, for starters I can say this game has a pretty nice presentation: lush environments, a diverse and well-handled stereo soundscape, and fitting mechanics. Story is basically null, with missions in-game telling you ""kill this with that"" or ""do these things with this animal"", and that's good for the sim-feel of the game.BUT, you will at most get 3 or 4 hours out of theHunter if you don't want to pay for every single thing (weapons/gear/licenses/sights/etc.) beyond your starting kit. Once you've performed the four missions revolving around the only animal you'll be hunting in free-mode (Mule Deer), there's not much left if you don't feel like paying 4,99 euros for the next animal's license (spoiler: there are well over ten species, and the price gets steeper at every one).Sure you can wander around every reserve in the game (as a ""guest"" as you are referred to) and look at the gorgeous landscape, but you want to track and kill animals? Better haul out that wallet. My hope is that this gets a fixed price for the whole game, and unlockable weapons/gear as you progress in the missions. As it is now I can't recommend it, despite the hard work put into it.			"

												When I played the game, after making a profile, I roamed a forest for nearly one hour... forest walking simulator. Fine... after that hour and finding a load of pheasants and boars that you cannot kill because you lack the licence to kill, and tracking deershit and prints I found a deer and shot him. Got three achievements and closed the game. If you want a forest walking sim, you should download it. This game has nice trees and grass that bend with you when you walk over it and you can scale mountains with ease.Other then that.. be prepared to pay up for temporary licenses to kill other animals and hours and hours of tracking fleeing animals that you will probably find.. maybe.. sometime.. somewhere..

												A game that may have been state of the art ten years ago, 99% of content locked away behind very restrictive paywalls. Want to shoot some other kind of deer? 10 bucks. Want to shoot a rabbit? Sorry your starter rifle isn't permitted, how about a shotgun with birdshot for 5 bucks? There is an ingame currency that you can earn doing ""missions"" but that is only usable to buy limited use lures and ammunition. Weapons? Real money. Clothing? Bags? Scopes? Your credit card please. And it's not just nickel and dime stuff, weapons are 5-10 a pop and scopes start around 4.One of the few developers that hasn't figured out how to do a proper f2p model in tyool 2014. If the game didn't nag and badger you to fork over your money every five minutes and let you actually do and earn currency it would be a whole lot better and attract more customers.But before you go, even if you have terrible spending habits and don't care about throwing money away: The game isn't very good. The graphics are extremly dated, there is a hard render limit of a few hundred feet after which animals are invisible, the animations and sounds are sloppy, gunplay mediocre at best, small selection of weapons and ammo and it is missing many key features of other games such as being able to rest your weapon on anything (how can you not have this in a hunting game?!), bullet cams, whatever you could hope for.Don't waste your precious time with this unless you have some autistic need to crouch through blurry forests for hours and shoot at pixelated deer and too much disposable income. No wait, buy yourself a real hunting license for 20 bucks and go outside.theHunter, the only game more expensive to play than to do it in real life.			"

Posted: June 10, 2014
												The Good the Bad and the UglyTheHunter is a game that most people will either hate or love. I myself have developed a love-hate relationship with theHunter over the years. My first impression of theHunter was very skeptical and has grown to an absolute distrust of Expansive Worlds, the current developers. The game itself can be very addicting and enjoyable.It took me some time before I even thought it was safe to install theHunter. That's not a good first impression. TheHunter is partnered with shady marketing scams and distance themselves from all issues that arise from their use. Why would any developer tarnish their reputation before a potential customer has even been sold on a product? The reason is simple, revenue.Recently Expansive Worlds announced that they now had over 3 million accounts. To say that is a gross misrepresentation of the current status of theHunter is an understatement. If I would have to guess, I would say that active paying membership is probably in the 50,000's range. Most of the accounts are phony, not created for the intention of playing the game.So who does play this game? At its core are some long-term hunters who have invested thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars in this game. TheHunter forums are basically run by the die-hard fanatics who refuse to see the problems with Expansive World's current business practices. If you were to post this kind of feedback about the developers, you would most likely be lynched if not outright banned. Don't get me wrong, the forums are a generally mature crowd but ignorance does abound. What would you expect from humans who think it's ok to kill other animals for fun and call it a sport? Fortunately this is just a video game and we are not killing real animals. A recent poll also showed that about 50% of theHunter members are not hunters in real life.This is most definitely not a Free-to-Play  game. It is a Subscription based membership with a Micro-transaction shop. It does have a non-expiring ""Demo"" version which you can hunt one animal, with one weapon, in one reserve or zone, for free. Upon completion of in-game Missions you can earn enough gm$ currency to purchase one more weapon and hunt one more animal, but the ammo will run out. Though in general the gm$ earned are mostly useless without investing more real money into the game. You can potentially just play the full game  by purchasing a relatively inexpensive membership subscription and using the above mentioned ""Marketing Partners"" to earn enough em$, the other in-game currency, to purchase all the items in the Micro-transaction store. Again, buyer beware. At the least you may not receive the em$ and at the worse you may be infected with Spyware, Mal-ware or other potentially harmful software. And you will get no help from the developers. It should also be mentioned that you can earn em$ game currency buy winning ""Competitions"" but do not expect them to fund all of your desired store items. The Competitions are mainly won by having the most amount of time to spend gaming and just plain luck with a very small amount of actual skill involved, although knowledge of game mechanics are still needed.TheHunter is not a true Multi-player game in the sense of what gamers expect from today's Multi-player games. It was originally designed as a Single-player game that kept track of player statistics online, but not the game data. All of the game data resides on your local computer, there are no Multi-player servers that run the game. Because all the game data resides on the local computer you can imagine the hacking and cheating that have to be dealt with. About a year ago they decided to alter the programming to basically create a 8 player Co-op based LAN game that is hosted on the computer that starts the game. Running a Single-player game over a WAN, with no dedicated server, has introduced even more problems. So, what about the game itself? TheHunter has a beautiful environment with amazing details that can give you the feeling of actually being there. The playable areas are enormous, allowing you to spend hours at a time playing. There are 7 reserves or ""zones"", 18 different hunt-able animals and 33 weapons. Quite frankly there is nothing else like it.  It is a very niche game that some will find quite immersive, complex and addictive. Others will be bored stiff after a few hours. This is a very slow paced game that requires a lot of patience. Patience not only because the game play is so slow but because of poor performance and  software bugs. After many years playing, testing and reviewing video games , I have to say theHunter is one of the most enjoyed, longest running Betas (by game performance) I have ever been involved in. To be fair, the current developers at Expansive Worlds were not responsible for the original core problems implemented when the game was designed. That's not to excuse the current incompetence in management, but some of the existing problems just can't be fixed. One thing for sure is that anyone playing the game for a certain length of time will encounter serious bugs. Whether you can live with those bugs or not is an individual choice but do not expect them to be fixed. The development team is basically a Monday to Friday crew that is focused on graphical design and cosmetic items for the store. Though I am quite impressed with the single Support Staff (in the US) that handles all of the Support Requests in a professional, courteous and timely manner.I could imagine the potential of this game if it was redesigned from the ground up. Dedicated servers running multiple versions...Realistic, Arcade, Adventuring. More to do than just shoot animals. Like Botany, Camping, Hiking, Cooking, Fishing, Survival, Crafting, Etc. There are so many areas that could turn into skill based activities with achievements and accomplishments. It could be marketed to more than the niche hunter crowd. There would be no need for shady marketing and deceptive business practices. The game could be better programmed to get rid of core problems like the blinding glare of the sunlight, or the inability to cross a stream without needing an engineering degree, or  independent volume controls for things like the headache-causing-pounding-chronic rain, or not being able to look straight up or straight down and the list goes on and on. But more importantly it could fund a professional staff of developers that could provide an enjoyable game and make a profit.Alas, we have what we have. I would give theHunter a ""C"" rating and that's only after accepting the game for what it is, a poorly developed, perpetual Beta with a small market. Yet addictive and enjoyable. I would encourage anyone interested to try out the ""Demo"" and see if the game is for you.PROS:•	unique game•	vast beautiful zones•	amazing details•	endless game-play•	addictive•	worldwide player-base•	can try for freeCONS:•	poor development•	perpetual beta•	aging game•	poor performance•	lacking ""gaming"" features•	requires a lot of patience•	small player-base•	can be expensive "

												After taking a look at the negative reviews on this game regarding it saying 'F2P' when they have a Guest user system which is essentially their version of ""Free Users"", I don't see why you're all upset about this. The system works perfectly with the game and despite many of you saying ""You have to invest lots of cash to actually do anything"", you'd be supprised if you took a look around their starter packs page and various retailers for the game (Key websites, Amazon etc), you can infact find ridiculously good deals for this title, I'll explain that further on.I myself find the game to be one of the best hunting simulators I've played in a long long time, the Cabela's series honestly has been blown away by this title and the community as it stands is in excellent condition. The game is regularly updated and despite having a few issues in the past it's turning out to be one of my all-time favourite games due to the fact that there is an unlimited amount of fun that you can have, from having hunting competitions with your friends to solo hunting in the dense forests or in the mountain peaks. The graphics and the game ballistics & physics are clean and very well-done, despite having hiccups rarely with a few glitches they need to iron out you'd be supprised at how much you can actually achieve within the game. The achievement and rewards system for competitions and general milestones are another feature which adds a sense of achievement to investing your hours into the game, same with weapon skills and tracking / spotting skill levels.On to the weapons, currency and customization within the game. Customization is somewhat limited due to the fact you can't swap camo's on your weapon, so the marketplace often has weapons of the same type but a different appearance. But it doesn't really matter as they share the same skills / stats aslong as they are the same model. Character appearance is another feature you can customize within the game by simply mix and matching clothing to your desire, with the wide range available it's really not that bad. As well as you can swap out clothing on different enviroment conditions or depending on what you're hunting to give better visibility and sound reduction stats. Currency (EM / GM) within the game is something you'd definetly expect for a game of this type. With a large multiplayer endorsement around the game I wouldn't have expected anything less than the requirement to buy different weapons, clothing and equiptment with the virtual currency, which is perfectly understandable for this title and was implemented well within the game. EM is the real-world exchanged currency where you purchase it using real-world money or you can complete surveys as an additional way of gaining it for those who can't justify supporting the title through currency purchasing. GM is the free currency which you can gain through suveys again or by completing challenges or competitions within the game, however you can purchase limited things using this currency.Honestly, despite what you guys are saying they should have no shame in calling themselves a F2P game, I've spent many hours within this game and spent what I'd say is a fairly reasonable amount on additions for the game. They offer a nice range of deals on their site for starter packs, for the price of $15 you can get almost everything you'd need to have a nice start to the game, the 12 GA Pump Action Shotgun included can hunt almost everything within the game, you gain 3 months membership and access to hunting everything and travel anywhere, as well as various other equiptment and a sidearm included.I didn't realise it before but I found various retail versions of the game available on certain retailer websites, and despite already having a membership and a nice collection of weapons, I went ahead and spent £14 on a retail key from {LINK REMOVED}, who offer a very nice retail package for this, for the price of any regular game. So what's the shame in calling this an F2P game if they give you a variety of free options, and then the ability to upgrade to a full version of the game with a membership / starter pack / retail copy for the price of any regular game? It's perfectly justified.And for those who are interested in that retail copy, it is beyond belief what you get from it and I'd highly recommend that to anyone interested in starting or continuing playing this game. It includes 6 months membership, 7 weapons (2 shotguns, 2 sidearms, 2 rifles, 1 bow) as well as access to everything within the game and another large assortment of equiptment and callers to get you started. (Note: One of the shotguns is an exclusive non-market shotgun too!)Weapons in the game are definetly very fitting for the title. The developers have kept far away from unrealistic hunting weapons, despite firearms such as AR-15's and semi-automatic rifles being used regularly in real world hunting they have taken the right desicion to not spoil the fun of hunting and keep it to a nice selection of rifles, shotguns, sidearms and bows. They even added a muzzleloader for those who want a way-back hunting expirence. Perfect matches, for a perfect game.Overall, in my opinion the game is absolutely superb with it's stunning graphics, unbeatable realistic physics and it's very well implemented multiplayer, community and features. Definetly a 10/10 in my books, and for those upset about the pricing of things, seriously check out the retail copies and the starter packs. For the price of a regular game (Under £15) you can get everything you need to have endless hours of fun within the game.Hopefully this was helpful, if not then I'm not sure what you were expecting from a review.(Note: Over 100 hours on the non-steam version)- Felix B.

												I'll try my best to review this game since it's not exactly ""Free to play""If you go into this game with just the free version, go into it knowing that you can ONLY hunt and harvest Mule Deer and Rabbits.The game really shines ones you have a membership since you can hunt everything the 9 or 10 hunting locations offer.The common thing I've seen people ♥♥♥♥♥ about when it comes to this game is that you need the licenses to hunt other animals (Which like i said is sorted with a membership) and you needing different types of guns for different animals.You can earn ingame finite amounts of gm$ which you can use to buy a shotgun with which would allow you to hunt pretty much everything since it can use the 3 types of Shotgun ammo availible. (BirdShot, Slugs and Buckshot)Although it would be a trial, and a management of Gm$ it's still available through that means without spending anything.Also as a memeber you get umlimited ammo with every gun you have, apart from a type of arrow which do expend  which is the tracer bolts. (Not tested them myself)But all in all, I've had a fantastic time playing the free version when I did, and I'm having an even better time with a membership.Best Hunting game around. If it's not your type of game or business model, then just move along and don't play it :)Happy Hunting and good luck!			"

												I'm a long time player whit multiple accounts.This review is not about the game itself (which is great). It's about EW business model and how they are greedy.Some companies choose to sell a full game at a full price and then charge for DLCs (Guns, equipment, cloth bundles etc…) separately. Other companies prefer to make monthly subscription system; you will pay monthly to have access to a full content game. Both are okay. However, some greedy companies like EW choose to do both at the same time whit the same game. Of course, nobody is forcing you to pay, but you will have a limited experience even subscribing monthly. You subscribe monthly and then you need to pay for every single piece of equipment you want, if you want to have a full experience. It isn’t monthly subscription enough? If you can pay for it, it is okay. Or if you content yourself by subscribing and playing whit only 2 or 3 guns whit no cool equipment. It's a game for rich people. A money Wormhole.They want your last cents. Don't be fooled by fanboys and their stupid arguments about ""F2P"" and how this game is ""cheap"".			"

DON'T LET THE INTRO VIDEO ON THE STORE PAGE FOOL YOU. IT WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THAT THE GAMEPLAY IS FLUID AND RESPONSIVE. THE MOVEMENTS ARE CRIPPLED AND LAGGY AS HELL!This one is great for when you just want to slow things down, take your time, and slaughter innocent forest creatures. Unfortunately these game devs have a horrible reputation for greed and poor customer service. They boast that it is they most realistic hunting game out there... and that's not quite true.. While the terrain and landscapes are very well done, the draw distance is very limited (meaning the animals disappear from site within a very short distance from you) in this game, and that is something that a hunting game SHOULDN'T have. The animals (excluding the deer) in the game are very poorly detailed, both aesthetically, as well as their movements. The game engine and graphics are VERY dated. If you've ever hunted in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry: Primal you probably found the animals looked much better, and moved much better. The weapon handling smoother. Not to mention the superior baiting and trapping you can do in those.Then there's the business model. Not only are you required to subscribe or purchase licences (with REAL money) in order to hunt the different animals in different locations, but its also riddled with a boatload of unreasonably overpriced microtransactions for guns, ammo, nests, blinds, and pretty much EVERYTHING the game has to offer. Basically its a wring out every dollar greed fest.All from the same devs who released theHunter Primal from early access while it was (and STILL IS) very much a broken beta game, giving a nice middle finger to everyone that invested in it!Only spend money on this game if their packages on steam are at a MAJOR discount.

												I would Not Recommend this game unless you have loads of money to throw away!This Game is very limited on what you can do. This Game Involves you having to buy membership just to hunt any other animals. As a non-member you are only allowed to Hunt Mule Deer, And rabbits But you cant hunt the rabbits until you buy a air rifle, So to buy a air rifle you need to buy Some game money called em$. To be able to Hunt other animals you need to buy a membership. But even then you will still need to buy extra stuff to hunt the animals you got from buying the membership!-Positives-------------------Nice Looking Game-Runs Fast-Easy To use Tracking System-Negatives-------------------To many Things to Buy-Non-Members need More things to hunt- Need membership To hunt other animals- Still need to buy wepons even if you buy the starter pack (This gives you wepons, but not the right ones to hunt the Membership Animals )- Need to buy memebrship to play with friends Without strangers Joining and messing up hunts- WAY TO MUCH MONEY NEEDS TO BE USED TO ACUALLY ENJOY GAME!-Still Quite buggy on multiplayer e.g Deer dont die they just lay on floor and run or they lay on floor but cant be killed by any wepon what so ever!This Game is not worth the time unless you have lots of money to enjoy it with!!!!!

												This is by far one of the best virtual hunting games ever made. The graphics are amazing, the animals realistic and the game is full of a wide variety of guns. The negative reviews simply come from the fact that you have to spend real money on the guns and the fact its a pay to play not ""Free"" as its advertised. If you have the money you will not be disapointed, if you dont well... Get a better job so you can enjoy it lol.*Edit* Additionally you actually dont have to spend real money on in game items assuming that you can get 1st to 3rd place on a hunting competion which rewards you with the currency you would normally have to buy. While this is not a guarantee that you'll win its a fun competative aspect.			"

												I'm going to be honest, I almost didn't recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great for being free. The graphics are nice, the game runs smoothly, and the gameplay is fun (especially with friends). BUT, to really have more than an hour or two of fun you will need to spend some money. It isn't much ($15 gets you 3 months of membership which allows you to hunt all animals), but it isn't a permanent membership. You would also need to buy a gun to be able to hunt most of the animals. Overall, if you are willing to put money into it, it is a great game with hours upon hours of fun.			"

												This is far from a Free to Play game. If you want to do anything you have to pay for it. I jump in and look around and see a moose. Whats the first thing that pops into my head? Lets kill the moose! I try to shoot the thing and it tells me I need a licence that I have to buy... The hell? So I quit the game and go to the shop. It's only then that I see all the licences that I need to be able to kill anything. So a quick look at the map tells me that I was in a area that I couldn't even kill anything. Again, the hell? So I finally found a area that I could kill something without a licence to do so and do you know what it was? A BLOODY RABIT! Appearently you need to pay to get a licence for anything bigget than a rabit. Bottem line, save yourself the trouble and don't play this sorry attempt to get money.			"

												It's not worth it if you think it is ""free to play"". Its pay to play in the end, all you can do in the free version is to go around on the Island. The game dosen't allow you to hunt  animals before you buy a seterfication (its 1 seterfication for each animal) and it costs real money.But if you love hunting games i think you shoud try it out and pay 20-30 euro for all the basic stuff :)			"

												""Free to play"" You need to buy EVERYTHING to play this game, you can only hunt rabbits and mule deer without paying, but the game is horrible. It looks nice, runs nice too, but from the motion sway in the gun, even at short distances, and the horrible spped and size of the map with no vehicles from what i saw. ""free to play"" if you spend money then you might actually be able to enjoy it. Go buy deerhunter, it's probably a better deal			"

												This game is very detailed, the graphics are simply amazing and so is hunting.But why is this a negative response you may ask? Well, as soon as you get in the game you realize that you dont really have much to do, you can only hunt 2 animals and you get only 1 weapon, unless you pay that is, and this isnt some easy payment, you need to pay for guns, tents, and well, everything, and on top of that you would also need to pay for membership. Overall, i'd rather just put money into real hunting than putting lots of money into a video game			"

												theHunter is a great idea, and has some great potential. The game play is a little stiff and could use some fluidity. The hunting is actually quite difficult and fairly realistic. Being a hunter in real life I very much enjoyed that part of the game. The biggest issue with this game is that they require a monthly fee as if they have something really special.  This results in this game feeling more like a scam then a good idea. Don’t pay for this game it’s not worth the money.			"

												I'm a little bit indifferent about this game. It sure has some nice graphics and game mechanics for a hunting game (I myself haven't played any other for longer). You now get I think all reserves to play for free, but as many others mentioned:You have to pay for anything.Hunting licenses, Weapons, Ammo, Callers, Clothing.... Almost nothing can be baught with the ingame money you earn, so you cannot get into this game deeper than a demo, if you're not willing to pay anything.But as others recommended: If you like this game, spend a few bucks on the boxed version for a 6-month account, all hunting licenses, some startup wepons, etc. I'm sure it'll get you through the game until it bores you anyway.But for a ""Free to Play"" title....For me this game loses in some casual point:No save option. If you miss that deer you followed 2 houres, have fun on tracking it down for another hour. Sucks big time, especially if you want to make use of a ""Free to hunt <other species> weekend"". YAY, houres wasted. In-Game and In-Real-Life -.-			"

												It's fun and would be a great hunting sim... if things weren't so expensive! Free to play meaning you can only do one thing without paying. You can shoot mule deer, with one gun. They say you can shoot rabbits, but you can't do that with the gun they give you.If you could purchase guns with the money you earn in game, that would be an improvement. But it's like $3 to $10 for each different gun. I'd rather pay full price for the game and get everything, than get nothing unless I spend real money. You would spend LITERALLY HUNDREDS to get everything!Seriously, reevaluate the prices and pay model, and you might get a recommendation from me. If you keep it as is, you're not going to get many players.			"

												So I got together with a couple of mates a couple days ago and we played this game for like 8 hours. I'll give you my opinion of the game.Textures - 7/10      Textures are reasonable for an open-world game, but could be better. Scripting/Execution/AI - 7/10      I'll give it descent credit because the AI is kind of detailed, but does glitch occasionally. 3D Models & Art - 8/10      The 3D modellers for this game put a lot of work into the models, which I appreciate as a game developer myself. Gameplay - ?/10      Your opinion on this game's gameplay is very dependant on your playing style and your style of game. If you play games like Call of Duty or Team Fortress than you probably won't enjoy it all that much, but if you prefer slower-paced games like Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, or like Farming Simulator, you probably will enjoy it lots. But that's just my interpretation. On another note, this game can also be incredibly boring. You could be tracking an animal for three hours and only find their feces. But that's where the slower-paced gamers come into play. If you like to play games with your friends, than I HIGHLY recommend grabbing a couple of friends and getting into a game together. It gets a lot better if you have some friends with you. Features - 0.5/10      If you've played this game before reading this review than you probably know what I'm talking about. The per month fee that you have to pay to play this game is rediculous. Sure, the game is labeled as free, but in reality all you get is a really, REALLY limited demo of the game. In this demo you get to explore about 5% of the games full map, get one weapon, and you can only hunt a small number of animals. Like one or two. Once you think about it, you end up paying like WAY more for this ""free"" game than any other game if you are going to play it long-term. It's $15.99 for three months of minimum game features. You can pay more for some more weapons and gear, and EVEN more for what should've been offered with the original copy of the game. And even if you don't want to get into this game long term, you can pay more actual money for face-camos and things like that and you only get about 10 uses for $0.99.Overall - 2.25/10      This game could have been incredibly succesfull and entertaining if there wasn't some scam of a fee. I understand that they want to make money for their work, but it would have been a better idea to charge maybe $10.00 or $15.00 for the full game. If you like slower-paced games and you wanted to pay $15.00 for 3 months of partial features, or nothing at all for a demo. I do not recommend this game to anybody unless you have a few friends that are willing to pay the fee as well as you.			"

												Was hunting Geese with my buddy Armrha, got frustrated when they weren't landing and fired birdshot while they were out of range in a fit of rage, 14 Geese landed 1 minute later. Shot 8 of them between the two of us, Pheasant got spooked and flew away after we shot them all, shot it out of the sky.8/10 would get angry and fire my 12 gauge into the air again.The Hunter is an excellent spiritual successor to games like the original Cabela's Dangerous Hunts, however it often misleads potentially new players with a ""Free to play"" scheme, that is a blatant lie, the game becomes unplayable, much like the original ""Free to Play"" marketing schemes. However if you invest some money into it, (Around 15 bucks) the game is pretty decent, with well coded animal AI and plenty of quarry that behaves drastically different, you won't feel as though you were chasing the same thing with a different model. Kangaroos for example are almost oblivious to predators (I.E. you) and will remain fairly calm as you close in for a good clean one shot. Whilst deer will get spooked at the slightest step within 30 meters.I've yet to hunt every type of animal and am still fairly new to the game, I'd say if you like hunting simulators and have some buddies to play with on this it would be a decent purchase for a brief bundle pack, by its end you should have gotten your money's worth and will be done with this game.7.5/10+ Good AI.+ Gunplay feels genuine.+ Good with friends.+ Drastic change in environments keep the game fun.- Crappy store pricing.- Misleading ""Free to play"" marketing tactic.- Pay to playI'd recommend a cheap bundle buy, if you enjoy it you could invest more into it. Trying it ""Free to play"" will feel incomplete.			"

I understand that they want to make money for their work, but it would have been a better idea to charge maybe $10.00 or $15.00 for the full game. If you like slower-paced games and you wanted to pay $15.00 for 3 months of partial features, or nothing at all for a demo. I do not recommend this game to anybody unless you have a few friends that are willing to pay the fee as well as you.			"

												Was hunting Geese with my buddy Armrha, got frustrated when they weren't landing and fired birdshot while they were out of range in a fit of rage, 14 Geese landed 1 minute later. Shot 8 of them between the two of us, Pheasant got spooked and flew away after we shot them all, shot it out of the sky.8/10 would get angry and fire my 12 gauge into the air again.The Hunter is an excellent spiritual successor to games like the original Cabela's Dangerous Hunts, however it often misleads potentially new players with a ""Free to play"" scheme, that is a blatant lie, the game becomes unplayable, much like the original ""Free to Play"" marketing schemes. However if you invest some money into it, (Around 15 bucks) the game is pretty decent, with well coded animal AI and plenty of quarry that behaves drastically different, you won't feel as though you were chasing the same thing with a different model. Kangaroos for example are almost oblivious to predators (I.E. you) and will remain fairly calm as you close in for a good clean one shot. Whilst deer will get spooked at the slightest step within 30 meters.I've yet to hunt every type of animal and am still fairly new to the game, I'd say if you like hunting simulators and have some buddies to play with on this it would be a decent purchase for a brief bundle pack, by its end you should have gotten your money's worth and will be done with this game.7.5/10+ Good AI.+ Gunplay feels genuine.+ Good with friends.+ Drastic change in environments keep the game fun.- Crappy store pricing.- Misleading ""Free to play"" marketing tactic.- Pay to playI'd recommend a cheap bundle buy, if you enjoy it you could invest more into it. Trying it ""Free to play"" will feel incomplete.			"

												An absolutely emotional rollercoaster of action and suspense, this game managed to completely envelop me in its world as I fumbled with the awful controls. Once realizing my top running speed was 1.5 MPH, I was off to hunt my first deer. The journey was tough, as I crawled along, finding tracks for numerous rabbits, but no deer. Finally I was on the trail. Days and nights passed as I embarked on a quest to trudge through a forest, spamming the deer call. Finally, I was answered. A deer bleat echoed off the trees to my left, signaling that something had recieved my call. I readied my rifle, prepared for whatever awaited me past the trunks of the nearby forest. There, it stood. A beautiful, majestic mule deer waited in the pasture, looking for the source of the familiar call. I quickly tried to aim, but alas! It took off! However, this is no normal hunter you're dealing with. A well placed shot quickly dropped the animal to the ground, and I ran over to see my kill.Unfortunately harvesting the deer crashed my game.Also this game blows, seriously don't play it. If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to hunt deer as Steven Hawking, this is your game.			"

												This is the most realistic hunting game you could ever ask for. As an avid hunter, I find it exciting to explore new places and hunt different animals that I may never have the chance to in real life.On the downside, it is very expensive to hunt different animals. Ducks for example, you need to buy a shotgun, ammo, camoflauge, decoys, calls, blinds, and a dog to be efficient at hunting them. This could add up to hundreds of real dollars. It would be nice if they would make it possible to make in-game currency through certain tasks where you could buy all of the items with it. They do have an in game-currency, but you can only buy consumables with it and it is difficult to aquire.overall, 8/10			"

												ok so i download this game despite the...3,000 and some odd number of negative reviews. And to my surprise there it is, not a free to play not a free to play with slight premium buys but a pay to win, then after 3 or so months pay to win again. As soon as i loaded the game up the first screen that pops up is the purchase screen so this tells me that this is nothing but a milk machine for the skeezy developers that made this. And once i get past that i actually get into the game and what do you know i start with nothing but my hands and a camera. So upon further investigation of the getting a gun situation i find that i have to exit the game entirely and go to the ""Launcher"" to get equipped with something. So i knew that being a free to player i wouldn't get the best. But i got the absolute worst. I got some crappy gun that looks like it was textured in PS2 era and i still have to buy ammo which costs in-game currency. So i go to buy some and nope i got no starting cash so basically it was trying to force me to pay up to get some in game currency so i could purchase ammo for A FREE GUN. I feel like this should be labeled as a bad game and taken off steam due to the 3,000 some odd number negative reviews saying it was a horrible game and nothing but a scheme to rob people. I am going to try and contact the developers to see if i did something wrong and how i can fix it and i might change my review.			"

My Gun w/locking case: $400, Hunter Safty Coures: $250, Firearms Permit: $250.  Plus $58 for 1 Moose tag(actually is a draw system here and I'm not even garentied a tag).  Almost $1000 the first year I hunted. Plus it cost about $600 to $900 to have a moose processed by the local wild game butcher. Game: Around $200 for every gun in the game.  plus $40 a year for every liscence and unlimited animals.  You do the math......Off to buy more flowers.			"

												Here's how it basically works:-Each animal needs a license to be hunted. You can't have permanent licenses. You can buy membership to have all licenses for 3 - 6 - 12 months.-You can hunt animals only with the right rifles, meaning if you buy the license for Bear hunting but you don't have a weapon that's good for it then you can't hunt it.-F2P = license to hunt Mule Deer and Rabbit, 1 weapon with which you can hunt Mule Deer but not Rabbit. Unlimited ammo for that weapon, a scope and a Mule Deer ""caller"" ( idk how to call it i'm not native english )-You need to buy ammos for weapons. Meaning if you buy a shotgun then you need to buy it's ammos. When you finish the ammos ( 2 euros are usually 10-20 ammos  depends on the ammo type ) then you need to buy other ammos.-Every rifle costs from 5 to 20 euros.-Clothes, ""callers"" for other animals, and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥that helps you have a easier hunt cost real money.Definitely not a real F2P, don't even download it if you're not ready to spend A LOT of money.

												I must say this is the best hunting game out there!Pros:pretty realisticgreat gfxa great varity of animals to hunt, weapons and gear to use. Cons:MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I understand its a F2P but the ONLY way to hunt anything fun is to pay for a sub for x amount of months, then depending on what you want to hunt you have to have certain weapons and/or gear to hunt them. This also costs money to get and a TON of it...... You can do objectives that gives you in game money, but this only buys you scents, lures, bait, pretty much consumables. In all honesty if you like hunting games this is the game for you as long as you have a good $50+ to spend on getting guns, clothing, calls, stands, sites/scopes. If you don't have any money to put into the game its not worth getting due to the fact you CAN'T hunt anything fun.			"

												Ok it's free, of course I'll try it.Well 1,7 hours and I haven't killed anything because everything I've found I can't shoot because I haven't given them money. So this is the worst free game ever but possibly a good hunting game, I still can't say if the latter is true because I can't seem to hunt anything and I'm not going to pay just to try.......			"

												The Hunter is the best hunting game there is. No questions, it looks great, it plays smooth and is realistic!It does not have a long and hard learing cruve, you have a ""Hunter mate"" that can tell you what tracks it is that you just found and tell you where the track is leading. For me it took like 3 - 4 hours to really get the hang of the game. Now, as a ""free"" user you only get to hunt (i think its 2 not sure) 2 animals and you get 2 weapons. You get one hunting reserve that is huge. If you want to play the other 7 reserves and hunt all the 18 animals you need a subscribtion. When i started playing this game i first played as a free user and hunted for 1 hour per day just to see if i enjoyed it that much that i would like to pay for it. And i did! So i bought the 300kr (29 euros approx) package that gave me 6 months sub, a♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of weapons and equpiment. When my sub was gone, i still had all my weapons and equimpent left, so i just bought another 3 months for 80kr (8-9 euros) and started to play again. There is a lot of stuff you can buy ingame, for example callers, baits and camo. I have used the regular outfit for more than a year and been able to hunt in every reserve and any animal with out problem. Its just for looks and making hunting a little bit easier (even though i think its funnier to just follow tracks and shoot them, some perfeer to sit near an open field with a caller and wait for somthing to show up). Anyway should you get this game? Install it and try as a free user. If you liked it, I recommend the 30 euro package, it gives you (in my opinion) the best rifle and some equipment.  "

												Don't listen to all these Whining fools, you can choose to pay for a membership if you want, Its not very much, first of all a standard membership for a whole year is around $37.00? That's not a lot for an entire year, secondly the game starts you off with a .243 bolt action, and a single shot 12 gauge, you can kill any animals in the game with those too, .243 for deer etc, 12 gauge , slugs, birdshot, buckshot. As a guest (person who does not have a membership) you can hunt Whitetailed deer, pheasant, European rabbits, and the two free to hunt aniamls for the week. You can choose too pay for guns, but you can still play easily without them, he'll I did for 4-5 months and shot lots of animals, also the game has new content coming out all of the time, the community is absolutely awesome, I have met loads of people I am now good friends with, is the game realistic? I am an avid hunter In real life and I would have to say out of all hunting games this one is as close as it gets, still it would be extremely boring to have a hunting game be super realistic, I have gone weeks without shooting or seeing a deer in real life, also there are several types of memberships, there are the ones that come with equipment and the normal ones, I would suggest buying the $50-$60 membership for a year because it comes with loads of guns, calls, and equipment, then you can just buy the member ship that comes with nothing for $30 something, I Really have no idea where the people putting out negative reviews get there information from, all of the reviews i have read that are negative about this game have tons of false imforamtion. I really hope you decide to play the game, for free, or pay to help the devs produce even more content. it wont matter to me, you can add me on here and i will be willing to help anyone out.			"

												This is a beautiful game, I love to play even when Im not finding anything to hunt because its so beautiful! Although this is a beautiful game, guests are extrtemely limited as to what they can do in the community and in-game, I would absolutely play this game more if em$ were esier to get and if maybe guests could create their own dedicated server, with of course a certain amount of game time played. I reccomend this game to people who enjoy good graphics that are viewable even to the crappiest of computers!			"

												Some facts first:I am playing TheHunter for almost 5 years now.Spent about 150 EUR.Still enjoying the game because of the updates and good cooperation of devs and community.Yes - I recommend this game.It is a special genre for patient players.For beginners it´s recommended to read the Wiki/forums first and play some tutorials perhaps.I really like the atmosphere in the reserves - there are a lot in the meantime.From spring to winter - from rabbits to bisons...you can play through a lot of different missions which gives you ""Gamedollars"" as reward to buy consumableswhich are pretty helpful in the game.The recent update (Jan 27th 2016) allows guests (F2P) to hunt more than one species nowand hunt them in different reserves. Just a result of the good coworking of the community and the devs of EW.If you want to visit my profile follow this link: http://www.thehunter.com/#profile/hardtree/ "

												well,  to be honest, the hunter could be a really awesome hunting simulator.COULD BE.on the positive side:  - many interesting and well designed locations.- detailed and pretty looking graphics, good looking animations, shadows and light effects.- realistic animal and gun sounds.- very far distant view.- changing weather conditions.on the negative side:- some video bugs, like floating trees, poo...- the water, especially in rivers looks rather ugly.- you cant host multiplayer games without buying a membership subscription.- you see many different animal species, but you arent allowed to shoot them without ""a license"" aka a membership subscription.- 90% of the time you're tracking an animal with a device called ""huntermate"", you see a popup ""YOU FOUND A TRACK OF A XXX BUT YOU DONT CURRENTLY OWN THE LICENSE OR MEMBERSHIP TO HUNT IT""  thats just ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.i understand that its a free to play game, and the developers want to earn money, but this license / membership system is really one of the worst i found after years of gaming.i would gladly pay 50€ ONE TIME to get the hunter as full game, with all guns, equipment, when im able to hunt all animals...but with this ""free demo, pay when you want a real game""-system, its a big NO for me.

												This has to be one of the most un noob friendly games. You get in the game and learn how to hunt and play. You finally find a dear or anything and try to shoot it. It then tells you that you need to have a membership to hunt this animal. A membership cost money and is very expensive for what you are getting. From my experience this is a pay to play game. This game would bor me if i continued playing it.Is it hard to run: No a positive is it is really easy to run and you should not have any problems if you have a decent computer. You dont need a titan to run this xD. There are settings to turn graphics down though if you do have problems.Conclusion: There are little pluses in this game the truth is it is not free to play and if you want to proceed or get anything done that is fun in the game you will find your self paying 30$ or more.

												Yea... fun game... atleast until you finally find an animal that is one of the two you can kill. You get really excited, really pumped... You take your little gun that it gives you you aim the crosshairs over the head of the whitetail or whatever you found, you hold your breath, count your heartbeats, close your eyes and expect to kill the creature, until the game starts to yell at you about how your not supposed to shoot something that you don't have a license for... And after tracking for like two hours. you should atleat be able to illegally kill an animal, yea maybe not get any points from it, but atleast let out your inner need to kill on this poor creature, cause its not like that doesn't happen ever in real life. Then all you can do is run around shooting your gun in the air to make the animal flee... other than this, the game is actually pretty good if you have the patience of a venus fly trap and the money of an oil company ceo.

												I spent about an hour wandering through reasonably nice but repetitive scenery, tracking animals that I wasn't allowed to shoot. When I did occasionally find the one type of deer I could hunt, I had to spend 20 minutes inching close enough to find additional tracks, and then I came across some other animal's tracks and it reset my tracking.Moving around is incredibly slow. You can run to go about twice as fast, but this frightens away animals at approximately the same range you can start to track them.If you're crazy into hunting, maybe this game will be enjoyable to you. If you're into games, it probably won't be.			"

												theHunter is definitely my new addiction. The graphics are just purely amazing and also the gameplay is really well done. You can decide yourself whether you want to walk around and sneak up to animals and take pictures of them or want to go hunting.There are several different weapons and you can pick one for yourself depending on which one works best for you. There is a restriction of weapons though, while you can kill some animals with a certain weapon, you can't kill others with the same weapon. But this exists in the real hunting world as well, so if you've got experience in hunting already, this won't be new for you.In my opinion theHunter is definitely worth the money and I will continue paying to play it.

												I've been playing The Hunter since before steam, this is my first review of The Hunter. The Hunter's developers are extremely money hungry and all they want to do is to make this game a ""free to play"" and add items you have to buy with REAL MONEY. It is just like team fortress 2, but TF2 has much, much less items you have to pay for, and most of them are 3 dollars. in The Hunter, you have to pay for almost EVERY item in the game. You even have to buy a damn membership for hunting additional animals. Guest membership can only shoot mule deer and cotton-tail rabbit, and the default weapon isnt licensed for THE DAMN RABBIT, which means you need to BUY a gun that is designed for rabbits.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T! Do NOT buy any item they have, it is a waste of money, or better yet, DON'T PLAY THE GAME!!'			"

												By far one of the best hunting games you will ever find period! Yes it sucks you have to actually buy licenses and rifles and such but in this day and age you should expect it and compared to paying $30 for an arcade cabellas game every few months its worth it. The 3 month is $15 and that is crazy cheap for an online multiplayer game. As for the game itself. The maps are beautiful and very detailed, most hunting games are either open fields or forrests that seem more like a crop or plantation. Wide selection of firearms and bows, you don't need every single one you can get one rifle and one shotgun and hunt everything in the game, or just one bow. The animals can be a challenge to track more so the trophy animals they are very skiddish as they should be. Too many people are focusing and giving bad reviews on the fact that this game isnt really ""free"". I have news for you. It is. You never have to buy the game. Yes you have to put a few bucks in here and there to get everything the game has to offer but you dont HAVE to do that if you don't want. Some people just like hunting mule deer... That is FREE... Ammo for the .243 is FREE, You want to go hunt whitetail then pay a couple bucks and get a license or pay $15 and get it for 3 months.If this game does not suit you then go back to Cabellas games. They are great if you like to hunt like you are playing CoD and not actually hunting.			"

												TheHunter is ""Free to Try, Pay to Progress"" Hunting Simulation game. It worked on Win 8, looked good, sounded ok, played ok.  Simulates Real Life hunting of animals.  You can hunt whitetail deer, European rabbit, cottontail rabbit, snowshoe hare and pheasant, because you have a free permanent license for them, but each week there are random animals that as a free player you can shoot as well and are featured on the front page of the Expansive Worlds web site.  You start off with only a beginner's hunting rifle, binoculars, gps, camera, deer call, t-shirt and regular pants and other gear.  No real easy way to earn ingame money to purchase other gear and other hunting licenses.  You can join another vip hunter's server and try to hunt together or get help from. You can hunt for free on a solo map.  You have to track animals by looking for tracks, sounds and poop, not sure what else you can track by. You are playing a real human in game, can die or get hurt. You can run but will get winded and Running scares away animals. The graphics look good.  Huge maps with hills, plants and trees blocking sight.   I guess the animals are programmed to act like real animals.  Not sure if the virtual animals have same or similiar senses as real ones.  You can use lures, if you can buy them. You need huge amounts of patience, real skill, and luck to bag a kill.  Has some shooting ranges on some maps too.  To hunt anything else and get better gear, you have to spend real money, they are pushing hard the subscription.  You might like this game if you love real life hunting and know how to hunt. Maybe a noobie hunter can learn to hunt for real on this game without having to suffer through bugs, heat, poison ivy.  If you Don't know how to really hunt in real life, you will fail at this game and not like it. For more info:

												Yea... fun game... atleast until you finally find an animal that is one of the two you can kill. You get really excited, really pumped... You take your little gun that it gives you you aim the crosshairs over the head of the whitetail or whatever you found, you hold your breath, count your heartbeats, close your eyes and expect to kill the creature, until the game starts to yell at you about how your not supposed to shoot something that you don't have a license for... And after tracking for like two hours. you should atleat be able to illegally kill an animal, yea maybe not get any points from it, but atleast let out your inner need to kill on this poor creature, cause its not like that doesn't happen ever in real life. Then all you can do is run around shooting your gun in the air to make the animal flee... other than this, the game is actually pretty good if you have the patience of a venus fly trap and the money of an oil company ceo.

												I spent about an hour wandering through reasonably nice but repetitive scenery, tracking animals that I wasn't allowed to shoot. When I did occasionally find the one type of deer I could hunt, I had to spend 20 minutes inching close enough to find additional tracks, and then I came across some other animal's tracks and it reset my tracking.Moving around is incredibly slow. You can run to go about twice as fast, but this frightens away animals at approximately the same range you can start to track them.If you're crazy into hunting, maybe this game will be enjoyable to you. If you're into games, it probably won't be.			"

												theHunter is definitely my new addiction. The graphics are just purely amazing and also the gameplay is really well done. You can decide yourself whether you want to walk around and sneak up to animals and take pictures of them or want to go hunting.There are several different weapons and you can pick one for yourself depending on which one works best for you. There is a restriction of weapons though, while you can kill some animals with a certain weapon, you can't kill others with the same weapon. But this exists in the real hunting world as well, so if you've got experience in hunting already, this won't be new for you.In my opinion theHunter is definitely worth the money and I will continue paying to play it.

It says free to play and is, only to a degree, if you want the full experience then be ready to part with real money, but hey we do this for every game we go and buy right? So all these people complaining and giving this game a bad name should read the small print first. If youre 12 and cant afford 25 quid or whatever it is to buy a membership then dont bother.Simple!Thumbs up x10000			"

												I've played a lot of Hunting Simulator games in my time and this one was by FAR the best one I've ever come across. There are plenty of animals (with great behavioral mechanics), weapons, levels, and good ol' trophy kill satisfaction to keep you occupied for a long time.Unfortunately the pay-forever-to-play business model ruins it. They took it way too seriously with the word 'simulator', meaning it simulates everything, even the crap parts of real hunting like having to fork out real money for temporary hunting licences.They argue that many people don't play a game for more than a year, hence the ""justification"" of having to pay the cost of a full-game every year. But I've been playing Deer Hunter 2005 since 2005 and thanks to this game's poor business model I'll still be playing it in 2015. That's the kind of decated fans they are turning off with this payment method. "

												I will say this is a very nice game and its came a long ways. No the racks on deer arent exactlly realistic in the wild and turkeys arent as responsive to a call as they really are.  All animals ragdoll instead of go with the direction of the bullet orslow down when running hit and about to die but thats no reason not to play.  Vast, beutifull terrian, diverse wildlife and a wide selection of firearms and bows make this very good and well worth the money. "

												Okay so I was pretty excited to see this game for free I was looking at TheHunter Primal but before buying it I thought I would give this one a try since they are made by the same company. Once this game downloaded I was excided to start playing. It was beautiful, until I realized I couldnt hunt anything because I needed liscenses. Makes sense but once I tried to get them they told me I had to make in game purchases to continue to play.  For a free game that doesn't sound bad, but I don't want to spend almost 20 $ a month just to play a game. Due to this expericnce it has me worried  about purchasing Primal. Didn't like this game and I honestly don't think its worth the download.			"

												The Hunter - The most realistic hunting game that has the Moderators remove any negative comment against.  Pay huge sums of money to hunt the same animal over multiple areas.  Be amazed by 2011 graphics.  Gotta catch them all as the devs release the same gear under multiple reskins for ten bucks apiece.  Waste both your time and money as the franchise slowly drowns under the devs incompetence. -- Poor dupe and Player of 3 years.			"

												(I have played this game since around 2011 when it was a single player game and even before it came to Steam, in total I have a few hundred hours played)THERE IS A TUTORIAL. If you can't find it yet still somehow start a hunt, don't play it. You clearly don't have the chops for this game, sorry.Let me open this up by saying if you're under 16 or have some kind of attention deficit disorder, stay away. If you're the kind of person whom while playing MMOs jumps on your mount to run 10 meters and tries to hit max level on the first day\week, stay away. If you're the kind of person who thinks games like the ArmA franchise are 'boring' stay away. If you're the kind of person who thinks 'Free to Play' should mean: ""Give me everythig in a week so I can move on to the next game like a ravenous locust"" stay away. If you can't take the time to read a few pages of text, stay away.This game requires an insane amount of patience, forethought and time. It requires you to learn animal behaviours, how to use lures. It'll teach you how to stalk, stay down-wind and it'll teach you to ease off the trigger and wait for that pefect shot. But it won't beat it into you. If you don't learn, you'll never kill anything, and you'll blame the game for your own hysterical ineptitude.The game is your typical huting style game, you enter a range with a few buddies, gear up and go looking for game. If you're an idiot and run around everywhere, you'll hear nothing and see less. See my point above: Go low, go slow. Follow the trails the animal has left. Spot it's calls and get yourself in range for a quick, clean effcient and ethical kill. Simple right? It's an especially enjoyable just chilling in a tower or a hide with a few buddies catching up.Now let's talk about the pay wall, shall we? Yes the game is hardly playable as a free to play game. Is it prohibitivly expensive? Only if you're an idiot with no idea how to take advantage of bundles. There are a selection of bundles on the store that offer 3, 6 and 12 month subs respectivly alongside a whole boat load of gear. If you drop the £30 on the top end back you get:12 Month SubAround £50 worth of consumablesA weapon from each catagory and a high powered pistol, as well as ammo and equipment for it.GearHidesStandsTentsThis is as much conent as if you'd bought the game normally. CRAZY I KNOW. It's almost like the company wants to stay in business with such a small demograph. (Let's hope these kids never spot Flight Sim after market prices, eh?)Yet the people knocking this game are more than happy to drop £60 on the latest CoD Map Pack while shouting about this games payment model. It is MORE than possible to buy a single 3 month sub and complete the missions in a few days, giving you around 100,000 GMS (In game currency) which is enough to buy liscences and hunt for free for around a year and a half.)Make no mistakes though, the Free to Play in this game should be considered a pretty hefty, unlimited demo, much like WoWs Free to Play model.If you've ever wanted to actually hunt or want a realistic representation of what it could be like, this game, some buddies and a few hours to kill will be a rewarding and satisfying experience. If you want to have a collection of 30 deer pelts and wrestle a bear all within 10 minutes, don't waste your time, or my time when you come crying to the forums.			"

You have one high powered rifle, and a limited amount of ammo that has to be bought with any money you may be able to pick up through missions... But if you're like me, you will probably forget the missions are even active and end up with too little money to even afford the one type of ammo for the one type of gun you have.			"

												You've got very limited weapons and hunting permissions, unless you pay.That's not a free game, really don't understand why not just make it a paid game with the full experience. Oh well, I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to find out that there didn't seem to be any unlockables, just buyable stuff, that's why I'll give it a negative.If you are willing to pay all the expensive things you need to buy to make this experience really enjoyable it may be a really good game. I don't know, I really had fun hunting down just 3 deers of the only species I was allowed to hunt, really relaxing and enjoyable, you can either track animals almost by your own (clues like footsteps or animal crap are highly visible and recognisable by their red aura, although that's all the basic help and it's reasonable, for gaming purposes) or you can use a device to mark the clues, make a trail and estimate an area in which the animal may be, it's fun either way.I expected at least a killcam for when I finally killed the animal I was tracking but... nope, you just take a pic at the corpse and on to the next one :(			"

												I'm going to start off by saying this game has a lot of potential to be an amazing hunting simulator. The fact that is multiplayer is also a fun bonus. The false advertising rubbed me in all the wrong ways however; this game is not free to play (unless you like a hiking simulator dressed up as a hunting simulator). To actually hunt in this game you have to spend real money on licenses, guns, etc. I'm hoping in the future that this game will actually allow you to hunt a bit more without spending money (or just costing money right off the bat). This game does have a lot of promise but right now I wouldn't waste your time downloading it.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game... I really do... But this game being advertised as Free-To-Play is nothing but a lie. You have the license for the mule deer... and nothing else... You have one high powered rifle, and a limited amount of ammo that has to be bought with any money you may be able to pick up through missions... But if you're like me, you will probably forget the missions are even active and end up with too little money to even afford the one type of ammo for the one type of gun you have.			"

												This game is very enjoyable and time consuming! The game is still playable even without a membership, as you can get kills and earn money. The more money you earn the more you can unlock to kill. Think of it as a double win! The membership costs are low enough to honestly not cause any discomfort compared to the price on some games now adays. Think of it as a cheap game for 3 months, and then if your bored move on, and only have spent a fraction of the price of a regular game!  "

												Lets talk anout the pay to win....In order to hunt anything other than Mule deer and Rabbit(non-members dont get a shotgun for rabbit) you need a membership or a specific licence.I don't entirely agree with this system, it causes you to have to pay a lot of real money over time as opposed to just paying money for the game and being able to get all the in-game stuff without real money.All of this aside, the gameplay is amazing, it strikes a good balence between simulation/realism and enjoyment. Most animals are not so hard that you get extremely bored (as long as you're hunting correctly) yet some of them can be tricky to hunt. They each have they're own habitat,(some are in more than one reserve)sounds, difficulty, and weapons that you can use for them.(don't worry about having to buy a ton of guns for all of the animals)Overall, if you can put up with the payment system, and you have some patience. This game is extremely fun to play. "

												With theHunter Call of the wild coming out I decided to give this game a shot, and its the best hunting game out there. Gameplay wise in the first 3 or 4 hours+ wich it takes to get a decent mule deer its pretty interesting.. I mean if you shoot at anything yes sure the game dies out quick. but if you really try to aim to get a ""Trophy"" Kill its not that bad..They have also added 1 more animal to shoot so you can shoot 3 free animals, White tail Deer, Some bird, and another animal + they went to add the Moba style ""Free to play"" Licenses where every week you get a free license.. This week there is Bison for example... Sadly tho, in cold weather you need cold weather clothes and this game is not exactly free to play. you can now also go to other reserves where you can find your desired animals, so you can for example go and kill a mule deer but at the same time you can spot a bear or a moose.. Quite interesting. I didnt mention the cash shop since everyone knows already that its a terrible cash shop, hence why they are making a ""buy to play game called ""The hunter call of the wild"" And honestly if this game is anything like the Hunter, i dont wanna give it a negative review, because the ONLY negative thing about this game is the cash shop and i think that any negative review can Agree on that.. This game is actually very fantastic if you immerse your self in it, or you chase the same deer for 4km because its a BIG ♥♥♥♥ING DEER! but big ♥♥♥♥ing deers means big ♥♥♥♥ing experience so he probably thinks ""That is one hella noobish hunter, i can trick this guy across the map!"" Fantastic game, Horrible cash shop.. I'll give it a 10/10 for immersion10 / 10 hunting sim10 / 10 gameplay (its a bit old now but still solid)-10/10 Cash shopOverall 3/10 (99% due to cash shop).. Fantastic game honestly CANT wait for the call of the wild!			"

												Ok. I have now hit around the 100 hour mark in this game and its time to review it. Does this game deserve 40% negative review? short answer: NO. Long answer: Still no, but I understand why its so low. This game is advertized as a ""free to play"" game. This is sadly not the case. This is a pay to play Hunting simulator. And let me tell you, this is the single best hunting game ever made. Hands down the most fun and imersive hunting experience I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I love this game and always will. TheHunter classic will be a game I come back to again and again for two reasons. 1) Like I said above this game gets hunting right. From big game to small the team at EW has done an amazing job creating beutifull hunting reserves inhabited by great looking and beliveable animals to hunt. Its a blast to shoot bucks and ducks alike.2) I have spent too much money not to get the most out of this game. I think I am sitting at about a $250 bill when it is all said and done. From guns, blinds, lures, callers, bait stations, tents and any hunting equipment you could think of I have bought something of it. But here is why this game is sitting at 40% negative on steam review.The majority of reviews here are from people who downloaded the game, played for a hour and quit and uninstalled when they saw what is free in the game. Which is not very much. You can always hunt for free with licences for Whitetail deer, all the rabbits and pheasant's. They also give you the means to hunt all of these animals. For free equipment you get the .243 bolt action rifle, 12ga single shot shotgun (not free when I started years ago by the way, bonus for new players now!) and unlimited free ammo for both guns. You also get binoculars, deer bleet caller and a camera to take pics with. You as a free user can also join other hosts multiplayer games but you yourself can't host a game without membership. You can complete missions for specific animals and earn in-game money to buy consumables with. You cant get any weapons with the mission money. You can however earn the premium curency by entering and winning competitions (you are unlikely to win so I dont really count this). By now many people will already not want to bother trying this game if you have read this far. Try it anyways. Trust me here you cant get some really fun hunting done with what you have a free user. Its basicly a demo so why not give it a try and see if you like it. And if you do like the game then buy a membership package. I recomend the $54 one that gives you a year of licences to hunt all animals and a bunch of new weapons and equipment to get you a really good start. With that package you dont really need to buy anything else to get the full experience out of the game.Here are some tips to get free stuff in game (dont say the devs never gave you anything).By verifying your email you get a free rifle. Do that in your account info in the launcher. Aslo if you send a referal link to a friend (find that in the launcher sidebar) and they make a TheHunter account you get a ground blind free and your friend gets premium curency and some free equipment. So get a friend to try with you, and if they decide to buy a membership  package (you will get the following rewards depending on what package they buy) you get a premium engraved .308 rifle, engraved deer ""grunt"" caller and a two person tree stand all for free. Also in steam there is a free dlc equipment package that gives you a bunch of consumables for no cost.			"

												Ok, the F2p bit is stretching it a bit far since you only get 2 free weapons and ammo at the beginning which does allow you to hunt various animals, but all being said; it is value for money.The 3mth membership alone you don't find in most games, and ok you have to buy the weapons but tbh since you earn gm's for the ammo you're laughing.This is not a game to waste your money on as you can waste your money quite quickly. It is what it says on the tin, The hunter, you hunter; them animals; you hunt and get better at hunting. All you need to get going is your Computer or Laptop, your Mouse and a lot of your Patience, have them and you're already on your way to be a hunter. And there is plenty in the game to keep you interested:Hunting records :Hunting statsHunting SkillsHunting AchievementsInventorial:Plenty of weapons to get your hands onPlenty of modifications (Weapon specific)Gameplay:As realistic Hunting as you will ever get in a game (Anywhere)Plenty updates to the game to maximise realisticness and upkeeping of the players experiences. (if something goes wrong, it is quickly sorted or as quick as they can get to it)Experience:Really helpful players when you need help or advice on the game etc..Really helpful SupportThese are some of what the game gives but there is a lot more in the game than i can be bothered to put in here as it would take too much time to do so.Updated from here:So far things have been hotting up within the game:New eventsNew seasonal events and challengesNew animalsNew reserveNew weaponsNew gearFixing of things needing fixed and not trying to fix what is not brokenThis game has definitely a long way to go and it can only get better.

												This game looks beautiful, sounds amazing, but is NOT F2P. Yes, you get to install the game, and get a ""free"" gun. But you can only hunt two types of animals: One species of deer and rabbit. But for the rabbit you have to BUY a specific gun. You can unlock the ability to hunt other animals but it's only for specific amounts of time, which when it runs out, you have to buy AGAIN. This game is a money pit and NOT worth the cost to make it fun. If you enjoy running around only to track animals you CAN'T shoot or paying large amounts of money to unlock critical parts of the game, get this! Otherwise, hope they change the microtransaction scheme, because this game is otherwise amazing.			"

												The gameplay is amazing. I really dig it. Walking trough the woods. with a pair of buddies. tracking an animal together. listening to animals calls trying to find the one you're looking for. But. Theres a big but.The buissness model is simly awful. this should not be in the free to play section. but in a new section called Free to Pay. As the game will try to squeeze every penny it can out of you. What you do get for free. is a low caliber bolt action hunting rifle. With unlimited ammunition. a pair of binoculars. and a little bit of camping supplies for fast travel (consumables) The game features two currencys. Quite usual for the Free to play market. Yet also has a subscription! And one does not grant you the olther! Subscription or ""Membership"" Will grant you a ""License"" To hunt all animals. But the rifle you start with is not ""Ethical"" for all of them. thus you will have to spend even more money to actually take part in competitons. or get score for theese animalsEM$: A currency used to get absolutly everything the ratio is 100 EM$ = Dollar. But the smallest package you can buy is 500. for 5 dollars. the larger packages save you a little bit of cash. EM$ Is the currency used to buy about anything. Clothing. weapons and so on. Yet a single item will cost you 3-7 dollars. For just a single item. ""Happy Camper tents"" Will cost you 550 EM. But there is no 550 Package. Forcing you to spend more money!While there are competitions in game with EM Prizes. To get to them. you will most likely have to spend money. Again!GM$: An in game currency. You might think that you get GM from hunting animals. And you'd be wrong. All you get is score. in a phatetic attempt to squeeze more money out of you. GM is earned by compleating missions. theese have a finite number. and most of them require you to use a peticular weapon or hunt an animal you will not have acsess too. without opening your wallet up. And do not ague that the microtransaction system lets you have ""Choice"" As it does not. The design of the game. maps. liceances. all of that is under the influance to squeeze more MONEY out of you wallet. And it will not stop untill you have everything. And once you do. They will still try and squeeze money out of you on a monthly basis. EIther have microtransactions. or a subscription. having both is disgusting.  "

												The game gives no instructions. At all. After scaring off 2 deer because I couldn't figure out how to crouch, I find one. I found no button to shoot. It runs off into the hideous wilderness, and disappears after 5 feet because of the horrible render distance. I say this after playing on the absolute highest graphics available. The screenshots and videos do not, in any way, reflect this peice of crap.You have to buy an insanely overpriced membership to get anything but the first gun or even play multiplayer, and if you did get it, any gun with a scope costs more than 150$.

												I've been playing the free version since 2009 when my PC could barely run it. Now I've got a much beefier PC and decided to take the plunge and buy a membership. $54(CAD) for the Trailrunner starter pack (Best deal IMO) gives you a very nice selection of weapons/equipment, and all licenses for a year.All I can say is wow. I'm not dissappointed at all with my purchase. I love the fact that this game is 6 years old and still amazing. At first I wasn't a fan of the whole ""pay-to-play"" sales model, but I completely understand why the dev's did it that way.If this game was a ""buy once and keep playing"" type of game it would have been released in 2009, and stayed in basically the same shape it was is at the time of release.Instead, we've got a game that is constantly being updated, even 6 years after it's initial release, and that's due to the fact that the devs are still seeing an income from the game, which allows them to spend time/resourses updating it, and adding fresh new content, as well as fix bugs and add new features over time.In my opinion, that makes it worth the $34(CAD) I need to keep paying in order to hunt all the animals after my licenses expire.Don't get me wrong, if I decide to not pay next year, I can still keep all of the weapons/equipment that came with my initial purchase and use them to hunt Mule Deer and Cottontails (I believe those are the only free animals), but I will definitely be buying my licenses again next year.I would even consider buying a higher priced ""lifetime license"" if the devs ever thought to release something like that, but I understand why they decided to go with the current business model.Now, if only they would do something similar with theHunter:Primal so it could be anywhere close to as amazing of a game as this is.

												Game is not optimized in the least, even for the platform it is designed on. At the same time, as a ""guest"" you are limited to one gun, one target, one hunting area. Any unlocks or purchases are for TEMPORARY use only, no kind of XP item unlocking system, whether bought with the impossible-to-earn in-game currency, or real money. On top of that online connections are miserable even to no-ping servers and hosts. Would recommend for mild ammusement for a couple hours but certainly not any kind of real investment in either time or money.			"

												The really astounding thing about this game is how much fun it could be if the company at the reigns wasn't so money grubbing and stupid. It's actually kind of fun to run around, explore, etc. It reminds me of STALKER, only filled with deer and rednecks instead of muties and Russians.But you get nothing. You get absolutely nothing as a starting player. The only thing you can hunt are mule deer and rabbits, but you can't even kill the rabbits with your rifle. Great decision there. The clothes you start with are vastly inferior to the ones you can only get with money. Which would be fine, but you can't upgrade at all without money. At all. You can't get any weapons, clothes, etc.The game says you can 'earn' currency by doing surveys and such. This is an absolute load. Every single site it links you to is sketchy as hell. Some of the 'programs' it wants you to download are blatant viruses that only an idiot would use. Nice. Of all the offers I went through ( most of them viruses or dead links that did nothing ), I managed to complete one. I got nothing. The currency never came. Even if you pay for the game, it's so damn stingy that you're basically going to need to spend money to keep playing. It's absolutely baffling just how much this company hates it's potential players and wants to squeeze every last cent out of them. This isn't free to play. This is a demo. It shouldn't even be in the free to play section.The only reason you should even consider this game is if you want something to space out to while you're listening to an audiobook or doing something important.

												The amount of REAL MONEY needed to do anything makes this game not worth the time to play. If you like hunting deer all day with the same gun then your in luck! But if you want to play with friends, get other guns, try out different locations, or anything else this game offers then you better have a black visa card... PASS			"

												So... I played the game for free, actually enjoyed it. Told my brother, he enjoyed it too, to play together we jopined someone elses server so that wasnt't really an issue. I thought to myself, well i want to hunt more than the basic stuff tbh so i bout remium ""3 month licence"", then somethning magical happened. Even after the liscence you need to pay more money to buy the right weapons for certain kills, then the right ammo. THEN more money for scentless gear, then more for hides and tents and scopes and anything else even remotly enjoyable. I tweeted them about it, they dont care.			"

												Its a free game, so you dont have anything to lose by downloading it. I walked in circles for thirty minutes following deer tracks. I didn't find any animals. The game takes patience and skill, you probably wont just wander into your target and manage to kill it.This game is like when you've got a tab open, and then the internet stops, so you just sit there and click refresh, even though you know nothing will happen.

												I did not pay anything for this game, but i have greatfun playing it never the less!I honestly can't understand the people who say that this games is crap because it takes them to long to find a animal, or it takes them to long to find an animal they are allwoed to hunt... yada yada yada... moste of the negative reviews cry all about the same♥♥♥♥♥♥If you are not willing or able to just play the damn tutorial and after that use your f*ing brain please go back to school and learn something!The thing about the hunting licenses, yeah as a free player you can hunt 3 animals, White tail deers, european rabbits and phesants, additionally to that 2 randome animals that are changing each thursday. I don't have problems hunting them. If you want to find and hunt them you first should play on the right map and... ahh wait, i don't want to be your tutorial, just play the tutorial and use your brain, after a few hours of gameplay i think you can try writing a review again.I have to admit that this game has very much features you have to buy for a specific time or temporarily and i don't like this either. Also the premium credits are the opposite of being cheap. But if you realy want to have something from the store and don't want to pay money, go play the game with the free stuff and compete in competitions, because there you can win the premium money. I don't say it is easy, but if you want it you can do it.The last thing i want to say is, this game is a very good simulation and you won't find any better! So if you like hunting play the game for free! If you like the game so much you can buy something, nobody forces you to do it!			"

												As of me typing out this review i have been playing for 3 weeks and i have to say the devs of this game have come a long way and yes the there might be a few bugs here and there the devs work their butts off to fix them as fast as they can.In this review i would like to pint out a few things(1) Yes you do need to pay money to actually be able to hunt the majority of the species but i would like to point out that in order to hunt in real life you need to buy a license as well.(2) Just like in real life hunting you need to take your time and be patient in order to drop that big buck or bull you might have been tracking. In no way shape or form will you just get that big buck or moose in the first few minutes of you joining a server. This game focuses on developing skills such as spotting and tracking and the more these skills are developed ingame the more proficient you become as a hunter just like you would IRL.(3) This game will appeal more to those who truely respect and/or love for the great outdoors. So therefore if you treat this game as a real life hunt you wont even notice you are actually playing a game.overall thoughts on this game:fantastic simulator that should be given a score of 10/10			"

												Where do i start... well first of all , it's a simulator.I knew that i wouldn't go shoot 20 Deer in 2 minutes, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I've played the game for more than 60 minutes and i couldn't kill anything.After i started the game i found myself ""running"" up a hill for 10 minutes.""Running"" because you run like...30% faster than you walk. and you walk really slow...When i got there i found some poop and a red arrow above it ,wich pointed me to a direction where SOMETHING should have been.After another 10 minutes of following poop trails i finaly found a wild boar.When i looked through my rifle scope and pointed the animal it said:""you need a license  to hunt this animal""I couldn't belive it. I shot it anyway to see what happens.My Bullet didn't do anything..... GREAT!!!!!So then i found out that you have to BUY the license for REAL MONEY!The rest of the time i tried to find another animal. I had some sort of ""Deer call noise can"" in my  inventory but it didn't had any effect what so ever.So at the end i just rage quit.This game takes a lot of patience...like an INHUMAN AMOUNT OF PATIENCE.This is not entertainment.

												It's a good game - don't get me wrong. It's immersive, tense, beautiful, and fun. Tracking is an absolute thrill as well. It's a game I'd gladly pay $15-20 for. However, it's free to play, but not in a good sense. In order to have any real fun after the first hour or two, you'll need to pay ridiculous fees. You wanna hunt something besides mule deer and rabbits? You need to buy liscences with real money for individual animals. Even better, the liscences aren't even permanent! Plus, you need to buy lures, scents, camouflage, and even AMMO! On the ""plus side"" you can allow companies to fill your computer up with malware for some free ingame cash.

												It's my first hunting simulation, I really enjoy it and there are a lot of things you can learn from its wiki wich lead you, for example, to a real scoring for mule deers or any other information you didn't know about some species. It is very interesting for those who love hunting simulations. It's realistic, the environment you are in is important in relation to the animal you are hunting and if you miss a move, they're gone but you still can find them later with the track they leave behind. Also, there are a lot of places to go and the maps are big enough to trip trough forests and water.Why don't I recommend this game?Because if you want a good equipment, you need to spend a lot of real money or spend some time on third-party pages (eather you earn a little or not... yes, some links does not simply reward you). Well, you earn some virtual cash when you finish a mission but, you can not even buy a thing that is worth your work and time in-game. I don't even know how dare they call this game a F2P. When you are a beginner and don't want to give a few bucks, the only thing that can be done is tracking or kill one of the 18 species (you must have licenses for them ->money) with a single default rifle and there are a lot of missions to do but you can't complete them because you don't really want to spend your own money on that...Again, it's a very interesting game but the store and monetary system in-game made me sick...

												Ok, So I played this game a while back (after developer change but before steam) and would like to say, yes it is a good game. It is a good game with some very nice hunting. But I cannot say it is a great game. There is long walks with nothing to shoot. I have had 3 hour game sessions where I only found one red fox and nothing else despite the fact that I have traversed the entire map and sat for a good while at a stand. Sometimes, there is just a lul in things to shoot. While yes this realistic, can't say it is very fun for a game.Also, it is very, very expensive to play this game. I can tell you it is almost no fun to play the one map and hunt only the mule deer and ignore all the other tracks and sounds you hear. It is frustrating. Also you can't create multiplayer games and you can't always find multiplayer games that you can hunt in. So it is singleplayer for you. This might actually be a better idea because if you do play multiplayer with strangers, people like to follow you and make lots of noise. It can be maddning to finally find that mule deer, get your sights on him, and then have the guy that had been following you run up, pull up his gun, shoot, and completely miss scaring the deer away and anything else that might be around.I just think you should be able to do more without spending money or at least have more in-game ways to earn money and buy licenses. I like this game but I can't afford it.			"

But the bad part: pay to have fun. I started with this rifle and a liscense only to hunt mule deer. I could hunt rabbits, but my gun wasn't right for hunting those. Had no idea how to do ANYTHING, because I got no tutorial. I don't know why. To buy guns from what I could tell you absolutely had to use real money. Same for almost everything else. The developers of this game will rip you off. Even though it's actually free to PLAY it, don't even bother letting it take up space on your PC inless you want to shell out money. If you want you can buy an overpriced membership and have a litle bit of fun for a few months.			"

If you enjoy hunting you'll find the game very fun. Good community out in the game as well. Don't let the negative reviews stop you. I gave the game a second chance and paid a little money and have been enjoying it since then. The hunting experience is fun in the game and the most realistic as well.

												Just no, for the first few hours you do get a slight buzz, and it really does interest me but, after these hours the game just stops. This seriously disappointed me as i soon realize what you need to get a full immersive action: a membership of 3, 6 or 12 months, other guns as (the one you are given is only allowed to be used on a few animals), scopes for the guns and ammunition these all have a sizable price tag and i haven't even mentioned clothes and other addons to make the hunting easier. this may sound like a rant, and it probably is, but it is just annoying that they claim to be a free to play(by definition, a game which gives players access to a significant portion of their content without paying) which is clearly not fufliled in this supposedly free to play game and the developers should be quite ashamed in portraying it to be so (reading through the features they have given, there is no mention of only being able to shoot one animal and only limited to one park for guest).on the other hand if you are willing to pay on the region of $40 to have enjoyable experience then i am sure you will have a great experience, but withn the next few months or maybe a year you will have to pay another $20 or more to kepp you going on the bare minimum or to get the next urgrade, gun or membership.back on to those who do not want to pay, like me, you should download this game; just to see if you like it because it is your decision which is the ultimate decider, but do not come into this game thinking you will get a sizeable portion of content as you will be severly disappionted. This is a good game in theory and with the willing to pay constant money, but it underacheives what is expected of an average F2P.			"

Not a single animal was found.Day two: :I tracked some feral hogs down. While trying to noscope them, they rammed me. My bloodied and bruised rolled down a hill while I was injured. That was fun.Day three: :I spotted a rock. I named him Jim. Jim was a floating rock. He could fly away to the stars if he wanted to.

												NOT FREE TO PLAY. Not even a ""pay to win"" game, Its subsciption isnt bank breaking but you also have to pay for everything else and there is a lot you need to buy to play it! I admit it is a good game but not good enough for what it asks for. I'd love to play it if it were free to play or even a one time payment of between 5-10 GBP, because thats the quality of the the game, but the money making scheme behind it turned me off it. Gonna pay £15 for stomping land and try that instead. (dinosaurs!!)someone let me know when they bring out an arma 3 mod of this game :) "

												I never review game, but I feel like I have to do it on this one, seeing all the bad reviews it is getting, mostly because of the ""Free to play"" tag. First, if you want this game to be fun, the ""Free to play"" tag does not apply. The free part is only useful to make sure you can run the game and get a glimpse of what it is.I started playing this game a while ago from its web page (around 130hrs) and continued on Steam since I got Windows 10. I spent around 60$ so far and I'm well equipped to hunt everything in every reserve, or almost; my friend have bought different guns/deployable items than I did, so we didn't ""double buy"" anything and we can do 99% of missions and hunt ducks and geeses comfortably, which are the most expensive to hunt. Anyway, lots of fun to hunt in all the reserves with friends or strangers or even alone. Great variety of species, good graphics, competitions and leaderboards to get the adrenaline up when you think this is the big buck you were waiting for!I think you have to consider it like a normal game you usually pay between 40$ to 60$ (bundles of several months of  membership and additional guns and stuff available, or buy points to get what you want separatly) and you will have lots of hours of good hunting. After that, when you membership ends, you choose to renew it for another 3 months (3-4$/month) or not, but if you really like hunting games, I bet you will!In the end, if money is really an issue, this game is not for you			"

												The Hunter is a hunting simulator where your goal is to simply collect the highest scoring animal (in short).It features a wide range of animals to hunt from small game to big game in different environments.This combined with new daily competitions to win trophies and in-game cash creates a fun and non-repetitive experience.It is also being constantly updated with new gear, animals and places to hunt at, and if you don't like playing alone there's also multiplayer. Players can enter different teams in a multiplayer game and compete with eachother.The graphics are also outstanding and it's a really immersive experience and definitely the best hunting simulator to date.I've been playing this since early 2012 and will keep playing for years i'm sure.If I had to give it a grade it would be around 95/100, there's no perfect 100/100 game, every game has its flaws, no matter how small they may be. But in this genre you won't find a better game than The Hunter.			"

												This game isn't free to play. Only one animal is free to hunt. You have to get subscription to be able to hunt the other animals. And you have to buy weapons and equipments for money too. I can't comment on how good is the game if you are a paying player, but if you want to play it because it is free, then move along, there's sadly nothing to see here.			"

												This game is really fun considering it is Free-to-play, the one issue everyone has is that you cannot hunt any animal without a license apart from the Mule Deer. You can hunt rabbits but you don't have a weapon at the start that you are allowed to use on them. Now don't get me wrong, sure their tactic with the buying of weapons, licenses, gear is a bit out there, since I believe they should allow you to put in game time to be able to purchase said things but they dont. What I would say is, if you play it a lot like I do recently, Just get the 10 dollar for 3 months and you can shoot any animal that you can shoot with the .243 rifle you get automatically for playing the game. You will get your money's worth even if you play twice a week or even once a week.Gameplay: 9 - Really nice, love the animations and the way you can track and kill your prey.Sound: 8 - It is really nice sound, mostly just nature but it still relaxes you if you are into that thing.Graphics: 8 - The game does feature nice graphics but also bad, I constantly notice my hand looks wooden at times.Story: Not Applicable			"

												I played this hunting simulator for maybe half an hour? Something like that. Still I can say the f2p version is a strong canditate for the ""Walking Simulator 2014"" award. Or more like crawling slowly simulator as walking and running will scare the wildlife away. So first of all, it's free to play. Kinda. You can only use the default weapon (rest you need to buy with real money) and gear. You can only create single player matches without paying a subscription of some sort. You can also hunt only some certain type of deers. You need to buy licenses for the rest of the animals. When I wandered around the forest, I found tracks of many animals and my GPS thingy told me their direction.Even though I didn't have the required licenses to hunt pheasants, I still tried to take a shot at it (as I was unable to locate the only animal I'm allowed to hunt). When I pulled the trigger, my character dropped his aim and an info box appeared on top of the screen saying that I need to buy a license in order to fire my rifle towards animals. Lame.

Custom skins for guns, pay for guns, custom player models and stuff that doesn't affect the gameplay that much, but it's not, and i am sure that it will have more players if it would be.You have to pay monthly if you want to hunt other animals, and pretty much do everything what this game has to offer.Cannot recommend, sadly, because it's a very good game, i hope the developers/publishers change their methods.Cannot recommend it to anyone, except if you want to just hunt a little bit the few animals you are allowed to hunt, or you want to pay monthly for it.

If you like the game, go buy a bow or something else that can hunt the rest of the animals that you can't hunt with the .300. Do NOT buy  x-day licenses for a single animal.

I understand I could have done missions in order to earn money to buy more bullets however I would have to go through about an hour of tracking a singular animal for a couple of bucks on the side rather than playing the game with my friends like I thought I'd be able to, It's a shame because its a wonderful concept of a game with amazing graphics but overall just a disappointment in my opinion.

												I believe this game is for a certain type of player. First if you are impatient this game is not for you. If you crave constant action then you probably won't like this. If you don't want to spend any money then this is not for you. If you like to hunt, enjoy the reward of patiently stalking and killing something, have some money to spend; then you will probably like this.I'll comment first about the gameplay then about the pricing of the ""free to play"" in the second/third paragraph.The game has a slower pace to it, I'll give an example of a typical hunt for me. I spawn at a lodge and load up my equipment in my inventory; I'm hunting whitetail and maybe turkey today so I want my shotgun for versatility and bow for stealth, I could take my .243 rifle but I prefer the shotgun. It's early in the morning and I can see the misty dew settling on the grass plains. The air feels fresh as I slowly wander about looking for my sign. A red tracker mark over some footprints point me in the way of a deer and I walk after it. I want to rush and sprint but I must be patient lest I spook it away. Droppings indicate to me how far it might be, more footprints help me close in on it when I hear the grunt of a buck. I crouch down and sit. I could stalk it down, but I'd rather the deer come to me. I pull out my deer call and mimic the sound of a doe to the open air. A call from the buck responds in kind. The bucks grunts get louder and louder, I know which way he's coming from but there is too much brush in the way. I lay down amongst some grass to make my profile even smaller and wait for him to reveal himself. At last I spot him standing tall and he calls out for the doe in my trap. He is still too far out so I maneuver onto a small hill for a better vantage while he gently and slowly walks in. I watch him closely and load a shell of buckshot into my shotgun, he suspects nothing. He has a decent set of antlers, nothing special, but he carries himself as a king. Still, I know my role as assassin well and wait for him to close in  enough to see the grain of his antlers. Finally he stops before me and raises his head high as I hold my breath to steady the shot. Silence tells him nothing until a cacophonous blast reverberates through the air and scares away any nearby animals from the king as he falls to his knees and lands his face in the dirt. I pull out my huntermate, snap a trophy shot, and claim my work. Walking away I eject the spent shell and load another, there's plenty out there yet on the reserve today. The game looks pretty good and I can tell they put quite a bit of work into the environment. There are a few bugs that happen in multiplayer but otherwise the game itself is very good.Now for the reveal of the abnormal market. Since this appears to be a niche game, they have decided to get it paid for in a way, I think, most steam gamers aren't accustomed to. The free-to-play isn't, its more of a demo really. When you first start out you can only hunt mule dear and rabbit with your one .243 rifle, and shooting rabbit with your rifle will give you disqualifying kills. If you want to hunt everything then you can get, at minimum, a 10$ membership which is good for 3 months. On top of that you'll want calls, other weapons, equipment, which all cost real money. To further the currency explaination: The game has paid for currency (em$) and earned currency (gm$). Em$ is a cent to cent ratio, 100em$ is $1.00. Almost every weapon is 4-6 dollars, yeah, I know. Each call is over a dollar, clothes costs a few bucks (don't buy individually, get bundles), stands, blinds, other items are all going to be 4 dollars or so. In other words, you can easily spend more than a triple-A $60 title. In other words, if you put money down, spend smart (research stuff) and make sure you're getting what you want.Gm$ are earned by doing missions and are terribly underutilized and overpriced in the store. I do enjoy doing the missions, a little extra goal and challenge to a hunt, not too hard to accomplish. With gm$ you can buy one single shot shotgun for 6200 (I have it, I like it) otherwise you can get sprays to attract animals or bait and that is pretty much it. You would think at least some clothing but nope. You can get animal licenses individually with gm$ but its priced so high for a beginner its not worth it (1800 gm$ for 1 day of turkey hunting). I sort of understand why everything is so expensive compared to other games but I don't agree with it.A little more about my experience that may be helpful. I hunted with a friend who picked up items so I didn't have to get everything, he got a bunch of mallard gear, I got a bunch of geese gear. I only hunt with the .243 rifle (given for free) which is good for most deer and coyote and fox. A 12 gauge shotgun, which can shoot anything except birds with slugs and birdshot can shoot those (you get three kinds of shells and it replenishes for every trip). So yes, with one shotgun you can shoot any animal in the game, given somewhat limited range. Finally a compound bow which is great for stealth and when you have multiple animals coming as it won't scatter them like a gun. So my method is very up close and personal usually but only took the purchase of the bow; the pump-action shotgun came with a membership bundle. If you want to hunt big game with a rifle get something up in the .300 caliber range and you're good to go.So as a result: Good game for patient gamers who have decent income. Bad game for someone looking for an actual free-to-play game like War Thunder or LoL and/or doesn't like somewhat realistic hunting. Of course you can always try it out yourself. Do the tutorials when you start it up (Hunt Now -> Tutorials) Also read up on the wiki (thehunterwiki.com) has a lot of useful information. If you do decide to get into the game and put down money. I recommend one of the membership bundles, you get a lot more than getting it individually.If this review isn't helpful please comment why and I'll do my best to improve it with what you need to know.

												Awsome game. They are working on the free to play features with the new free rotation so you get 5 species over one like the old version and it rotates so you can hunt new stuff every week. Tons of rifles, bows, handguns, sents, lures, ect. So you always have something to play with. There is like a 5$ average on new weapons but I think thats fair just wait for sales and get bundles. They got to make money on a free game somehow. There is aton of reserves and the upcomeing Rockies reserve comeing out which I can't wait for. Also you can have 8 people on a reserve at a time which is awsome to host little compititions and stuff. The grahics are not bad when you crank them up all the way. Try it out see for yourself. "

												-Not willing to pay-You will not like this if you are not willing to pay for their monthly subscription.Their ""free to play"" demo only allows you to take down a specific deer. You WILL DEFINITELY come across many different types of animals that tease you into shooting them but lo-and-behold, no license. -Willing to pay-You will like this if you are willing to pay for the monthly subscription that gives you weapons, unlimited ammo and license to kill all animals.The simulation is realistic enough that you can almost smell the grass.The sounds, the scenery, the animals, the refined look of the weapons are really well defined. -You can add me to find out more.  :)			"

												I don't ever review ""Free To Play"" Games but with this one I have to!   A lot of people gave this a bad review because non-premium people can't hunt many animals in the game.  Non-premuim like me can hunt ""Mule Dears"" and Rabbits I really don't mind that at all!  Even though lack of animals you can hunt it is still a very nice game,  this game makes you feel like you're in the woods hunting/camping.  I personaly love this game and I would recommend this to anyone.  overall this game is proabally a 10/10 for me.  I hope this review helped you!!! Try this game out for your self, you have nothing to loose it's ""Free To Play"".  I did not mind at all I think two species is very generous! Loggers point you can find tons of the animals their.  I've been a member for awhile now and I love it still my favorite game on steam. The Devs are nice and help ful they don't yell or get mad at people that trash talk this game.  theHunter is one of the best ""Free To Play"" Games on steam for me! well it is my favorite game even out of all my paid games.  In theHunter you won't be getting an adrenaline untill you actualy see an animal then thats when it gets very tense.  I use to play many Hunting games when I was a kid but this one here overtops all of the hunting games I played.  Another positive is the beatuifulness of this game it's so relaxing reminds me when I was in a cabin.  Just get the game and try it if you don't like it then it's fine but it's prob not your kind of game then.  Thanks for reading please rate this up so we can get people to see this game! -Shawn Spencer			"

												Note this is not a free 2 play game and the free 2 play content is limited in scope to the point where it is just a demo. This game is a game that takes time and some investment to enjoy, first off I suggest buying a membership after trying the game, this will allow you to hunt all game. I have a Trailrunner (1 year) membership, this gives you a few guns some calls and a membership, also the membership gives you 3 replenishing boxes of ammo after every hunt, so you hunt use it all quit start a new hunt and it will be available again. I also bought every call, and some set up bundles, but that was after around 40 hours in the game. The graphics are great and immerse you into these beautiful reserves. The tracking and spotting of animals is excellent. Animals have a nice variety in size and antlers. There also rare coloration differences and for some deer non typical antlers. There are dogs for waterfowl and they are a nice premium item. There is also bow hunting which involves stalking and getting up close to your prey, an intense and fun experience.Ok enough rambling, basically this game, is more like an iracing you need to narrow what you want to hunt or do or be prepared to spend more than what an average game costs. More on hunting on a budget, pick a style not species say bow hunting, competition hunting, waterfowl, big game etc. Then buy some the items that help you hunt in that style, for bow hunting maybe some camo and an upgraded bow, competition, the calls can be key, waterfowl a blind and decoys, big game calls and a nice rifle. So it can be played on a budget but to be the best at hunting everything can get expensive, now the setups mentioned above can be had for around $20 - $30 a piece and this is on the high end. This is not a free to play game but a hardcore hunting simulation, but if you find what you want to hunt through watching videos or trying to hunt them you can immerse yourself even on a budget. "

												The only hunting simulator worth playing out there at the moment!The Hunter couples gorgeous graphics and immersive sound design to create vast environments that feel real when you step into them, something that other hunting games out there just don’t replicate. Recent hunting games have been shoe-horning you down corridors while Ibex and Lions jump out onto your shotgun barrel. The Hunter gives you the opportunity to experience the journey, a complete hunting scenario: Listening out for calls, tracking, and observation, not just constantly providing a slurry of beautiful beasts to bludgeon.I believe the game suffers when informing new comers. I’d recommend checking out the wiki before jumping in as there are some rules for Guest players who haven’t purchased a membership regarding what you can hunt and where. I have all confidence in the Dev team though! They are constantly active and seem to value and utilise feedback. New content is always on the horizon whether it is new gear, weapons, species or reserves to hunt. The game also boasts a strong community to hunt alongside or against in an interesting array of hunting challenges.			"

												Great game... if you're alright hunting ONLY mule deer, cottontail and european rabbits; the latter two of which require specific guns/ammo you do not begin with in the free game.Runs well on my crappy little laptop and installed fairly quickly.As everyone has said - it's called a ""free"" game in the same way an incomplete game that requires paid DLC to run properly could be.Expect to spend a good few hours hunting and your first few ""successful"" hunts to give you nothing as you'll spend more time than allocated trying to find the damn thing.As I said, have spent many hours on this game, and am personally /alright/ with hunting mules, but if you're wanting a game with variety where you don't get frustrated by ending up finding a track to an animal you can't hunt in the end then this isn't the game for you.

												the only thing i dont like about this game is that if you are a guest you cant buy crap like its fine to only hunt mule deer and all that other guest stuff but the only thing i would like added was at least like 1$ for everykill that way you have to spend lots of time, and patience agrivates some people that they might even buy a membership out of frustration, so its also a way to make more people come and maybe more people buying, but im sure you can find a downside to this, but this is just a suggestion. why don't you make the game like 50$ on here and then it lets you have like a lifetime licence for only like 2 more animals, and ACTUALLY EARN MONEY. this game isnt recommended, until they  can fix the other peoples problems, but truly i think it would be a great game without spending 100$ on virtual in game things instead of getting somewhere in life.

												Awesome game, but you can only hunt Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits for free. The rest you have to buy with any kind of membership.But I do think that the membership price is worth it. It's $10 for 3 months of membership, and you're able to hunt ANY animals. But, if you don't want membership and there is only one other animal you want to hunt, you can buy any animal licenses at the store.So far, my Hunter Score is 45.			"

												So, I'm back, and this time, an in-depth (not really) review of thehunter. So, yes I know, microtransactions suck, but even if you pay the $15.00 fee for a license(3 months, I believe), you WILL enjoy this game. I happen to find the game really fun. I have decided to buy the $50.00 membership (12 months). The $15.00 and both, the $50.00 plan, come with weapons. The $15.00 comes with a little bit of stuff, but not a load. The $50.00 gives you a bow, two pistols, two shotguns, and two rifles (I may be wrong about that). They both, of course give you a license to hunt all animals and unlimited basic ammo. So if you really don't like the idea of the game, then maybe this will help you face the microtransactions, if you want to play, of course. Thanks for reading this review, this is my opinion of the game, I enjoy playing it, and have collected this informaton since the last time I wrote a review on this game.			"

												I played the Hunter well before it went to Steam and thoroughly enjoyed the game, even more so competitively hunting against other players I knew in multiplayer.  So many of the Steam reviews revolve around two themes:  this games isn't F2P, and it doesn't deliver instant gratification.There is no such thing as a free lunch.  I wonder how many of the negative reviewers have purchased premium time in WoT, WoW, AW, or War Thunder?  Or have spent $$$ on the Lowe in WoT?  Maybe a premium ship in WoW?  Of course you should feel entitled that they conform their payment model to other games, that bare very little simularity to what they have created. /sarcasm  This isn't an arcade game like a Cabellas special, it actually makes you have patience and some skill.  I think they know that the masses aren't going to find this title appealing, that it won't be Far Cry Primal.  If you want to participate in something unique, you have to pay the entrance fee.  The best part is that they have constantly expanded the content and listened to community feedback.  And when you start looking at the content, you start seeing that you don't need every piece of it to have fun.  You could hunt almost any animal in any reserve with a 12 gauge pump.  I personally like the classic muzzle loader.  I have a few guns and a bow, but they compliment what I like to hunt, as does my gear.  I don't have to have or expect all of the content.  The most important part is that license. $35 gets you 12 months to hunt any species.  That's not $14/month for premium time in some other games.  I think people are conveniently ignoring that they can selectively buy the content and experience they want.			"

												I won't argue the 'Free Play' ****, st*pid marketing trick doesn't mean bad game. Actually I found this game itself totally worth the $60. And there's a friendly community. But every time you play, you need to connect the official server (not Steam). After only about 1 hour's playing, I got a lot of so called 16002 error, can't play for several hours, quite frustrating. And the in-game purchase is ridiculous -I don't talk about membership, that's kind of acceptable to me- But after people already have had paid $60, why? Did anyone know what DLC is for?A 70/100 game ruined by weird ideas and inadequate servers.Not recommended at current state.----------------------------------Feb 9 2016,The infamous 16002 error was gone. This is a good sign.BUT, my steam trail-runner pack is still not here, after I paid the price ONE WEEK ago. And the only answer I got from their customer service, was that they were looking into it. Still not recommended then. /shrug			"

												What hunting game does have no animals to hunt? I got bored of walking for long distances just to be able to shoot only one damn deer. To hunt the other animals, you need a license, and licenses require some special in-game currency which also requires a lot of real money. Guess what, the license is vaild for a day, so next time you need to spend even more money! I didn't spend anything, because I know it isn't worth it.Basic equipment, like a backpack or lanterns for nighttime? Pay2WinNew rifles, advanced tech scopes or special bullets? Pay2WinClothes? Pay2WIn (come on, don't we have TF2 with its crapload of hats already?)Oh, and to get into multiplayer, you need some sort of membership. 3 months membership is like 10 euros. WTF? I can buy 2 cheap games with that money!Seriously, avoid this game.			"

The subscription you need to have is just like a lot of other niche sims like this. ( again, like iRacing).If you like to hunt in real life or just the idea of hunting. This game is for you.			"

												Trying to explore the map will result in forced returns back to your base camp. Devs tried to compensate for this small area of exploration with poor moving mechanics. Moving around is slow and annoying, because the character is out of shape, and breathes heavily every second of moving at a walking speed. There are only two speeds; slow, and slower. Shooting mechanics are just OK. Final verdict: 3.6/10			"

And got as far as the the end of the tutorial before I realized I would never actually get to do anything other than kill 1 type of animal with a single gun.You start with single bolt action rifle with 30 rounds and able to shoot Mule Deer.

												What hunting game does have no animals to hunt? I got bored of walking for long distances just to be able to shoot only one damn deer. To hunt the other animals, you need a license, and licenses require some special in-game currency which also requires a lot of real money. Guess what, the license is vaild for a day, so next time you need to spend even more money! I didn't spend anything, because I know it isn't worth it.Basic equipment, like a backpack or lanterns for nighttime? Pay2WinNew rifles, advanced tech scopes or special bullets? Pay2WinClothes? Pay2WIn (come on, don't we have TF2 with its crapload of hats already?)Oh, and to get into multiplayer, you need some sort of membership. 3 months membership is like 10 euros. WTF? I can buy 2 cheap games with that money!Seriously, avoid this game.			"

												This game has the biggest split in reviews I've seen.There's a huge paywall to really get into the game but that wall typically only comes if you like it enough to spend money on it. The free to play experience is fine to demo the game out plus signing up for an account nets you a three day membership. You won't get the full experience but you'll be able to preview the meat of the gameplay, which is what this game is all about.If you don't have a lot of free time there is no gameplay whatsoever. However, if you're patient enough to just sit back and immerse yourself for a while with the occasional distraction, you'll find the deepest hunting game out there. It's pretty much just like real hunting. You walk to a good spot or find and track signs of an animal. Then you carefully set up a shot and shoot it. There's a thrill to findind a big buck, grizzly bear, or a huge flock of fowl coming your way. Shooting it is a challenge, and pulling off a clean kill is rewarding. Adding it to your ever-growing list of kills and trophy-shots is merely the aftertaste of a good hunt.As for the pay to play element, if you like the demo but don't want to spend a ton of money then drop some cash on a basic membership, a universal gun, and some camo. Expect to spend about $30~40 dollars if you really like the experience and want to play a lot for a few months.TL;DR, if you want authentic hunting, this is it. Also much much much better with friends in multiplayer.			"

If you're wondering why I wouldn't just use another gun, it is because you HAVE to use the gun to tag rabbits.			"

												Rarely do I review a game, but I feel in this instance I must.theHunter is the best hunting sim out there. This alone demands that a certain demographic -- those not looking for a hunting arcade shooter where animals pop up every ten seconds -- take notice.Yes, it costs for a yearly license to shoot every animal in the game. And yes, there are new free animals available for hunt, rotated every two weeks. My suggestion to a new hunter just starting out would be to find what animals are free, then go after them to see if you like the game enough to pay fora  license.And yes, weapons cost money, as do callers, clothes, and everything else in the game. This is a part of what makes it a great game, in my opinion. There's a sense of ownership and challenge when you purchase a new weapon and bring it out into the field. Leveling up a weapon is actually fun when you know you've just paid for it. I've been in the game for years now and do not own every weapon in the game, nor do I need to: I've had a blast leveling up the ones I do have, and I am nowhere near to mastery with any save the pump shotgun.To trash this masterpiece because of its aggressive business model is a real shame. For my part, I am happy to continue to support the devs with my money because they're constantly adding new things.Bottom line: if you want a hunting sim, here's the best available to you.			"

												Ever since they added the ""Free Rotation"" feature, a mechanic that switches the available to hunt without a license, the game has become much more fun for players who don't own a membership. After long turmoil, the developers are making the game better. I do want to note that to get other items THEY ARE NOT FREE. You still have to buy em$ and there's no way of earning it. Yet.Anyways, my review of the game is yes, it's a very patience demanding game. Walking on trails through the lush forests of the reserves takes a while, but with the right equipment you can radically change your experience. I normally use some kind of bow for hunting but I also bought a nice .308 rifle for longer ranges and bigger game, I.E. Moose or bear. The bows are permitted to hunt EVERYTHING. I see these reviews down here are mostly negative but they have changed the game so it can be more fun. Give it another chance. For a number rating of 1-10... I give it a 7/10 mostly for the very demanding proccesing power.			"

												I cant explain how much i love this game. When you fisrt start you may think that the game is too slow paced and its boring, but dont give up just yet. The longer you play the better you will get, the more animals you will kill, and the more fun you will have. the only thing i dont like about this is the fact that in order to hunt everything you have to pay a minimum of $10.00. But once you buy the membership you will be able to hunt anything you want instead of the free animals that you get without paying and the more in game money you buy the more stuff you can get in game therefore maikng it more fun!

The game itself is very pretty, it really feels like your on the spot hunting wild game. Now note this is a HUNTING game it takes paitence to play this game so if you dont have it dont think even think about downloading it. The animals you encounter are really well done, from the calls to they way they act, even there tracts look good. the devs are allways updating the game and listening to the players and community.

												The only hunting simulator worth playing out there at the moment!The Hunter couples gorgeous graphics and immersive sound design to create vast environments that feel real when you step into them, something that other hunting games out there just don’t replicate. Recent hunting games have been shoe-horning you down corridors while Ibex and Lions jump out onto your shotgun barrel. The Hunter gives you the opportunity to experience the journey, a complete hunting scenario: Listening out for calls, tracking, and observation, not just constantly providing a slurry of beautiful beasts to bludgeon.I believe the game suffers when informing new comers. I’d recommend checking out the wiki before jumping in as there are some rules for Guest players who haven’t purchased a membership regarding what you can hunt and where. I have all confidence in the Dev team though! They are constantly active and seem to value and utilise feedback. New content is always on the horizon whether it is new gear, weapons, species or reserves to hunt. The game also boasts a strong community to hunt alongside or against in an interesting array of hunting challenges.			"

												I won't argue the 'Free Play' ****, st*pid marketing trick doesn't mean bad game. Actually I found this game itself totally worth the $60. And there's a friendly community. But every time you play, you need to connect the official server (not Steam). After only about 1 hour's playing, I got a lot of so called 16002 error, can't play for several hours, quite frustrating. And the in-game purchase is ridiculous -I don't talk about membership, that's kind of acceptable to me- But after people already have had paid $60, why? Did anyone know what DLC is for?A 70/100 game ruined by weird ideas and inadequate servers.Not recommended at current state.----------------------------------Feb 9 2016,The infamous 16002 error was gone. This is a good sign.BUT, my steam trail-runner pack is still not here, after I paid the price ONE WEEK ago. And the only answer I got from their customer service, was that they were looking into it. Still not recommended then. /shrug			"

												theHunter is one of the most enjoyable and most beautiful hunting games available at this time IMO of course. The realistic aspect is not to far extreme where you find yourself waiting a whole day to bag and tag a single animal, but at the same time not at all arcade-y where you can gun down 5 deer in a matter of seconds. The pace of this game is rather rewarding is the sense of accomplishment when it come to the hunt.The main complaint that many have is there price structure. Yes, it can get expensive purchasing all that is available for this game. In fact If I recall correctly that if you happen to buy everything all at once (not including consumables and a ammo), you are looking at about a $600 price tag.  Yes, a lot of money, but at the same time compare that to Train Simulator 2015 which holds a price tag well over double of theHunter for all of its DLC. This game should not be considered Free-To-Play, but rather Free-To-Test or simple know it as a Demo since you are only allowed to hunt 1 species of deer (Mule Deer) on 1 reserve (Loggers Point). Also some have stated this is a Pay-To-Win game. Far from it IMO. Buying the ingame equipment and such doesnt make you a better hunter than everyone else. You just have more options to hunt and hunt with. Purchasing items in this game is like buying DLC for any other game in the long run. You do get to keep them forever minus consumables, but those can even be purchased with the ingame currency, gm$ which are earned buy completing ingame missions.At this current time, theHunter is being offered on the Steam Holiday Sale (2014) for 20% off on bundles.  If you have any  form of interest and are willing to support a game that actually works vs. the latest and greatest AAA titles that havent been, now would be a great time to purchase. The largest bundle is currently going for 39.99.  This includes an annual membership that alone cost 35 dollars during the normal time of the year, but also included in this bundle is $85 worth of gear that will allow you to hunt everything and anything under the sun within this game.  Even when the sale lets up, a price tag of 49.99 is not bad. $35 for the annual and $15  for the additional $85 worth of gear.All and all, I recommend this game to those that enjoy a good hunt and are will to invest a little money (the bundle) into it as you would any other game title that isnt listed as Free-To-Play. After all... games dont make themselves.			"

												Ok, I don't write reviews very often but I felt the need to on this game.I was skeptical about theHunter at first due to the overwhelming number of negative reviews on Steam. I weighed it out and thought ""well, it's free"", so I wasn't out anything by giving it a shot...and I'm glad I did.I like hunting. In real life, I love hunting. Unfortunately, I can only do so certain times in the year...and this game fills that void. This isn't a ""game"" in a traditional sense, it is practically a hunting simulator and it is done so well.The negative reviews all come from people who hate micro-transactions and expect completely free things. The game itself is free. You can hunt whitetail deer, european rabbits, and pheasant any time, along with two other animals which are selected/rotate on a weekly basis. Right now it's black bear and bison I think. If you like the free stuff, you can pay for the game by buying a membership, or different guns, or licenses...whatever floats your boat. I personally bought the Trailrunner membership for $49.99 because I like hunting and this game is well made. I normally spend $50 or so on any other game I play, I have absolutely no problem spending the same for something I truly enjoy. It nets me a year of hunting any animal, plus all sorts of other goodies like weapons, outfits, treestands, etc. To summarize: This is not a game for just anyone, and it's definitely not fast-paced. It's hunting. But it doesn't deserve negative reviews based solely on how the developers have chosen to take their profit from it. The game is free. The REAL game is going to cost you a bit if you so choose.			"

												I personaly think that this is an exelent game.  Ok, you can't run around hoping you'll find something too shoot at, but that isn't hunting.  You have to walk to a spot, lure the animal too you wait untill you can get a good shot and then shoot.  Or you can follow the tracks of animals and shoot them that way. So if you are looking for a quick action shooter, keep looking, this requeres patience.  And yes you do need a licence for a lot off stuf, but i personaly think you can have fun with the things you can hunt without a licence.  And yes you need real money to get good equipment, but I walked with the basic gear around for an hour and i already got 3 confirmed kills, and 2 other animals that i've hit, but not killed.  So over all i think its worth playing			"

												Awesome game, but you can only hunt Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits for free. The rest you have to buy with any kind of membership.But I do think that the membership price is worth it. It's $10 for 3 months of membership, and you're able to hunt ANY animals. But, if you don't want membership and there is only one other animal you want to hunt, you can buy any animal licenses at the store.So far, my Hunter Score is 45.			"

												Rarely do I review a game, but I feel in this instance I must.theHunter is the best hunting sim out there. This alone demands that a certain demographic -- those not looking for a hunting arcade shooter where animals pop up every ten seconds -- take notice.Yes, it costs for a yearly license to shoot every animal in the game. And yes, there are new free animals available for hunt, rotated every two weeks. My suggestion to a new hunter just starting out would be to find what animals are free, then go after them to see if you like the game enough to pay fora  license.And yes, weapons cost money, as do callers, clothes, and everything else in the game. This is a part of what makes it a great game, in my opinion. There's a sense of ownership and challenge when you purchase a new weapon and bring it out into the field. Leveling up a weapon is actually fun when you know you've just paid for it. I've been in the game for years now and do not own every weapon in the game, nor do I need to: I've had a blast leveling up the ones I do have, and I am nowhere near to mastery with any save the pump shotgun.To trash this masterpiece because of its aggressive business model is a real shame. For my part, I am happy to continue to support the devs with my money because they're constantly adding new things.Bottom line: if you want a hunting sim, here's the best available to you.			"

												I cant explain how much i love this game. When you fisrt start you may think that the game is too slow paced and its boring, but dont give up just yet. The longer you play the better you will get, the more animals you will kill, and the more fun you will have. the only thing i dont like about this is the fact that in order to hunt everything you have to pay a minimum of $10.00. But once you buy the membership you will be able to hunt anything you want instead of the free animals that you get without paying and the more in game money you buy the more stuff you can get in game therefore maikng it more fun!

												So this looked halarious, so I started up my account, HUNTDAD69 and spent about 45 minutes looking at loose fecal matter laying around in the grass before a pheasant flew by!

												What hunting game does have no animals to hunt? I got bored of walking for long distances just to be able to shoot only one damn deer. To hunt the other animals, you need a license, and licenses require some special in-game currency which also requires a lot of real money. Guess what, the license is vaild for a day, so next time you need to spend even more money! I didn't spend anything, because I know it isn't worth it.Basic equipment, like a backpack or lanterns for nighttime? Pay2WinNew rifles, advanced tech scopes or special bullets? Pay2WinClothes? Pay2WIn (come on, don't we have TF2 with its crapload of hats already?)Oh, and to get into multiplayer, you need some sort of membership. 3 months membership is like 10 euros. WTF? I can buy 2 cheap games with that money!Seriously, avoid this game.			"

												Well I'm pretty sure I played this game before, the first map looked very familiar, which was very discouraging as the last time I saw no animals at all.This time I played the tutorials that weren't there before and they went well. Then I went off to try and hunt.Found a bunch of deer, yet every shot I took my gun lowered and I got a message saying I have no license.After a bit of investigating I found out all about the supposed licensing. The ""free"" part consists of 1 type of deer and a type of bird.Went and looked further and decided I'll try the $10US membership so I got all licenses.After that I went back and things went down hill. Spent quite a few hours playing and the more time went by the less animals I found. Some times I'd be following a track and suddenly the ""huntermate"" would turn me around or loop over the previously found track. Other time the track I was looking for wasn't actually in the direction I was pointed and other times it'd just go cold out of nowhere. Some ""mate"" that is.On the way back to the camp I see a turkey out of nowhere and so shoot it, to which I get told off for an ""unpermitted hit"" for using the wrong ammo. So I leave and go to the shop to find all the ammo costs more real money along with every other item.Going to uninstall this, and if I could I'd have my $10 back too.Steam should also remove the ""free to play tag"" since 99% isn't free.

												So, I'm back, and this time, an in-depth (not really) review of thehunter. So, yes I know, microtransactions suck, but even if you pay the $15.00 fee for a license(3 months, I believe), you WILL enjoy this game. I happen to find the game really fun. I have decided to buy the $50.00 membership (12 months). The $15.00 and both, the $50.00 plan, come with weapons. The $15.00 comes with a little bit of stuff, but not a load. The $50.00 gives you a bow, two pistols, two shotguns, and two rifles (I may be wrong about that). They both, of course give you a license to hunt all animals and unlimited basic ammo. So if you really don't like the idea of the game, then maybe this will help you face the microtransactions, if you want to play, of course. Thanks for reading this review, this is my opinion of the game, I enjoy playing it, and have collected this informaton since the last time I wrote a review on this game.			"

												So I have played a fair deal, the game is good, Its Free to hunt on the base map for MULE deer and I guess Rabbits? I read someone elses post I guess they changed it to Whitetail, Thats pretty cool. Whitetail are one more then one map so THAT really opens the game up to none paying because now you can hunt other maps. Its honestly just better to pay the 50 bucks get the year sub and all the gear that comes with it. The gear and the year pass has everything to get you out and doing. The game makes you work for the kill at times so if you just want to shoot and kill then you wont enjoy.Play free understand its limited to those animals, IF you like it spend 50. Games dont update and pay for themselves.			"

												No the full game isn't free. But it's worth what they ask for it, they shouldn't have advertised it on steam as F2P I believe, it's not a horrible model it's just that people are raging about it and over reacting. Most of the folks leaving those negative reviews are prob DayZ players or kiddo's with the attention span of a fly. Try it out, hunt the free stuff and if you like it buy a membership it's only like $15 and that gives you more guns and everything. Anyway, this game got a bad rep on steam that it didn't deserve.

												The best hunting game I've ever played, so addicting, put $40 into this game and you won't regret it, you just need patience and you can get some monster animals. I have over 800 hours into this game and plan on putting in way more, and way more money, 10/10 would recommend if you are not a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game (From the footage I have seen) looks like an amazing open-world F2P Hunting Simulator Shooter Friend game. Unfortunately, the price of admission seems to be one of uncorteous descent. Making an account is a hassle, and trying the website to make one is even more difficult, for sometimes the page doesn't even load. Nicknames are impossible. From current reviews, I have seen that there is a new Developer to replace the other, and now you have to spend at least $200 in order to feel like you have a full hunting experience. Truly, if this game became a bit less of a pain to begin playing, I would try to play this amazing looking game myself.			"

												This game is a great game don't get me wrong, but like everyone with a rational brain would notice that everything cost money in that game under the exception that you do not do any of the rediculous tasks that seem nearly impossible to do. Or doing surveys that don't tend to work half of the time. If anything they could have priced it at $30 and they would still make a large amount of money anyway. Make money in game so it feels like you earned it instead of accidentally buying the gun you don't like so you buy a different one and never se it again. One of the ""Premium Rifles"" costs 1000gm$ which is $10. That is utterly rediculous, not a person in their right mind would ever think of wasting $10 on one rifle you may or may not even like. But there are always those people that are still will to buy an animated weapon for that much. Not everyone is swimming in money you know. Fix the game please and I can just about guarantee that there will be a massive jump in profit and players to hunt with.			"

												God awful. The community is awful. The whole ""free to play"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It took me three times to even get into a server where there wasnt some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ saying,""oh you need to be a member to hunt here"" and then get kicked. After the third try, i get in, i track some deer tracks all the way to this river. The river is full of deer and other kinds of wildlife, so I get a little bit excited, scope in and have a perfect shot at the heart of a deer. I press the LMB and nothing happens; a second later a context box pops into the upper lefthand corner saying i need a license to hunt this animal. It was a white-tailed deer. arguably the most hunted animal, atleast where i am from, but no i still need a license for it. so then i go into singleplayer thinking hey theyll probably only have animals i can hunt in here. Wrong! i spent hours looking. Found three different species, and none of them were species i could hunt. Terrible! DO NOT WASTE THE SPACE AND DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT PAYING FOR THIS NONSENSE!			"

												WHAT IS THE HUNTER?The hunter is a simulation game based on real life hunting, it requires patience and it's time consuming but rewarding in the end. there is something about that feeling of stalking your pray knowing that one simple sound may spooke the price buck, but if your quiet and careful a well place shot to a vital organ may kill it instantly and you go home with a trophy or you can miss and track him back again all depends how you aproach the sitation.The world is expansive, lot of walking but fear not aoutowalk option is availive!!, there are a big number of different variaty of animals from a simple mule deer to white tail,brown bears,moose,canadian goose among many others, not to mention weapons like hunting rifles (of course), bows, shotguns, revolvers, special rifles, as well as clothing and hunting tools. truly in an immersice world with a lot in your hands to choose and make your simulation a better experience.IS IT FREE TO PLAY OR PAY TO WIN?The game is free to play with its restrictions, currently you can can hunt two animals for free, mule deers and rabbits (male & female), you can roam and explore any map but the animals are restiricted to a membership or hunting permit found at this link.http://www.thehunter.com/#bank/membershipsplease read carefully the perks of each memberships and permits before proceeding to purchase. Ladies and genteleman it is important to consider the efforert of the developers and the fact that they need to gain something out of this,j ust as if you would invent something would you give it fully for free??...the answer is no! lets not be naive nor insult our inteligence, if you like this game support the developers. they are not forcing you to buy it it's all up to you., you want to spend 10 dollars or euros or 50 or more it's up tp you, in the end you make your experience, you decide what to buy. if you dont like the game dont ruin the experience for others just because you dont like the transaction system, act as you would like others to act towards you and put yourself in the developers and creators shoes before saying anything.IS IT WORTH INCESTING IN THE GAME OR PLAYING IT?yes!, if you agree, like this kind of games and can most importantly run this game then it's worth it, but i suggest you give it a try first, play it a couple of days and see if you dont get bored with the basic free membership, if you then really like it and want to expand your hunting experience, please support the developers and most importantly enjoy the game.Thanks everyone for taking the time to read this review i hope this helps in making a better hunter out of you, see you on the reserves lol.

												-Free to play no, very restricted demo yes. On the Loggers Point reserve you can hunt mule deer and rabbits but only get a gun for the rabbits.-Pay to win no, typical subscription game yes, and at around $3.33 a month and continuous updates I see this as a great value.-Extra equipment too costly no, able to purchase a whole crap tonne of mini expansions yes. When I first started I bought the entry level bundle for $15 and $10 worth of in game money. I got exactly what I wanted to hunt with for $5 less than the medium bundle. It's not like you go to your sporting goods store and buy all their equipment and guns, the same goes here. I almost feel like buying equipment in this game is like buying tabletop wargaming minis. You end up choosy and the choices have meaningful merit.-The Havok engine is outstanding in 3d (fallout, Skyrim etc). Where most games can hinder you playing in 3d I have a hard time playing this without using it.The wiki, be sure to look up permitted ammo typeshttp://www.thehunterwiki.com/index.php?title=Main_PageThe.de one which seems more focused on mechanics (you may need to translate the page)http://de.thehunterwiki.com/index.php?title=Hauptseite "

												Hello everybody.After playing only 15 minutes of this game, i noticed that there are solid graphics and good overall performance.But buuuuuuuut.Do no think this is a free game, I mean how dare these people claim that this is a free game 50 ... sorry i mean about 80% of this game is only accesable through paying a susbtantial amount of money. And i can already see that the prices on the in game store are ""insane"". I definetly do not recommend this game to somebody who likes chill hunting and has all the equipment he wants, and just one more fact. the controls are really bad, the mouse speed is really bad in game, and the pre-game interface just seems a bit messy			"

												Pay £6.99 for basic membership, pay £10 for guns to hunt the animals that you need a membership for, pay £10 to get callers and lures for the animals that you need a membership for, pay £5 for camo to hide from the animals that you need a membership for. This game is so good yet so badly thought out, this IS NOT free to play, it is free to download.But if you want to play for free you can fill in 100s of surveys to get a hat or something.11/10 would give e-mail to albanian mafia to get a fake duck.

												Uninstalled this game after about an hour. It's pay 2 win, you can kill litterally no animal (ok, 1 animal) without buying a new gun for real money. Also, you can't find♥♥♥♥♥♥in the forest. I'm assuming that was the purpouse, that the life of a hunter is about waiting for a deer to show up, but this doesn't do that... Oh, that's maybe because of the horrbile A.I. The animals can see you through everything and instantly run away. Just horrible game. Play it, if you just want to relax, but do NOT invest any money.

												The biggest problem in this game is all the noobs that joins the game and dont understand that they cant run around and shoot into the air and think they will find a animal. You gotta wait, wait and wait even more or this game wouldnt be any realistic at all. I'm just happy that you need licens or membership to hunt all animals becuase otherwise all noobs would ruin for everyone that are patient enough and understands the game. If you got all the weapons and licens in the game from the beginning it would make the game very unrealstic. A more realistic hunting game then Thehunter dosent exist. Sadly there is not too many hunting games that have good graphics and are realistic out there. I would recommend this game to someone that dosent have anything against being patient and spending some money.			"

You have to buy licenses, guns, tents, even your backpack.. It's disgusting, honestly.

												I won't argue the 'Free Play' ****, st*pid marketing trick doesn't mean bad game. Actually I found this game itself totally worth the $60. And there's a friendly community. But every time you play, you need to connect the official server (not Steam). After only about 1 hour's playing, I got a lot of so called 16002 error, can't play for several hours, quite frustrating. And the in-game purchase is ridiculous -I don't talk about membership, that's kind of acceptable to me- But after people already have had paid $60, why? Did anyone know what DLC is for?A 70/100 game ruined by weird ideas and inadequate servers.Not recommended at current state.----------------------------------Feb 9 2016,The infamous 16002 error was gone. This is a good sign.BUT, my steam trail-runner pack is still not here, after I paid the price ONE WEEK ago. And the only answer I got from their customer service, was that they were looking into it.

												Although you do need to invest some money to get the most enjoyment out of this game as you can, it is definitely worth it. As an avid hunter for over ten years now, I never thought I would find a video game that could come close to what the great outdoors are like. With each and every update, TheHunter inches closer and closer to this mark - actually it hit that mark a long time ago and just gets closer towards absolute perfection.The only thing a person really needs to buy is a weapon, or two, or ten...or thirty. Just so you have the ability to hunt every animal, you need compatible weapons. If you do missions and grind a bit, you can do this completely Free to Play - but it can be discouraging and seeing a large or trophy animal (or even a rare variant) appear before you and knowing you cannot take that trophy due to license restrictions would be disheartening - so really the only money anyone should spend would be on a subscription (which for a year is well-priced in my opinion, especially if you do the Trailblazer pack that comes with plenty of weapons and camouflage).At this point it just becomes a game you paid once for and it's like you're buying DLC if you really like it. You have the weapons and gear permanently, and if you play that year you purchased you should have enough GM$ to renew licenses and ammunition.On top of everything, it's MULTIPLAYER. Single lobbies do exist, but being able to hunt with a friend and scout together or compete for the largest trophy, it's just loads of fun. Even counting down from 3-1 so you both can take down trophies simultanaeously...it's just great overall.			"

For all the people out there that complain about the game being too expensive, the f2p side of the game is basically a demo to see if you enjoy the game. If you like it, you can buy the 15$ membership which gives you all the basic essentials needed to play the game. The game needs money to survive and become more developed, it's not like the game could be successful if no one bought anything and everything was free. I think the 15$ is well worth, considering you can hunt everything and they give you everything you need to hunt everything. But, thats just my opinion. Well developed and updated game, 9.5/10 Scary as ♥♥♥♥ when charged by a bear.			"

												I was really looking forward to this game, having played Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2010, and several other hunting games. The fact that this game  has expansive open worlds (Reserves) and game tracking/baiting was also a draw, until I found that I'd have to pay through the nose to get any enjoyment out of the game!In the end I decided it made more sense to spend the money on ""Real ammo"" and go out hunting for real, and I see a lot more animals in the ""Real"" backwoods too!My advice save your money for hunting season, it's cheaper!

												The biggest problem in this game is all the noobs that joins the game and dont understand that they cant run around and shoot into the air and think they will find a animal. You gotta wait, wait and wait even more or this game wouldnt be any realistic at all. I'm just happy that you need licens or membership to hunt all animals becuase otherwise all noobs would ruin for everyone that are patient enough and understands the game. If you got all the weapons and licens in the game from the beginning it would make the game very unrealstic. A more realistic hunting game then Thehunter dosent exist. Sadly there is not too many hunting games that have good graphics and are realistic out there. I would recommend this game to someone that dosent have anything against being patient and spending some money.			"

												Before you start reading the reviews of people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about having to have a license please read this. This game is actually really good, yes you neeed a license to enjoy the games full experince. There are tons of weapons, equipment and clothing to choose from. The game itself is very pretty, it really feels like your on the spot hunting wild game. Now note this is a HUNTING game it takes paitence to play this game so if you dont have it dont think even think about downloading it. The animals you encounter are really well done, from the calls to they way they act, even there tracts look good. the devs are allways updating the game and listening to the players and community. I beleave this is truly one of the best hunting games I have ever played. So if you have some extra money go ahead and get it.			"

												This is a great game! I walked around for 1241048015 hours and found a rabbit, I pulled out my gun and tried to shoot it, A pop-up said I need a license to shoot it. I walked around for another 1241048015 hours and found a deer, I tried to shoot it, but a pop-up said I needed a license to shoot it.  I walked around for even another 1241048015 hours and found a bear. I tried to shoot it, but a pop-up said I needed a license to shoot it. 420/10 - IGN would uninstall again.Epilogue: After thinking for about 16582164581 years, I finally decided to buy a license and a .22. I enjoyed it because I could actually do the point of the game. The next day I went on my computer to play this dumb game and I found a deer. It only took 1241048014 hours this time.

												Edit:alright lets write a brand new review, alright so first off people complain about not being able to hunt without paying, in real life you need to pay for a license to hunt in the first place, the money you spend goes toward to keeping the game alive. 10 dollars to hunt for 3 months is not that much, really it isnt, you can pay a lot less in this game to hunt than in real life.[hunting gear, including guns, ammo and blinds and so on in real life will be in the thousands, so really 10 bucks isnt that much.]			"

												I personaly think that this is an exelent game.  Ok, you can't run around hoping you'll find something too shoot at, but that isn't hunting.  You have to walk to a spot, lure the animal too you wait untill you can get a good shot and then shoot.  Or you can follow the tracks of animals and shoot them that way. So if you are looking for a quick action shooter, keep looking, this requeres patience.  And yes you do need a licence for a lot off stuf, but i personaly think you can have fun with the things you can hunt without a licence.  And yes you need real money to get good equipment, but I walked with the basic gear around for an hour and i already got 3 confirmed kills, and 2 other animals that i've hit, but not killed.  So over all i think its worth playing			"

												I actually really like this game, I play it with friends and we play it a lot. For all the people out there that complain about the game being too expensive, the f2p side of the game is basically a demo to see if you enjoy the game. If you like it, you can buy the 15$ membership which gives you all the basic essentials needed to play the game. The game needs money to survive and become more developed, it's not like the game could be successful if no one bought anything and everything was free. I think the 15$ is well worth, considering you can hunt everything and they give you everything you need to hunt everything. But, thats just my opinion. Well developed and updated game, 9.5/10 Scary as ♥♥♥♥ when charged by a bear.			"

												If you're happy blissfully walking about in a medium, well done graphics environment, and plan on hunting only the basic 3 (+2) animals (+2 seem to be on a weekly rotation, i.e. this week Turkey and Red Deer? are free), then definitely give it a go.The paid hunting licenses aren't that distasteful really as the base game is free.  The whole game is ""stalk and shoot and claim"", in its base form.  Doesn't matter what animal you're hunting, the basic gameplay seems the same.The rest of the paid gear and equipment appear to only make the end results happen quicker.  Having to buy ammunition for any bought weapons is a shame; although, for the base weapons, the ammunition is unlimited.It'll pass many hours if this is your thing, for free; if you get bored, some small cost purchases and you have weapons for life, and temporary licenses to keep it interesting.Free: 10/10Paid: 7/10 (because of continued license renewals, equipment depletion, and non-standard ammo purchases)			"

												I was really looking forward to this game, having played Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2010, and several other hunting games. The fact that this game  has expansive open worlds (Reserves) and game tracking/baiting was also a draw, until I found that I'd have to pay through the nose to get any enjoyment out of the game!In the end I decided it made more sense to spend the money on ""Real ammo"" and go out hunting for real, and I see a lot more animals in the ""Real"" backwoods too!My advice save your money for hunting season, it's cheaper!

												theHunter is, well, a hunting game. Not much more can be said, as the Free to Play aspect is completely blown out of the ratio quickly. If you ever decide to play this, though I don't recommend, you will soon notice that you can kill nothing without paying for an in game liscense. What's worse? The liscenses are seperate. You need a liscense designated to each animal in the game to be able to kill everything you see in the wilderness like a maniac. This game is not F2P, but if you enjoy paying hundreds of dollars to even play this game, then this is the gem for you. Other than the main point of the game, hunting, the game is graphically beautiful and sounds amazing as well, but the gameplay lacks when you are constantly pumping money into the devs.			"

Its all subscription based...    I would easily pay 60 bucks for this game if i didnt have to have a subscription.ive known a lot of players who pay for 3 months and never return to the game because it just doesnt offer enough to warrent a subcription.

												I find this game to be very enjoyable. It's quite a realistic experience, has a wide variety of firearms and bows to choose from, quite a number of different animals you can hunt, and seems they are adding weapons/animals regularly. Now if you play this for free, without spending money, you will at best be able to unlock only 2 firearms; the .243 single shot that you start with, then a less-than-prestine single shot shotgun which I call 'trusty rusty' because although it's in rough shape, I still find it to be effective enough for hunting. In fact with a shotgun, you can hunt literally any animal provided you have the license to do so and you use the proper ammo (bird shot/buck shot/slug). Also, if you don't spend money, you can only hunt mule deer starting out, then if you do enough missions and get about 6300 gm$, then you can buy the shotgun which will allow you to hunt rabbits as well because you can't do so with .243. From there, continue doing missions, and if you collect enough gm$, you can buy a license to hunt another animal.To put it simply; if you don't spend money, you will only be able to use up to 2 firearms, and it will be VERY labour intensive and time consuming to earn your way up to hunting anything but mule deer or cottontail rabbits. If you do EXCEEDINGLY well in competition hunts, you will be able to earn em$ which otherwise you can only buy with real money. It is THIS money that the vast majority of firearms/bows need in order to be bought, along with callers and camouflage. Personally, I've spent about $40 on the game, and I'm glad I did. I have a $15 3 month membership which allows me to hunt anything, it also gave me a pump action shotgun as well as a .357 Magnum, and the em$ I bought with the remaining $25 or so allowed me to buy a cap and ball muzzle loader, Kar98k, .22lr pistol, longbow, a couple callers, and some good camouflage that makes it harder for animals to see me in the majority of maps. Speaking of which, the maps are huge, with a variety of game to hunt in each one.This isn't a game in which you run around until you see something, then shoot it. Running will make you easy to be spotted, and will thus cause any game that sees you to scarper. There's also the issue of scent, so it pays to mind which direction the wind is going if you're getting really up close to an animal. As with real life, hunting requires patience, it requires accuracy, and it requires tracking (especially if you don't line the shot up right, simply wound the animal, and it runs off while bleeding). If you're looking for a run and gun game, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a hunting simulator, I don't think you'd be able to find a better one than this. This game also has bullet drop so mind your shots if they're 150-200m+, and also it keeps track of the weight of your loadout so it's not like you'll be heading out with 3 rifles, 30 rounds each, every caller you have, along with all the other equipment available to you lolRealism is a big deal in this game, and if that's your thing, as it has been mine for years, then you'll enjoy this thoroughly. Just keep the restrictions in mind unless you're cool with spending a few dollars. For less than $20 though, you get 3 months to hunt anything, along with a pump action shotgun which is all you really NEED to hunt literally everything (Though there are better options out there for long distance shots), and a .357 Magnum revolver which you can hunt red fox, coyote, mule deer, white tail deer, black tail deer, and I think Alpine Ibex (Basically mountain goes) as well as turkeys with. I gotta say, it's kinda fun to sneak through the woods, listening for calls, stalking up on animals as you track them, feeling your heart begin to race as you catch sight of your game, perhaps use a call to try and get it closer, line up that perfect shot, and watch as it either goes down in one hit, or hopefully just runs for a few seconds before collapsing. It's quite an intense experience, and when it goes well, gives you a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.			"

												My favorite Hunting Simulation. Its NOT CHEAP and its NOT free to play. You can however play it like a demo. You get one weapon and 2-3 animals to hunt. But to really enjoy then game you have to buy a time membership and alot of stuff from the ingame shop. Which is quite expensive. BUT: For that you get the best Hunting Sim out there. They constantly add new ""maps"" (Reserves), Animals and Guns.So if you willing to pay for it you get a lot of fun. At least if youre a patient gamer. Hunting is a lot of waiting :) If you really want to invest money in it I hardly suggest buying one of the Shotguns first. With nearly all of them you have a weapon which is allowed to hunt every animal in the game. Watch some Lets plays and read some forum posts for more Information. So i really enjoy this game and can suggest it to any Gamer interested in a Hunting Game. Have fun.			"

AN HONEST REVIEW (expand for tl;dr)It's the first hunting game I like and have gotten into. You can hunt deer, rabbit, BEAR, and you actually have to live the life by sitting and waiting, it's the real deal. They even have setups to hunt duck, they have tents and calls along with GPS. It's the only decent hunting game I've played on steam, and everyone's whining about the business model. Look, In games like WoW you pay $15 a month just to be able to play. In this, you pay basically that for three whole months, not just one. Not to mention, you don't really have to pay. You can earn credit in-game to get a license. Everyone's complaining about the licenses as if they want every little thing to be freely fed to them. Wake-up call: Nothing in life is free. There are too many negative reviews based on people's opinion on the fact that you can't immediately hunt everything for free, and not nearly enough points about any actual problem with the game itself. How do you expect them to develop a game if everything is free? So it seems the game's rating has been tarnished by buttmad kids whining about licenses, some reviews are probably even jokes. It's a free game, just try it for yourself, see if you like how it plays, and progress. I promise the fee for a license isn't going to kill you, you spend more than that on breakfast everyday probably. Sorry for the rant, here's a TL;DRGoodVarious animals to hunt, with variations in guns and ammo to useMultiple maps to walk through, not restricted to only ever one areaSocial aspects (taking trophy shots, hunting in a party, competing)Updates now, and in the future giving us new animals, weapons, etcBadI had audio issues after killing some animals, high pitched screeches... *shudder*...Depending on who you hunt with, it can make or break your time spent.Micro-transactions**ok so yes, I'm ok with the whole license thing, you need to work for a license to get better animals to get more points and so on, but there are so many transactions for stuff like weapons, tents, clothing and calls and so on... But it IS their business model and how they make money, and it's a free game that actually works in the first place so. I'm willing to overlook it really, considering most of it is extra or you could earn enough to get what you need anyway. I hope we get more forgiving and sensible players in the future to balance out the mostly negative review it currently stands with, because I honestly don't think it deserves that despite anything bad I have to say about this game.

												After playing this game alot, i have decided to make a true review of this game. At the time of writing this, i have played a total of 489 hours (this game wasnt always on steam, so i have played it before it were), so my word can be trusted.To start things off, this game, theHunter, is aimed to be a hunting simulator. Although there are a few arcade-like functions, this game is mostly what it aims to be. Some people call this a ""Pay-to-Win"" game, but i will tell why it is not in a few seconds (or minutes, depending on your reading speed). This game offers alot of variety to paid users. If you buy, lets say, the Trailrunner membership (often best for thoose who are new and needs a great start), contains alot of usefull items. It gives you a few very usefull weapons, one camo set wich is very good against deer, license to hunt all species (there are many) for a year, diverce items and equipment. The weapons you recieve is mostly made up of: .300 Bolt Action rifle, .270 Bolt Action rifle, Compound Bow ""Snakebite"" (most powerfull compound bow, although not most powerfull bow after all) and the .30-06 Lever Action rifle. Theese are not all weapons, but they allow you to hunt almost all species in all the reserves. This game offers alot of different ways to track, spot, stalk and kill prey. You can use lures to attract most species to get them closer to you so you can kill them with a bow, a shotgun, a pistol, or you can use the .300 with a 3-9x scope to pick them off at range. A wide variety of weapons are available to be purchased ranging from a .22LR air rifle to take down small bird and rabbits, to the 9.3x62mm Anschütz rifle and shotguns using slug ammunition to take down the biggest of bear and moose. To buy theese weapons, you need an in-game currency called em$. This currency can be gained in a number of ways: Purchasing it for real money and earning it from competitions and certain offers. The easiest way is to purchase. You can also purchase tents to spawn in, treestands/blinds/tripods to sit in to take down prey without it noticing you, and other different tools that may aid you during hunts. Free users only start with the .243 Bolt Action rifle. A weak weapon, but still capable of taking down the most basic free-to-play animal: the Mule Deer. Although Mule Deer is not the only free-to-play animal, it is the only one you may take down using the .243 rifle. There are a huge number off different species, all with their own unique behaviour and pelt characteristics. This game cannot be a ""Pay-to-Win"" game, as there is no real true goal. Its like a open world sandbox, although with the characteristics of hunting. This game can never be completed fully, wich is why you can never win. I will not keep writing this huge text so much more, as this would take alot of time.Pros:-Fun and interesting gameplay.-Get to have a slight feel to hunt animals.-Feeling the adrenaline rush when you spot that Roe Buck with thoose huge antlers.-Many different gameplay mechanics to track, spot, stalk and kill your prey.-Fairly realistic.-Free to play.Cons:-Fairly expensive if you want to get the most out of the game, although not as expensive as titles like World of Warcraft.-Still a few interesting (although harmless) bugs and glitches.-Animal behaviour could be better.-Ballistics could be better.-Weapon mechanics could be better.-In-game skills is very, VERY, time consuming to level up.Conclusion: A great game that i would recomment people to try out. Start as a free-to-play, and if you feel this game is for you, get a membership. Get serious in playing. This game is not for everyone, so i cannot promise any user to be satisfied. I am personally in love with this game, and have inspired me to enter high school with a education line in ""Hunting & Wildlife Preservation"". Devs are also happy to assist on their social networks. I cannot be more happy with this product, and i hope you will find this review of use. Also i cannot thank the devs behind this game enough, it has given me litteratly days of fun in total. Give the game a try, atleast it begins as free-to-play. Thanks to GunninGamerz for letting me post his beginner tutorial, you can watch it  here  "

												I have played this game for a about 2 years now (almost exclusively outside steam). I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.General characteristics of the game:The Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt. Downloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards.If you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun. If you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy. Pros:- There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] )- There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old) - Very nice reserves- Good graphics- Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters- It's challenging- It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it- Frequent updates- Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!)- Many great people in the community- A very active forum, where all your questions can be answeredCons:- It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time)- Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours- It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear- Very limited options for character customisationCheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter) "

												Besides the fact that the game launcher doesnt allow you to purchase a membership from within the launcher itself (some or other error most people get - go onto their website and you can buy memberships, em$ etc), its a fun game to play - with friends!Sure, the single player hunts are rewarding, but there is nothing better than running around with a trusted friend while you try play pin the .300 on the bear!Also, and this nearly turned my review from a positive to a negative, when the launcher tells you that you need to update in order to play, never assume it will just be as easy as -close game-->press [play] in steam--> watch update. I have tried a few things, none have worked. Not sure if they are just slow to push their updates to steam after telling the launcher not to let anyone play, or if their launcher code is just not that well written.. who knows.. If you want a free-to-play game that you will need to spend between $30 and $50 to enjoy, then this is the game for you!If you are still reading, here are some pros and cons:PROS]- Its fun with friends ]- Ballistics work fairly ok]- Tracking animals is frustrating at times, but rewarding when you get the basics right]- Wide variety of game to hunt]- Visuals are beautiful!CONS]- Their business model is blatant. $5 will get you 500em$. In order to buy a tent (spawn point + inventory) you will need to buy 1000em$ as the tents start at 550em$. What can you do with the remaining 450em$? Not much worth mentioning. Maybe a lure or two. ]- The weapons do not have a ""this is how far the gun potetially shoots"" info section. Would help a little. ]- Bugs in the launcher]- No way to change the view distance. Its slightly annoying when you see something move, sight down the scope and see massive grass covering where the animal was. Personal issue: I run a Titan X, let me throw my view distance through the roof. The game runs between 140 and 190 fps with everything maxed (steady 120 - 138fps in heavy woodland and forest) , i wouldnt mind more visual rendering options to make better use of my hardware.			"

												The game is free to play, as it says...but the amount of money you need to use to really play it should just be a priced game. It takes for ever to find an animal and even harder to find one you can shoot. Yes...you have to pay irl money for licenses. I have never been more bored playing this game			"

												ok sure its been a while but so far nothings changed. i have reached my ""quota"" of 24 hours. and i will say i stand by the aspect of the free to play. and in this game the more i saw its a cash grab. items that you pay for with real bucks (bu dum bish ha ha) will be deleted if used a too much. Like a pick in minecraft.(example) so spend five bucks to get somthing a little later you will need to again. or the liscenes (sorry for spelling errors) will give you a day a week or so and is VERY pricey for a free to play. i am really a sucker for hunting games and survial games (dont starve i am scared of my 700+ hours) but this just has a huge pay wall that unless you like playing this for 3000 hours you are not going to get past.i say not a good game but the first few hours were fun adn so were the first three deer kills i had. i would say 10 to 20 hours and maybe once in a while game but other then that dont fall into the cash loop, its just not worth it.

												Bottomline Upfront:  Its worth dropping some coin to get a membership starter pack.  This is the game for you if enjoy first person shooters, but need something laid back to play after work to unwind on, prior to going to bed and getting up early the next morning.  Absolutely gorgeous, runs on a wide range of machines.  Pacing is excellent for what it is.  The least arcadey of the hunting simulators, but certainly one of the most polished.  Note: If you do see my low hours, that's a bit deceptive... I've put many more hours on it prior to it going on Steam, and only recently crossed it into my Steam account.Lastly... for those that criticize the game for being deceptively marketed as ""free-to-play"", I say ""nuts!""  If you're going to be critical towards a single game, you're going after the wrong target.  The whole industry should move away from the term ""free to play"" because nothing is free... to include the player's time as well as the player's private information.  Free-to-play these days is too often synonymous with getting a fully loaded game that you & the developer are expecting the die-hards to drop enough cash to cover the expense of making and maintaining it.  Nothing wrong with that... that's a viable model for many games, but that is not ""free"" either.  Let's be clear.			"

												My favorite Hunting Simulation. Its NOT CHEAP and its NOT free to play. You can however play it like a demo. You get one weapon and 2-3 animals to hunt. But to really enjoy then game you have to buy a time membership and alot of stuff from the ingame shop. Which is quite expensive. BUT: For that you get the best Hunting Sim out there. They constantly add new ""maps"" (Reserves), Animals and Guns.So if you willing to pay for it you get a lot of fun. At least if youre a patient gamer. Hunting is a lot of waiting :) If you really want to invest money in it I hardly suggest buying one of the Shotguns first. With nearly all of them you have a weapon which is allowed to hunt every animal in the game. Watch some Lets plays and read some forum posts for more Information. So i really enjoy this game and can suggest it to any Gamer interested in a Hunting Game. Have fun.			"

												This game is very good, it has decent graphics and has free roam multiplayer hunting, wich is a cool idea. But you are basically forced to buy a subscription if you want to even have an average experiance. the prices are probably about the same as you would pay to get a REAL hunting license. You are limited to one gun, two types of animals to hunt, and you cannot host games. but if your okay with that then i do recomend this game... i just hope that you make a reasonable pay.			"

Try it for free, like it and play.It's subscription based because it's played on official hosted servers, and because they constantly put out new content. You don't have to pay for expansions on top of subscriptions like WoW or other MMOs. Just 35 bucks and you get all sorts of online features.

												It is absolutely horrible. You start off with an iron sighted rifle with only 10 rounds, then you must buy more ammo and if you want a new gun you must buy it. Maybe you want to hunt a different animal, well, they only provide small game and white tailed deer as free to hunt animals. Meaning you must pay to hunt elk, bears, etc. Speaking of which you must PAY MONEY to host MULTIPLAYER MATCHES.In conclusion avalanche studios and exspansive worlds really arent lying when they say its the ultimate hunting experience. It would probably be more cheaper, fun, and less complicated to actually go hunting.			"

												The graphics and the way you hunt is very realistic, one can enjoy that. But as for the hunting, you're entitlted to hunt one type of Deer unless you're willing to spend real life cash on hunting ""licenese"" to expand your gameplay. That also goes for weapons, outfits, items. That all takes real life cash, a pity.. this game could have been great if you weren't restricted to one deer type and one gun.			"

												:Positive: Amazing game! What I have been looking for a hunting game is map size, smart AI, sounds, bows, crossbow, rifles, shotguns, pistols and this game does just that. The graphics does a great job aswell for making game hard to spot out.:Negative: But there is downsides for this game, such as you have to purchase alot of things such as the weapons the clothing and hunting licences. Somtimes the render distance is a little bit annoying.:Soution?: They can improve this by buying membership for the licences and instead of weapons you have to purches with guns with earned ingame currency such as GMS instead only of EMS. I think alot would agree that would be a better idea through doing missions or tagging enough game for GMS maybe the score of the buck can calculate towards earning GMS such as 100 score buck will earn you 10 GMS? I don't know it is my idea and still should be able to buy guns with real money for a quick shortcut. But a progression system through buying guns would be good and not so many would complain. Also it would be good if there was a option to increase render distance because sitting 150 meters away I can see game sitting at a river bank and I zoom in there is tall grass there and when I zoom out there is none. If you can get past through all that than this is a really good game and I am happy with buying membership and purchasing a couple of weapons but it can be costly to some.:My score: My total thought on the game 7/10 great simulator just needs work on the GMS system and render distance			"

												I have played this game for a about 2 years now (almost exclusively outside steam). I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.General characteristics of the game:The Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt. Downloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards.If you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun. If you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy. Pros:- There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] )- There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old) - Very nice reserves- Good graphics- Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters- It's challenging- It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it- Frequent updates- Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!)- Many great people in the community- A very active forum, where all your questions can be answeredCons:- It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time)- Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours- It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear- Very limited options for character customisationCheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter) "

												If you are an extreme hunting enthusiast like me, this is the game for you. It is technically free-to-play, but you can't do that much with it. The memberships are cheap and so worth the money. The hunting is challenging and very rewarding when you get the monster buck or albino moose. It isn't impossible to be able to buy guns if you don't want to spend money either. You can earn in-game currency by completing offers from the game's sponsors and one of these free offers can easily get you a quarter or even half way to buying you a new gun. Strongly recommend the game.			"

												*Please give this a read* So, I had just taken a peek at the reviews for this game to see if others had been enjoying it as much as I have, and I was shocked with all the negatives there were. A lot of the negative responses I saw were complaints on the fact that the game itself isn't really free to play or that it's pay to win. But you're playing the full game, you're just limited to what you can hunt, which is Mule Deer. Now, that doesn't sound like a whole lot, and it really isn't in comparison to what else the game has to offer. But I spent a solid 3 hours straight tracking and hunting mule deer and having a blast. I quickly realized that this game was well worth shelling out some money for. The terrain is gorgeous, the way all of the animals behave is very realistic, the tracking keeps me very interested in the hunt and the overall experience is just amazing. To those of you who were looking for a free hunting game with lots of guns and animals to shoot, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this isn't it. The free part is just a demo really of the full game where you can hunt mule deer and get that taste.  But if you're looking for a great hunting game and are willing to drop 30-40 bucks on a bundle that gives you 12 months of unlimited hunting, a 12 gauge shotgun(comes with all different types of shot to hunt everything), a new stronger rifle with a new scope, a .44 and .357 revolver, some better camo'd clothes, some calls and a few other goodies, then this is definitely the game for you. Seriously, if you enjoy the experience of just hunting the mule deer for a bit, drop some money into it and go for the full experience, it's really worth it. This game deserves to be paid for.9/10 (Only because of microtransactions with all the rest of the items that don't come in a bundle, but none of that other stuff is actual stuff that's needed to enjoy the game and have the full experience)			"

												Otherwise known as the patience simulator, this open world hunting game is all other kinds of beauty. It has its bad points and good points, mostly good, but I think it's definitely a one-of-a-kind. At first, it is a free-to-play game, but the options are scarce, and what you can do vastly outweighs the actual point of playing. They give you the ability to kill mule deer (males are hard to come by) and cottontail rabbits (which you can't even kill due to the caliber of the gun you are given to begin with. I upgraded to the ""Wayfarer"" membership and was rewarded with a shotgun (complete with basic ammo) and a revolver, both very useful weapons as now I can practically hunt anything that I want to.The gun sounds and mechanics are beefy and feel realistic, the tracking is awesome and finally getting a kill is quite rewarding. The animals behaviours are quite accurate also, being an individual who is thoroughly intrigued by animal behaviour, I definitely felt aware of their naturalistic tendencies.Overall, if you're looking to play a game that you have to invest a little bit of cash in to play properly, then go ahead. You won't find anything like this anywhere else.  "

												:Positive: Amazing game! What I have been looking for a hunting game is map size, smart AI, sounds, bows, crossbow, rifles, shotguns, pistols and this game does just that. The graphics does a great job aswell for making game hard to spot out.:Negative: But there is downsides for this game, such as you have to purchase alot of things such as the weapons the clothing and hunting licences. Somtimes the render distance is a little bit annoying.:Soution?: They can improve this by buying membership for the licences and instead of weapons you have to purches with guns with earned ingame currency such as GMS instead only of EMS. I think alot would agree that would be a better idea through doing missions or tagging enough game for GMS maybe the score of the buck can calculate towards earning GMS such as 100 score buck will earn you 10 GMS? I don't know it is my idea and still should be able to buy guns with real money for a quick shortcut. But a progression system through buying guns would be good and not so many would complain. Also it would be good if there was a option to increase render distance because sitting 150 meters away I can see game sitting at a river bank and I zoom in there is tall grass there and when I zoom out there is none. If you can get past through all that than this is a really good game and I am happy with buying membership and purchasing a couple of weapons but it can be costly to some.:My score: My total thought on the game 7/10 great simulator just needs work on the GMS system and render distance			"

												Besides the fact that the game launcher doesnt allow you to purchase a membership from within the launcher itself (some or other error most people get - go onto their website and you can buy memberships, em$ etc), its a fun game to play - with friends!Sure, the single player hunts are rewarding, but there is nothing better than running around with a trusted friend while you try play pin the .300 on the bear!Also, and this nearly turned my review from a positive to a negative, when the launcher tells you that you need to update in order to play, never assume it will just be as easy as -close game-->press [play] in steam--> watch update. I have tried a few things, none have worked. Not sure if they are just slow to push their updates to steam after telling the launcher not to let anyone play, or if their launcher code is just not that well written.. who knows.. If you want a free-to-play game that you will need to spend between $30 and $50 to enjoy, then this is the game for you!If you are still reading, here are some pros and cons:PROS]- Its fun with friends ]- Ballistics work fairly ok]- Tracking animals is frustrating at times, but rewarding when you get the basics right]- Wide variety of game to hunt]- Visuals are beautiful!CONS]- Their business model is blatant. $5 will get you 500em$. In order to buy a tent (spawn point + inventory) you will need to buy 1000em$ as the tents start at 550em$. What can you do with the remaining 450em$? Not much worth mentioning. Maybe a lure or two. ]- The weapons do not have a ""this is how far the gun potetially shoots"" info section. Would help a little. ]- Bugs in the launcher]- No way to change the view distance. Its slightly annoying when you see something move, sight down the scope and see massive grass covering where the animal was. Personal issue: I run a Titan X, let me throw my view distance through the roof. The game runs between 140 and 190 fps with everything maxed (steady 120 - 138fps in heavy woodland and forest) , i wouldnt mind more visual rendering options to make better use of my hardware.			"

												This game is awesome and lots of fun with your friends. Part of the game is free to play...but the best way to experience theHunter is to get a membership pack like the (Trailrunner Starter Pack) because you'll get a lot of really good gear and a 1 year membership that will let you hunt every animal on every reserve in the game with unlimited ammo for all your weapons as long as your a member (but you always get free ammo for the .243 starter rifle even if your not a member). Now this would keep any hunter busy for a long time as it is, but the development team is hard at work on new stuff (new animals, reserves, guns, bows, camo, stands/blinds and callers) and updates are released all the time. With the constant development and the massive amount of already available content in this game I would say that theHunter is one on the best buys on Steam, and it lets the player pick what they want and how much to spend or not to spend on the game. I hope this review gives anyone that's thinking of giving this game a shot the confidence to take the plunge, because it's really worth it...especially if you like hunting and the outdoors.			"

												After playing this game alot, i have decided to make a true review of this game. At the time of writing this, i have played a total of 489 hours (this game wasnt always on steam, so i have played it before it were), so my word can be trusted.To start things off, this game, theHunter, is aimed to be a hunting simulator. Although there are a few arcade-like functions, this game is mostly what it aims to be. Some people call this a ""Pay-to-Win"" game, but i will tell why it is not in a few seconds (or minutes, depending on your reading speed). This game offers alot of variety to paid users. If you buy, lets say, the Trailrunner membership (often best for thoose who are new and needs a great start), contains alot of usefull items. It gives you a few very usefull weapons, one camo set wich is very good against deer, license to hunt all species (there are many) for a year, diverce items and equipment. The weapons you recieve is mostly made up of: .300 Bolt Action rifle, .270 Bolt Action rifle, Compound Bow ""Snakebite"" (most powerfull compound bow, although not most powerfull bow after all) and the .30-06 Lever Action rifle. Theese are not all weapons, but they allow you to hunt almost all species in all the reserves. This game offers alot of different ways to track, spot, stalk and kill prey. You can use lures to attract most species to get them closer to you so you can kill them with a bow, a shotgun, a pistol, or you can use the .300 with a 3-9x scope to pick them off at range. A wide variety of weapons are available to be purchased ranging from a .22LR air rifle to take down small bird and rabbits, to the 9.3x62mm Anschütz rifle and shotguns using slug ammunition to take down the biggest of bear and moose. To buy theese weapons, you need an in-game currency called em$. This currency can be gained in a number of ways: Purchasing it for real money and earning it from competitions and certain offers. The easiest way is to purchase. You can also purchase tents to spawn in, treestands/blinds/tripods to sit in to take down prey without it noticing you, and other different tools that may aid you during hunts. Free users only start with the .243 Bolt Action rifle. A weak weapon, but still capable of taking down the most basic free-to-play animal: the Mule Deer. Although Mule Deer is not the only free-to-play animal, it is the only one you may take down using the .243 rifle. There are a huge number off different species, all with their own unique behaviour and pelt characteristics. This game cannot be a ""Pay-to-Win"" game, as there is no real true goal. Its like a open world sandbox, although with the characteristics of hunting. This game can never be completed fully, wich is why you can never win. I will not keep writing this huge text so much more, as this would take alot of time.Pros:-Fun and interesting gameplay.-Get to have a slight feel to hunt animals.-Feeling the adrenaline rush when you spot that Roe Buck with thoose huge antlers.-Many different gameplay mechanics to track, spot, stalk and kill your prey.-Fairly realistic.-Free to play.Cons:-Fairly expensive if you want to get the most out of the game, although not as expensive as titles like World of Warcraft.-Still a few interesting (although harmless) bugs and glitches.-Animal behaviour could be better.-Ballistics could be better.-Weapon mechanics could be better.-In-game skills is very, VERY, time consuming to level up.Conclusion: A great game that i would recomment people to try out. Start as a free-to-play, and if you feel this game is for you, get a membership. Get serious in playing. This game is not for everyone, so i cannot promise any user to be satisfied. I am personally in love with this game, and have inspired me to enter high school with a education line in ""Hunting & Wildlife Preservation"". Devs are also happy to assist on their social networks. I cannot be more happy with this product, and i hope you will find this review of use. Also i cannot thank the devs behind this game enough, it has given me litteratly days of fun in total. Give the game a try, atleast it begins as free-to-play. Thanks to GunninGamerz for letting me post his beginner tutorial, you can watch it  here  "

												I have played this game for a about 2 years now (almost exclusively outside steam). I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.General characteristics of the game:The Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt. Downloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards.If you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun. If you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy. Pros:- There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] )- There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old) - Very nice reserves- Good graphics- Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters- It's challenging- It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it- Frequent updates- Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!)- Many great people in the community- A very active forum, where all your questions can be answeredCons:- It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time)- Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours- It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear- Very limited options for character customisationCheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter) "

												Okay so, I'm completely let down by this game. I'm a huge fan of hunting games but this one has let me down beyond compare. Content with taking my money but not giving me much for said dollar apart from a subscription and items that i already had on start up with the game this purchase was not worth it. Instead of giving me the same items over they could have given a backpack and/or holster for my purchase plus some starter in game premium coin. To add insult to injury, the game lacks any sort of serious gameplay. This game needs the patience of a saint, even worse, once you get into the game no only is your kills not worth anything unless its based on a mission but the ones you do get don't give much to begin with... This games need a little more thought as to what players get, not only for their dollar but also for their time and effort. 4 hours for 1 mule deer even for a beginner is not worth my time specially when you get nothing in return for that mule deer. Over all, I do not recommend this game or spending money on it.			"

												I dont think the pricing is unfair. Not only have the producers gone to great lengths to get realistic data about hunting tactics and features and put it all into one game, but its a free to play aswell. Massive array of maps and locations. Sure you need a membership to get all liscences but even guests can join and explore the forests online. Another thing people dont appreciate about this game is the scenery. I think its brilliant. Having bad luck tracking? Dont rush, the rest of the game is awesome. Only downsides for me is:- When animal eyes go behind a tree, that indicates you have a window to move, (In real Life) but it appears there is no line of vision for that.- Animals will see you from a mile away or hear you if running. In this it appears you can run up to them almost 50 m away undetected :(- Rendering: now i know some PC cant render as far as this game goes but most can, Even with high scenery high quality textures ETC you may see in the distance an object looks like a deer. zoom in, replaced by a forrest. Or when you do see an animal, you zoom in there is a log blocking it.- Maybe price a little lower for ingame cash. I remember all those racing games... and deer hunt and candycrush ETC, always make it so you cant proceed without paying unless you can live to attempt levels for another 100 years. DONT be that company ok... Good game so far, people will stop playing if like 99% of the game costs money. all the features combined well over game price. All that can be done now is settle the game prices out as popularity rises.Other than that brilliant game. animals dont de-spawn you can track them for miles. doesnt use as much internet speed to sync online, brilliant graphics and VERY dense grass and plantlife.  honest review. Realism (9/10) Content/Price Ratio(5/10) Entertainment (10/10)Recommend it :) also game experience is alot more exciting and fun if you be more realistic with the hunting like the game promotes. all round (9/10) favorite game			"

Not only have the producers gone to great lengths to get realistic data about hunting tactics and features and put it all into one game, but its a free to play aswell. Massive array of maps and locations. Sure you need a membership to get all liscences but even guests can join and explore the forests online. Another thing people dont appreciate about this game is the scenery. I think its brilliant. Having bad luck tracking? Dont rush, the rest of the game is awesome. Only downsides for me is:- When animal eyes go behind a tree, that indicates you have a window to move, (In real Life) but it appears there is no line of vision for that.- Animals will see you from a mile away or hear you if running. In this it appears you can run up to them almost 50 m away undetected :(- Rendering: now i know some PC cant render as far as this game goes but most can, Even with high scenery high quality textures ETC you may see in the distance an object looks like a deer. zoom in, replaced by a forrest. Or when you do see an animal, you zoom in there is a log blocking it.- Maybe price a little lower for ingame cash. I remember all those racing games... and deer hunt and candycrush ETC, always make it so you cant proceed without paying unless you can live to attempt levels for another 100 years. DONT be that company ok... Good game so far, people will stop playing if like 99% of the game costs money. all the features combined well over game price. All that can be done now is settle the game prices out as popularity rises.Other than that brilliant game. animals dont de-spawn you can track them for miles. doesnt use as much internet speed to sync online, brilliant graphics and VERY dense grass and plantlife.  honest review. Realism (9/10) Content/Price Ratio(5/10) Entertainment (10/10)Recommend it :) also game experience is alot more exciting and fun if you be more realistic with the hunting like the game promotes. all round (9/10) favorite game			"

												A cool hunting game I can confidently say. Looks good, feels good and most of all you can hunt with your friends.Now for what I really think. This game should not be free to play, because it's really not, you have to pay if you want to have anything more then one gun and two licenses for animals you will never find. It should be called free to download, because its far from ""free to play"" all to make money i guess. False advertising to draw you in, then it's pay to play from there. I do not recommend this game because of it's pay to play style. If there was a up front cost, i would have a different opinon.			"

												Seems like another pay to play disguised as a free to play. You can't do much without a membership or premium currency which defeats the purpose of a free to play game. The interface and graphics are okay but the gameplay is slow. The progress is extremely slow going because you have to buy licenses to hunt anything besides a mule deer which take a good while to buy unless you put up real money.			"

												Probably what is the best hunting sim on the market today. Graphics are great but the animals are nothing if not predictable. Very good overall game though as the animals look and usually seem to act with some realism. Like that its not always a 2 minute hunt to get the trophy you were looking for. Sometimes takes much longer and more effort to bag a good trophy. With the free to play (limited animals only) The game should  keep a pretty large following. Ive enjoyed it so far.			"

												First off, you really do need to disregard ALL negative reviews of this game. I will say that the only negative (which everyone is complaining about) is that the Devs don't explain the license system in the 'About this game' section for people to understand before downloading. This is not just a hunting game like Cabela's or any of the other commercial games that is purchased as a full game. This is an always evolving, new features constantly added in-game, so for full access runs on a subscription ($9 for 3 months), similar to, and much cheaper than most MMO subscription costs. New guns, new animals, new accessories to hunt new animals, new gear, new maps are constantly being added to the game to fully immerse a player into the game (mostly available as cheap micro-transactions). If you don't like the idea of a subscription, don't play it. If you don't want to spend a little money on new/different gear from time to time, hunt with other people that have the gear to do it. Too many butthurt players ruining a solid game's reputation because they don't understand.			"

												One really good hunting game, may be one of the best I've ever played! Graphics are good, the way animals look, move, their sound are very good an realistic! I really like the opportunity to choose between so many different guns and camouflages. But It look like a cheap game (free to play, pay to enjoy of course) but it is really expensive you need to put at least 30$ to buy good gun with optic, some decoys, upgrade yourself... and don't forget the license 10$ for 3 mouths ... This is kind of expensive but I still think this is great game to waste your time 👍			"

But you are basically forced to buy a subscription if you want to even have an average experiance. the prices are probably about the same as you would pay to get a REAL hunting license. You are limited to one gun, two types of animals to hunt, and you cannot host games. but if your okay with that then i do recomend this game... i just hope that you make a reasonable pay.			"

												I believe this game could use more reviews from people who actually play so...In one sentence, this game is the absolute best hunting game in history, but the developers know it and will make you pay for it accordingly (meaning in excess).Do not let that scare you, for $50 (but no less) you can get up and running for a while. But the devs are devious little swindlers ;) so send you first dollars carefully. All those bad reviews you see.... all bad spenders *tisk*tisk*   The dev game => Devs want you to buy small stuff piece by piece and have designed the price structure to force your normal human brain to do just that. Here's what you do to avoid the trap.   I. Buy the TRAILRUNNER Pack ($49.99) and nothing lower, here's why.        - 12 Month Membership:  You NEED this to play and its a super cheap rate in this pack. Individual licenses are for fools, period.        - .300 Rifle and scope(::hint:: mousewheel my friend): Most accurate rifle in the game and my personal favorite of all time.        - Full Boone & Crockett clothing set: Really, really good for deer/elk/moose.        - Start up set of callers: Obviously essential and you have most of what you need        - 3 Deployable hunting towers (where my other two devs?!?!): Can't buy more of these and they are best hunting towers in the game (note: take two real days to build so choose a good spot :D). The pack is the only way to get three right now.    II. Did you follow the ^ first step ^ ? Good, I just saved you ~$150 and a terrible sense of money♥♥♥♥♥♥when you first start playing. After you enjoyed your new toys and learn the game, you will start to want more stuff, and hence put in your first $10-20. Again, remember to defeat the developers at their own game.       - Only, only, only buy things that you intend to use immediately and have some plan with. Don't just buy things that look cool, have some purpose so you don't waste your cash.       - Buy one gun or equipment piece at a time and learn to like it before buying more, one toy at a time.       - Always check the 'Bundle' tab first for what you want.       - Bows - Buy the most expensive 'Python' bow and the 5 pin sight. This is actually the easiest way to start bowhunting and your workhorse.   III. Last word on price, i have spent ~$200 so far and its without question worth it (or close enough). Most actual players (+100 lvls) spend to that and above with the same attitude. If you spread that cost over time and not waste money, you will start to enjoy each new purpose.------Okay, finally the GAME review!!!!!!! (f'n developers, look how long the warning took?!!?)theHunter is in the category of ""game you need to place"" if you are interested in hunting and are patient (aka like simulation/exploring/survival games). I know what your saying, more bullet points it is!!    - The enviroment of the game is perfect. Graphics are beautiful and are perfectly balanced to appear as little like a ""video game forest"" as possible. The sound is impeccable, the background noise is exactly like a real location and the active noises (calls, gun shot) are filtered so that you can almost get a real sense of their location.    - AI is intelligent, bam. Animals will wander around in paths that make sense, sometimes in packs sometimes not. They can hear and smell you way before you may notice them. Each animal has its own behaviors and patterns and active times and critial hit spots and on on on..... Once you get good, you can turn that intelligence against and lead them right to where you want >:)    - Maps, you will start to love the maps.... each map has its good spots and bad spots, but once your more knowledgable, you will love walking around and discovering get hunts. I live in Colorado and spend a lot of time in the mountains. This is the most realistic forest experiencei have ever seen in a game.Alright, official review over but those that are interested, heres a simple strategy guide for your first few hunts.    - Pick a map that is one of the first four on the list and start your hunt 7-8 am.    - Walk (NOT RUN) along one of the paths, do not touch your callers.    - DO NOT follow an animal trail until you know the animal is close by (call, sight). That trail could be 30min or more old and a complete waste of time.    - Listen for a call, and note the location, give a call yourself (one), and walk towards it.    - Start looking for a good location closer to the call, preferably to the side. You can call once or twice more but no more. Calls dont stack, they will only be ""refresh"" if you are closer to the animal.    - Think one shot, one kill and side is always best (slightly above front leg on deer). Wait for the animal to pause, press SPACE to hold your breath, and shoot.    - Get that kill!!Alright for real, this is a wonderful game and one i have put lots of hours into. Join but be wise or experience cash whiplash like you have never experienced before.			"

												Here's the financial breakdown. 35 bucks a year, with microtransactions to get extra weapons. Not better, extra. And there are plenty of bundles. Try it for free, like it and play.It's subscription based because it's played on official hosted servers, and because they constantly put out new content. You don't have to pay for expansions on top of subscriptions like WoW or other MMOs. Just 35 bucks and you get all sorts of online features.

												Here's the financial breakdown. 35 bucks a year, with microtransactions to get extra weapons. Not better, extra. And there are plenty of bundles. Try it for free, like it and play.It's subscription based because it's played on official hosted servers, and because they constantly put out new content. You don't have to pay for expansions on top of subscriptions like WoW or other MMOs. Just 35 bucks and you get all sorts of online features. And yeah, in the free trial version you don't get to shoot the not-free-trial-version♥♥♥♥♥♥ No ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ right?			"

I like the feel of the game but as some of the other reviews say you need a license to do EVERYTHING! It's stupid. go buy Cabelas Big Game Hunter instead because at least you can have some kind of fun with that. 2/10 would get stuck and only allowed to move my arms again			"

												What can I say. I was excited. Thought me and my buddy could virtually go hunting together. Considering I've never been hunting with my father, considering he left me at a young age and I haven't been very socially adept becuase of that, and was left quite heartbroken for the few years to follow, but I digress. I was ready to finally go hunt with my buddy. I load in to be disappointed with the lack of quality, and sound options. I mean for god sake, c is bound to spring. it toggles it too. what the hell? Not to mention you teleport on ladders, and when you shoot a deer it full sprints away before collapsing. I thought this game was going to be able to fully captivate the expierience of hunting with friends. i thought I could have been able to expierience going to a 7/11 in the chilly, brisk morning. Loading up the truck with supplies, clif bars, and a case of Bud Light. I would have to decide what flavor of 5 hour energy I wanted, or if it was a Red Bull kinda day. Nontheless, I was let down. My heart was shattered. I had no clif bars, and I have no hunting expierience. this game has left me more heartbroken, than my own father. 5/10. I recommend			"

												So. let me start off by saying this game is NOT♥♥♥♥♥♥ its just a small money Hog. get it heh hog. you can hunt those <3 no? ok...I TRIED. BUT. this game is fun i recommend it. i read the reviews about it. its all about licenses. what i did. what i tried it out. i thought it was pretty cool. and i spent $50 in EMS alone. and now i cannot stop playing it. it the most realistic hunting simulator on the market. its amazing. and beautiful graphics. the reason nobody plays it is because you need a license to hunt other animals. but all the guns and animals are ethical. you cant kill a moose with a .243 bolt action rifle. this game is fun if you Fully want to try it drop $15 to $20 on it. and to be fully honest this game is however much you want to pay for if you never want to spend a dime you dont have to. if you want to spend $1000 you can. its up to you. i spent $20 for all licenses. 2 guns. and a whole outfit AND alot of other things. and the extra $5 was for a ghillie suit. so it all added up to $20 it was worth it.

												I felt someone needed to stick up for this game and the ""free to play"" business model they have chosen.  First and foremost, the game is a hunting simulator and it nails it in that regard, to include the nature in which you buy things.  I live in Montana and know hunting.  You can walk around the forest for free but if you want to hunt something, you buy a license.  If you want to hunt, you have to buy a rifle, bow, clothes, accessories, etc.  I plopped down $15 and get to hunt anything I want, anywhere I want for three months.  Then I bought a rifle that I can keep forever, some clothes, some lures and , bingo bango.....I'm hunting.  All for about $30, which is half what a AAA game costs.  As far as the game is concerned, It is a huge open world that has hunting opportunities for anything you could be interested in.  It is a SIMULATOR, which means you may walk around a forest for quite some time to bag your prey or even get a glimpse of it.  Which is like real hunting, only easier and in the warmth of your home.  The game runs smoothly for me and I have no problems with the way it is set up.  If you want a hunting simulator, fork over some dough and have a great time with this game.  If you want to run around shooting constantly, this is not the game for you.			"

												theHunter is thePayToHaveFun game.As much as I would like to recommend a hunting game that is this open and supports multiplayer, it takes way too much time and effort to be able to do anything but hunt mule deer. When you first start out you can only hunt mule deer and rabbits. The trick is that you don't have a gun to hunt rabbits with. Instead you have to earn currency by hunting mule deer in a couple different challenges and competitions which don't give you enough currency to do much at all.Even if you do paytohavefun it's for a limited time that you can access all the animal license and a limited time to acess all the hunting grounds, the only thing you get to keep is the items and guns...and you have to keep hunting to get more currency to keep buying ammo for the guns you want to keep using except for the starting gun.

												theHunter is a slow pace game of hunting animals. If you like hunting, grab a few friends and go hunting. Just make sure they are not near you when they fire. If not you better off invest you time somewhere else~While theHunter gets updated with content time to time with new map and animals to hunt. This game is also a lot of things, part of it is decent animal AI, part of it is the test of your patience, skills, time, tracking, getting to know the animal and environment, which gun to use, where and when to shoot, and imo the best of all 'if fail, learn and retry'.BUT there are also some things to take note before diving in.You will need to adjust you expectation when playing the game.""You Don't Have The Licence To Shoot"" does not mean the game is ""bad"", even for on forms F2P model there is usually some kind microtranstion to cover the cost.They do provide a free weapon and licences to hunt specific animal as guest, if you want to spend some time shooting Deer and earning enough gms to buy ammo and licenses, then yes, it's absolutely free. Spending money for a few month's subscription is simply a way to skip the boring grind and go straight to the part where you get to hunt everything.While your hunting mileage may be vary, but it's worth to give game a go before deciding if theHunter or subscription is worth it or not~			"

												A friend of mine recommended I try out this game and it's free to play so I said why not.  Out of all the animals the only free animals you're able to hunt are mule deer and rabbits.  Rabbits being too easy and no fun I thought I'd try to get me a nice buck.  The only problem with that is the mule bucks (as far as I know not being a member) are extremely glitchy and will run from you for absolutely no reason.  For example, I had bought the guille set and odor eliminator and was crouch walking while tracking this decent buck I saw (5 maybe 6 pointer) and just as I got him in my sights I aimed my gun and he fled for me to track him for a good 35 minutes.  Keep in mind this buck was at least 150-200 feet away, I had full guille on so he couldn't see me and I also had scent neutralizer. That's not the only glitch though, I've seen some bucks/doe run straight into the water and drown themselves never to be seen again and there's probably more I just haven't found/realized.			"

												*Please give this a read* So, I had just taken a peek at the reviews for this game to see if others had been enjoying it as much as I have, and I was shocked with all the negatives there were. A lot of the negative responses I saw were complaints on the fact that the game itself isn't really free to play or that it's pay to win. But you're playing the full game, you're just limited to what you can hunt, which is Mule Deer. Now, that doesn't sound like a whole lot, and it really isn't in comparison to what else the game has to offer. But I spent a solid 3 hours straight tracking and hunting mule deer and having a blast. I quickly realized that this game was well worth shelling out some money for. The terrain is gorgeous, the way all of the animals behave is very realistic, the tracking keeps me very interested in the hunt and the overall experience is just amazing. To those of you who were looking for a free hunting game with lots of guns and animals to shoot, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this isn't it. The free part is just a demo really of the full game where you can hunt mule deer and get that taste.  But if you're looking for a great hunting game and are willing to drop 30-40 bucks on a bundle that gives you 12 months of unlimited hunting, a 12 gauge shotgun(comes with all different types of shot to hunt everything), a new stronger rifle with a new scope, a .44 and .357 revolver, some better camo'd clothes, some calls and a few other goodies, then this is definitely the game for you. Seriously, if you enjoy the experience of just hunting the mule deer for a bit, drop some money into it and go for the full experience, it's really worth it. This game deserves to be paid for.9/10 (Only because of microtransactions with all the rest of the items that don't come in a bundle, but none of that other stuff is actual stuff that's needed to enjoy the game and have the full experience)			"

												Wow. Where to start. This game bills itself as free to play. You're allowed to hunt a single animal for free, while constantly being reminded about all the animals you're not allowed to hunt. You can shoot rabbits, but the game will remind you that you need to pay to legitimately shoot them. All in all this game stinks of money grubbing, doesn't understand what it is about ""free to play"" models that makes people spend money, and caters exclusively to a kind of urban cowboy who has never been within a hundred miles of an actual wild animal, but likes to litter your facebook with a bunch of garbage about the fake deer they've killed.It is a very pretty game, however, and ultimately playing it for even five minutes will make you wish that Expansive Worlds made it anything less than nauseating to give them any of your money.

												if your a gun fanatic and want a hunting game this is for sure not that game. the simulation is actually quite realistic to real hunting. you have to be quite stealthy and have the right guns and ammo for the right animals your tracking. but the part is you need to be extremely dedicated to even trying to hunt for said animals. it takes forever to even hunt and even longer to develop a sense of paitence. the game lacks the element of danger which should be actually involved just like in real hunting. if this was more in volved to the player physics on survival and retaliation of animals then it would be better. i may not be a genius but even the most skilled hunters get broken ankles from falling from high ledges and trust me on this even the highest of quality GPU's break down in the wild. if it was a more survival type game it would be more interesting and less dull. to my experience the commercials were way better then the actual game play. i may be bias but this is just a simple review and your free to ignore my 2 cents.

												When I started this game, I didn't know what to expect. I started running into the grassy field in front of me, and found nothing, even after 20 minutes. I questioned this ""walking simulator"", however crouched down, and started walking much slower. A few minutes later, I heard a deer call, and being a novice, simply walked toward it ( I didn't know yet that you are equipped with a tracker that locates where the deer was)  I pulled out my rifle and scoped in to the general vicinity that I believed the deer to be. Shortly, I saw it in my sights. I took careful aim, fired, and completely missed. The deer ran away, and I didn't get a kill that hunt.All in all, I absolutely adore this game. The gorgeous wild beauty mixed with the enjoyable tracking and hunting of your animal makes this game incredibly fun-for me at least. See, this game isn't a game where you get kills every other minute, this is a game in which up to hours of time climaxes in one moment where you have your animal in your sights. If you blow the shot, you can expect a minimum of 20-30 minutes either tracking the same animal down, or looking for a different beast all together. Another thing about this game that puts people off is the price tag. Although the game itself is F2P, you have to buy hunting licenses for all animals expect the Whitetail deer.  Furthermore, the only viable way to get equipment such as deer odor (to conceal your scent from the deer's) or a tent (to start your hunt at a place which you placed your tent in previous hunts) alongside rifles, shotguns, and handguns;is to pay occasionally large sums of real money. For some, this is the ultimate turn off. I believe it to be irritating that you have to pay for this content, however I am still content with the game itself.(See what I did there?) 9/10 for a solid, realistic, and accurate hunting game with a few flaws.

												In short, a great hunting game with lots of variation in both huntable species and weapons, if you are willing to pay for it, and quite nice graphics even though it has been out for some time.Many complain about the subscriptions and costs of the game. I feel it is not so bad compared to a lot of other games that costs much more in total, especially MMO's with higher monthly subscriptions and so forth. I played the free version for almost 7-8 months before I got my first subscription and even though at the time you could only hunt mule deer as a guest I did not grow tired of it. Get a membership bundles, extend with the normal subscription and you will be able to hunt every species for a very reasonable price. I personally like the slow pace of the game with the thrill of never knowing if the next animal will be a new personal best. There are a lot of competitions and missions available if you want some ""direction"" of your play. Note that special weapons or equipment might be needed for these. The scenery of the reserves are beautiful and there playing multiplayer with some friends while chatting is really fun.If you like these kinds of games, give it an honest try and you will not be disappointed.

All the animals I saw I could not shoot because I didnt have a license for hunting them... Really? Then I litteraly followed bear tracks for about an hour and did not see one bear. Graphics are ok. Game play and woods leave you wanting to find something to shoot, but soon you find your on a disapointing Hunting trip...			"

												In this review, I am going to list the pros and the cons of this game. I know it is hard to change the minds of people who do not like the game, but i will try.Pros: Of course there are 18 different species to hunt, 19 with the incoming caribou!Active development team. They have status updates weekly to keep you informed, and even some surprises as well. this week we got camo face paint!It's the only up to date hunting sim out there, last one was probably deer hunter 05.Beautiful scenery! This game is powered by the same engine that Just Cause, and Just Cause 2 runs on.Realism. It isn't neccasarily 100% realistic, but it's the most realistic hunting game i've playedCons:While this game is free to play to a certain extent for free, you will probably have to pay at some point, but a 3 month membership, plus a shotgun, revolver, camo cap, caller, and a few other things is 15 dollars for 3 months. That's a hell of a lot cheaper than elder scrolls online, which has you pay 60 dollars outright, and then 15 dollars a month. For 3 months, $105 usd.Expensive. This game can get expensive, but, if you're a minimalist, unlike me, you can get a 6 month membership for 32 dollars, and that includes license for all species, access to all reserves, unlimited basic ammo, as well as a .44 revolver, 12 ga pump action shotgun(you can shoot anything with it), .357 revolver, compound bow ""snakebite"". That's four weapons. along with those you get camping supplies, which is used to travel to campsites or tents, 3-9X40mm rifle scope, wind indicator, 2x20mm handgun scope, boone & crockett cap, basic pants, Backpack, which doubles your inventory space, turkey box caller, basic jacket, and a tent, which you can use to set up a alternate spawn in point.Most missions, at some point require you to buy a specific weapon, which is kinda bogus  but oh well.Other than that, i have no complaints about this game. The game is beautiful, addicting, and fun as hell. I've been playing for 3 months, and i will definitely get a membership extension.You pay 15 bucks for three months to hunt everything, and if you get tired of it, you dont have to keep paying. You pay 60 bucks for call of duty, you get bored of it, you take it to gamestop and sell it for a couple bucks. Expansive Worlds has to make money, and this game is aimed toward a very small group of gamers. This is their namesake, so they have to be able to live somehow. free to play is a bit iffy, and if they put a disclaimer saying that not everything is free from the start, people wouldn't jump in, expecting it, and then getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥TL;DR It's a great game, 15 bucks for 3 month membership plus a couple guns and other stuff, 32 for 4 weapons, plus a ton of other♥♥♥♥♥♥ its aimed toward a small group of gamers, they have to make money somehow. ESO is 105 bucks for 3 months. compare. "

												Wow. Where to start. This game bills itself as free to play. You're allowed to hunt a single animal for free, while constantly being reminded about all the animals you're not allowed to hunt. You can shoot rabbits, but the game will remind you that you need to pay to legitimately shoot them. All in all this game stinks of money grubbing, doesn't understand what it is about ""free to play"" models that makes people spend money, and caters exclusively to a kind of urban cowboy who has never been within a hundred miles of an actual wild animal, but likes to litter your facebook with a bunch of garbage about the fake deer they've killed.It is a very pretty game, however, and ultimately playing it for even five minutes will make you wish that Expansive Worlds made it anything less than nauseating to give them any of your money.

												if your a gun fanatic and want a hunting game this is for sure not that game. the simulation is actually quite realistic to real hunting. you have to be quite stealthy and have the right guns and ammo for the right animals your tracking. but the part is you need to be extremely dedicated to even trying to hunt for said animals. it takes forever to even hunt and even longer to develop a sense of paitence. the game lacks the element of danger which should be actually involved just like in real hunting. if this was more in volved to the player physics on survival and retaliation of animals then it would be better. i may not be a genius but even the most skilled hunters get broken ankles from falling from high ledges and trust me on this even the highest of quality GPU's break down in the wild. if it was a more survival type game it would be more interesting and less dull. to my experience the commercials were way better then the actual game play. i may be bias but this is just a simple review and your free to ignore my 2 cents.

												What can I say. I was excited. Thought me and my buddy could virtually go hunting together. Considering I've never been hunting with my father, considering he left me at a young age and I haven't been very socially adept becuase of that, and was left quite heartbroken for the few years to follow, but I digress. I was ready to finally go hunt with my buddy. I load in to be disappointed with the lack of quality, and sound options. I mean for god sake, c is bound to spring. it toggles it too. what the hell? Not to mention you teleport on ladders, and when you shoot a deer it full sprints away before collapsing. I thought this game was going to be able to fully captivate the expierience of hunting with friends. i thought I could have been able to expierience going to a 7/11 in the chilly, brisk morning. Loading up the truck with supplies, clif bars, and a case of Bud Light. I would have to decide what flavor of 5 hour energy I wanted, or if it was a Red Bull kinda day. Nontheless, I was let down.

												Игра в которую я хотел поиграть , и не зря ! The hunter это симулятор охоты , тут нужно выслеживать животных , а не бегать по лесу и стрелять в кого попало !Игра не предназначена для людей  ,которые любят боевики , потому-что она вас достанет!!!!!!!!! За все время которое я играл в the hunter мне встречалось много животных , но есть одно но !В игре просто дофига доната , лицензии на животных (доступна только одна ) , оружие , приманки , камуфляж ,членство в клубе , все это надо покупать за деньги !Графика в игре хорошая , если вы любите природу , то скачайте и побегайте !Я думаю игра достойная , если вы конечно любите тратить деньги !

												Hello Fellow Hunters,I despised this game. It's awfully boring, and the graphics aren't that great. This kind of also represents the entire series in terms of gameplay so don't bother buying any of the other versions before you at least try this free to play version. It's pretty much a ""walk here, wait here, listen, shoot, walk,"" simulator. There's nothing particularly fun about it in my opinion. I feel no sense of accomplishment when shooting some game and it just doesn't do anything for me. There are more fun hunting games out there, and this is not one of them. Although the game might be actually good in some people's eyes, this just isn't a genre that particularly does well for me. You're welcome to give it a shot, it's free, it won't hurt, but you'll see how boring it gets within the first few hunts-Kyle James			"

												As of the time of this writing I have about 4 hrs. in the game as a guest/free player and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to get a year subscription. Contrary to popular belief, considering a lot of the reviews I read before trying the game, it's not that difficult. I didn't have to walk for hours to find prey, heck, I found prey within 5 min. of playing and continued to find prey with practical hunting techiniques. This isn't an instantly gratifying game like other First Person Shooters. This game, like real life hunting requires a little patience and an understanding that most wild animals have better senses than people do. Therefore, you can't just run down whatever it is you are looking for and engage in combat. You have to track, stalk, lure and wait for the correct moment to take your shot. I do agree though that the membership rates and in game currency are a bit expensive. I do recommend this game but only if you kind of know what you're getting into i.e. realistic-ish hunting and slightly expensive fees. If you are looking to take down a deer in hand-to-hand combat with an RPG across your back... stay away and go with what you know.			"

												I'm surprised at all the negative comments. I have played the game casually every now and then for the past six months on a free account, sure it's frustrating to not be able to hunt everything you see, but there's no such thing as free lunch.Real life hunting rarely comes with a free pass to shoot anything that moves, and the area with Mule deers is sizable enough to have kept me going for the past half year at least.

												Wow. Where to start. This game bills itself as free to play. You're allowed to hunt a single animal for free, while constantly being reminded about all the animals you're not allowed to hunt. You can shoot rabbits, but the game will remind you that you need to pay to legitimately shoot them. All in all this game stinks of money grubbing, doesn't understand what it is about ""free to play"" models that makes people spend money, and caters exclusively to a kind of urban cowboy who has never been within a hundred miles of an actual wild animal, but likes to litter your facebook with a bunch of garbage about the fake deer they've killed.It is a very pretty game, however, and ultimately playing it for even five minutes will make you wish that Expansive Worlds made it anything less than nauseating to give them any of your money.

												if your a gun fanatic and want a hunting game this is for sure not that game. the simulation is actually quite realistic to real hunting. you have to be quite stealthy and have the right guns and ammo for the right animals your tracking. but the part is you need to be extremely dedicated to even trying to hunt for said animals. it takes forever to even hunt and even longer to develop a sense of paitence. the game lacks the element of danger which should be actually involved just like in real hunting. if this was more in volved to the player physics on survival and retaliation of animals then it would be better. i may not be a genius but even the most skilled hunters get broken ankles from falling from high ledges and trust me on this even the highest of quality GPU's break down in the wild. if it was a more survival type game it would be more interesting and less dull. to my experience the commercials were way better then the actual game play. i may be bias but this is just a simple review and your free to ignore my 2 cents.

												Being British I haven't really been interested in hunting, but after playing theHunter for a few hours I have to say It was very fun.The reason I don't recommend the game is purely due to the fact that it is heavily dependant on spending real cash to really experience all that the game has to offer, which is VERY expensive. As a free to play player you can only hunt ""Mule Deer"", granted that the 'free' rifle you get allows you to kill more than that, you obviously can't because you don't have the proper license to hunt them. While you can earn the free currency by completing missions (17 in total for Mule Deer, which is the only ones you can do as a free player), doing so you could afford to buy maybe a 1 day license for whatever species, but then to continue earning the free currency you'd actually have to pay real money to reset these missions for Mule Deer, which is pointless if you either don't want to pay to carry on playing as such, or if you don't have the money spare, but you do want to carry on playing because you do actually enjoy playing. There is no incentive for free players to carry on playing due to basically having the game shove the need to pay real money to really progress.			"

												Free to play it does what many other F2P games do, allow you to hunt specific animals with basic gear, grind grind grind, buy licenses or more gear, then keep going. Unfortunately for the reviews of this game, people seem to think that F2P means they should be able to do ALL THE THINGS IN THE GAME...for free. Nope, that's not how it works guys. This isn't WoT/WoWS or whathaveyou. The devs have to pay for server costs and continue developing the game, so if they include EVERYTHING, then the game will die.If you want the full experience/ability to shoot any animal you wish, you need to pay for the monthly sub, which is fairly cheap compared to other games. Beautiful game, great sound, awesome direction-sound, decent tracking mechanics, lots of variety. Just don't expect to have an easy time of it as a F2P game.			"

												An excellent and highly rewarding game that is horribly disfigured by, hands down, one of the most awful implementations of free to play business model I have ever encountered.This game essentially demands a subscription fee to be fully enjoyed, but offers nothing that would explain the need for such a thing. The developers have created the best hunting simulator I've experienced, but thoroughly bogged it down with unneccessary MMO-like payment models that I see no justification for me to spend on.I sincerely hope they will come to their senses and fix their business model, as I would love to spend more time in this game, but the fees they demand for features that would be standard in any other game are frankly insulting.Hats off to the dev team, a middle finger to the board room.

												As of the time of this writing I have about 4 hrs. in the game as a guest/free player and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to get a year subscription. Contrary to popular belief, considering a lot of the reviews I read before trying the game, it's not that difficult. I didn't have to walk for hours to find prey, heck, I found prey within 5 min. of playing and continued to find prey with practical hunting techiniques. This isn't an instantly gratifying game like other First Person Shooters. This game, like real life hunting requires a little patience and an understanding that most wild animals have better senses than people do. Therefore, you can't just run down whatever it is you are looking for and engage in combat. You have to track, stalk, lure and wait for the correct moment to take your shot. I do agree though that the membership rates and in game currency are a bit expensive. I do recommend this game but only if you kind of know what you're getting into i.e. realistic-ish hunting and slightly expensive fees. If you are looking to take down a deer in hand-to-hand combat with an RPG across your back... stay away and go with what you know.			"

												Hey guys, just to summarize, I love this game, but the AI Collision Avoidance/Pathfinding needs to be fixed. PLZ READjust thought I'd say hi and get some important things out of the way for those that are looking to get this game. For those wanting to get theHunter, know this; it is a Hunting SIMULATOR. This is NOT like Cabela's Big Game Hunter where you can just stroll up to a deer and shoot it point blank in the face without it spooking. YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME AS IF YOU WERE HUNTING IRL, which is why I recommend to AT LEAST learn the basics of hunting before even starting this game if you have NO hunting experience whatsoever. If you choose to ignore me, you'll find the game boring and give it a crappy rating, just like what all of the other inexperienced players have already done, hence why the rating is very poor. Other than that, for anyone with hunting experience, such as myself and a few other friends, we can say as a whole that theHunter is very entertaining to play for someone with hunting experience. My only complaint with the game is the Collision Avoidance and Pathfinding for the animal AI, including Scent Hounds and Retrievers. The thing is: there practically isn't any collision avoidance or pathfinding. For example, I've had several times of where I've been tracking/chasing a game animal, only to find it stuck in a bunch of trees, simply because its AI had no collision avoidance/pathfinding programmed into the code to dodge the issue. Same thing for the Scent Hounds/Retrievers: I've had moments of where I'll be walking through the forest or up a hill, and my Scent Hound will get stuck in a bunch of trees or on a rock, simply because its AI had no collision avoidance/pathfinding programmed into the code.

Still uses a ridiculous subscription-based paywall system. If they ever add a system that allows you to progress without having to bring in a dump truck filled to the brim with wads of cash, I might leave a good review.But for now, it's probably best that I finally delete this from my library.

I have played the game casually every now and then for the past six months on a free account, sure it's frustrating to not be able to hunt everything you see, but there's no such thing as free lunch.Real life hunting rarely comes with a free pass to shoot anything that moves, and the area with Mule deers is sizable enough to have kept me going for the past half year at least.

												Hello Fellow Hunters,I despised this game. It's awfully boring, and the graphics aren't that great. This kind of also represents the entire series in terms of gameplay so don't bother buying any of the other versions before you at least try this free to play version. It's pretty much a ""walk here, wait here, listen, shoot, walk,"" simulator. There's nothing particularly fun about it in my opinion. I feel no sense of accomplishment when shooting some game and it just doesn't do anything for me. There are more fun hunting games out there, and this is not one of them. Although the game might be actually good in some people's eyes, this just isn't a genre that particularly does well for me. You're welcome to give it a shot, it's free, it won't hurt, but you'll see how boring it gets within the first few hunts-Kyle James			"

												Fact.1 Terrible hunting simulator but great grass simulator. Fact.2 Cant shoot anything without being told you need a license to hunt that. Fact.3 You can only find animals you cant hunt and even if you do see an animal at about 20 metres away it sees you first and runs. On the other hand the greatest part about the game is the uninstall button. game 1/10 uninstall button 10/10			"

												Before falling to the haters, read this:I play this game since 2011. It is a fantastic, like no other i ever seen.- You CAN play free and enjoy it, It is not a lie.- Not every aspect of the game is free. Why? This game is deep and diverse. It is constantly updated and new content released every week. And the full time developers has to eat you know!- Once you get membership, the boundries are no more, and you can enjoy the endless fun. When i say endless, i mean it. People play it 2-8 hours a day for years! There is no end of it!- If you expect some easy and quick fun, i must warn you: This game not an action shooter, but a hunting simulator. Things can happen slow, and you have to work for the results.- The community is one of the kind. Real life hunters, weapon maniacs, enthusiastic kids, oldtimers, many interesting and nice people who are happy to help you. No question remains unanswered. And there are many things to talk about, tactics, tips, what item to get next, or just how to win competitions.- I want to warn all the newcomers: You may stuck here forever! Play the free version 1-2 month before purchasing anything. And don't spend all your money blindly, ask the community for help! Pnshen (ingame name)			"

But no, apparently you need licences for every animal - So I decided to give it a shot and bought a membership. This was a mistake. After buying my license I was now allowed to track the animals around, but after putting my first bullet in an elk, I was told I also needed to buy a new rifle just for shooting elks. This game is a complete moneytrap, and I refuse to put more money into it. I have played it for around 6 hours, and after buying membership, have only been able to get a total of 4 legit kills. I feel cheated of my money and I DONT RECOMMEND others to go through this same process. Its a WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY			"

												Quite frankly this game simply is the best most realistic multiplayer hunting sim there is.Does it cost money to play? noDoes it cost money to play everything it has to offer? yesPeople seem to complain that this game is pay to win, I assure you it isn't. The rifle you get for free will kill a deer just as well as any you would buy in the shop, it is a matter of preference, nothing more.The game does have a subscription to hunt all the available animals but as far as subscriptions go it is inexpensive, $10 for 3 months. However I find this to be a good thing, having a subscription keeps the people who don't care out of many parts of the game, believe me when you stalking a trophy buck you don't want someone who doesn't understand or care shooting up the place around you. What you are left with is a mature, fun gaming community, one of the best I've come across.			"

												I like it because it is realistic. Best hunting game I have ever played and as you can see, all the negative reviews are about having to pay to play the full game. It's a game with constant events and developments. So if you aren't willing to pay for it then it's not the game for you. Pretty simple. If people want a decent free game, then what can I say? Can't have your cake and eat it too. A one off payment wouldn't work because it is a game that is constantly updating and developing. So of course they don't make you pay for the game. You have to pay for the full privilege of the liscences and other weapons and events though. Which is fair enough imo. It's not free for the developers and they put their own time and money into it. And why shouldn't they make money out of it? It's called capitalism. And btw, people saying that you just walk around doing nothing didn't bother playing the game long enough for figure how to actually hunt the animals. If you do, then it's plenty fun taking them down. They're full of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

I Killed three bunnies which apperently my gun wasn't registered for. I spent two hours looking for one non-bunny animal. Finnaly I found one deer. I tracked it and proned into range. I pulled the trigger, my gun was unequiped and a message said I didn't have a permit for that animal. theHunter= Hiking simulator while killing helpless bunnies with a rifle.			"

												I'm sorry, but if I wanted to buy a hunting tag to go hunting, I would buy a real one. And take my real gun, track and shoot a real deer and eat it.The concept is great. I have no issues with the technical side of the game. However the execution is terrible.I downloaded the game, installed, launched it, was a little miffed by the ""Launcher"", I sifted through the game list and found 2 servers I was ""Allowed"" to join. Seriously, there was some kind of restriction on %90 of the servers. Finally got in one server after 3 tries spent a good amount of time tracking a nice White-Tail buck.Aimed, fired.... POP-UP said something like ""Hey, we noticed you tried to kill a white-tail dear, you need a white-tail tag."" I'm like, alright. That's cool you need tags. Then I saw the prices in their weird currency. And the rates at which you buy them with real money. Yeah... ""Free-to-Play"" I see.Then I saw the missions and tutorials and thought, Cool, at least there is a way to EARN in-game currency to buy a tag to shoot a deer in the face. WRONG, the tutorials do not count toward the missions. What? Really? So you have to BUY tags with real money, basically, then use those to complete missions which reward you with a fraction of the cost of the tag... Right.This has to be some kind of scam right? Like how dumb do they think people are. Uninstalled, never installing again.			"

												I find this game rather misunderstood. Yes, it does say free to play, and yes you do have to pay to unlock a lot of things, but just because you were misled doesn't make it a bad game. This game is really enjoyable when people put the effort into making it that way. The membership price isn't bad, at least nothing new compared to other games, and buying opens the door to a lot of new things. So what, the game wasn't exactly what you expected. A lot of times it's not but that doesn't mean you can't make it that way again.			"

												Note: theHunter is a NICHE game. It's a wonderful niche game, don't get me wrong. But other than the gameplay itself, I have nothing but issues with it. Compare this game to the big name games out there... CoD, Bioshock, Farcry, Skyrim and so forth... ignore the genre. Production value and sales are what I'm comparing here. In all of these big name games have one thing in common. You buy the game, you can play it. All of it. You unlock gear and items as you play through. You don't have to buy additional junk just to complete missions/progress through the game. Occasionally you will have expansions or add-ons, more DLC that you can buy that will in most cases extend the gameplay, but in all cases will at least net you more content of some kind. So, I'll take CoD, one of the best known, most loved, and highest selling franchises in the gaming industry. I think I paid $60 when it first came out. That was it, for the whole game, all equipment, all levels and weapons attainable for that $60. Oh, I forgot to mention that you OWN the game at that point, you don't have to buy a membership to enjoy all of the games content. Now, theHunter. Free to Play? No, it's not mistitled. It's deceptively titled. The F2P portion conains one rifle, one scope, a bleat call, a camera, a GPS and binoculars. Oh, That's fine and all, but you only get to hunt ONE animal (Mule deer) on ONE reserve. If anything, it's a free demo. If you expect to see the rich content in this game, forget it. This ""demo"" is nothing more than a snapshot. Ok,... so that's what you've gotten for free. Let's spend $60 on this game, like we would any other, and see where it gets us. $45 for one year basic, and another $15 for three more months. That's it. That's what you get. I would love to say that you get more, but you don't. You get 15 months, with no additional gear, no additional weapons. Oh, you DO get the option to hunt on all the reserves. You also gt the licences to hunt all of these animals. But you still CAN'T because you haven't bought the proper weapons, proper ammo, proper equipment.... So you have to shell out more money just to take advantage of the fact you just shelled out $60 for 15 months of play time. What's that? Did I just hear someone squeak the words World of Warcraft? Denied. WoW at least gave you access to all of it's content after you've paid your subscription. And no, I'm not going to complain about the subscription, as WoW is/was an MMO. Gotta maintain those servers. Yeah, I know theHunter has multiplayer. Big deal. Out of the 20 people who enjoy multiplayer, theHunter could loose all 20 of them and still be a perfectly great game as single player only. You guys want to make more money? Add the cottontails and a crappy shot gun to the ""Free to Play"" version, and call it a free demo. Sell the game for $30, and monthly membership of $5. Make gear and weapons unlockable. Get rid of the microtransaction garbage. I would buy this game for $30. I would pay a $5 subscription, IF I had access to all of the games content after I made those purchases. That's at LEAST $35 you guys would have made from my first month. $5 and maybe even more a month after for my continues subscription. However, due to the way you guys have decided to sell this game, I've spent $15 for the subscription, had my fill becasue I refuse to spend more money on trivial, and temporary purchases, and that's it. You've made $15 from me, and you won't make any more. I don't recommend this game. Sure, download it, shoot a few mule deer, and call it quits. For the price you'll be paying to make anything in this game available for use and the fact that these are only temporary purchases, (subscription/consumables)  this game isn't worth the disk space it occupies. Even with WoW, purchased when it was released, and played for the first year at about $180 is still cheaper than this. You want a good hunting game? Play CoD, or FarCry, or Bioshock. You get to hunt people and monsters, you get tons of weapons to choose from, you don't have to pay a monthly subscription, and your purchases are yours to keep!! DON'T SPEND A DIME ON THIS GAME.  "

												Lots of Negative reviews! If you look though you'll notice the majority of which have under an hour of playtime. The game is completely free to download and play, you can hunt with your guest license for as long as you like, you can hunt Mule Deer with the starter .243 Rifle as much as you like, in fact my wife plays every weekend with me in Multiplayer and does just that, she hasn't spent a penny yet! (You can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits and European Rabbits as a guest however you cannot use the starter rifle to do so) There are currently 9 different hunting reserves in the game, Logger's Point being the one where you will find Mule Deer to hunt for free, use this map http://www.thehunterwiki.com/images/0/08/LPAnimals2.pngNow, once you get hooked and wish to hunt other animals you need to spend money! (Hey Dev's gotta eat!), Personally at the moment I'm only interested in hunting Deer, so I purchased a 3month membership for £6.99 (That's £2.33 a month, less than half the price of a fast food burger each month) and I can hunt all animals in all reserves. On top of that I bought a .300 bolt action rifle & Snakebite bow which cost 1100 Em$ (2000 Em$ costs £13.70 so you'll have 900 left for other stuff) and can now hunt everything with the bow and all deer with the rifle on all of the reserves.If you like hunting games you're probably familiar with Deer Hunter 2005, for me this was the best hunting game of all time, and now theHunter is scratching that itch I had, I'm playing every night lately, loving the atmosphere, the graphics, the audio, the daily competitions and leaderboards, the multiplayer and the hunt for that big buck!Simply put, if you like hunting games, this is pretty much the best one around and I've tried a lot, don't be put off with all the negative comments, the game is free to play with limits but if you spend wisely you can get a lot out of this game for a very reasonable price.

You're also stuck with the starter guns unless you want to pay more money, and even when you get a license it's time limited to 3,5,7,or 23 days or some such garbage.

												After a very long and very boring 63 minutes of walking i finally came across a boar. I have a very keen eye for games like this. Being it was above me and i could only see a small sliver of its upper body i had to move to an advantage. I immediately laid flat and began my slow crawl up the mountains, as i did not want to risk losing my boar. It took about 30 seconds to lose that boar and never see it again. But hey, I walked for only an hour. Im not sure about how everyone else feels about this game but 63 minutes of walking to finally find something and lose it seems a bit rediculous for a video game. I gave up shortly after. Also i dont feel as if i should pay to access most of this game. Seems more so a trial than an actual f2p game.			"

												Very fun game. Yes, It is a subscription based game to have FULL access to all animals etc. which may not be what is expected when you see the words ""free to play"". That said, the prices, especially on the starter bundle subscription packages, are more than fair and the best I have seen on a subscription based game in a LONG time. The games business model is also largely based on Microtransactions, IF you desire to have access to more than the weapons you get in the starter bundle or the starter rifle you receive.  Again, if you purchase even the cheapest of the starter bundles you have weapons capable of hunting every animal in the game. I chose to spend a somewhat absurd amount of money to get many of the extra weapons, clothing items, animal calls, etc. Simply because I love the game and wanted to and I know I will get much use out of them. Strongly suggest at LEAST trying out the free version of this game.			"

(You can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits and European Rabbits as a guest however you cannot use the starter rifle to do so) There are currently 9 different hunting reserves in the game, Logger's Point being the one where you will find Mule Deer to hunt for free, use this map http://www.thehunterwiki.com/images/0/08/LPAnimals2.pngNow, once you get hooked and wish to hunt other animals you need to spend money! (Hey Dev's gotta eat!), Personally at the moment I'm only interested in hunting Deer, so I purchased a 3month membership for £6.99 (That's £2.33 a month, less than half the price of a fast food burger each month) and I can hunt all animals in all reserves. On top of that I bought a .300 bolt action rifle & Snakebite bow which cost 1100 Em$ (2000 Em$ costs £13.70 so you'll have 900 left for other stuff) and can now hunt everything with the bow and all deer with the rifle on all of the reserves.If you like hunting games you're probably familiar with Deer Hunter 2005, for me this was the best hunting game of all time, and now theHunter is scratching that itch I had, I'm playing every night lately, loving the atmosphere, the graphics, the audio, the daily competitions and leaderboards, the multiplayer and the hunt for that big buck!Simply put, if you like hunting games, this is pretty much the best one around and I've tried a lot, don't be put off with all the negative comments, the game is free to play with limits but if you spend wisely you can get a lot out of this game for a very reasonable price.

												For a ""free"" game, this game sure had a lot to offer... if you actually paid for it. The environment was stunning, the A.I. was good from what I could see, the only problem is you have pretty much nothing to do if you don't pay for a membership. The only thing I could do in the free version was hunt one single species of deer, with one rifle, with no way of getting more content out of the game without paying. Unless you're an avid hunting fan with a disposable income, I DO NOT recommend this game at all.			"

												I like it because it is realistic. Best hunting game I have ever played and as you can see, all the negative reviews are about having to pay to play the full game. It's a game with constant events and developments. So if you aren't willing to pay for it then it's not the game for you. Pretty simple. If people want a decent free game, then what can I say? Can't have your cake and eat it too. A one off payment wouldn't work because it is a game that is constantly updating and developing. So of course they don't make you pay for the game. You have to pay for the full privilege of the liscences and other weapons and events though. Which is fair enough imo. It's not free for the developers and they put their own time and money into it. And why shouldn't they make money out of it? It's called capitalism. And btw, people saying that you just walk around doing nothing didn't bother playing the game long enough for figure how to actually hunt the animals. If you do, then it's plenty fun taking them down. They're full of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I highly recommend this game...to anyone who is willing to invest a lot of time and money into this game to get the full experience out of it. I have spent over 200+ hours playing this and combining that with my real life hunting experience, it has become a very enjoyable game. Set aside the fact that you must invest $25-$30 just to start getting more enjoyment out, it starts getting better, especially if you find a good hunting buddy. If you do not have the patience to sit in a treestand or blind waiting for a deer for a couple of minutes, then you are better off going back to COD. Notice the game name is The Hunter not The Shooter, if all you did was start up the game load up your gear and instantly find something to kill, there would be no point. I love how they made this game as realistic as possible and i understand the frustration about the in-game currency but you have to understand no ""free to play"" game is ever really free, there wouldnt be a profit to be made, so to all of you out there that are used to just getting handed everything and not really earning it, turn away now and keep scrolling cause this isnt the game for you. To all those that are looking for a great hunting game that is better than the cabela""s games that are basically the arcade shooters from the bowling alley, then you have found the right game.			"

												I personally love this game, it's a great simulation, the hunting mechanic is fun, enjoyable and I love to spend time hunting the mule deers. However this may seem strange as I don't recommend it, that stems from the fact that it's a pay to win game, everything and I mean literally everything apart from the few things you start with, you have to pay real life money for everything, I stress everything. This is supported by the fact that you even have to pay money to hunt the animals. So please, to improve this game just let people either hunt anything or be able to buy the items with the other currency you actually get from hunting animals. Even if it's something ridiculous like 10,000 just to buy a feather or something.			"

												First: this game is not free to play, it's free to try. You can hunt a few animals with a limited arsenal, but you should get a good idea of the game before you buy anything.This being said, theHunter is the best hunting simulator out there. The graphics and sounds are simply awesome, animations are life-like and even the AI is good (with some small glitches). This is a simulator game, so it takes patience to master (and to catch anything). If you like FPS games, this is not the game for you. If you want a hunting simulator, you have found the right game.As for the pricing, yes the game is expensive to start. When you get going and have bought all the important equipment, you only have to pay for membership, which is about 40 $ yearly. At this point this game is a lot cheper than many MMOs, so it's a question of how do you want to spend your money. I have spend it on this and have no regrets.			"

The game is no fun without paying as you can only hunt Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits, you can't create a multiplayer game, you have only one gun and you must buy ammo for any guns that you bought and without paying you have crap clothes so you are spotted quickly.

												Very fun game. Yes, It is a subscription based game to have FULL access to all animals etc. which may not be what is expected when you see the words ""free to play"". That said, the prices, especially on the starter bundle subscription packages, are more than fair and the best I have seen on a subscription based game in a LONG time. The games business model is also largely based on Microtransactions, IF you desire to have access to more than the weapons you get in the starter bundle or the starter rifle you receive.  Again, if you purchase even the cheapest of the starter bundles you have weapons capable of hunting every animal in the game. I chose to spend a somewhat absurd amount of money to get many of the extra weapons, clothing items, animal calls, etc. Simply because I love the game and wanted to and I know I will get much use out of them. Strongly suggest at LEAST trying out the free version of this game.			"

												I personally love this game, it's a great simulation, the hunting mechanic is fun, enjoyable and I love to spend time hunting the mule deers. However this may seem strange as I don't recommend it, that stems from the fact that it's a pay to win game, everything and I mean literally everything apart from the few things you start with, you have to pay real life money for everything, I stress everything. This is supported by the fact that you even have to pay money to hunt the animals. So please, to improve this game just let people either hunt anything or be able to buy the items with the other currency you actually get from hunting animals. Even if it's something ridiculous like 10,000 just to buy a feather or something.			"

												Ok so after a few hours playing this game i can honestly say i really liked it. The negative reviews are people crying because they expect something for nothing. This is F2P i have been for some time now. Every week the animals you can hunt are rotated you also start with two guns and five types of ammo which can deal with most of the creatures. Yes there is a lot of things to buy in the game but you are not being forced to and you earn in game money for your kills. My personal advice would be to get a 12 month mebership which i think is £30 and with that you get so much extra stuff plus the right to hunt what ever you like. So if your into your hunting give it a try and see for yourself.			"

												I don't get why everyone is complaining about the fact that you have to pay to play most of the game, that's a normal thing these days. If you bother to pay (and you won't pay more than a normal game to get 3 months plus a good range of gear - and then it's really cheap to renew your licence whenever you miss the game), it's an AMAZING BEAUTIFUL hunting game. It really is ultra real, and if you are opposed to hunting real animals but can see the fun otherwise, then this is the game for you.It's the only game where you will WALK, and even crawl most of the time and enjoy it. It's a game that makes good finds rare, so when they come they are really rewarding, and challenging. There's a thrill in hunting an animal across the gorgeous (huge) maps and making sure you don't spook it.You also get to hunt with friends, which is a great pasttime. Grab a beer, get a good microphone and head out into nature with your buddies and enjoy good, old fashioned, manly hunting!Try it, it's free to try (THATS THE POINT), and you do get to go on a great map and hunt a deer that's as fun as all the other animals. You can even go on the other maps and find other animals, you just can't shoot them (but you can photograph them and see if you want to invest).Ignore the spoiled brats that want everything free and give this game a go :)p.s. I've played for over 100 hours, via the website rather than steam ;)			"

												I dont know what all these negative reviews are for, probably just the typical ""Steam community"" being negative as usual, the game has been out WAY longer then it has been available on steam, it has a good community, and a lot of seasoned veterans, yes yes yes you can only hunt Mule Deer and Rabbit to start, and only at 1 hunting resort, the memberships arent that expensive, if you enjoy the game, then support the company by paying a little money, or dont play the game. Other then that, this is an excellent hunting sim, graphics, sounds, controls, and realisim factor is all there, download it, try it, and enjoy........also, get over the ""free to play"" hype, there is no magical self sustaining game with constant updates, servers, new content and employees to pay thats truly ""free to play"".

												This game is 2 ♥♥♥♥in dope. I thought this game would be a simple hunting game similar to the Cabelas series but oh golly was I wrong. I was walking through the forest hunting for a bear when I stumbled uppon this green thing, when I approached it it was a weed plant. When I looked at it a message appeared and said ""Do you want to enter 420 mode, once entered you will never return?"". I was scared but I decided to press yes. Right when my finger was about to hit the left trigger I heard a voice say ""What are you doing in my swamp"", I nearly fainted from fear. It was Shrek, I was just about to quicksope him when he jumped off a tree stand doing a 720 noscope headshot and rekted me. I cried in my bedroom for many hours before I decided to play again, this time with revenge on my mind. When I returened to Shreks swamp I discovered that Shrek had stole the weed plant and used it himself. I researched what would happen if you entered 420 mode and I learned that once inhailed you would become the ultimate quickscoper and rek everything in your path, even hackers with god mode would be rekt. I felt hopeless, but help woud soon come. I was on a hunt for a turkey when I found a mystical cave, I didnt know what to expect but I went in. I saw all these pyrmids on the wall, It turned out to be a iluminaty base. I teamed up with them and they told me that there was only one thing that coud defeat Shrek, the power of the dew. They told me where Shrek was and how I had to defeat him, and they told me if I failed I would die for good. I literally had to climb a mountain in the game to find this magical liquid, getting attacked by many mountain lions and mountain goats, but I made it. I drank the sugary liquid and what I experienced I will never forget. I morphed into sanic da heghog and with lighting speed I rushed off to Shreks new base. Shrek was waiting for me super blazzed and we went to battle. I was still upset that he stole my weed plant and I beat his♥♥♥♥♥super good, ""You little cheeky♥♥♥♥♥♥I'll rek you m8"" ""Does you even lift♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; I told him. I did a beastly 1080 spin and did a dolpin dive and I shoved my intervention up his ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥hole and blasted him with the most beast head shot ever. I then shot his feggt friend Donky and ate him for dinner. Afterwards Is stole his groupy bittch Fiona and fukkt her pusy all night.This game is that good 9000/9000			"

												I've been playing this game for about a week (though I haven't been active in this game for a few days). My experience was a decent one. While the game claims it is ""Free to play"", that is about the extent of it's F2P model. Loading the game for the first time, I'm only given a ""Guest"" License, which only allows me to hunt Mule Deer, and Cottontail Rabbits. I also get the basic weapon (.243 Nosler Rifle) as well as a Deer ""Bleat"" Caller, Binos, and a Digital Camera as well as the HunterMate (a PDA of sorts). Very basic stuff. To be expected when starting for the first time. I spent hours learning the game, walking around, taking in the sights (which were majestic, by the way), and trying to locate my first prey. It really didn't take long despite others' claims that there were no animals. It just took some patience and careful movement, as well as some time sitting around waiting for my prey to come to me when I used the caller. The game does have tutorials, and they weren't hard to find, and they explained pretty much the basics on how to find animals and how to use the items you're given.Spending some more time in this game, I decided to take a look at the store to see what I could purchase. Well, turns out you need gm$. Pretty much your in-game currency which can be obtained through running missions. The missions weren't hard. It's just that you need to do quite a number of them to be able to purchase some of the items in the store. But not all. Most items (and I mean MOST) require you to use em$, which is obtained through spending actual money. I ended up spending $20 to buy a few things and also purchased some ammo with the gm$ that I accumulated while running missions. Not too bad, though I wish the real money I spent was better spent for more than what I got. Still, I was happy with what I purchased and moved on. I wasn't expecting to have everything this game has to offer while only spending $20. I'm still having fun in this game and I find it to be enjoyable. However, I'm not too keen on the way the game is tagged as ""Free to Play"" when it's clear that most items can only be purchased with real money. I can see why the developers need to make some money, but this is pretty fraudulent. Most F2P games allow you to purchase ALL items in the store using in-game currency (gm$) but at an extended length of time. This is NOT the case. While it is a fun game to play, I cannot recommend it at this time because it really is NOT Free to Play. It is more like a demo. It's free to only hunt 2 animals, use 1 weapon and use only 1 caller. To get other weapons and other, more useful items, as well as having to purchase the licenses needed to hunt other animals, you WILL HAVE to spend real money. Being able to spend in-game currency on some items is a plus, but there's just not enough items to do this with to justify a true F2P game. Overall, a good game. But if you want to do more in this game other than hunt Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits, and/or just walk around taking in the sights, you will have to open up your wallet.			"

												Figured i'd offer a different opinion then the typical  ""OMG THIS GAME ISNT FREE TO PLAY"" review. This game definitely is free to play, i played this game for years without paying a penny before it came to steam. I will admit though that the experience is more enjoyable when you've purchased a few items that are fairly cheap to get anyways.If you want to hunt as a guest for free, you are allowed a .243 Rifle and scope, and a 12 GA Shotgun with Buck/Bird/Slug shells. You can hunt Whitetail, Pheasent, and European Rabbit , and there are two more random species on rotation every week for free hunting, and guests also have access to all 11 unique hunting reserves. I really need to stress that yes, if you want to enjoy this game to its fullest you'll have to purchase the basics, a better hunting rifle and maybe a hunting bow and a membership. The weapons and equipment are fairly cheap to buy anyways, and a membership will run you about $3 a month, that's not so bad for what this game offers. What it offers is something you can't get with any other game out there, a realistic hunting simulator. This game takes a lot of pride in being as authentic as a video game can possibly be to the real thing, and for that reason its pretty fun and rewarding. I think it must be mentioned that this game was released over 8 years ago now, and it's still recieving regular updates from the developers; because of this there is a pretty large online community supporting this game that existed before it came to steam.

												I have played this game casually for many many hours off steam, so that is why my time on here is low.I'll be brief about it, because I do love this game.THIS GAME SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A FREE TO PLAY GAMEif looking at it from a free to play win game it is the most inarguably pay to win piece of crap that there ever was. You only have a single (decent) weapon to start with, and can only hunt two animals, on a reserve that has 5 other things you can't shoot at. You can only unlock ONE gun without paying real money, and even then it would take an ungodly ammount of time, along with licenses, ammo, ect.This game is not satisfying or entertaining at all without a membership, and if you DO get one, it has some of the best gunplay, graphics, and experience of any hunting game I've ever played. I highly reccomend this game for that reason, because i've spent many hours tracking game.TL;DR: Not reccomendable unless you spend money on it, great fun if you do.			"

												Bad reviews are based on the fact it is not entirely free to play .. and for this game the money is worth the membership. This is a hunting simulation the best hunting simulation out there might I add, with a large variety of animals to hunt many very detailed hunting reserves with stationary hunting towers. pretty well full customised loadouts for your hunting trips .. a massive arsenal of weapons ..handguns, bows, shotguns, rifles and even muzzle loaders ie black powder . You cant go wrong if you are into these games this is the best one . Ok so these people made the game put their time and money into it  .. and a very well made game with amazing graphics and realism ..whats wrong with paying a few dollars considering the base program is free .. so many people do not even understand the concept of this and that explains the bad review I have played this game for over 3 years now on the non steam client and i will continue to play ...

												Calling it free to play is pretty deershit since the free part is really limited ""try if you even like the game"" deal. You can only hunt rabbit and one type of deer. But for this game the 40 euros for a year of licence is not bad and you get loads of stuff with it. And if you buy something with money like new guns and such you can keep them indefinitely except the consumables. And just buy the types of guns to suit your hunting style and your fine. Also the ammo replenish after hunts so you only need a case or two. Because the yearly subscription fee is not that big and you get loads of stuff with it I think it is actually pretty fair. Just don't expect to do much without paying... And yes, if you like hunting and the game the developer fully deserve your money. Best hunting simulator since Deer Hunter series and I played that for hours and hours. But it is definitely not for everyone, but playing this with friends or even sometimes with some random people online is tons of fun! It really shines in multiplayer.			"

theHunter . . . is the best hunting simulator game on the market by far, environments are beautiful, constantly changing weather, authentic animal behaviour and sounds, excellent ambient sounds, competitions to earn rewards and trophies, personal missions to earn rewards, single player & multi player, worldwide leaderboards and ranking system, trophy photo gallery, competition trophy room, consistently adding new products and content, varied choice of weapons, tracked lifetime statistics, achievements, weapon and tracking/spotting skills, my overall rating for this game . . . . 9.5/10 edit: Game support is only ONE person and can take weeks to respond.

												I have played this game casually for many many hours off steam, so that is why my time on here is low.I'll be brief about it, because I do love this game.THIS GAME SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A FREE TO PLAY GAMEif looking at it from a free to play win game it is the most inarguably pay to win piece of crap that there ever was. You only have a single (decent) weapon to start with, and can only hunt two animals, on a reserve that has 5 other things you can't shoot at. You can only unlock ONE gun without paying real money, and even then it would take an ungodly ammount of time, along with licenses, ammo, ect.This game is not satisfying or entertaining at all without a membership, and if you DO get one, it has some of the best gunplay, graphics, and experience of any hunting game I've ever played. I highly reccomend this game for that reason, because i've spent many hours tracking game.TL;DR: Not reccomendable unless you spend money on it, great fun if you do.			"

												You can only hunt two species of poorly coded animals,Decent graphics,Ungodly animal speeds,Poor multiplayer,And the lie that is ""Free to Play""The game creator mentioned how people disliked the f2p label and never mentioned it again.Greedy game developers + crap game = THIS			"

												This game sucks. i bought a bow and now i need to buy arrows? Me and my friends were hunting and we tracked five deer. we shot at all of them and never hit one. my friend hit a deer in the heart and it didnt die! Plus when you start you can only hunt one animal! and use one gun. every review of this game says it sucks! update the game and make it to were starters have more freedom!   (Ps: this game sucks and its♥♥♥♥♥♥) "
