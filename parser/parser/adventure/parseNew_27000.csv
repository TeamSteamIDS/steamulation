												I'm really not a big fan of Tale of Tales, having played previous games like The Graveyard and that game with the deer, and now The Path. It's not because of their not-so-subtle pretentiousness, such as how when talking about the development of Sunset (their latest game, which I haven't played), they stated ""Abandoning some of our more extreme artistic ambitions actually made work easier and more enjoyable. And that’s when we should have realized that we were on the wrong path. Because whatever we enjoy is never, ever, what the gaming masses enjoy."" It's not because after Sunset became a commercial failure and they left the gaming industry, they proceeded to write a series of passive-aggressive statements on various mediums blaming Sunset's failure on the gaming community's inability to ""get"" it, along with a tweet that goes, and I quote, ""Hahaha. I'm so free. Look at me. I can say ♥♥♥♥ GAMES! ♥♥♥♥ GAMERS! ♥♥♥♥ THE GAME INDUSTRY! DIE! DIE!DIE! And rot in hell!"" It's not because in Michaël Samyn's Patreon, he has a $5,000 tier listed ""Shut me up"", claiming that ""if you really want me to disappear from videogames altogether, stop writing about them but also stop trying to make them, basically get the f out of your precious hobby, all it takes is a bit of cash. Make my day!"". Tale of Tales is a pretentious blowhard of a developer, and while any developer leaving the industry is a bad thing, I can't say I'll miss them. But none of those are the reason why.The reason I don't like Tale of Tales because they don't seem to have a clear grasp on what gaming is as an artistic medium. None of their games are good in the tratitional sense, and instead they bank on their artistic value. The problem is, their games never seem to actually acknowledge the strengths of the medium. Video games are a unique artistic medium because they allow the player to interact with the story and characters in ways that no other medium can easily do, and that allows them to give unique, involving, and emotional experiences that you can't get in other mediums. Tale of Tales games are more like paintings made into video games; they're pretty to look at, and maybe you can find a meaning if you look hard enough, but there's very little to actually see or do in them, and they don't really engage the player any more than going to an art museum would. Rather than being ""games as art"", these games are more like ""art as games"", and while I'm sure some people will appreciate them, they just aren't very fun to play at all, and I'm not so sure that they even wanted them to be fun. The Path is a game where you pick one of six girls and walk around a forest (or stay on the path, but you're pretty clearly not supposed to considering 98% of what little game there is is off the path), stopping occasionally to look at things, and that's basically it. You get to Grandma's house, and then you start over with another girl. It has a great atmosphere, and the forest environments are pretty to look at for the time it was released, but that's about as far as the game goes as far as what I can compliment.			"

												The Path is a walking simulator and adventure/horror game, where the horror mostly is implied.You take on the role of one of six sisters, each representing a different stage of womanhood, from little girl who only wants to play to a grown-up woman with adult wants.Each girl enters a path through the forest, at the other end of which is grandmother's house. Walk there, and the game for that girl ends.Of course, that's not where the real gameplay is. Instead, go into the forest. A strange girl clad in white tries to guide you further away from the path, and strange white distortion on the edge of your screen guides your character to other spots. You can pick up flowers along the way (which do nothing but increase a counter -- really, you don't get a thing for picking them all up) and also find strange items. Some of these can be interacted with, many cannot as they are meant for another sister.Each item you can interact with gets added to the basket.Eventually you will find the Wolf. The Wolf takes on a form which is meaningful to the sister you're playing as, and leads her to her death. These deaths range from the obvious (little girl gets eaten) to  the vaguely implied (talent agent destroys her? Woodsman rapes her?) -- a lot of this is left to interpretation.After each wolf encounter the girl is back on the path, but the only way to go is move forward -- slowly, limping -- to grandmother's house. If you picked up the right items along the way the house becomes a kind of horror slideshow with distorted graphics and sounds reminiscent of what you found in the forest...It is a strange and unique game definitely worth playing. Just don't think you'll fully understand all of it.Also of note is that the game's demo is actually a fully separate ""level"", where you play as the Girl in White in a very different form of the forest. Fortunately it can be installed even if you own The Path.			"

												The Path is the only game from developer, Tale of Tales, that I thoroughly enjoy. If I had to narrow it down as to why that is, it would be due to the extremely mature themes and musical dissonance, combined with the exploration of the forest. Each item you find is unique to the character you play and, upon discovery, your character will interact with the object and an image will be superimposed over the screen, as if it were a memory.There are six characters in all, each with their own unique locations and encounters with the wolf. Once your encounter with the wolf has been made you are left on the path, in the pouring rain, heading for your grandmother's house one last time. Upon arrival your character experiences their final nightmare and you are returned to the home screen to choose the next playable character.The music and sound design is what becomes most dissonant in The Path. The off-tune choir of girls singing, mixed with an assortment of synths playing to heavy chains clanking in the background. It's all very unsettling.The Path focuses on very serious themes without directly implying what has happened. If you find the topics of♥♥♥♥♥♥and child abuse horrifying then I advise you not to play this game. Nothing explicit is shown, it is merely suggested. It is up to you to put the pieces together.			"

												This was my very first steam game and I've never regretted the purchase. The music, scenery and underlying message in each character's journey was something that I honestly didn't expect from what was supposed to be some kind of ""gothic Red Riding Hood"" game. I'll admit, at first I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing but after a quick run-through I got the hang of it. This game is more relaxed than most and I guess that's what caught me off guard. It's a game where the more things you discover the more warped the world turns out to be. It's a tale of innocence, destruction, pain, and discovery. Not something for everyone, but it's still one hell of a fun ride!			"

												The Path could be considered an 'art' game, which basically means you just walk around, explore and enjoy the sceneries. The game is based on a dark version of Red Riding Hood. You start by picking one of the six sisters (Red Riding Hood's) and the game tells you to stay on the path to your grandmother's house. If you stay on the path the game ends once you've reached grandmother's house, so it's best to go and explore the woods. In the woods you will find things like gravestones, campfires, humans or notes, most of them trigger some kind of interaction but are not essential for completing the game (as stated before).The Path is a game you play when you want to forget real life for a bit and just want to enter a strange but beautiful fantasy world. I would recommend this game over other 'art' games like Proteus, everyone who's into these kind of games should try this one.			"

 !No spoilers, just my honest review! I honestly dont think this should be classified as a horror game. But yolo whatever. ANYWAY,If you expect: A good story, pretty music, solid characters, spooky settings and something that keeps you guessing, this is the game. If you expect: Jump scares, ghosts, a straight foward story, a challenge and being a wolf and eating little girls, this is NOT the game. I love The Path and support it with all of my heart. But this should not of been a video game.It should of been more of maybe an interactive comic, or even a book. Even so, this is great all around. Not great as a video game but great as a story. It is very powerful. There is a lot of different ways you could take the story and it still make sense and be…well, a good story. So if you haven’t noticed by now, ITS A REALLY GOOD STORY. There is still a spooky atmosphere and sometimes you might catch yourself sitting there for a moment and thinking, “That is creepy wow okay” but never should you feel threatened or scared by anything that happens. Each girl (there is 6) experiences life in a different light. Which is beautiful. Now something that I want to say about the description of the game:""There is one rule in the game. And it needs to be broken.”This rule is; stay on the path. For new comers, my suggestion is (If you have the time) play your first round of the game staying on the path right to grandmothers house. And think about the things you see there as each sister. Then, after you have went to grandmothers house as every girl, replay the game and immediately leave the path to then find your own way around. ""There is one goal. And when you attain it, you die. “Each girls ‘death' is not as straight forward as the other. For me, some of the girls ‘deaths’ don’t seem like dying at all, but more of realizing something important in their life. (Some are obvious deaths though) Also, You do not get to see the girls die, you get to see what happens right before their deaths, if they die at all. Thats all I really have to say, but by all means, I love this game and it is wonderful.Some tips and fun things to try out:The flowers you find show you the map once in a while, so when lost, look for flowers. The path disappears if you stay off it too long.The “girl in white”s  intentions are different with each girl. There is only one way to die so do not be afraid.Dont base the game on the demo.All of the sisters names are a type of red which I thought was cool.There is a saving option in the pause menu, (Its not obvious and I kinda didn’t figure it out until my 4th play through so I thought this tip would help.)

												Just a warning. This game is obviously not for everyone. I know Steam is in no way related to Ps3, but if you know “Journey” the game or have played it and liked it then this is a lot like that. A really relaxing game when you don’t want a challenge, but something to reflect on. This is more for people who like artsy games. Some people call it pretentious and that’s fine to have that opinion. I personally have poured hours into this after long days and like to discover the symbolism and weave my own story with the pieces I find. There is really a lot you can figure out or imagine if you are into characters and stories.Basically this purely explorative. Just walk, run, look and observe. That’s all there is to it. Some people find this too basic, but I think there should be both complex and simple games out there. If you don’t like easy stories and easy games- then don’t get this. But if you’re like me and love a little exploration than this is for you. My only problem? The camera sometimes gets a little wonky when I’m observing. But it isn’t every time and it’s not like you’re going to be in one place for long. This game is otherwise beautiful!The game will tell you to stay on the path. But here is the moral of the story; if you take the road where everything is paved out for you, then you don’t earn any experiences and you don’t learn anything about life. Everything is too safe and you will never know real life. Going off the path leads you to both good and bad experiences. The story is going for a bit of a darker theme and some people might think it’s too dark, but I think you can interpret it as something a little bit less so. I don’t really want to get into spoiler territory, but I’ll just say this; death in these types of games doesn’t always literally mean death, but death to a part of a character’s personality or how they look at life. The real objective is to find each of the girls their own “wolf” which symbolizes different things. These wolves are the main even that will change their lives for better or worse. You decide. There are plenty of people who have come up with awesome theories. And that’s part of the fun! "

												This is my favourite game. It's slow and there is no ""action"" at all, it's more like an interactive story, but I always find it fascinating and have done since it came out when I was about 15. Five years later and I still think it's beautiful and kind of sad. But you have to go into it knowing that it's less like a game and more like a story. I view it as being all about the loss of innocence and how we lose it in different ways, some of the endings seem simple and suburban, but some suggest horrible, traumatic things happen. While I understand how people can't get into it or don't like it, to me it's beautiful.			"

												This is the sort of game I think tried to be too much artsy and not enough substance. It's interesting, certainly, but it's almost unfair to call it a ""Game"" and more of a sort of window into allegories of the Little Red Riding Hood story. Even then, it's mostly told through visuals (which are beautiful, mind you) that leave you putting small pieces together of what's happening rather than telling you a full story.It's novel, but... I can't recommend it. Very style-over-substance with nothing to hold it down and bring it to something engaging.			"

												More of an interactive story than a game. The game consists of searching the forest for collectible items to unlock thoughts and reactions. After interacting with each item your time at grandmothers house will be changed with different imagery to provoke thought.The game is open to massive amounts of interpretation and how you perceive and digest the images at the end of each story based on their thoughts and reactions to the objects in the forest. The devs say the girls are sent off to die, but it quickly becomes clear its an advertising thing and its more about the girls transition into adulthood. Their thoughts on how things will be, how they reacted to their life decisions and how they wish things were different. Play and see what outcome you took away from the story! Worth the money even at full price.Edit: Dont be fooled by my low play time, I watched a full playthrough on twitch with someone. Nothing changes so low re-play value but still a great thought provoking discussion piece none the less.			"

												I'd like to start by saying that I did like this game. It's easy to get lost at the start when you don't know how the game functions yet and it's hard to get all the items without a bit too much aimless wandering. But it has a reasonably well thought out story and great atmosphere. Some of the girls have more engaging and well written stories than others though which is especially noticeable in the ending sequences. This leads to some of the endings feeling significantly more fulfilling than others. At first I thought it was going to be more grim than it turned out to be due to the girl I started with and if you don't collect enough of the items the ending sequences make less and less sense. If you enjoy games that are very relaxed and mostly involve exploration you'll like this one. If you don't then you'll likely find it boring. Especially since running in the game makes it so that the environment phases out which makes it almost impossible to search for anything unless you're walking. This is a plus point for it due to the pacing of the game but it's bad if you're impatient or have really bad spacial awareness.			"

												As a piece of art, the Path delivers: emotive, curious, thought-provoking.A unique storytelling experience that relies as much on the narrative on-screen as that which the player formulates.I initially played the Path elsewhere for free and was impressed enough with the developer's vision to make a paid purchase. While there is enough content to justify the pricetag (currently $10), I strongly recommend playing the demo first, as those who enjoy this type of experience may be in the minority.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link) "

The Path is an interesting, thought-provoking game that takes a lot of pleasure in making us wonder what a 'game' is and to which extent it can blend with other genres. Playing The Path is like reading a book: there is no voice-acting, you have to read the thoughts of the six main characters to understand who they are and the nature of their desires and fears. Sometimes, it is like playing a record: the eerie, yet beautiful soundtrack plays a decisive role in setting the atmosphere of the game. The Path is not a traditional horror game: it plays with the player's sensitivity. I personally had to close the game once because I was just afraid. Afraid of the paradox that the Path presents us with: if we take the safe path and  go to grandmother's house unharmed, nothing happens (even though the grandmother is quite terrifying in my opinion, but this is not relevant here). To 'beat' the game, we have to encounter the wolf. Its form is always different, sometimes surprising. It completes and ends the girl's path, and helps us understand her better. I am currently replaying the game to better understand what happens and sharpen my interpretations.The music, the graphics, plus the work on the shading, blended with the subtle characterization of Robin, Rose, Ginger, Ruby, Carmen and Scarlet, bring into being a wonderful game. One that moves deeply and definitely asks for your point of view to become whole.			"

												Coming back to this particular title - mostly from memory unfortunately - I figured I should write a more thought out review.  I picked this title up as part of a Halloween horror bundle on Steam and can safely say it's certainly not of the horror genre. The Path is what many would call an artistic game in the most extreme sense.Most people's first reaction, mine included, was being confused as to what the goal or purpose of the title was. You play as one of six young girls at various ages in an imitation of the tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"". The first instructions you receive is to ""stay on the path"" on your way to grandma's house. This you quickly come to find is a ruse. Remaining on the path brings you swiftly to your end destination and a game ending. The real goal, if it can be called that, is to collect 144 flowers as well as stumble across objects and areas of the game which trigger memories. Each girl has their own look, locations and encounter with the wolf which is about the only variety that is present.The primary themes are of violence, sexual abuse and child abuse. This of course is not shown directly, or even indirectly, but very subtle with much of the events being left to our own interpretation. I can safely say I was highly disappointed in this and hoped it would be the best out of the horror bundle it was a part of. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this at any price personally and to keep clear from it.			"

												This game is on the thought provoking sides of things, it reimagines the tale of little red riding hood with touches of surrealism. There is no linear story, it is up to YOU the player to figure out what happened, there are lots of theories and possibilities with a game that leaves the player to think. There is no wrong or right answer with games like these, but I keep coming back to play it time and time again for the simple fact of the beauty of the world that you are centered in, the music that can become unique to each character and the simplisticness of the gameplay.

												The Path is an interesting adventure exploration game involving six red girls (Ginger, Rose, Scarlet, Rose, Carmen, and Robin) who go to Grandma's house while they explore the woods and find their own personal ""wolf"" ( except for Robin. Robin actually meets a real wolf.	). The story telling on this game is kinda complicated due to the fact that the only way they'll tell you the story is you have to make it up once you see the girl's personal ""event"". Also this game is pretty dark especially when you witness the six red girls special ""events"". I highly recommend this game if you're into story rich exploration games.

												*Tiny potential HINTS and SPOILERS*This is not a 'game' in a sense of gameplay. This is a trippy look into these girl's minds as they walk into death. To really pay attention to everything around you as you avoid the fate you are destined to walk down eventually. Grandmother's house. How long will you prolong? Will you get every piece of the puzzle to solve their lives, or maybe even their deaths?You REALLY need to stay open minded with this game, or you may end up hating it. This game, you either hate or love.PROS:Beautiful attention to detailLovely soundtrack, though trippy sometimesWell-made characters, if you ask me. They have their own quirks and stories.Left me thinking and comtemplating a lot of it, so it's basically engraved in my life now. The girl in white... I loved playing with her. That is, until I found out...Creepy and stays somewhat true to the original tale of Little Red. Other than the cloth bridge and all that. You're sort of by yourself in this forest, almost. It adds to atmostphere but can also be a hinderance at times. The isolation kind of scared me.The noises. Oh god, the noises. They really immersed me, since I was wearing headphones. I actually got really into the game, and it kind of kept me on edge. Everytime I heard a rusty swingset, I thought the girl in white was playing in a park somewhere, and set off to find it.CONS: THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EPILEPSY WARNING FOR THIS GAME (Nearly had a seizure at the end. Pictures flashed on screen to give you ideas of what happened, but I couldn't see most of it due to my epilepsy...)Easy to do a loop around the forest, AKA, get hopelessly lost.REALLY hard to find all the items, or get the wolf on first try.If you REALLY want to get back on the path, you can't exactly do that by yourself...Not everything is flat out explained, you actually have to think. Shocker, I know.OVERALL:I give this game a 7/10. It's not the game for everyone, but it's certainly the game for me, since I am a lover of art and deep stories.			"

												""Two roads diverge in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled, and it has made all the difference.""-Robert Frost, The Road Not TakenWell, this was a different game to say the least. I enjoyed it myself, so I'll give it a recommendation on that part, but I can see why people hate on it as well.So, talking about what people might not like about it first to get that out of the way. The game is very slow and often feels as if it doesn't have a set goal, until you find out what the set goal is that is. And up until then you have no real purpose in the game, and for all purposes up until the point when you realize what's happening in the game, it's just an exploration collectathon game.Now onto what I did like about.People keep on bringing up Five Nights at Freddy's when ever they talk about good hidden stories. I want those people to spend a few extra dollars on this game as it is a lot less waiting and a lot more gameplay than FIve Nights at Freddy's. The story is hidden is such a way that you have to complete the game %100, meaning collecting every memory, to get the full thing, otherwise the game can honestly be quite confusing to be honest. But if you put enough effort into finding everything in game the it's worth it in my opinion. Going onto the music in this game. It's like they took a page right out of ""Silent Hill"" and crossed it with ""The Binding of Issac"". Needless to say, I loved the music in this game. It provides a good amount of atmosphere while also allowing you to feel the safety you should while safely in Grandmother's House, assuming you did like I did and just walked down the path on your first playthrough. The music is eerie when it needs to be and calming during the majority of exploration, with sound effects mixed in to keep you on your toes.Now for the characters. Having the old story of Little Red Riding Hood protrayed in this sense was really interesting to see. Even though only one character even slightly resembles the fairy tale character (Robin), it still allows for each character to have the same story of misplaced trust and betrayal, which was what the original Grimm fairy tale was about. This is another aspect of the game that you can't experience in it's whole unless you play the game to 100% completetion. It adds replayablity for somebody like me and adds to the overall charm of the characters. Also adding a different walk cycle for each character to further drive their personality was another good idea that we don't often see in games today, as most games, even triple a games, only have a single walk cycle for every character.What would I rate this game on ERSB?T for sexual content, Blood, tabacco use, frightening content, and mature themes.My overall rating of the game:8/10			"

												I wanted to like it. I watched a friend play through one of the girl's story line, and I thought Id love it since Im a sucker for a game with a story with a message. There isnt much ""game"" to it though. You play as one of a bunch of girls, wandering in a forest until you meet her ""wolf""/how she loses innocence. The game only tells you to stay on the path, which of course, you can do, or you can wander off. The game doesnt explain that the real goal is to collect flowers and find objects that trigger memories of the girl you are currently playing, so my first playthrough, I just ran through until I found the ""wolf"", and was then disappointed with how shallow the event seemed, and confused why the character I was playing was so effected by the event (the theater story comes to mind, and I still have no idea why it effected her or why I should care, as cruel as that sounds).The controls are pretty basic. W and shift to run, or use your mouse. But if you play in windowed, the mouse isnt locked to the screen and gets annoying very quickly. Music is repetitive, but isnt bad. Graphics are pretty nice and I liked the aesthetic of the game quite a bit.My real problem with this game, and why I cant recommend it though, is that it lacks clarity of your goal. If you dont go find flowers or hunt for objects, you wont trigger memories and you wont learn anything about the character you are playing. Its very hard to feel much of anything for a character when you have no context of that character. And if you arent very attached to the characters, then the message the developer is trying to convey gets lost beyond a very basic ""lost innocence"" concept. Someone in another review suggested that this game be called ""interactive digital art"", and I would have to agree. If you go into this looking at it as a piece of interactive art, Im sure most people would enjoy it, but if you go into this looking for a game, you are probably going to be disappointed.			"

												First, this game has its merits.  It has great atmosphere and the graphics aren't bad and the gameplay itself is creative and thought-provoking.  But straight up, if you don't like games that have an inconsistent story that gives you no answers, The Path isn't for you.  If you like games that make you think...The Path probably still isn't for you.Tale of Tales as a developer has completely imploded their own fanbase with their behavior lately, yes, and it's really made me reconsider this game.  Originally I thought a lot of thought went into this game; the developers established Livejournal accounts for the characters, there are a lot of details in the game, the girls all have some sort of personality and it seems like there's a mysterious story unfolding behind all this.It sure SEEMS that way.But the thing is, if you set up a mystery that no one else can solve and then insist that they don't ""get it"" because it's ABOUT not solving the mystery, but about ""appreciating"" the ""puzzle as it was left unsolved,"" then that sort of makes you sound deep and mysterious yourself.  It sort of shifts the focus from the creation and onto the creator, the only person who has any answers about the otherwise completely unintelligible piece of work.  And frankly, after their freakout, Tale of Tales definitely sounds like a duo way more interested in shifting attention onto themselves.And I was really committed to putting together the puzzle of The Path once.  I pulled apart the girls' Livejournals and was really baffled that their situation seemed to indicate that The Path was an experience they had...all the time?  Regularly?  And that their mother insisted they only go on the path itself by themselves??  It started to seem like the developers were not interested in creating some macabre version of hell or surreal depiction of time, but had set up characters they could pretty much do whatever they pleased with, as long as that gave them attention.Honestly, if you set up a game to seem all deep and mysterious with individual sad stories to piece together, but then roleplay your characters as just whatever, it sorrrrta seems like you actually got nothing to say.I didn't want to believe this was the case before, but after seeing their attitude about the failure of their game Sunset, their interest in only having a small (elite) fanbase, and their total disregard for making their games accessible to people, I just don't think the people behind Tale of Tales possess the sympathy and depth to create a game that demonstrates sympathy and depth.It was a huge disappointment.The Path is not deep.  The Path does not have secret answers or an underlying meaning.  The Path is just a very creative atmosphere, all dressed up with nowhere to go.  If you get something out of it, it'll be inspiration for some better story.			"

A game so intriguing, interesting and innovative, and yet painfully simple and fun, that you are flabbergasted as to why it didn't exist before now.This isn't one of those games. Don't buy it.			"

												The path is a game that is hated and loved, misunderstood and dreamed of. You have to be open minded and want to go on a very slow, deep adventure through the woods. Seriously! Take your time. Enjoy the music and follow the stories six girls have to face in their lives. The little red riding hood. Different and dark. It's a modern fairytale. I understand if people don't like it. For me it's a piece of art. One of my favorite games. Try it for yourself and stay on the path...			"

												So... This definetly isn't for everyone. This is an art game, and should be experienced with that in mind. Like all art, it becomes what it is at the line where the artist/s & viewer/participant meet. Yes, it is highly open for enterpretation, and some people hate that & crave conclusions, goals & answers. However, unlike what I would consider ""failed"" art, where it's just a matter of a pretentious pile of worthlessness you're asked to find your own (non existent) meaning in because the artist really didn't have anything to really bring to the table, this does work!When it comes to art games, I love the fact that you're not just watching something here, you are participating. Making choices where to go and what or who to interact with, and with which character. You are also asked to find your own meanings, associations and how to feel about it.I don't always enjoy slow paced art games, believe me. But this I did. I enjoy the beauty of it, the sombre feeling, the symbolism, the sometimes surprising thoughts the girls have upon finding places or things. And there is a lot to be found, both within the game world, and subsequently within yourself. I was pleasently surpised, and rather intruiged.I'm hesitant to recommend it though, because like I allready mentioned, it is not gonna appeal to everyone. Just know it is slow paced, not very scary if that's what you're after, but more atmospheric, in a David Lynch kind of way.My complaints are that there are some clippings and graphical glitches, but nothing really noteworthy for this type of game. Also the music may get a bit repetetive and get on your nerves if you sit through too long a session, I would have prefered it a bit less vocal & more ambient, but it's no big issue. However, the color of the text in game *is* a real issue though, because many times it is near impossible to read against the background. That's a real shame because those texts are some of the things you long for the most in between the wandering in the forest, and aim to have show up to enhance your story & get more of the girls personalities.But over all, I thought it was a remarkable experience. Also, just have to add, that I loved the setting and design within the frame of Little Red Riding Hood! An excellent choice for artistic, emotional and psychological experiences.SPOILER! For those who like to theorise: I do believe, like many others, that this is a story about growing up. Some elements of this can be found in the tales of Little Red Riding Hood as well, so it's rather fitting. I see it as how we loose something as we grow, but it's inevitable. To ""win"" the game, you have to make each girl meet her wolf, and ""die"" a little. If you just go straight to grandma's house, you're there safe and sound, but you haven't learned anything. Each girl represents a different age, the youngest one makes comments about how she is a kid, she's a kid, and it reminds me of how some children want to play baby even though they are too young really. Like when a sibling shows up and they are suddenly the older one who needs to grow up. Likewise the older ones are starting to get interested in alcohol and sex, yet still being naive. They think they want a certain thing but it costs to know these things/experience them.			"

												I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to indie games, and I have a real fondness for less conventional games like Dear Esther and Gone Home. But The Path seriously pushed me to my limits of tolerance on this front. It's a game that is very obviously trying too hard, and lets its own mechanics get in the way of whatever point it's trying to make. Be warned, if you're going to give this one a chance at all, go play it yourself and come back because I'm going to spoil the hell out of it. I'm sure it's even less effective if you know what to expect.You pick one of six girls fresh from Hot Topic to visit their grandmother in the woods. The game tells you up front to stay on the path, and here it commits possibly its greatest sin. My first time through I made the slow walk straight down the path to a surprisingly sinister house. Inside the pitch-black cottage the girl made her way to her corpse-like grandmother and laid down next to her. The game then informed me that I had found no items, unlocked no rooms, not encountered the wolf, and that I had failed.So, to reiterate, the game told me to do a thing, I did the thing, and then it told me I failed.YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU ♥♥♥♥S. If subversion of authority is a theme of your game then you need to introduce it in some way within the body of the game! I'm not going to read your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed treatise on your store page to figure out how to play your game. Fine, whatever, I picked another girl and walked straight off the path. The lighting and sound get creepy until you run across some random point of interest in the woods, like a theater stage or sofa or TV or pond. There are items to collect like knives and two-headed teddy bears. I met a little ballerina girl who spouted some nonsense about chaos and led me back to the path. After a whole bunch of exploring I went back to grandma's house. I got treated to a slightly different path through the rooms and then another screen that said I failed.At this point I gave up trying to figure out what the game wants. Wandering the woods is interesting for a bit, but hamstrung by the glacial speed at which you move and the horrible sketchy-artsy filters the game vomits all over your view. There's really no common theme or identifiable symbolism to the junk you find, either. It's just weird for the sake of being weird. Or maybe it isn't... the store page says the optimal experience is to play for 6 hours. There are something like 13 items to collect and another 144 flowers you can pick, but I doubt very much I'm going to divine The Path's true meaning if I keep at it.Appropriating the creepy side of Red Riding Hood isn't a bad idea for a game, but this one gets so caught up in trying to be clever and poignant that it all falls completely flat. Maybe there's something to find in here, but it's too damn boring and obtuse to get at it.			"

												People keep praising the game, but I don't really see any lasting appeal - Sure, the game looks pretty and has a haunting atmosphere with great visual characterization of all the girls, but it doesn't really do anything with that potential gameplay-wise.You just kinda wander through the forest, get repeatedly lost, and randomly stumble upon awkwardly out-of-place locations of interest where you can have some minimal interaction.Which reminds me - Whoever thought it would be a good idea to make people keep their hands away from the controls if they want the character to use/examine something? It's pretty counter-intuitive.It really is an art.... gamey thing. I guess it's trying to tell you a story, but having seen all there is in the game, I do not see any coherent plot of any description, no lesson to be learned. It's just a few disconnected half-finished narratives shoe-horned into a 3d environment.Am I being too harsh? Absolutely. I'm all for games as art, but for the love of god, let me DO something involving in the game.PS.I played the game outside of Steam, hence why it shows just 5 minutes. "

												Im not sure whether i can even call this a game.It starts by letting you to choose 1 of 6 available female characters. Once you've made your selection, the objective is to walk / run down a path towards the character's grandmother's house in the distance. At least this is whats stated in the message that appears.Now, the strange thing is, if you do exactly what it tells you, you will eventually reach the house, go up to the grandmother's bedroom, and LOSE. Wait what? Yes, you actually get a message showing a score you've obtained, and proclaiming that you lost the game.So how do you play? Well, you sort of don't. Its hard to explain. It doesn't seem to have any actual objective and perhaps the way to play is to just wander around. Music is surreal and spooky and the whole thing just feels wierd.Overall Rating: 4.0 / 10I don't think this is even a game. Perhaps interactive digital art is a better term. Give it a few points more if you like the concept.			"

												I normally love exploration games, but this one tests my patience too much. It claims to have all sorts of narrative aspects, but frankly, unless you read over the store description for the game, it's clear as mud, because there's no actual real narrative within the game. You basically spend the game wandering around until you find a cut scene, and you can only find one cut scene per playthrough. The speed at which your character traverses the world is excruciating, and if you try to move faster by running, you get punished because the camera moves into an angle making it impossible to see where you're going.The game description goes on about how this is such a mature game with themes unsuitable for children -- frankly, the original tale of Red Riding Hood is miles scarier than this. Mostly it's more confusing than scary.It'll take you several hours if you want to actually find all the stuff in the game, and most of that time will be spent rather repetitively recovering the same ground you've already covered. I can think of more entertaining ways to waste my time than slowly meandering through the same stuff over and over again.The music is also annoyingly repetitive. Over and over, the same little music snippet. It's interesting for a few minutes, but after a while, you start to wish this game had more soundtrack to it.			"

												The Path can be compared to walking in a gallery with ugly modern ""art"", or listening to some very dissonant ""music"". Disgusting and revolting, pretentious piece of crap. And no, I don't think I'm missing ""the point"" of the ""game"". I regret spending money on it, and if it were possible, I'd give anti-money to its creators (I'd give 20 $ so that they can lose 20 $).  What's the gameplay and the setting? Basically you walk through a boring, endless forest with disgusting colour palette, terrible graphical filters and scratched words with illegible annoying font going across the screen for no reason. There are a couple of cut-scenes that can be triggered in the forest, there's a metaphor for taking risks in life (straying from the path that leads little red riding hood to granny's house), and a metaphor for how life rapes you in the end no matter what you do.I felt dirty after playing this, I wanted to take a shower multiple times, it was such a disgusting experience. No gameplay, no meaningful story (except for some lousy metaphors I mentioned above), ugly, unpleasant to the senses on a very visceral level, nauseating, pretentious, artsy-fartsy, irrational, waste of time. I even wonder if I should write this review - it may attract attention and make people wonder ""is it really that bad"", thus making them give money to the creators of this abomination and losing hours of their life on something that cannot be unseen. Guys, make no mistake, I like indie games, dark games, depressing games, I like intelligent sophisticated games with a message and unique ideas or perspective. Trust me, this isn't the case here, this is the worst ""game"" I have ever seen in my whole life.			"

												If you're looking for action and adventure, don't buy this game. If you're looking for jumpscares, don't buy this game. But if you're looking for subtle tension, thoughtful and ambiguous themes, implied and frankly somewhat disturbing horror, and beautiful art, buy this game. It's an atmospheric game, and the developers create the atmosphere perfectly. Oh and if you're afraid of thinking, this game isn't for you.You begin in an apartment where you can pick one of six sisters. Each sister has different items you can interact with in the forest/a different wolf (not a literal wolf except in the case of the youngest sister, Robin). Each encounter could be interpreted many different ways. Personally I think that it's a loss of innocence story. Each girl meets something that they must face as they move into adulthood. The wolf is the most important part of the story. Once you reach the end of a girl's story, you will be told ""success"" or ""failure"" based upon whether or not you met the wolf (meeting the wolf=success). You also get a rating based upon how many of the girl's individual items/secret rooms you found.I've played for an hour and that's enough time to meet the wolf with two girls and collect about half of their items. However, you can spend hours in this game if you have enough patience. There are tons of different disturbing endings you can get based on which items you collect.Do note that the game is not ""complete"" until you've found the wolf which each sister (by leaving the path) and then walk the path with the girl who presumably represents childhood innocence. Then the game restarts and you can try again with a girl you've already found a wolf with.Overall it's not a fun game. It's a thinking and patience game that tells its story with beautiful art and excellent atmosphere. It's a great work and easily worth $10.			"

												The Path is a ""game"" in the loosest sense of the word. The graphics are nothing impressive, and the gameplay consists of wandering aimlessly through the forest. The only challenge to this game is in trying to derive the author's intended message from the assorted uses of symbolism throughout the story. Even though I generally enjoy analyzing a game's storyline and underlying messages, it becomes a bit of a chore to do when there's no substantial gameplay to accompany it.If you're the literary geek type who enjoys analyzing symbols and metaphors in books and movies, this might be for you. But if you're more interested in playing games for having interesting, challenging  mechanics, then you'll most likely just be left with a sour taste in your mouth, as well as a desire to play something with more engaging gameplay.

												Right off the bat, I’ll say you as the player will either love this atmospheric exploration game or it’ll really wear on your patience fast. It can be mind-numbingly slow, confusing, and the controls are tolerable at best. There is almost no gameplay beyond exploration and collecting to speak of. Still I do recommend this game very highly to exploration lovers, role-players, and players with active imaginations. For these players I promise this game will have a lot of the things they enjoy in gaming.Honestly, while I do highly recommend this game as stated above for open-minded players and exploration lovers. Personally, I found this game initially to be rather boring and hard to get into. As I tend to play more direct story driven and action oriented games. Yet, I decided to give The Path the play time I needed to honestly judge it. Out of sheer determination fueled by the other good reviews. Which generally said the game would get better if given time. For which was true in my case. I slowly started to get into this game as my predetermined notions of what makes good gameplay faded with each step I took into the dark woods. I quickly realized this game almost requires at least an hour or two to really judge it. Due to the game’s slow placing and subtle influences.None of the game’s story line is directly force upon the player and is instead left to them to find and figure-out. While, initial gameplay as stated above may leave the gamer lost and confused. Once they do discover their story oriented purpose in game, either through sheer luck or logical deduction. Story-driven events will start to playout more often for them and the story should start to become clearer in their mind. Leading to the player’s enjoyment level most likely increasing or at least I believe so. As in my case, once I got that ah-ha! moment I started enjoying myself. I have on purpose been rather vague with the details for those who do not like spoiler reviews so far. But for those who would like more to go off of. When deciding whether to give this interesting game a go or would like to just know more of what’s really going on in it. The follow two sections go into more descriptive detail. The first covers the gameplay elements and “generically” describes the goal of the game. The second further down one describes the games goal in-depth and does contains some direct story spoilers. Each section is tag with a warning label for those who rather avoid spoilers. If you choose to read on or not thank you very much for taking the time to read my review. - Olyth--- WARNING: Gameplay related spoilers below ---This game is ulitmately very dark and twisted. From the start you’re given two important choices to make. One which is obvious: Which of the young ladies would you like to play? The other, which is subtly hinted at: Is your chosen maiden going to be a good girl by following the given directions to head straight to her grandmother’s house without deviation or is she going to venture off the beaten path and explore the dark woods?So logic would dictate initially you of course would obediently follow the directions you’re given and go straight to grandma’s house without deviation, right? Oh, how obedience in this game is so overrated. All you’ll get for your goody-two-shoes effort is a whopping “D” rating as your character arrives to sit at the bedside of her dead-looking grandmother. While the words “FAILURE” is plastered across your screen. Before the game unceremoniously plops you back on the character selection screen. Yep, the game wants your little Miss to be a disobedient minor. If you hope to receive anything above a “D” rank and some acknowledged “SUCCESS!”Now if you’re girl does like to venture on the wild side and decides a little trip in the woods would be fun. Things are going to get a tad dark and atmospheric. As the game’s bright and cheery visuals turn quickly into a dark and eerie wooded locale with some lite horror elements introduced to set the mood. Also, to make things more interesting within mere seconds of leaving the path you’ll be completely lost and finding yourself walking in circles. Sounds like fun right? Well yes and somewhat no.Wondering the woods lost is basically the initial core of the gameplay. As the girl explores she’ll come across random items and some limited interactions with other characters. Which is intended to give the player hints and imagery to build upon to develop their own personalize interpretation of the game’s story. Which not surprising will make the initial experience very confusing. Borderline leading to some to rage quit out of frustration and boredom.  As they will be most likely waiting for the game to give them a purpose or at least a goal to work towards. Something the player may gain either within a few minutes or may take upwards of an hour or two to figure out. If they stick around long enough. Depending on a little luck and a lot of patience.After the player finishes his or her first character’s playthrough in the woods, either by coming across a key event or staying lost and running out of time. The goal of the game kind of becomes clear to the player to a certain point. Which is to lead each girl one-by-one to their horrible demise. For which the player receives higher ratings depending on how many items they found and if they located the girl’s personal key event. I did say the game was dark and twisted.--- WARNING: Contains story related spoilers ---As I mention above the player is rated on whether the player choices to collect items and if they find the girl’s personal key event. By Now I sure you've most likely figure out from the game visuals and the fact that the girrls all wear red. This game is based off the Red Riding Hood Fable. So the key event the player is ultimately looking for to get the best rating is to locate the other main character in the red-riding hood story besides Red and Grandma. The big bad wolf who wants to eat the young maiden. Pretty obvious huh, if you think about it. Yep, what you’re now thinking is correct: the player’s ultimate goal to get the best rating is to systematically hunt down the wolf and sacrifice their poor character to him. With each girl’s experience in the process being unique and the wolf being a little different for each of them. Due to girls being of different ages and having their own personalized perspective of the events as they encounter them.As the player finds girl’s personalize beast, they get to watch some unique cut-scenes of Red's and the wolf's initial encounter. Some being more entertaining than others. Before being taken to just outside their grandma’s house and allowed to enter it. Although, this visit is not as visually cheery as the good girl’s visit. Each girl gets their own twisted nightmarish version of the house to briefly tour. Before the player is shown the girl’s fate in the form of multiple image stills depicting their gruesome death by the big teeth and claws of their wolf. Followed by the player receiving a chapter completion prompt with that “SUCCESS!” they were looking for and an overall ranking as describe above. Afterwards, the player is returned to the character screen to select their next victim. With the deceased girls no longer being present alluding to the horrors that befell them. Now what happens, when only a few girls are left or better yet; none…..? Is there something sinister going on behind the scenes. Maybe something to do with the memories and visions the girls saw. Well I going to leave that’s for the player to figure out; enjoy! Thanks again for reading my review/overview.			"

												Highly recommended. The Path tells the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, at various different ages. It is a coming of age story about women, and has underlying themes that are sexual and violent. A fable like Little Red Riding Hood seems straightforward, which is one reason we keep telling it. But why keep telling a simplistic story over and over again unless it has some meaning? The meaning, and other reason we still tell it, is that Little Red Riding Hood highlights the dangers of a girl's coming of age. People complain the Path can be completed by just walking forward. The game allows you to reach an end stage that way, if you want it to be that straightforward. But you can also spend more time learning about the story and the different little Red Riding Hoods (or stages of her life) if you want.  The freedom to finish the game on your own time is a good gameplay mechanic.This was one of the first digital games I bought (not on Steam, initially), and so it also gets props for that.			"

												As an experience, this game is is a must however gameplay is quite simplistic. At most you will be exploring and collecting items. If you want something a little more complicated in terms of gameplay, I can't promise you will love this. This game's atmosphere is hauntingly beautiful and to no small credit to the music that plays you through your exploration through the seemingly endless, dark wood. That is, if you choose to stray off of the path. The best part of the game is the look, the sound, and theorizing about the things you will see and do as each of the girls. If that's something that appeals to you, you gotta check this one out.			"

												The Path isn't a game I feel confident in recommending, in fact it isn't even the kind of game I usually enjoy as I'm more of a narrative focused person. But I finally got around to playing it and it's actually quite good. The art style is beautiful and creepy, with a very unsettling soundtrack that builds ambiance well. Each of the girls do have their own personality, even just in the way they walk around, and the 'wolf encounters' were very unique to every girl. I also found something strangely soothing about walking around that forest and exploring, despite how uncanny everything felt it was nice just to wander. I didn't think the rating screen or the number of collectibles were necessary, in fact they felt very out of place, but the different memories did give further insight into the characters. There isn't much gameplay other than walking and interacting with objects plus story itself is not very clear, and if you play The Path I'd say check out some of the theories online because they're very interesting, but this game is more about the atmosphere and exploration than straight storytelling.Personally I think this is a great little game, it's unusual but effective and it's at least worth thinking about. However I would say really consider if this is something you want to play. Look at the description and the screenshots, be aware that it's slow-paced with an ambiguous story but don't just dismiss it because of that. If you give it a chance then you could end up enjoying it, but it's definitely not for everybody.			"

												This game is...weird.  It tells you to stay on the path, but don't.  Go off into the woods, and reality turns into an enigma that needs to be solved, and that's what makes this game so interesting to me.  Mysterious objects scattered about, your grandmother's house changes depending on what you do, and a mysterious girl that can lead you back to the path if you get lost.  I've only scraped the surface of this game, and I'm going back for more, and yet I wonder if I'm doing it right.			"

The music is awesome and the graphics (not their quality but their theme) underline the whole atmosphere well.Personally it set me back to my childhood, playing alone in the woods when I was a little girl still and generally not being aware of the danger I might put myself into. Some of the girls / their wolves caused me to rethink situations from back then, that I barely remember.If you're in for an atmospheric, meaningful game experience then buy it. If you're casual gamer out for 'fun' and some action then just dont buy it I'd say.			"

												I'm going to have to say that this is the only good game that Tale of Tales has made so far. It's the only one with substance.It's not really a game in the traditional sense, more of an interactive experience. But unlike The Graveyard (walk forwards and then die) and Fatale, this actually has things to do, places to explore, things to find, and substantial content. Each of the playable characters has their own personality and has different thoughts to give, and different things to find in this neverending forest. I think Tale of Tales should look at this and learn for their future games, as they haven't made anything nearly this good since.			"

												I was unsure of how much I would like this game when I first purchased it, but it quickly has become a game that I love playing. Inspired by the tale of Red Riding Hood, it does stick with the basic story quite well. There are different characters that you can play as, and they all have their own wolf that they eventually come face-to-face with while travelling to Grandma's House. The graphics are not as great as many of the more modern games that there are, but the special effects are lovely, and give the game an overall horror-esque vibe to it. The various characters that you can select from are all unique in their personality and how they interact with the items in the woods, and make the game to play through multiple times to see their ending.  The gameplay is simple, but make it so that you can enjoy the game all the more. This is definitely a game that I'd recommend to anyone.			"

												Surely it requires a certain mindset and mood to play The Path, but I found it easily enough to get into it once I allowed myself to be drawn in by this.. I appreciated music, feel and art style, even though I often am reluctant to call it a 'game' because it simply does not offer a whole lot in the way of actual 'gameplay'. Still, at this price, I didn't think anyone could go wrong. Maybe get the demo to receive some insight, but doing too much research and background checking on the setup and story would definitely ruin the experience. Just let go and dive in.			"

												Intriguing game. Would I recommend it ? I'm not sure. The graphics are decent and the music is pretty good, but it did start to annoy me after a while. But about the game... Your characters walk slow, even running is slow. It's not past paced and I appreciate that. It's unlike any game you've ever played before. You select one of six girls, and your objective is to walk to your grandmother. You can use the normal path for this or you can go through the woods (which is what you're supposed to do). In the woods you can find items and things that you can pick up or interact with. Supposedly every girl has her own story, which you can try and find out by collecting the items. I haven't figured one out so far, since you only get small hints.It's not a game you play for hours and hours. But if you like psychological stuff this might be for you.[Rating: 71/100]			"

As you play with each sister you'll meet their ""wolf"". Pretty good atmosphere, but it is a very casual game.			"

												Tale of Tales makes a lot of experimental and ""art house"" video games but The Path is the one game they've made that feels the most like a game but still keeps their distinct style. It essentially is a modern telling of Little Red Riding Hood. You take control of one of six girls instructed to go to their grandmother's house in the woods. This game is all about atmosphere and exploration, mood, finding things and deeper issues like making decisions and facing consequences for them. It is quite literally a game you can get lost in.

You gotta walk around, get creeped out a bit, slowly have the fear edge into you then have it all come together in the end.

You're told to stay on the path and avoid the wolf, but if you do what you're told, you don't get to experience anything this game has to offer.The Path is a mystery that needs to be unraveled. As you explore, you find more things and learn more about each of the girls, and you may bump into the ""wolf"". For each of the girls, meeting the wolf is a life-changing experience.The game is a very interesting mystery and an engaging metaphor, but when held to the normal standards for a video game, The Path is severely lacking. The controls are completely awful. The aesthetic is nice, but the actual graphic quality is pretty poor. The sound is odd, which is fitting for this game. The gameplay is slow. Really, really slow. You'll need a lot of patience.The game description on Steam should be taken seriously. This game is not for children.The Path is definitely not for everyone. Pick it up if an arthouse title with difficult metaphors interests you, but if you're looking for a fun game, this is not it. $10 is probably a bit much; wait for it to go on sale.			"

												This is a very hard game to quantify into a catagory, genre group or ranking. Not truely a game, but not enough of an indie classic to be called ""art""; to me it stands on its own as a psychological examination of life and what it means to mature from childhood to adulthood for the six sisters of this thriller/horror interactive piece.You have one objective: get to grandma's and do not leave the path. But you have no choice but to leave the path to truely experience this game.This is NOT a game for people who do not have patience. There is a hell of a lot of backtracking and blind searching as you uncover the clues of the characters, their habits, personalities and innocence. A completionist run for a single character can easily take away three hours while you listen to the same eerie music over and over, challenging your mental memory and the occassional flashes of the trail you've left behind while getting hopelessly lost in the forest.Compared to a similar indie ""art"" game, To The Moon, this interactive title is certainly very similar in the amount of love that the development team put into this piece. But unfortunately the message isn't as clear as it could have been without being a completionist or cheating and hitting GameFAQs for a plot synapsis.As an art deco title, it's a game that must be played at least once in your life. English Literature and Psychology Majors will get a real kick out of this title, as well people with an interest in slow-paced thriller and horror games. But other than that recommendation, think really hard before you purchase this title if it isn't on sale: it is a difficult one to recommend to casual and mainstream gamers.I lean on the said of ""yes"" because I really appreciate these types of games. But then I'm a student of psychology.			"

												An interesting piece this one. The Path was designed by artists, not game developers. It's pretty important to keep that in mind when playing. It uses the interactive ""game"" medium to draw the audience into the atmosphere, and the interpretive nature of the game can sometimes be frustrating. But the fun is letting go of your assumptions and just seeing what's going on. Just stop asking, and let it happen. Minimal replay value, but a unique one-time experience. It's an experiment of the medium, and I applaud that.			"

												A work of art is a work of art, and it's difficult to critique it. Ultimately a critique will have more to do with whether you liked it/whether it resonated with you/how it affected you, and that's not a review, that's a response.On the other hand, a work of interactive fiction has some responsibilities that have nothing to do with its message. The Path has terrible, confusing controls. Some of the controls sometimes work and sometimes don't. Most places you walk by holding down W/up arrow/forward, but in one place you have to tap it repeatedly instead. You spend way too much time being forced to walk one ... mile ... an hour ... I understand drama, but the basic walk speed should have been about double what it is. The times you have to walk the last stretch to Grandma's house are agonizingly slow.There's supposed to be an action button, but I generally was only able to interact with things by approaching them until a ghostly closeup appeared in the window, then taking my hand off the controls. Having actions happen when controls aren't being manipulated is TERRIBLE interface design.And then there are the location indicators along the outside of the screen. Given that most of the forest is empty, this is your primary means of locating the things you're looking for. But it doesn't respond quickly, it's hard to judge distances, and the map only pops up occasionally (!)I'm not going to even attempt to talk about The Path's artistic merits. But even if this were the world's most beautiful painting, you'd still be looking at it through a broken, filthy window from 300 feet away. The weakness of the interface makes the basic act of playing through the work tedious and unpleasant.I'd include a trigger warning for sexual violence imagery, but ... it's a freakin' Little Red Riding Hood game. Saying there's♥♥♥♥♥♥imagery in an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood is like saying there's dairy in a glass of whole milk.			"

												Please note that The Path may not be everyone's cup of tea. It's not what some would consider a ""game"", but more of a story shrouded by symbolism and is incredibly artsy. If you hate games that are almost purely story driven and more of an experience, then you might want to look elsewhere.For a person like me, The Path is just the type of thing I love. Not only is there dark and mature themes, but the symbolism is absolutely brilliant if you notice them. I also enjoyed the ""Red Riding Hood"" theme the game had going for it. After replaying a few times and discussing the story with others, I realized the game is actually very open for a lot of interpretation. More so than I anticipated. The ideas that many have come up with have only enriched the experience for me.Basically, you have several sisters, each very different from each other, and their goal is to get to grandmothers house to deliver some goods. The rule is to not stray from the path, but it has to be broken in order for the girls to encounter the wolf. If you do not want to be spoiled or have my opinion on the wolves and their interpretation with each girl, please skip the next paragraph.In my opinion, each girl represents a stage of life. The wolves are an experience that one must go through to grow up. These experiences may be harmful or scarring, but like in the game, the girls get up, wounded, and make their way back to grandma's house. The whole story is about growing up. Letting your curiousity getting the better of you, getting wounded, but growing up a little. The path is a safe life without exploration. There is no harm, but neither do you learn anything. That is why you get a failure screen when you do not encounter the wolf.As for it's length, if you just buzz through the main task at hand, it is very short and you also miss a lot of added story. Each girl has items and unlockables. There is also 144 ""flower coins"" to collect if you so chose. In my opinion, the replay value only lasts as long as there is something that you missed, which just to note that the forest is randomly generated each time so finding everything will be a challange if you switch girls or start over. Unless you are the type that enjoys resetting the game and starting fresh repeatedly, you probably will complete the game once and rarely touch it again.			"

												One of the most frequent criticisms of The Path is that it's not really ""a game"". And it's not. If you want a capital-G Game, look elsewhere. But does that need to be a criticism?What is it, then, if not a game? It's an experiential marvel. The only game I've ever seen with more atmosphere than The Path is the similarly un-game-like Dear Esther. While the theme of Little Red Riding Hood is so incredibly overdone in interactive storytelling circles (though few have made it to commercial release), The Path has an interesting enough take on it to be worthwhile. The characterisation is superb, although you have to search for it and even then it's expressed in a very minimal fashion. Each of the girls is likeable but flawed, and, without wanting to spoil too much, each one is ultimately undone by her flaw. While not a game in the ludic sense, interactivity does play a vital part of the experience, creating a sense of ""discovering"" the story and also creating emotional resonance by making the player complicit in sealing the girls' fates.The negative sides of the game are that sometimes atmosphere takes precedence over technical considerations. Sometimes the text that's communicating the story is illegible because it doesn't contrast strongly enough with the background, and sometimes the game just gets too dark to see what's going on, which I guess is supposed to be scary, but just ends up being frustrating.I can't recommend this without qualification, because it's not for everyone. Indeed, that's one of its strongest points! If you're interested in something that isn't quite a ""game"" in the traditional sense, are willing to put effort into engaging with it rather than having everything neatly presented to you, and your narrative sensibilities tend toward feeling rather than thinking, it's definitely worth a look.

												I'd only recommend this game to a particular audience--one who can appreciate abstract atmospheric horror and isn't put off by slow gameplay. The horror portrayed in The Path is not the jump-scare, fast-paced kind that most gamers are accustomed to, but is found in the dark visual storytelling which is left almost entirely up to interpretation. This game has a very unique artistic style which very effectively sets the mood. I found the character movement to be excruciatingly slow for the most part, but worth the patience in the end.			"

But this game opened my eyes and made me realize that death is no joke, and I began to experience overwhelming emotions of empathy and remorse, for both real life and video game people! Don't watch someone on YouTube play this game, for that would simply not do this game justice! Play it for yourself alone in a dark room, isolated from the sounds and visuals of the real world, and let yourself get absorbed in this immaculate and emotional dreamscape!

												The Path is certainly a different gaming experience. A modern, gothic take on the classic Red Riding Hood Tale that articulates the dark cautionary elements quite well in subtle ways.The game has but one objective: Go to grandmother's. Upon doing so, this means you've somehow lost the game, so as it turns out, you are actually encouraged to disobey the rules, and adventure into the dark, dreary forest, interacting with objects in the woods, skipping freely, getting completely lost. Eventually, you, as one of six 'Red' girls, will find what represents the Wolf, in one of it's various incarnations. Upon meeting the wolf, you are taken back to the path, completely desolate and somber as you tread quietly to grandmother's in the rain. There, grandmother's house is no longer a sweet old lady's cottage but an absolute mind-♥♥♥♥ where you die, but you technically succeed in the game.While the game is completely open to interpretation, and is more art-focused, this reward of defeat, especially after a character has been presumably injured, molested, or otherwise attacked, raises a few questions, considering rather than being able to outsmart the wolf, once you are locked into the animation, there is no way of fighting back. You essentially play 6 victims. Again, this is more of an artistic form of story telling, but it still raises a few questions. Overall, visually, the game is appropriately sharp and goregous with a bit of an aesthetic to intice gamer-cult followings, and the soundtrack is fascinating and at times intensley dark. With so many themes and theories out there, this is a game for anyone who's looking for a different gaming experience, or for someone starting out in indie gaming. Or, simply for anyone into either gothic things or fairy tales.			"

												""Do you recommend this game?"" With The Path, that is surprisingly hard to answer.""Yes"" if you are the type of gamer that likes something different from everything else you've played, won't let technical flaws distract you from immersing yourself in a well developed game world and enjoy stories with a dark side.""No"" if you have a short attention span that demands action be part of all gaming, tend to call things ""pretentious"" that others call ""artsy"", can't stand to be limited to an all female cast of playable characters or don't have a penchant for the macabre.Let me be more specific. My biggest complaint with this game is that it is clunky. It doesn't control well and your character will occasionally get hung up on things. Fortunately I never got permanently stuck, but there were several times that had me holding my breath. Aside from that, the slow pacing left me tapping my foot at times. Each character moves at a different speed which, in my opinion, doesn't add anything positive to the game. It just makes playing all of the slower characters less enjoyable. There are also certain locations where the ability to run is disabled. For that reason alone I found myself trying to avoid these locations even though otherwise they were often the most interesting places.With all that said, don't count The Path out yet. Its atmosphere is one to get lost in. The art style fits well and is altered heavily at times throughout the game to help heighten the feeling they are going for. The music perfectly matches what's going on and is hauntingly memorable. The stories told in this non-linear open world format are engrossing, if a bit too steeped in symbolism for my taste.Overall, it feels like the type of first game an independent developer would put out: Rough around the edges but a bright eyed, inspired piece of art that isn't afraid to test the boundaries of what a video game is.

												This is a very beautiful art game with lovely visuals and music, with red riding hood themes. It lets you play and observe various character's view points and personalities as you wonder the woods for items and an encounter that might alter their lifes. A very story based game told in an untraditional method, being very cryptic and telling it's tale through visuals, items, quotes and clues. Thus, leaving alot of the story and happenings up for personal interpretation. There is not much for gameplay, but it's incrediably relaxing and can be very engaging if you're into deciphering and discussing the possiblities of the characters and stories.  Can easily not be someones cup of tea, but if this is something in your niche interests - you may just very well love it.

However, the gameplay might disturbs you since, let's face it, it's really unusual and slow. If you're not into contemplative game experiences, avoid it. If on the contrary, you want to discover an unique and bizarre game experience, try it.All I can advise you is trying the demo to get a first preview of this strange universe before buying the whole game, to avoid any disappointment.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Vous tomberez peut être, tout comme moi, amoureux/se de l'athmosphère Gothique et sombre ainsi que de l'histoire de the Path (qui contient différentes lectures en fonction de l'imagination du joueur). Cependant, le gameplay est relativement déstabilisant car, avouons le, très inhabituel et lent. Si vous n'aimez pas les expériences de jeu contemplatives, évitez le. Si au contraire, vous souhaitez découvrir un gameplay unique et bizarre, essayez le.Mon seul conseil serait de tester la démo afin d'avoir un aperçu de cet univers étrange, avant de l'acheter pour de bon, pour éviter toute déception.

												This is a beautiful game. It is purposefully abstract and I am excited about the potential for this style of storytelling in video games in the future.This is from the Tale of Tales creator Michael, as a response to a player's question - ""in the midst of all of the individual interpretations, what was the story the creator's had in mind?"":""This ambiguity and lack of resolution is exactly why we love the interactive medium so much. And why we think it is the medium of the new generation, the new century. It offers a way of trying to come to terms with the fact that truth does not exist anymore, that reality itself has been obscured by all the images we make of it, etc. Personally I follow the guidance of 19th century writer Alfred Jarry in this context. He invented 'Pataphysics, the science that ""transcends metaphysics as metaphysics transcends physics"". In short, it is a view of reality that simply accepts that everything that can be imagined is true. And more importantly, perhaps, that it is true simultaneously. So, something can be both black and white at the same time. I think interactive media offer us a way of creating artworks that embrace this ambiguity.So, even more important than the fact that every person's interpretation of The Path is perfectly valid, is the fact that this interpretation can be different every time you play, or even change after you stop playing. For me, it's more about the potential of meaning, than about a single conclusion. I think this comes from my dissatisfaction with language as a tool to describe reality. A painting or a piece of music have always felt more ""true"" to me than a page from the encyclopedia, or even a philosopher's theory.""			"

												While marketed as a horror game this really is not. There is no horror beyond the atmospheric which was admittedly done fairly well. This game is much better viewed as a piece of art. However there it fails completely. For the amount of actual content there is a ridiculous amount of bloat. Finally the story it tells is fairly trite and since that is it's only selling point I would rate it as 2/10.			"

												I like the concept of this game - a big fan of all things fairy tale and love that we continue to find ways of bringing them up to date.  This game would have really appealed to me as a young teenager but as a 24 year old I find it a bit too depressing and introverted. Because of the game's free adventure style, you have to be a willing participant in order to get the most out of it - not for me at this stage in my life, but I can certainly see the merits of the game and respect what it is trying to do. We definitely need conceptual games like this challenging our notions of what a game should be.			"

												First of all, kudos to Tale of Tales for making something outside of the mold of modern games. The Path is something unique, and it is definitely not for everyone. If you excel at abstract thinking and extrapolation, and can be patient, this game is for you. This game cannot be hurried, and encourages you to think, and move away from the ""Sprinting with all guns a-blazing"" tropes that are so prevalent. Some think it's meant to be a 'horror' game, but are disappointed when it does not fit their expectations. It is thoroughly disturbing and sometimes gut-wrenchingly sad, but only if you understand the characters and can take subtle hints. It made me slow down and think, a rare quality these days.			"

I'm assuming once you've lead each of these girls to their inevitable violation something happens, but after the second one I was too disgusted to continue playing.In fact, if you're considering buying ANY eastern-bloc game with a name like ""The <NOUN>"", just don't.

												The Path is centered around six sisters, each one a different Red Riding Hood that the player can take control of on the walk to their grandmother's house. Players are originally instructed to stay on the path on the way there. Upon reaching grandmother's house, players are treated with an eerily empty house, a mysterious rocking chair, and a pale old woman in bed with a stuffed wolf lingering nearby. Or, should they stray off the path, they encounter objects that inspire their chosen character to relive unpleasant memories. Gather enough of these memories and your character will encounter the dreaded wolf. Unfortunately, what could have been an intriguing exploration game with a unique underlying concept is rendered more trouble than its worth by poorly designed gameplay. Each character you play as seems to move slower than the last, causing the game to suffer from terribly boring stretches of walking that seem to be taking you no where. The forest has very few noticeable landmarks or interesting sites to discover. I often found myself walking for long stretches of time, encountering absolutely nothing of interest. On top of the drearily slow pacing, the moment you start to feel like you're moving a little bit faster the camera swings to an inhospitable angle.Overall, the Path has a pleasantly creepy vibe to it. The music is often discordant and mixed with child-like singing and chanting. The air is foggy and the forest is dark. The hallways of the grandmother's house are large and imposing and there's a sense of foreboding whether you stay on the path or adventure off of it. The memories you find are unnerving and just a little bit haunting. In terms of atmosphere, the Path is a clear winner. However, the poor controls make even turning your character clumsy and awkward. The game quickly becomes so tedious that it loses what charm it originally had going for it.There's something to be said for the relaxation that comes with a good walking simulator. Many people debate over whether or not these type of ""artistic experiences"" qualify as true video games, but I believe that laid-back games that focus on exploration are just as valid a media as high-action platformers and shooters. As a genre, walking simulators often rely on some of the underlooked aspects of a good game: character, environment, and atmosphere. However, they are, first and foremost, intended to be played as video games and, as such, are required to maintain a certain level of playability that the Path fails to achieve.			"

												[possible spoilers]This ""game"" can be completed in just one 1-2 hour sitting, 4 hours if you really take it slow. I don't expect jump scares or blood or ultra-gun-action-violence in a horror game, but I do expect it to actually have some element of story, background, character, and personality that is legitimately terrifying or at least disturbing or ANYTHING on an emotional level. I expect it to have characters that are CHARACTERS. The girls you play as are extremely bland and uninteresting. Why exactly am I supposed to care what happens to them? I was given nothing to become attached to these characters. There's no tension, there's no real conflict, there's nothing that will make you put on your critical thinking glasses. Oh, and the story, if it can be called that; the developer expects you to piece the story with ""your own active imagination."" This means that they were too lazy or afraid to COMMIT to a solid story and background and expect you to fill in the blanks with what little pieces they give you. It's very rare for a piece of media to successfully handle this type of open-ended interpretation. It's like the developers watched Jacob's Ladder (or any other horror-acid-trip film), was inspired by it, but then had no freaking clue how to piece together a coherent story while maintaining a sense of mystery. Also, lots and lots of scene flashes and twisted, topsy-turvy environments that force a supposed sense of symbolism. The game loves spewing nonsensical visual vomit masquerading as yet more symbolism across your screen. Oh, I forgot, this is an ""art piece."" this gaem is so smrt u guize.The gameplay is barely worth mentioning. There's no map system, your character blacks out if you run for too long (making the exploration even more tedious), and you better hope to god you have a damn good memory of where all the memory items are with the lack of landmarks (other than other memory items, that is). If you enjoy games with half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥symbolism and story writing, this is for you. This game could have been so good, and I was pretty interested when it first came out, but I want my money back. Playing The Path was a nightmare in tediousness, shoddy controls, violence-against-women-as-a-theme, and gray-to-blood-red visuals. Because blood red is so scary, right? And (implied) violence against women, that makes this game so mature and smart! When I finished a ""chapter,"" I did so hoping the next one would actually give me something to be interested in. And each time I was disappointed. No self-respecting artist would consider this game ""art."" I go to art school, I think I know a little bit about pretentious art-not-art.			"

												This game is one of my favorites. I don't normally like ""walking simulators"", but this one is very good. The story is you control 1 of 6 girls who go to grandma's house. The only rule being, ""stay on the path"" but you of course, as Little Red Riding Hood, say ""screw that"" and walk off the path where adventure and intrigue lie. Each girl has her own wolf and items you can find in the forest, and as you walk you get insight into their character by interacting with the environment. Now the horror comes in when you run into your ""wolf"" (which isn't always a wolf) and end up knocked out in front of grandma's house. As you travel through grandma's house you feel goosebumps as you find out the fate of your young heorine. However, this game isn't all fun and roses, there are some development issues that must be mentioned. Each girl is super slow, and there is no map to the forest which is huge! It's very easy to get lost when trying to find an item that you know belongs to a particular sister. Also, when you encounter the wolf, you cannot run. You also get penalized for running by having the camera zoom out making it harder to see. The game can be laggy and buggy at times as well. But if you like games that are super artsy and are a sucker for off the cuff ""Little Red Riding"" stories then by all means spend your dollars. I think this game has great replay value and is one of the best ""Tale of Tales"" has to offer. 7/10			"

Missed out on one of Ginger's 'items' because I gave up looking then i found it when I moved onto Rose; was gutted since i had 11/13 found; would have loved that extra one.

That way you aren't prancing around the whole, damn infinity-forest for who knows how many hours, just hoping to randomly bump into those objects.I'm serious, run straight to grandmas house with each character.

												An excellent example of an artful video game that uses interactivity to engage the player and enhance the message of the story. Inspired by the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, the player chooses to play as one of six children each given the identical objective of visiting their grandmother in a cabin in the woods. The game gives the simple instruction of staying on the path to grandma's house, but the player is free to disobey this command, abandon their duty to their grandmother, and instead venture into the forest where each girl's unique ""wolf"" awaits. The Path is about the inevitable human curiosity, the obliteration of one's innocence, and the consequences that follow. It is deep, it is beautiful, and is a great example of what video games are capable of as an art form.9/10			"

												The Path, from the recently and unfortunately departed Tale Of Tales, is a peculiar and perhaps polarizing experience that relies less on traditional gameplay functions and more on the player's curiosity and willingness to deviate from instruction. A unique take on the Red Riding Hood tale, you choose one of several young girls and are instructed to head to your grandmother's house without deviating from the established path in the forest. However, such things are never so simple.If you like, you're welcome to obey the rules and keep to the safety of the titular Path. That's not where anything interesting happens, however. By diverting into the woods, each girl has a chance of finding a series of reminders that illuminate their past, some of which are more traumatic than others. As there are several Red Riding Hoods, so are there multiple Big Bad Wolves, all of whom intervene in a given Red's life in their own unique ways. By the way, let me add a trigger warning for what I think was an implied sexual assault in one of the stories.The forest, its few inhabitants, the relics there, and the experiences following your discoveries upon your eventual arrival at grandma's are all beautifully rendered, and accompanied by a haunting, if limited in variety, soundtrack. The Path's decision to eschew dialogue for visual cues and symbolism helps get your imagination going, but at the same time makes certain sections more unclear than they ought to be. Even though the game quickly grew on me, even I had a few bouts of frustration between getting lost or being unsure what to do at certain points. Still, I enjoyed all the room left for interpretation with all the scenarios, and am still on the fence as to whether all the Reds are their own entities, if they're aspects of the same person (as they spread across a range of ages), or if they're something else entirely.The Path is definitely a game with rather niche appeal, but if you're willing to let yourself get lost in a world for a bit, several times over, I'd say it's worth a look.

												I don't know that I like the Path very much. And yet, although it's been years since I played it, I still think about the wonky little experience once in a while. In many ways, it's extremely obnoxious, the droning lady choir if you find something to pick up, the sluggish walking speed, and that's not even getting into the dark side of the Path. That very dark side, that Little Red Riding Hood horror schtick that leads to some frankly disturbing and often outright tasteless imagery. Nothing's gorily graphic, but nothing leaves much to the imagination either. Both practically and thematically, you are leading these girls to their dooms when you leave the path, but if you don't leave the path, they haven't ~lived~ or something. Anyway. It's by turns heavy-handed and nasty, the writing is more curlycue artsy-fartsy than terribly meaningful, and yet, and yet, and yet. There are some touches. I like the oil-painting darkness of the woods, some of the more surrealistic elements, the cramped breath if you do try to sprint, and our little lady of hope, who lives off the path, but doesn't court its dangers. Just know what you're in for. A lot of it is deeply unpleasant, ""Teen"" rating or no.			"

												Whilst this game does have a quite a bit of creepiness and atmosphere, its much more of a ""story delivered by a game"" rather than a game per se.In and of itself that's not a bad thing... however the game isn't massively deep or replayable and it does come with a certain level of ""True Art Is Incomprehensible"" pretentiousness which certainly isn't for everyone (that said, it can work well with the creep factor). It IS longer and slightly more gamey than other games in this genre (""Gone Home"" for instance) but the length is partially due to repetition.If you're a fan of atmospheric horror-adventures this game MAY be a good ""when on sale"" purchase... but as a fan of the genre myself I still think that this game isn't worth 10 bucks (5, perhaps). I guess fans of ""deliberately trying to feel art-house"" games may enjoy this too.But still, I'd be very cautious about purchasing this game.			"

												An excellent example of an artful video game that uses interactivity to engage the player and enhance the message of the story. Inspired by the tale of Little Red Riding Hood, the player chooses to play as one of six children each given the identical objective of visiting their grandmother in a cabin in the woods. The game gives the simple instruction of staying on the path to grandma's house, but the player is free to disobey this command, abandon their duty to their grandmother, and instead venture into the forest where each girl's unique ""wolf"" awaits. The Path is about the inevitable human curiosity, the obliteration of one's innocence, and the consequences that follow. It is deep, it is beautiful, and is a great example of what video games are capable of as an art form.9/10			"

												As it seems in the video game world, games heavily carried not by it's gameplay but by it's story and experience seem to be on the rise.The Path is one of these games.Extremely simple controls, as all you're given the option is to walk. In order to interact, you release the forward key. Gamers who are easily put off by a slow-pace, lack of action, and/or lower end graphics, I suggest you stop reading now, and shop elsewhere on Steam. However if you're a fan of exploration, experimentation, and a psychological approach on the horror genre, then by all means, keep reading.This is in fact a horror game, despite the lack of actual jump scares or a monster chasing you. The Path is unique that instead- you're chasing the monster. Play one of the six sisters who is tasked to bring your sick grandmather some wine and bread, but by all means, don't stray off the path- or so, as the game warns you. Despite the game's warning, you won't be rewarded unless you go on the path less travelled and go in search of the sister's wolf, unique to her. To avoid spoilers, I will break down the experience without actually delving into the story outside of;There's little to no voice acting. There's limited reading as each sister makes a remark on each object you do come across, as well as meeting her wolf. This minilmalist approach helps you get into the mindset of the sister, and what personality drives her to her decisions. Once meeting the wolf and finally arriving to grandmother's house are you treated with discovering the consequences of growing up and a bookend to that sister's story. Much like a silent film noted and influenced with a mix of an independent arthouse and a creepy horror film, enough is left unsaid to allow the players attempt to connect the pieces together. This leads to deep discussions creating webs around the game of everyone's different but meaningful and personal experiences. The Path is ultimately unique, memorable, and gorgeous in concept and haunting in it's hidden messages. This game is not for everyone, but for those who've fond memories of finding an old book to dust off to read of the dark fairy tales of once ago. This game is for those who can handle strong adult themes that can unrattle those sensitive to graphic truths of the real world. I bought this game the first year it came out, and even today I find myself going back to it. Well worth my money, and time, over and over again.			"

												The Path......The Path is not the game. That's the very best pique word I could use for anyone whom were reading this to decide wether you should buy it or not. The Path are both experience and experimental where the developer want to tell thier re-image version of ""Little Red riding hood"" (I recommended you to try and read the original version of this tale first before experiencing this game) with a very simple mecanique where we all known as ""Walking Simulator"".  At the begining of The path. You will get to pick 1 of 6 girls, each are different with both age and attitude they have toward the world. All have been given the very same objective from their mother. ""Go to your grandma house, And always stay on the Path"" and just that, The rest is up to you wether you were following up that instruction by straight head on to grandma house OR do as the dev want you to do, Stray off the path.By picking the latter, Depend on which girl you pick at the very begining. You will find many random objects in the wood and many of them require a specific girl to interact with. Now, As I mention before, This is not a game, It doesn't gave you an objective such find this, find that, discover this location and etc etc. Its about experiencing on how you will find the connection of the girl and that object, Which will also effect the very ending inside grandma house as well.The wolf would be highlight of this game, Each girl have their own ""wolf"" and as same as objects your girl interacted with. ""Wolf"" was also a very cryptid term where you have to translated the meaning of its connection to the girl by yourself.Which all and all led to the very conclusion of The Path............................It wasn't a video game where you can just hover in and out, having some round or play by the game rule or whatsover most known genre out there does. The Path require your time, Your thought and Your attention to enjoy it. It will asked you a lot of questions on your brain and only you and you alone can find that answer.			"

												Something of a sophomore effort. Some of the art on the screen, the music (to some extent), and the concept are, well, nice. But the character models and the pacing leave quite a bit to be desired. The slooooow pace through the forest is the result of 1) an effort to comb through it looking for relevant objects/memory cues, 2) the rather random appearance of a map, which would be much more helpful for combing the forest more effectively, and 3) the bumpy walk/run mechanic, where you suddenly hit an invisible edge (of pools or memory glades) and have to maneuvre around. Unlike a game like _Gone Home_, I feel like this game is slow not because I want to stop and absorb the atmosphere or detail, but because the game is holding me back. Often it leaves me wondering what I should do - do I hit a button? Am I at the edge of the map, and should turn around? In the end, I'm not sure what to do with this game. Is it a fairy story? Maybe. But too slow to use in the classroom: I'd feel bad asking someone to have to play this. It has a good heart, but not very useful.4/10			"

												I got this game free with some kind of horror bundle that got me The Void for $10. It's supposed to be based around Little Red Riding Hood. In this game, you'll pick one of the six characters and take them to go look for flowers in the forest which will lead them to traumatic life experiences which will result in their ultimate demise. The game ends when you've killed all six. The game is by no means scary, as you the player are trying very hard to get these girls killed, but it does have vague hints of David Lynch or Silent Hill or something at times. Gameplay is not so much gameplay as it is wandering randomly through a looping forest that is impossible to navigate. It is about on the level with a well-made student art project.I do not recommend this game unless you got it for free like I did.			"

												A very interesting retelling of the ""Red Riding Hood"" story.You play the part of one of several young girls who are going to visit their grandma. But there's more to it than that. You have the option, if you so choose, to go wandering off into the woods. There, you can meet various people or objects from your childhood.I think this is a game about loss of innocence and people being forced to grow up. It's certainly open to interpretation.""The Path"" is not intended as a game in the traditional sense, but the creators have thrown in a couple of optional ""gamey"" elements to pacify people, such as a map, or the option to collect flowers in the woods. There is also the option to try and find all the relevant objects for each girl. But there are no rewards for doing so, as that is not the point of the game.Unfortunately as this game was made by an outside studio, the creators have no way to compile it for Linux, which is a great shame.

												The Path is an interactive experience that strides the line between a game and an artistic exposition. The setting is a journey to your grandmother's house by 6 young girls who are told to ""follow the path"" while the endless forest on the sides taunts you in. Each female protagonist, at different stages of puberty, get to explore and find specific objects and areas that trigger memories and thoughts while collecting 144 flowers.The entire exploration experience is a premise to encounter a unique metaphoric wolf or demon, that transforms the girls and throws them at gates of the fabled grandma's house, where a nightmarish sequence seals each chapter. From a narrative perspective, the experience builds upon your personal interpretation of each encounter and memory, and it is deciphered in your own mind rather than being explicit and direct. The atmosphere is tense but lacks the immediate feel of dread, while using music and sound effects to control the experience. If you run for too long, the gathering flowers disappear and the music becomes intense and foreboding, and if you arrive at set piece your are forced to walk, and so forth. The graphics are serviceable, with unique character designs and attention to minor details; a good example is the receding city scape in the opening, or how the the path disappears once you delve deeper into the forest. Each character gets its own set of animation for all movements and interactions, and the music albeit repetitive, does contribute to the atmosphere giving hints to special encounters and sets. The Path does require a personal emotional investment, something that many will forfeit. If you are willing to go through it, do not expect a satisfying resolution or an ending, as the journey is the game, there are no achievements or victories once the girls' paths are explored. 3/5			"

												I played through with one girl.  I had no idea what I was doing or why I was doing it.  I couldn't reliably get my character to run, and when she did, the camera just pans up so you can't see anything.  She would randomly interact with various things without me pressing any buttons or simply stop moving and refuse to go any further until I spun the camera around a few times trying to walk in every possible direction.  The controls on this game almost made me shut it off more than once.  It's infuriating.Apparently, I unlocked 3 out of 3 rooms, found the wolf, and discovered the mystical lake.  I got a ""B"" rating for playing.  Fantastic.  When the game told me I found the wolf, I was completely surprised. I remember no wolf, nor any wolf-like things besides paws going across the screen (but the game was shooting random crap across the screen the whole hour I was playing).  In fact, I had no idea I had finished the game until it told me.  I just thought this was another random encounter thing that was happening.I will completely admit I don't understand the point of this game.  Positive reviews say it's more of an art piece than a game -- ok, I get that.  I played ""Gone Home"" and ""Shelter"" and I understand that those are supposed to be artsy as well.  Except, they have a freaking point and they let the player figure that out.  This game does not.  It tells you to stay on the path, except if you do, that's how you ""lose"" at the game.  The only way I figured out the point was to come back on steam and read about what the game is supposed to be about.  I feel that playing a game should tell you what' it's about and you shouldn't have to read forums to decipher the meaning.I will NOT be playing through with the other girls to pick up more junk from the forest or to attempt an ""A"" rating.  I have way more games in my steam library that deserve my attention more than this.			"

												Whatever interesting, open-ended narrative there is in The Path is impeded by obtuse, confusing design. Part of the blame lies on a limited budget and resources, but the devs seemed to spend all their effort on story beats and neglected to strengthen the core experience (being lost in the woods, which is an aimless, frustrating experience).

												I was expecting a weird game and what I got was indeed weird but hardly a game.The Path is mostly a 'hold W' simulator with optional button mashing because it seems that the controls don't really matter anyway - sometimes the space bar makes you pick something up, other times it opens the inventory instead. A cat could 'play' this game by sleeping on the keyboard.It seems to be either a pretentious game that lacks the ability to convey its message or there isn't any meaningful message to begin with. ""People die and we just bury them in the ground""? Wow. That's, like, deep. Furthermore, you're the little red riding hood and upon reaching your grandma the game announces that you have failed - not exactly the edgiest plot twist. Not poetic, not amusing. Just cringeworthy.I paid hardly anything for this game and I still regret it. Don't bother.			"

If you walk off the path, some weird and completely arbitrary events are triggered (ex.

I mean the little girl runs up to the giant monster wolf and jumps on its back, she kinda gets what she deserves. The goth chick with a decided handicap starts hanging out with a suave ray dude in black and one load screen later walks miserably to grandmas clutching her arm and looking pitiful in the rain. There is no subtlety to this game and it just drags on and on and on. Each girl gets it from some super creepy person that they decide is safe to spend quality time with, proving the developers lack of imagination and the character’s stupidity if nothing else, then the poor♥♥♥♥♥♥stick wanders pitifully to grandmas where an LSD like dreamsquency pseudo cut scene spells out their demise.

												I don't recommend The Path, but I will say that  I've never played anything else like it and the story and the characters did stick with me after I completed it. It's interesting, but it's definitely not worth $10. Catch if it goes on sale for a dollar or two if it interests you. The problem is that there is hardly enough actual gameplay to qualify it as a game. The only thing you can do in The Path is walk or run. The video makes it look like you're interacting with items, while you're actually just watching the characters do the interacting. Seriously, the way you pick up an object is by releasing the ""walk"" key and standing still so the girl can go on to interact with whatever you've stopped her near. I get that Tale of Tales was trying to tell us a story in an original way, but they don't seem to have an understanding of the importance of immersion. I probably would have loved the game if I actually felt like I was controlling the characters and discovering the secrets of the forest with them, but instead the game just left me feeling disconnected. When you finally do reach grandmother's house, your ""reward"" is an agonizingly slow walk and some flickering, jumpy cutscenes. Some of the sisters endings didn't even make sense, even with 100% level completion. People may try to gloss that over by saying it's ""artsy"" or ""deep,"" but in reality it's just bad writing and poor design.			"

												A small group of pseudo-intellectual, pretentious, art & philosophy students got together and proceeded to circle-jerk while chanting the words ""post-modern, juxstapose, existential, antidisestablishmentarianism"" repeatedly in an effort to get themselves off quicker. After they'd all 'finished' the resulting mess was collected and stored in a jar. Once the contents of the jar had been left to fester for a suitable amount of time they were emptied out and released in the form of this (not a) game.Don't get me wrong, I like the indie, artistic, 'story driven' genre and have fully enjoyed games like Gone Home and other similar titles, but what this consists of is around, at best, 10-15 minutes worth of a surreal animated short film split into small pieces. It controlls how often you get to see these set pieces by forcing you to continualy walk around in the belief that you're in control of an absurdly thin layer of interactivity and by making you repeat the process 6 times.If this isn't either a masterclass in trolling the fanatics of this type of game or an attempt to subvert the genre, it's certainly an excercise in extreme artistical masturbation and anyone stating how ""wonderfully atmospheric"", ""fantastically understated"" or how much of an experience this (not a) game is, is just as much a of pretentious, pseudo-intelectual idiot as the developers if this is indeed a genuine, non-spoof/satirical attempt at furthering the genre.

												What is this I don’t even? The path is best defined an indie game that appeal to hipsters. I played for ~10 hours and I still don’t have a single slightest clue how this is a game. It’s just graphical remake of the original little red riding hood. You find collectibles, and landmarks, and end up with a different ending depending on your success at finding things. Depending on what the hell you found, you can get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beaten up, or both at the same time. In terms of visuals, this game is fantastic in that department. The colors definitely bring out the eeriness of the game. Sadly that is the only thing I can find that is even remotely good about this game. You spend hours running in a ♥♥♥♥ing forest, for a 30 second ending. Just go read the original little red riding hood, or go watch all the endings on youtube. Maybe play through the game once to see the rather magnificent forest. If you like paintings, buy this.			"

												If I were ever inclined to write an arguement in favour of the ""Games-are-a-form-of-art"" debate, then this game would most assuredly be my first point of reference. Should you buy this game though?If you're after an adrenaline rush, or hordes of monsters to mow down with swords, guns, and chainsaws, then this will NOT be your cup of tea. However, if the thought of taking a creepy, meandering, (and sometimes disturbing) exploratory trek through another person's imagination turns you on, then I would strongly suggest you give this game a whirl.

												Slow and boring.Everything is slower than it should be. This starts when the game first begins and you watch an unskippable 30 second opening sequence (repeated every time you restart). After that it's similar to The Stanly Parable (tells you to do something while implying something else) except the world is huge and devoid of content. It took me 10 minutes to find the first memory and 30 more minutes to find the wolf. In between, you literally run through a forest for most of the game.But even for a game about running through a forest it lacks. The controls are clunky. You can't look around using your mouse, the longer you sprint the worse your view gets, speed is painfully slow and turning is a nightmare. At certain points the camera angle changes and you become even worse off.But then there's the story. It sucks. Each girl (this isn't told to you while playing) requires you to find a collection of memories and a wolf. The wolf represents a situation where the girl fell to temptation and lost their innocense. Memories and hidden rooms help you peice together how it happened. Its not obvious how you interact with some things (I've left wolves mid-sequence because I didn't know I was supposed to wait), and the stories are simple and boring (see tale of tales wiki to read them and save some time).

												This game is wickedly good at doing two things: story telling and getting you lost. Both could have been absolutely dreadful, but were excellently executed in this game.At first, when I heard about ""The Path"", I figured it would be just another game about Little Red and the Wolf. However, as I began to explore the world and interract with everything, I began to form my own stories on the girls and on the ""wolves"". This game is a treasure to have. I love the art style and the music. I would recommend this to anyone if they asked me. Hands down one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												I will state this for a fact before everything that this game will not be for everybody, everyone has different tastes and opinions and will have different thoughts towards the game, though I am totally in favor of loving the game, if I suggested it to a few specific friends they might end up looking at me like ""why did you give me this?""When I was younger and happened to come across this game, I was so interested and into it because of little red riding hood being one of my favorite fairy tales growing up, regardless of me being I think 10 years old, though I wasn't able to buy that game when I was that young, I always tried to look for as much content on youtube and other websites about it as I could find until I was able to get it and play it for myself last year and on.This game is of course one you have to experience, there are many different things in there you can interact with and it can trigger different ideas about the game. For the storyline of the game, besides the small amount that is given, most of the girl's past memories are given to you as a room and an item, and from then on you have to form your own theory as to what you think happened and what resulted from what and what makes this girl this girl. Each girl is very different from each other and some people can relate to more than others, and in some ways I am able to think and reflect as to how I would handle situations such as these and how to avoid some as well. Now, to stop my rambling, I'd totally reccomend this game to people who like forming theories and exploring and games that are very artistic, dark, and abstract. For those who usually don't play dark games unless it's Halloween, it's as well a good idea to play for that reason as well! I'll probably talk more about the game when I do a let's play of it in the probably not too far of future, but until then!			"

However, all of the storytelling is done through exploration and some players with worse luck may go a while before encountering anything that triggers an event or character moment (the endless trees can get a bit samey).

												This game is not for everyone. Gameplay:When they say it's a walking simulator, that's literally what you are going to be doing the entire game. It gets a little redundant, but the art style of the game helps you tolerate it.However, when you ""die"", you have to spend 5 minutes limping to the house to finish the level. I think that's a little ridiculous.Art style:Damn, blown away by its presentation. The background music is awesome. The dark gothic theme is so fitting. This game gets creepy fast, especially if you are doing the levels right, it gets ""scarier"" and scarier.Overall:If you're into trying something new, then this game might be for you. There are some really gnarly scenes that will leavve you breathless. Don't want to ruin them, but you gotta be super pateint to make this journey worth it.Buy it, if you're patient and like adventure games.			"

However, all of the storytelling is done through exploration and some players with worse luck may go a while before encountering anything that triggers an event or character moment (the endless trees can get a bit samey). It's an art game; if you like those, there are few I've liked better.			"

												Words cant explain what this game offers. It is something that hasn't been tried, it is dark, it is a bit scary. I would like to call it a game but by most it actually wouldn't qualify, it has a story, but requires you to use your brain to figure that out. Nothing is explained, besides giving you partial clues through poetry... This is not a game you would forget, that is one thing for sure, it is a experience that cannot be imitated by other games.

												This is a very good ""game"" (more like art) with great ambience and a psychedelic feel to it. Music is very good in places (it perfectly matches the mood and environments) a bit scary and psychological. Every woman should play this game. May have some replay value because u'll feel like revisiting some of the places and listenening to the music... the soundtrack doesn't adequately capture the dynamically mixed music (ingame). Anyway the game does have a good story to tell that's open to interpretation.			"

												One reviewer said of this game (paraphrase): The Path is not a game, it is art.This is not entirely untrue.  It was a fun game that came bundled with something else.  I played through it, and although I enjoyed it, its not a game I would have bought for myself.  Its very high-art but in a horror setting... based on the *original* story of Little Red Riding Hood (LRRH) with some interesting inferences to Catcher in the Rye (CiTR) this game is <<NOT FOR CHILDREN>>.If you're familiar with LRRH or CiTR - and if you are okay with a game with SLOW progression and a subjective scoring method... and if you're the kind of person that can fill in the gaps and analyze into a story - this game is for you.In retrospect Its been YEARS since I read LRRH or CiTR so I had to borrow someone else's notes online about this game.  Recommended for the right ADULT.			"

I like how you just explore your surroundings, find items and things that tell the story instead of just throwing it on your face. All the playable characters are unique from each other, despite being sisters and it's interesting to see all the little details of their personalities. There is some glitches here and there that could have been repalable, but they still don't make game unplayable.All in all; beautiful craphigs, music, meaning and interesting idea makes this game one of my favorite indie games ever! I recommend this game for you, if you're interested of indie horror/art games.			"

												The Path is an artistic game that plays around with new concepts in storytelling. The game was built around the Little Red Riding Hood mythos in a dark and twisted way, delivering an experience that you won't be able to forget. Be aware that the gameplay is very slow-paced and it doesn't try to supply any answers to the player. However, that is exactly what makes it shine. All in all, The Path can elicit some deep emotions and it's very open to interpretations. If you like unique artistic games, you should check it out.			"

												This game is incredibly lovely and quite a tricky interpretation. It's unlike all games I have ever played before and I deeply wish more games had such an effective story line and deeply involved characters. There's no right or wrong way to play. There's no way to cheat. Everything is a metaphor. Everything is a message. The message I gathered?: At any age, you may come across a time you are faced with a fork in the road. You know to never break the rules, but if you choose to do so, you exit your comfort zone and travel into the unknown. Outside your comfort zone, you begin to understand things that you were previously confused about. You can just keep going and going until you feel lost. You may ask for help, and help may lead you back to your comfort zone. However, look for signs and you will soon realize how easy life can be. Life doesn't have to be so scary. But tread on the wrong ground and get involved with just the wrong people, and you may find yourself regretting every decision you ever made... In reality, making mistakes is how we grow as people. It's scary and confusing, but as long as you learn from your mistakes, you're doing it right :) BRILLIANT GAME!			"

												Definitely not for everyone, I'd very much class this as an ""arty"" game, and while I'm usually allergic to such games this one really captured my imagination. In terms of gameplay, while there isn't much to it - it basically fits into the ""walking simulator"" category though there is much more of a personalised feel than other walking simulators like Gome Home; after progressively playing as each of the sisters while walking through the forest, as I came across the landmarks that reveal significant events in the previous sisters' lives there was a sense of poignancy, reminding me of what shaped them. Also, it's very easy to miss some of the girls' events. The other gameplay ""feature"" if it can even be called that, is collecting glowing flowers but as it has no effect whatsoever (literally, at all), I think that's because I read somewhere it was a commentary on the prevalence of collecting things in videogames, and pointlessness of it, which is all a bit too hipster and postmodern for me but I'll forgive it as I love it so much.It's atmospheric, dreamlike, at times creepy but most of all was magical for me. It's the first time, for a game, that I afterwards spent hours on the Path forums reading everyone's own interpretations of the events. The story is not given to you on a plate, and it's the wealth of different interpretations that I think make it truly worthy of being described as a piece of art.			"

												If I were ever inclined to write an arguement in favour of the ""Games-are-a-form-of-art"" debate, then this game would most assuredly be my first point of reference. Should you buy this game though?If you're after an adrenaline rush, or hordes of monsters to mow down with swords, guns, and chainsaws, then this will NOT be your cup of tea. However, if the thought of taking a creepy, meandering, (and sometimes disturbing) exploratory trek through another person's imagination turns you on, then I would strongly suggest you give this game a whirl.

												Slow and boring.Everything is slower than it should be. This starts when the game first begins and you watch an unskippable 30 second opening sequence (repeated every time you restart). After that it's similar to The Stanly Parable (tells you to do something while implying something else) except the world is huge and devoid of content. It took me 10 minutes to find the first memory and 30 more minutes to find the wolf. In between, you literally run through a forest for most of the game.But even for a game about running through a forest it lacks. The controls are clunky. You can't look around using your mouse, the longer you sprint the worse your view gets, speed is painfully slow and turning is a nightmare. At certain points the camera angle changes and you become even worse off.But then there's the story. It sucks. Each girl (this isn't told to you while playing) requires you to find a collection of memories and a wolf. The wolf represents a situation where the girl fell to temptation and lost their innocense. Memories and hidden rooms help you peice together how it happened. Its not obvious how you interact with some things (I've left wolves mid-sequence because I didn't know I was supposed to wait), and the stories are simple and boring (see tale of tales wiki to read them and save some time).

Basicly you wander around exploring the woods desperatly hoping or desperatly avoiding coming across your charecters personal 'Wolf'. Nope, I cant make it make sense untill you play it.You will either love or hate this... and i still think its overpriced for what is essentially a story rather than a game. Bloody atmospheric though...entertaining rather than enjoyable... Tim Burton fans would get a kick out of this more than most.3/5			"

												Mac version ran just fine here on Yosemite 10.10.2 for the limited time I played it.About that limited time I played it, well I became a wee bit frustrated by the glacial pace at which my little girl was walking to grandma's. I did get there eventually though only to find out that doing what the game told me to, staying on the path to her house was a stupid thing to do. I was supposed be a disobedient little girl and wander through the woods instead where I could then happen upon you know who not to mention finding various stuff. I entered the house and I won't say what I found because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but what I got was basically a GAME OVER message letting me know I had been stupid basically without coming out and saying it.I couldn't bear the thought of taking the long walk to the grandma's house again, never mind trapsing through the woods in slow motion x multiple girls who all need to do it too I think so that is why I lasted a half hour here.I don't like stupid games that point out my own stupidity. It makes me damned mad. So I uninstalled this little nightmare.So remember kids, never do what you are told for the best possible results!			"

												Definitely not for everyone, I'd very much class this as an ""arty"" game, and while I'm usually allergic to such games this one really captured my imagination. In terms of gameplay, while there isn't much to it - it basically fits into the ""walking simulator"" category though there is much more of a personalised feel than other walking simulators like Gome Home; after progressively playing as each of the sisters while walking through the forest, as I came across the landmarks that reveal significant events in the previous sisters' lives there was a sense of poignancy, reminding me of what shaped them. Also, it's very easy to miss some of the girls' events. The other gameplay ""feature"" if it can even be called that, is collecting glowing flowers but as it has no effect whatsoever (literally, at all), I think that's because I read somewhere it was a commentary on the prevalence of collecting things in videogames, and pointlessness of it, which is all a bit too hipster and postmodern for me but I'll forgive it as I love it so much.It's atmospheric, dreamlike, at times creepy but most of all was magical for me. It's the first time, for a game, that I afterwards spent hours on the Path forums reading everyone's own interpretations of the events. The story is not given to you on a plate, and it's the wealth of different interpretations that I think make it truly worthy of being described as a piece of art.			"

												To summarize: there is no wolf. It's a little black girl who drugs you, rapes you and then leaves you on the road in front of Granny's house			"

												This game is incredibly lovely and quite a tricky interpretation. It's unlike all games I have ever played before and I deeply wish more games had such an effective story line and deeply involved characters. There's no right or wrong way to play. There's no way to cheat. Everything is a metaphor. Everything is a message. The message I gathered?: At any age, you may come across a time you are faced with a fork in the road. You know to never break the rules, but if you choose to do so, you exit your comfort zone and travel into the unknown. Outside your comfort zone, you begin to understand things that you were previously confused about. You can just keep going and going until you feel lost. You may ask for help, and help may lead you back to your comfort zone. However, look for signs and you will soon realize how easy life can be. Life doesn't have to be so scary. But tread on the wrong ground and get involved with just the wrong people, and you may find yourself regretting every decision you ever made... In reality, making mistakes is how we grow as people. It's scary and confusing, but as long as you learn from your mistakes, you're doing it right :) BRILLIANT GAME!			"

												For sure read the other recommendations. I did not enjoy this game.  The not being able to use the right click at times to move faster and thus move so sluggishly slow it was torture at times.  Spoilers (if you follow the path as suggested by the title and logically follow the path to get to grandmother's house you go in and die and that is that short and dead).  It was interesting to learn there are different stories depending on character that part sounds interesting.  Some of the paths can be a little dark to say the least from what I heard from others in class I doing this for.  The music was nice.			"

												I changed my mind. I now recommend this game for precisely the same reasons I originally disparaged it. Play it, let it percolate for a year or two, then see if you agree. <|Here begins original review|> mind-numbingly tedious. SLOW in every way. Clumsy controls. Fragmented, contrived story WITH NO RESOLUTION! Like they had so many ideas they just threw them all in without worrying whether they integrated in any way toward an ENDING. I'll be the first to admit I don't understand what they were trying to do unless it was just an excercise in being deliberately obtuse. I don't recommend this game to most people. But I might launch it again once in a while even though I don't have the patience to hold the W key for hours again. Why? Because the game does not ENTIRELY fail to communicate.... something...			"
