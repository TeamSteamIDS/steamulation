												I've been a Thief fan since I bought Dark Project on release in that triangle-shaped box. I put over 40 hours into this game and I did all the side quests. I can't recommend anyone else do the same. And I got this for about $10 with the bank heist DLC. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970398622/recommended/239160 covers most of what I think, so I'll just append to those thoughts here:The Thief series is fundamentally a game about hiding in shadows and moving quietly to avoid being detected by enemies for which you yourself often hear first before seeing them. I've played every Thief game and that statement is axiomatic, fan-patched or not. The problem with Thief 4, as I will refer to it, is that the game's sound engine isn't properly coded and being fully in shadow (as denoted by the light gem and screen border indicators) doesn't meaningfully translate to ""enemies are unable to see you at distance."" You may be walking along and suddenly hear footsteps or someone speaking quite loudly to your right, as though they were inches away. You turn, and there's nothing...because the person is actually on a separate floor, in another room, or across the street. You can't reliably use sound to determine ""there's someone moving from that direction...and they're getting closer/further away"" in this game, especially when it comes to overheard conversations. You can be crouched down in full shadow, and a guard/civilian walking past may still be alerted to your presence upon walking by. Or not. Because of the inconsistent application of ""the rules"" your success or failure is based less upon your own player skill at stealth games (I'm no Lytha, but I consider myself competent) than your ability to predict the path the designers insist you take. You don't actually have much in the way of multiple solutions. This has NOTHING to do with any individual's CPU, GPU, or speaker setup.You can manually swing your blackjack, but it generally won't do you much good. You can't really thwack a surface to distract a guard, and if you try to manually swing it to KO someone it won't work. Nope, you've GOT to use the context-sensitive cinematic takedown button. Sometimes you can kill or knock out one guard (in this game there is absolutely no functional difference between the two outside of some arbitrary challenges) and the guard mere footsteps away detects nothing. Other times you do so and someone several feet away is alarmed. Aside from ""broken glass"" there is no difference in sound between moving on carpet vs moving on stone, wood, tile, etc so you'll spend most of the game crouch-walking with your hands mimicking the tiny arms of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I do at least appreciate that you can see your hands and feet, and your picking up of loot items is animated. That makes it seem like you're really in the world. But nearly all of the stuff you steal is below your ""master thief"" calling. Ink bottles? Pens? Ashtrays? Common silverware? Once you start asking ""wait, why are coin purses in bird's nests?"" and ""if everyone's starving and in poverty, why is this shiny gold ring literally lying on the ground in the street near these beggars?"" you can't help but notice that the big unruly mob there to witness the latest hanging--frequently overheard as the only entertainment left to see--consists literally of two people.Thief 4's story, setting, characters, and dialogue isn't even in the same league as the prior Thief games, such that during the moments in this one where they tried to reference / tie-in the old mythology to this my reaction was ""game, you haven't earned the right to reference Keepers/Hammerites/Pagans."" The writing isn't even in the same league as Assassin's Creed or Dishonored, the two games they were really, really trying to emulate here more than anything else. I think the only Thief game they really looked at was Deadly Shadows, but I don't think they learned from its missteps.""How was I seen just now?"" is what you will often wonder. ""Why am I not able to jump/climb onto this when I was able to jump/climb onto something just like it?"" is another frequent question. The answer to both is the same: ""unlike last time, the developers didn't want you to do that THIS time."" You are at least powerful enough to be able to easily dispatch multiple guards at once if detected. Only one enemy type in the game is a true threat for which you can't fight head-on, and that's when the capriciousness of the stealth mechanics become particularly noticeable.Don't believe me? Demand proof? Then don't just watch one guy's video playthrough. Watch three. Watch four. Note how they all more or less have to do the same thing the same way, especially during the scripted ""you've been spotted and have to escape"" moments. I understand the need to reboot old series to be more accessible to new generations of fans. But if you're going to do that, at least do it well like Deus Ex: Human Revolution did. After that game, I had so much hope for Thief 4. But in the end, I got a poorly written game with awful characters and a nonexistent ending with gameplay that could've been acceptable with just a little more effort.			"

												I just finished the game and am left wondering what happened during the concept and development phase that led to this blob of a game.I played 1,2 and 3 as they came out, before gold versions, or Steam, or any other modern game enhancement. Sure the original character backstory story was sparse, but the character didn't need to have a convoluted back story to be cool. I'm really confused as to why the writers felt it was necessary to create a whole new ""broken home/brothers at odds/apprentice lover kidnapped"" back story for Garrett when his original ""orphan trained as a keeper turned top tier taffer hated by all factions"" story was much more interesting.  None of the original world was even a part of this new game. I played on the hardest mode possible, shut off all visual helps (why those existed, I'll never understand), and took my sweet time to play through without killing everyone. I never felt the need to ghost every level in the original games and so I tried to play this in the same way (adventurer style). At the end of this new Thief, though, I was left with three glaring issues beyond the fluffy console gamer additives. Also, why was his jumping and swimming ability stolen from Garret? 1: The music in the game pulled me out of the supspension of disbelief, so I shut it off. The original games had music in the title, the catacombs, the credits and one or two other atmospheric interludes, but never did it have a full-running, repeating, battle-themed score. I felt the score was an addition that cheapened the gameplay at the expense of production money. 2: The addition of ultra vulgar curse words, nudity, and sexually themed conversations was stupid. Never did a player of the original games say to themselves, ""gosh, I wish their were topless chicks in this game that said the F- word all the time and performed BDSM themed scripted actions when I peered through a keyhole."" Instead we all focused on stealing loot and not getting caught by guards, zombies, and ratmen. I miss the ratmen and bug creatures BTW. Cut the ""real words"" vulgarity and make your scripting less vulgar. BTW, why was ""Taffer"" dropped? I loved that euphamism.3: Stop trying to make partial RPGs out of single player action games. Each level needs clear singular goals that drive profit or plot. Explain and answer all the plot points by end of the game. Start each level with a store for getting gear purchased with previous leveling loot cash. Eliminate the ""wandering through town in search of random side quests and loot"" bit. Bring back the storybook cutscenes between levels to drive the story. And, for the love of Pete, stop trying to make up a new origin story and faction rules for a world that already existed. The Hammers, Keepers, Zombies, Ghost Priests, Mechanists, Pagans, Ancients, bug people, ratmen, etc had more believeability and intriguing conceptualization than any of the crappy angry mobs and homeless people in this new iteration... Grrrr Arrrgh. Played, finished, sad, uninstalled.There is no replay factor in this game for me. Replay should be story driven; not multiplayer, stupid goals, and trinkets driven. I wouldn't watch a movie over and over again if its story sucked, and single player games are the same kind of entertainment for me. Make the story interesting and I'll play it again and again and again, because I love the story. I would also recommend it, if I loved the story. I recommend Thief 1 and 2 very highly.I wish someone could take the original gameplay from 1 and 2, the original cutscenes, voice acting, footstep sounds, and story lines; and put them into this beautifully rendered game engine. That would be the coolest thing that could possibly happen to the Thief franchise at this point.Make it and expansion pack and I'd pay for the stories all over again. Just don't kill an existing fanbase with crap like this ever again. Shame. "

												This ""reboot"" of the reknown series replaces Garret w/ a comic book variant that is part Batman and part The Crow.  Picture an Emo Goth Garret, complete w/ eye shadow and dour expressions, who spends his days sulking alone in an abandoned clocktower listening to 'My Chemical Romance' and writing bad poetry:  ""The clocktower of bleakness ticks a song for the black sadness of my existence.  I'm so alone and no one gets me."" until a crow comes to guide him to do things.  Yup.Garret is no longer just a Master Thief.  He's also Batman.  Instead of simply running from shadow to shadow, he now ""swoops"".  Instead of simply knocking some jerks out w/ a blackjack, now Garret beats the living snot out of them in a ""takedown"".  He can also do beat-downs-from-above ala Batman.   And like Batman he has a code:  No killing.  Well....  sorta.  Not really.  Depends on his mood, apparently.  He even has a ""It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me"" moment.  They should have just called it:  Batman - The Dark Victorian KnightWe can't talk about Garret without talking about loot.  You'll spend half the game collecting scissors, gears and syringes.  I kid you not.  You'll also find valuables that are ""collectable"".  These are unique and gaudy (profitable!) items that instead of selling them for a fat payday you'll instead decorate your clocktower with.  Did I mention they destroyed the very heart of Garret's character?  There is actually a moment when he's told by his fence, Basso, that he doesn't have to go risk his neck to break into a  safe that may or may not have something in it, because there's no job and he's not getting paid.  Garret's response:  ""It's not about the payment, it's what I do.""  *sigh*The game begins w/ you on a job w/ a reckless young Thief that you taught - a little brat named Erin.  Torturous dialogue whenever she appears in the game.  It's painful.  Fair warning:  The writing is bad and the story is atrocious.  It's like they went to a community college Amateur Writing class and found Stephenie Meyer and James Gunn there and hired them.  Erin is the all-in-one female character:  comrade, emotional foil, damsel-in-distress, antagonist.Remember all the things you love about the original Thief games:  complex maps w/ multiple routes to success, Garret's snark and sense of humor, overhearing Benny the guard, Pagans and their dialect, Hammerites w/ their inquisition-style religious fanaticism, Mechanists and their lispy leader, Keepers and their Swedish brand of neutrality, Mages and their weird echoey mantras, gas-spewing burricks, undead, bugbeasts, spiders, craymen,  ratmen, exploding frogs, swimming, flooring that gave you away, mission briefings, cutscenes neatly happening before or after a mission, the euphamistic word ""Taffer""....  it's all gone!  Garret is now just a humorless prick in a city of humorless♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  The game does, for some reason, retain vestiges of Thief lore that it otherwise doesn't bother with.  Erin has a spiky club she calls ""the claw"" that she made.  The game goes out of it's way to make a big deal about it.  Garret tells her the claw is holding her back - that it's loud and she doesn't need it.  Pretty soon Garret has possession of it and guess what?  Turns out he loves it!  This despite the fact he has a grappling hook he could use, but for some reason almost never ever does.  And thank goodness that the architects of the city thought to put strategically placed ugly metal grates wherever you need to climb to.  Lucky that!Wherein the first 3 Thief games you used a blackjack to club people over the head and knockout; now you use it to bash people in the eye during takedowns and as your weapon of choice when going toe-to-toe with sword-weilding guards.  You heard me.The lightgem was simple and elegant.  So they borked it and added a terrible ""shroud"" effect to the system, because... well... they hate us, or never played the original games.This entry sees the return of the rope arrow, but unfortunately you can only use them in predetermined areas.  Also, you can't retrieve them.  That's okay though, because the game is linear and the joy of exploring is absent anyway!  Speaking of arrows:  you get 3 variants of the plain arrow, one water, one fire, one explosive, and one called choke.  Why they felt we needed 3 plain arrows and 2 incendiary, but no moss or gas arrows is puzzling.  Why even bother having the rope arrow when Garret has a grappling hook?  A tool you only see him use in cutscenes and a couple times during the scripted console-boy climbing sequences.  These sequences, btw, are pointless.  There is no gameplay actually happening - you simply follow a series of pipes and grates to your destination.  There are no puzzles or enemies to worry about - it's like they threw them in just to be able to tick off a checklist.The item system:  new items include wire snippers to disarm traps, a pry bar to open windows, and a wrench to open vents.  Arrows don't have their own world model and instead are represented in game by what looks like a bagged lunch.  You can pick up food, but it also looks like a bagged lunch instead of, ya know, food.  Oh, and Opium.  Garret takes Opium.  It helps him ""focus"".  That's a great message for the kids, huh? Items can be found, but they can also be bought.  I thought it funny to find the merchant from Resident Evil 4 moonlighting here as a guy dressed like a flasher eager to show off his goods.  The merchant also lets you upgrade your skills via special items.  Yes, they've RPG-ified a game that in no way needed to be RPG-ified.You can no longer jump or mantle wherever you'd like, assumingly because the developers are massive d**Kheads.  You're going to hate going through windows by the end of the game.  You pry open a window, climb in, once inside you turn around - window is closed and you have to do it all over again to get out.  Going through vent grates is also annoying.  Opening drawer after drawer in a dwelling may be tedious, but even worse is this new peek mechanic which you will accidentally engage when searching for items in desks and cabinets.  The developers thought Thief gamers had it too good with simple lean keys, so now we have to press a key (the same key used for just about everything else) that causes you to become glued to corners of walls and furniture until you press a separate release button.  Pointless mechanic.  Speaking of pointless:  the game now has quicktime events.  Going through a window, squeezing through a narrow space, and certain sections of game involve a bit of button mashing.  FOR NO REASON.  The graphics are lovely, if you enjoy the black-on-grey Tim Burton motif in EVERY single map.  The sound is abhorrent.  You will hear guys from across a room like they are right next to you, and yes this will drown out some cutscene dialogue.  Forget about the glory days of having to lean against doors to hear what's in the next room - standing in the road a ways down the street is just as good.  My favorite sound issue is when dialogue from an NPC isn't finished before they start talking about something completely different.  The lighting system is also flakey.  I've been spotted in pitch black - and I've seen enemies find bodies hidden away in the shadows like they were clear as day.  The AI is just as broken - sometimes they'll get stuck in place and refuse to do anything more.  I've had numerous ""daydreaming"" AI encounters that would make ghosting a mission imposssible.  The missions are mostly linear romps with singular paths and they all contain story cutscenes or action sequences, because nothing says ""immersion"" like having control of the character taken away from the player.  Oh, good luck navigating the City hub - I can't imagine anyone living in such a crazy circuitous mess.  Good Lord, I could go on.  It's just awful.			"

												I had my qualms about Dishonored when I first played it, because of the plot (that ping-ponged you on the outskirts of a real story, leaving you no real choices) and and its decorative, linear world. But compared to Thief remake, Dishonored is a masterpiece. And the sad thing is, Thief is totally playable, solid game - but slightly annoying in all possible ways, and also completely ridiculous. Slightly amusing TL;DR next.Thief is not a horrible game - rather, it's quite mediocre, despite all of the evident labor that went into its making. The source of the most excrutiating pain is the game's plot: it's all incredibly half-baked, illogical twists and baffling characters who are all over the place. Yes, including Garrett, who is part action-star jock (delivering one-liners in the most inappropriate situations), and part piece of wood, that chooses all the worst moments to insert a meaningful silence (so they all look like bug-eyed weirdness). All in all, Garrett reminded me of Shia LaBoeuf, which is Eldritch enough in itself. I won't even get into the game's half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt at political commentary, because it's clearly pulled straight from other movies and games without any thought. Dialogue is simply very bad (though overheard ""flavor"" conversations are perfectly OK). For me, the highlight of writer's craft  was when chief of criminal police explained to a notorious thief the meaning of the ubiqitous in-game word meaning ""thief"" (along the lines of ""You see, when they catch thieves, they scald their hand in tar, so thieves are often called blackhands. Did you know that?"") The ending is so muddled and confounding, it's almost high-art surreal.OK, let's disregard the plot (and we can, literally, since there are several nice little, interesting side missions to play). Game mechanics (like the plot) is a smorgasbord of Dishonored, Hitman: Absolution, Assassin's Creed and others. Each one contributes a lovely bit of gameplay - and almost all of these bits don't work. Including the bits from original Thief. For example, Absolution-style closets for hiding are so completely useless, developers made them double as save points. I beat the game on Master using stealth, and I used the cabinet for hiding once. And I could do without it that time. And you can save anytime anyway.Stealth is not very good: on one hand, enemies are deaf and dumb, on the other, there are only two lighting situations for the player: brightly lit and totally obscured by darkness. The end result looks rather ridiculous, player prancing around people, snatching earrings out of their earlobes and cups before their eyes, hiding behind a coffee table in a lit room, hiding in plain sight in the middle of the stairs and so on. Another example of (Dishonored-)pulled mechanic is the Swoop - a cool accelerated stealth motion that is almost silent for some reason. Again, it's sometimes cool, but it undermines the tension and calculations of stealth: if there is a danger of detection, you just swoop around enemies like a terrified jetbike caught in hostile waters.Close combat leaves you feeling like an idiot: to make Garrett more thievy, they denied him the use of any edged weapons, so even if you make a tough moral decision to murder the guy who discovered you, you will have to hit him repeatedly with a small club until he is too tired to block. Yes, I'm not joking, it's the only kung fu in Garrett's arsenal.Open-world navigation is incredibly infuriating. In attempt to make the (very small) town into kind of a puzzle, developers closed off 90% of the roofs and plotted extremely arbitrary and convoluted paths, without any consideration for how the hell could anyone live in this city at all. And where is everybody. The ""overheard conversations"" mechanic always works as disembodied voices from inaccessible Nowhere, SOMETIMES EVEN IF THE CONVERSATION IS INSIDE THE APARTMENT YOU'RE IN. And it glitches sometimes, so you hear the same chat about a nice-smelling sex-worker all over the level, like it's a ghost that haunts your undersexed thieving self. Apartments that you rob, meanwhile, are always ominously empty. The nail in the coffin is arbitrary window-portals and ""narrow-passage-portals"" between maps, that never tell you where are you going. They're slow, annoying, and for all of their lengthy animations, they still end up showing you a loading screen.And several hours into the game, you realize that you're stealing everything from everyone, from lowly vagrants to artistic types to dead people to nobility. That's because neither Garrett or the game itself do not differentiate. For them, it's like collecting rings in Sonic.Oh, and Garrett can't jump. It's OK as a design choice, there are a lots of designated climbing points... but Garrett also can't jump over small and deadly pressure plates. He just expires, raising his hands in despair (that's his dying animation, for some reason).Anyway, it all comes down to the plot. You could gladly trod though not-so-perfect-but-totally-OK gameplay if you didn't roll your eyes every half an hour, or if any of the NPC's caused f***-giving counter to show of the myriad readings not amounting to zero. I certainly trodded through Thief all the same, and went away with something to tell - like the SUDDEN Silent Hill revival in the mental institution, or the need to set up precise soft flesh headshots, or cool side missions, or the HONESTLY COOL peripheral/central vision stealth mechanic (when enemies' reaction time depends on how peripheral you are to their vision cone). I have the utmost respect to its developers who churned out this enormous amount of content and threw in a couple of good ideas.There is a lot of things in Thief, and many of them are righteous. But the demonic side won.***I should clarify, after reading other reviews, that there are many smart bits about new Thief's stealth. Detection of open containers, peripheral vision, multi-level alert, cumulative alert and so on. At the same time I should add that the game world (which is part of the plot, so it's covered in the review) is not very convincing. It's 1920's (or later) technology, household items, fashion and overall aesthetics in a sorta medieval world. Rachmaninov playing on voxophones but lighting with torches. Wirecutters that cut rope. Rope that controls electrical machinery. Ratchet wrenches, metal ductwork and compound bows, and no firearms.			"

												Back in the day when other games encouraged players to shoot everything in sight, there was one game that challenged the standard. This game gave players freedom while also introducing them to a world where the faith of people lay in machinery and magic. Thief: The Dark Project also introduced us to the Master Thief, Garrett – who would go on to win our hearts not through brute force but through his cunning nature. I don’t know how to say the following without it coming across as rude. EVERYTHING that we loved about Thief has been, literally and figuratively, buried deep in the cold, hard ground. This review is meant for the players who have decided to make this their first Thief game – if you take anything from this review, let it be this: this is NOT what Thief games are about.Level Design: The city appears so spacious and lively at first glimpse. Don’t be fooled. In order to finish the main storyline, the game requires that you traverse through the same paths on MULTIPLE occasions in order to get to the next chapter. The city and areas connected to it feature gateways (like windows and narrow crawlspaces) that involve constant button mashing to unlock and pass. This feature alone becomes frustrating once you realize it is located around every corner. The chapters occasionally offer different paths inside a target building but eventually all paths will converge to the same endpoint in a chapter. Pointless in a game where if you want 100% of the loot, you will cover every nook and cranny. The city which was initially introduced as being lively eventually just ends up being the same guards (either City Watch or Graven) on patrol and the same civilian (albeit different model) who happens to walk around examining Builder knows what. Oh right, and the many homeless people who never interact with the protagonist in any way.   Audio and Music: You would think for a stealth game, the audio would be a must! Conversations can sound muffled from one person and not the other, despite being the same distance apart – even among main characters. Conversations from guards overlap and repeat every so often and might even get stuck on a neverending cycle. Oh and nobody says “TAFFER” anymore! It’s so disheartening to hear someone just blatantly say “f**k” (wow, so edgy!) I miss the days of quality banter between the drunken guards. The surface you choose to traverse across doesn’t matter because it all makes the same noise to the enemy depending on your proximity to them. All that matters is that you slowly creep and the enemies won’t know a thing. The only time the music AND audio ever stood out was during the spooky haunted asylum mission. (nod of approval for the audio based safe combination) But most of the time, the music just interferes with your ability to listen to FOOTSTEPS and NOISES.Character Design: Garrett doesn’t have his Mechanical Eye anymore. Instead, he has another eye ability which he doesn’t ever question until someone else points it out. Not like it ever matters because that still doesn’t explain why his new eye is capable of highlighting all loot and interactive objects within sight. (See also: Easy Mode) Furthermore, everyone in this game talks (non-stop) through clichés. Garrett used to have amazing dialogue but now just uses any opportunity he gets to point out the obvious. As for his protégé, Erin; they kept reusing her lines over and over in what seems like dream sequences. Dream sequences that you can’t skip. Last but not least, I must cover the most stereotypical villain of all time: The Thief-Taker General! (Great name by the way) This scumbag will show up more often than Team Rocket to make sure he captures Garrett in the most inefficient manner possible. Please never do this again.Game Mechanics: Where do I start? When you map keys, don’t map similar ones to the same action. The same key that’s used to open a drawer, is also used to peek around the corner. This leads to frustrating situations. Then there’s the arrows. Oh thank the Trickster God that the rope arrow is back! What’s that, you say that you can only use them on certain designated spots? And if you ever miss with arrows, you can’t salvage them? Curse thee, O’Trickster Lord! In addition, the blackjack knocks people out using a long, drawn out scene – just in case anyone wants to take a picture. If you ever decide to collect 100% loot, don’t start thinking that the hub will display your current amount! Nah, you better get well acquainted with the F1 key and the game’s menu screen. That reminds me, the overworld map is very unconventional and inefficient; often zooming in as far as possible on your current room. Great, I’m in a moderately-sized rectangular-shaped room. What's the point? Last but not least, this game holds your hand from the moment you start to the very end. If using focus wasn’t enough, Garrett also feels the need to mention your current objective via dialogue. Story: You know those blogs that say “Welcome to my Twisted Mind”? This game’s story looks like it was entirely written by people running such blogs. This story is so simple and bland, I'm surprised it was ever approved. While I’m at it, why does one of the Chapters have you sneak through a brothel? Who thought “Hey, I know what a Thief game needs: Pr0stitutes!” If it’s not too much to ask, please keep the smut in fan-fictions and out of future Thief games. Let me wrap this up without spoiling too much. This game’s story makes very little sense to me – they want to usher in an era of progress and industrialism by holding a magical ceremony which corrupts the minds and bodies of humans?Concluding Remarks: This game takes elements from other games and tries to make Garrett something that he was never meant to be: a Steampunk Batman. There needs to be more of a focus on the stealth side and less on the quicktime events and action sequences. Give players back the freedom to interact with their environments and choose their own path towards multiple endpoints. Fix the glitches and get rid of transition points and LONG loading screens. If you want to reboot the Thief series, that is completely FINE! But don’t erase everything that made it special. The Hammerites, the Pagans and the Keepers all contributed to Garrett’s development. My hope is that Thief will see another game in the franchise; one which develops Garrett’s origin story. This game will take us through his life; meeting Artemus, training with the Keepers, his eventual return to a life of thievery and finally it ends with the events preluding the Dark Project. Show us how he became a MASTER THIEF! It also would not hurt to have him be voiced by the talented Stephen Russell. This game is not bad as a standalone title, but it’s not a Thief game. Therefore, I give this game a score of 5/10.			"

												Regardless of how important the series is to you, Thief is just a fundamentally flawed game. I finished a ghost run on Master Thief difficulty with most of the UI switched off. It's a massive, generous game that plays like it was rushed out the door. When it works, it can be enjoyable but it has too many bugs, design flaws and questionable decisions to recommend to anyone but the most desperate of stealth fans.Thief is a broken, tragic, rewritten mess of a game. The plot has clearly been reworked multiple times. The Baron and Orion standing in for the Mechanists and Pagans respectively, is fine on paper but it doesn't work in execution. Since they have barely any screen time, they have to scream their motivations to the player in an awkward, rushed manner. Erin feels like a holdover from an earlier iteration of the game, when it was a straight sequel to Deadly Shadows. The Thief Taker General is hilarious. I love it when he happens to find Garrett, who has just returned from a trek through a long forgotten ruin, underneath his bed at the brothel. I like the idea of Garrett having an antagonist but TTG is just awful; a bald, mustachioed villain who walks with a limp, drops f-bombs, kills his underlings over trivial matters (so you know he's bad!) and has a crossbow affixed to his arm. There's way too much going on here. He feels like a one of the grotesque characters from Hitman: Absolution. Why Eidos Montreal thought he would be a good choice for the Thief universe is baffling.The sound-mixing is atrocious. The worst I've ever heard in any AAA game. That's not hyperbole. It's broken. Sound cuts out frequently, guards across a courtyard sound like their yelling into the players ear, npcs yell ambient dialogue over Basso repeatedly during cutscenes, and Garrett's voice actor frequently pauses to his read lines. The lip-syncing is horrid. I really miss the sound propagation from the earlier titles. Unless you're walking on glass or water, it's doesn't matter where you walk, Garrett won't make a sound.There are some really cool additions including blunt arrows (must-have for all future Thief games), some instances of impressive a.i. (noticing open safes, lights switching off etc...), knocking over bottles, real-world alarms (birds, dogs), the lockpicking game making a noise when you fail. It's quite enjoyable, but not without reservations. Some of the best parts of the game are undermined by, I suspect, poor play testing. For instance, after cracking a safe in tailors shop, Garrett refused to stop examining the silly earring I just nabbed. The animation was unskippable, so when the guard rounded the corner, I didn't have time to shut the safe, and he went on alert. Not cool.While the city looks gorgeous, its pretty much empty. The sidequests are neat, but most of the time I'm just exploring an vacant apartment; no one's home. If I mess up the lockpicking or set off a trap 9 times out of 10 it doesn't matter since it's empty. All these cool additions to the game are underused. Also, there's so many loading zones! Enter a one room apartment. Pick up a letter opener and a ring. Leave in under 20 seconds. Load for just as much. This content just slows the game down. Then there's a lack of abilities and gadgets. I like Swoop, but it's basically a grounded Blink and the rest of Garrett's abilities are essentially uniquely skinned door-openers. Garrett's movement has a nice heft to it. He feels present. But moving through the world is about working out exactly what the designer wants you to do, not using your instincts or experimenting. If a rope arrow is just out of reach, don't bother trying to grab it. You need to look for a crate, or a ladder or a walk way to reach it. It's a discrete puzzle that was made for that specific instance. I wish it was like Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge. Instead it's an awkward compromise that isn't very enjoyable. Unlike Dishonored, where the designers have a set of rules that you can rely upon, Thief is about instances. These guards will patrol in this pattern no matter what. This object can be leaned around, while another identical object cannot. You can climb this crate, but not this one. It's such a frustrating game! It doesn't have the same love Eidos Montreal had for Deus Ex. That team got the brand. Thief doesn't play like the rest of the series. That's fine. It's been a decade since Deadly Shadows. Time moves on. But Dishonored is Thief's competition and that game, as a stealth adventure, did a better job in every respect of capturing the essence of Thief. Thief plays like it was made in 18 months. It simply wasn't ready. I hope they get the opportunity to take a long look at what happened here, evaluate and take another stab at the licence.			"

												In abolutely every domain except graphics, it does much less than any of the original titles.This is not a subjective statement, it's not about taste or preference, or being nostalgic, it's about being unable to do a lot of specific things that were possible in a game from 1998 !The value of the older games was that you could do things that the developers did not think of, and did not plan for.But in this game exploration is non-existent, you can jump here (no, not there!), you can shoot your rope arrow only here in this exact pre-aproved spot, but not in any other wooden surface. You are literally being prohibited to engage in any action that was not planned by the ""developers"".I am sorry for the younger people who might think that this tripe is acceptable because they didn't get to experience something that is so much more. This is how the standard gets lowered by unscrupulous developers and publishers looking to work as little as possible for our money. (graphics alone do not make up for the removal of 80% of gameplay capabilities)			"

												It’s been a while since I played something as blatantly unfinished as Thief. At first the game appears reasonably well polished. But the further you get into the game you start noticing glaring issues with production values and design. I started out having a good time playing this, and in the second half of the game I was wishing it would just end.The first three Thief games set the bar as far as sound design goes. Everything from the droning ambient sound and music to the sound of walking on surfaces and NPC dialogue was as good as it gets in games. This Thief is like a joke compared to them. First off it’s just not done to an acceptable level of polish. You will often not be able to hear voice over from Garrett because some ambient sound or music overpowers his voice. Sometimes his voice over is even cut off early by the game transitioning to a load screen. It’s also lacking in finesse even when it’s working normally, as you often can’t tell where guards are. If you’re inside a building someone walking out on the street will sound like he’s just beside you in the room. Elevation, walls and such don’t seem to matter to the sound engine. It’s a critical problem in a stealth game where you’re always listening intently to tell where guards are before you see them. When you can’t trust your ears it becomes hard to believe in the world as a real place. For example the surfaces you walk on barely matter in Thief. Instead of clanking noise on metal you don't notice it. Cobble stones are no different from thick carpet. In the old Thief games you could almost feel how the material felt, just by the sound it made when you stepped on it. Here it's all the same. Not only does it make it harder to believe in the world, but it also robs the game of an entire layer of strategic thinking while navigating.Another issue with the game mechanics was the decision to ditch the old movement system, replacing it with the Assassin’s Creed system. So in order to run, jump, climb or vault object you hold down L2 (or the keyboard equivalent). The game decides for you which is the appropriate thing to do at the time. Over and over again this system did the opposite of what I wanted. Sometimes I wanted to stand on a ledge to get a better view of the environment, and instead Garrett leapt to his death, or vaulted right in front of a guard. Often I saw objects I thought I should be able to climb, but couldn’t. Or areas where I thought I should be able to jump down, but couldn’t because the ground below was uneven. This makes you feel constrained in what you can do. Especially later in the game when you’ve mastered all the basic game systems and would like to experiment with more inventive tactics. Many things in the game feel like the result of a hundred cooks meddling with the design and adding their own ideas. Presumably a faction of the Thief dev team pushed for Assassin’s Creed style navigation without realizing it meant robbing players of expression and ruining the endgame.What I found downright confusing in Thief was how bad the acting was. Most of the major characters like Garrett are fine. But far too much of the guard banter is embarrassing, like it was a fan dub instead of a professional release. The script doesn’t help, but in general the line delivery was shocking. The story as a whole hardly makes sense. A disease called the Gloom is terrorizing the city. But you don't see the effects of it in the game. I never had any clear idea what it was, how it manifested itself, or why anyone should care about it. It’s clear that the story was never finished in time. In the ending the last bit of gameplay cuts into a pre-rendered cutscene which doesn’t match what was happening in the scene at all. As if they were part of different revisions of the script, and they weren't allowed the time to bring them in sync. As it is now the ending feels like two halves of different scenes spliced together with no regard for continuity.The signs that this wasn’t ready to ship are everywhere. You have a focus ability in the game which highlights objects and traps in the world. One might assume that this is intended as a help for novice players to navigate the world easier. But as it turns out the developers used it as a crutch to cut corners on level design. Some traps don’t have visual markers in the world and are only visible using focus. Interactive objects like rope arrow spots are almost impossible to spot without it. There’s a minimap in the game, which is also a must if you want to find the stores in the city to buy and sell upgrades. While playing Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 I noticed they used player assists in a similar fashion. Not to help new players, but to prop up crappy unfinished designs to a level somewhat suitable for human consumption. I hope this isn’t a trend for the future of AAA games. I want thoughtful and well executed designs. Not some shambling wreck held together with tape and glue in the form of waypoints, minimaps and glowing highlights in the environment. Is it really that hard to do this right?During my first couple sessions I thought I would be able to recommend this as I was having a good time. Maybe get it when it’s cheap.			"

Note: this is the first Thief game I've ever played and I'm disappointed. I can't imagine how disappointed a loyal fan of the series could be.Underwhelming and boringGoes to show graphics aren't everything in a game.✓ Great graphics✓ Good voice acting✓ Nice stealth mechanics✓ Plenty of collectibles and challenges✓ It lives up to its name, STEAL ALL THE THINGS!✗ Mediocre gameplay✗ As linear as it gets✗ Crappy story✗ Very dumbed down for consoles✗ Full of hand-holding✗ Combat sucks✗ Although V.O. is good, the writing is BAD✗ Little to no room to explore✗ Overall a tryhard gamePersonal thoughtsThis game is a mess. It's like dunkey said:Originally posted by videogamedunkey:You know nowadays game developers, before they're even done developing the core game they wanna go out and add every single feature from every game they've ever seen.It's like making a pizza and there's no cheese on it, but now they wanna go ahead and add mushrooms, then they're bringing on the spinach on there, uh... peruvian onions from like underground layer, sliced banana peppers... then they're bringing in some olives and like roast beef... ughh like mosquitoes......and then you just have this abomination that nobody should eat and it costs $60.Thief could've been such a fantastic stealth/stealing based game, but it's like that wasn't enough so they put some parkour gimmicks. It still wasn't enough so they shoved in a RPG like system (perks, puzzles and upgrades)... but they forgot about the combat. Dear god the combat system is SO bad you'll actively avoid being seen just so you don't have to caress the enemies with your blackjack. Did I mention that arrows are unlootable? You can only purchase them and you'll run out pretty fast, so forget about archery.The missions are incredibly linear and they feel more like a chore as you progress. Every time you discover a new map there's this impressive aerial view of the place... it makes you think ""so much room to discover!"" but nope, it's all a small sandbox with some alternate routes to make you think there's strategy involved.And what's with all the illogical stuff throughout the game? Like why the hell does Garrett keep using the claw if he insults Erin for relying on it? Why is the city full of meshes and scratched wooden spots for me to escape? It's not like they're hidden... any guard can see them and it's pretty clear they're used by thieves.Why do I keep the most valuable treasures instead of selling them and living the high life with my dirty money? Or moving to a city without a plague, for that matter. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. I really tried to like this game, I really tried, but I ended up getting bored.Noteworthy  If you want parkour, play Mirror's Edge  If you want stealth, play Dishonored  If you want an RPG, play SkyrimJust don't bother with Thief.

												Thief was one of my most anticipated games of the year, and it's unfortunate that it was such a letdown.  A long-awaited sequel to the stealth franchise of the same name, this was the opportunity to allow powerful technologies to free the developers to make a compelling title full of the dense, interconncted levels the the original games were known for.Visually, the game is stunning, full of dark, moody environments and detailed characters.  The actual stealth mechanics work quite well, too. Creeping and peering around corners works well, and the enemy AI achieves the right balance of being observant, but not too frustrating to sneak around. As expected, you do quite a lot of stealing in the game, but whereas past titles simply had loot disappear when clicked on, your character's hands are now modeled to depict every action.  This tactile feel extends to other areas of interaction, as well.Where the game fails, quite resoundingly, is in its narrow, unambitious level design. For all their visual splendor, the levels are almost always linear paths with few options.  Instead of the massive areas of past titles in the series, we get a succession of tiny rooms, and very often a small bit of progression blocks access to the previous area.  It's a transparent use of checkpointing, and it makes levels feel too artificial and as a result progressing through these areas doesn't give a strong sense of accomplishment. For a comparison, it would be best to try the original two Thief games (or some of the numerous fan missions that exceed the originals in quality) or even the recent Dishonored game to see how rewarding level design can be when it strives to create non-linear environemnts that feel like a functioning place.On top of all this, the story/characters fall completely flat. The previous character actor of the series brought a cynical, worldweary, but still humorous take on Garrett, the protagonist.  Those dimensions are entirely lost here, and instead this Garrett, and the whole story, are entirely one-note: grim and dark.  At times this  morose tone seems to stretch into self-parody as the story takes ever sillier twists and turns.  I'd entirely stopped caring by the time I finished the game.			"

												NOTE: Compiled from notes found in the garbage containers of Eidos Montréal offices...""Man, I loved playing Outlast. I should definitely design a level like that. An asylum level with ghouls wandering around.""""I wonder how the guards should react when they see a downed character. Hmmm, maybe they could look around first th- Ah, forget it. I'll ask the folks at Square Enix to send me the AI used in Hitman for this.""""Just remembered that super cool ""Blink"" ability that made it possible for me to play Dishonored. I should add something like that to Thief too. I'll call it ""Swoop"".""""Can't think of an object to place right in the center of this locked drawer which will of course contain nothing else but that object! Ugh, I'll just place another pen.""""Let's put a single gold coin here on top of this roof. Why not?""""I can't believe I forgot about the log the player has to lift to move on to another area. I should be more careful. Don't wanna end up like Dave who lost his job for using a different window model.""""My son said he will never talk to me again if he can't climb on walls like Ezio even after I explained to him that this is a first-person game. I guess I have no choice but to do it.""""When you finish a mission in the newest Splinter Cell, it scores your gameplay in three categories. We have to do that too man!""""Too bad. We put tons of closets everywhere so the player can hide the bodies in them but we don't have any time left to do the animations and stuff.""-----I'm the legendary master thief, Garrett. I steal pens and spoons. I can only be in total darkness or shine bright like a diamond.To be honest, the game is not that bad. Just disappointing. Definitely not the successor to the original series.I loved the setting of the game, dark and immersive. The musics are great. Can't say the same for the story, sound effects and voice acting. Actually all sounds are garbage and there's something wrong with the loudness of the dialogues. Sometimes a man talking miles away will sound like he's next to you. Bad for a stealth game. Even the Thief games I played when I was just a kid had better sound.Firing the bow is fun. Shame that none of the arrows are retrievable. Anyway, we aren't supposed to kill guards after all.I really wanted to play a mission in daylight for a change. It's always night and all the beds are empty. City of vampires?Feeling indifferent about the caged animals in the game but at least they tried something new, I guess.I don't understand how a revolutionary game like Thief ends up with a reboot so unspecial like this?Hopefully Eidos will try harder next time and we'll have a much more memorable game.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Thief Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Stealth; Action; First-Person; Atmospheric; Aesthetic My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWI’m going to begin by saying that I understand some people with specific tastes may legitimately dislike this game, and they are entitled to their opinion and I respect that.  But I also believe some of the excessive negativity that surrounds this game is exacerbated by an overly vocal group of “Debbie Downers.”  At the time of writing this: the data shows that more than two-out-of-three people who took time to review this game enjoyed it; but there are mostly negative reviews as the “most helpful” on the store page.  So it seems the people who disliked the game really want you to know about it, even though there is evidence that suggests that there are more people who liked it than who didn’t. And so this review may receive a load of critique by those who refuse to respect my opinion even though I’m able to respect theirs, but that is OK.  All I know for sure is that: I liked Thief.Is this game different from the early installments of the Thief franchise? Yes.  It has no doubt been modernized to appeal to a wider audience of gamers and not just the hardcore stealth fans (i.e.: it is easier).  Still, if you take the time to set up a custom difficulty, you can remove much of the “hand-holding” and make the game quite punishing.  Nevertheless, I can empathize with everyone who was let down by this game being too mainstream by default and not staying true to the established traditions.Thief is semi-linear, undoubtedly, especially during the individual levels; although there is a decent amount of freedom to explore The City.  The thing is: you certainly won’t get stuck spending 3 hours lost in the sewers like you may have in the older games.  Thief is far less enigmatic than the earlier installments.  Some long term fans are upset by this, and you may be too— and that is your prerogative.  That said, there are also a lot of people who don’t want to spend a whole evening of gameplay being lost on one level in one game, especially if they only have a limited amount of hours of free time in which to play games.So it is true that this game is quite different than the early editions in the franchise.  It does hold your hand in the default state (although you can turn off most assistance in the options and difficulty settings).  And it is rather linear.  You have every right to dislike that and dislike this game.  But maybe you are one of the many gamers who just wants to relax and play a game for a few hours after working all day.  Maybe you are looking to go on an intriguing adventure, want to be told a story, and don’t feel like getting lost or frustrated on the way.  Well then maybe you should give Thief a try.I felt the most captivating aspect of the game was the stellar atmosphere of the gameworld.  The ambiance is mysterious, violent, dark, and mystifying.  The high production value of the graphics and soundscape went a long way to reinforce the air of quality inherent to the game’s atmosphere.  Moreover, even if many other aspects failed, I thought the ambiance of the game stayed true to the established traditions of the franchise.The narrative isn’t the most riveting piece of writing to grace the realm of video games, but it is mildly interesting and serves to give some purpose to the gameplay.  The gameplay itself is fun.  With the custom difficulty settings you really can take the driver’s seat in determining how casual or grueling of an experience you want.  The controls are smooth and intuitive, and there aren’t any painful flaws that will cause you to accidentally be spotted.There are plenty of collectibles, secrets, and achievements if you are into that kind of thing.  There are also a large amount of sidequests which can really open up and expand the game if you choose to pursue them.Thief is a pretty fun game, but certainly isn’t a masterpiece.  It is quite mainstream, and definitely has stepped out from the hardcore stealth realm of the earlier editions in the franchise.  If you just want to play a nice atmospheric game with a high production value and have some fun, you can definitely find that here.  If you want traditional hardcore Thief gameplay, you may be disappointed— although you may also want to consider trying the custom difficulty before you blindly dismiss it. It has some flaws and minor annoyances, but overall it can be a rather enjoyable experience. Regardless, this is definitely the type of game where you are going to have to determine your own preferences and decide if you want to try it or not.  All I know for sure is that: I liked Thief.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Before I begin, let me get the inexcusable out of the way: I have never played any of the Thief games prior to this 2014 release, so I don't have any basis for comparison. Turns out, it doesn't matter.The game starts off well enough with the jewelry store heist in the first chapter; picking locks and pockets is initially thrilling enough to get any kleptomaniac's heart racing. Eventually as the game progresses, it becomes evident that the NPC AI has been pared down to the point that sneaking around isn't much of a challenge. What is challenging though, is the way in which missions are replayed. Want to go back and play through a chapter to pick up that missed bit of loot? Well, forget about selecting the mission from the menu, you'll need to head back into the area in The City hub where the mission began. Hardly intuitive when there's no option for fast travel and the map is absolute rubbish. In addition, the story is bland, and the characters aren't very engaging. There are issues with the sound, too, which ruin the atmosphere when you're trying to be quiet and you hear a loud voice, which must surely mean someone's in the room with you and you're about to be discovered. Nope, the person talking is outside. Across the road. In another building. On a more positive note, the art design is great, the buildings and surroundings appear to be painstakingly crafted.  Sadly, this doesn't warrant purchasing a game, so I'd wait until there's a substantial discount. $5 and Thief would be a steal.			"

												You know there are two kinds of review you should take into consideration when you have a reboot for an oldschool game like Thief. There are the the people who are hardcore fans and are looking for the game they know and love, then there are the new players who are looking for a good game in general. I am new player, I have never played a Thief game before this so obviously I speak for the 2nd group of players. So far this game is very fun and unique among my game library. I am glad to see this game sticks to its guns and focuses on actual thievery and isnt combat such as Assassins Creed or Dishonored, fighting multiple enemys is suicide and stealth is always the best option. There is also the ability to customize the difficulty in any way that suits your playstyle to make it harder or easier, by chooseing harder settings boosts your score and rewards you for playing hardcore. Another feature I like seems to be similar to Splinter Cell, after a mission you receive a score based on three catagorys (Ghost, Predator, Opportunist). My only beef with this game so far is that its a little linear and the maps seem small compared to a game like Dishonored. Its just my preference, its nothing against the game. As long as a game maintains a strong story and good mechanics then being linear is fine, being a linear game seems like a bad thing these days and to me its just one method to telling a story.On to the second part of this review.When I was reading reviews on metacritic today I noticed that about 90% of the negative reviews were about how ""modern"" it was or how it was a crappy addition to the series. Now I can understand why people might be disapointed in the direction a game might take but it doesnt make it right to give it a 0/10. Fact is that this is a quality game and plenty of effort was put into developing it, thats all I can ask for. "

												Quite possibly one of the prettiest game I've ever seen (mostly from a technical standpoint, at least), and a great PC version too, if only the actual game was any fun to play.Now, while there's nothing entirely wrong with Thief per-se, there's the small things that grind your gears over the time. From the bizarre controls, which require you to press a special key to drop down from certain places but only those, the fact that in order to climb a ladder you have to press the jump key rather than use, or the fact that you can't actually jump, just press the jump key near a ledge and Garret will decide if he wants to jump or not. The annoying, long QTEs you have to do every single time you want to open a window (or to be specific, the same QTE repeated over and over again) don't help either, and the AI is serviceable though not even remotely good enough for a stealth game. I want to like Thief, mostly because the artists here put an incredible amount of love to the art, but the sub-par game design elements, lame story and overall lack of polish means that everytime I launched the game I minimized it at some point and started fooling around on the web completely forgetting the thing was even there, which is a first for me and hopefully the last.For all of these reasons I can't recommend this game, at least not at full price. It's not the worst, but it's also not good.			"

												I was a fan of the original Thief game and found this to be a terrible update for it. The lock picking mechanics maybe the only improvement. The linear style of the world and tons of loading screens is quite frustrating. I think the last two nails in the coffin for me (with this game) was how there is a loading screen combined with a closed window every time you move from area to area. Travelling between the areas is a nightmare and quickly gets frustrating. The final nail in the coffin was how closed the world felt. It seems like 90% of all the doors and windows you cross cannot be opened and are basically invisible walls. You can only jump up on certain walls and fences. It sort of feels like what a tablet version of Thief should have been, but it runs on PC. The game is to linear and has lost that open sandbox feel the original had.			"

												While all in all, not a bad game, true Thief fans from the original games will find themselves dissappointed. I was sad to see that Thief does not have the same feel as the old games. The humor that you receive from listening to the guards talk is also gone. Citizens wandering around the city do not acknowledge you, giving them a lifeless feel. The story is not as good as the stories in the previous games as it feels less compelling than the Dark Project, the Metal Age and even Dark Prophecy. The new game is also missing some of its most dynamic parts. What happened to the Hammers? The Pagans? Not to mention the unique enemies you encountered in all the previous games (mechanist robots, pagan creatures, keeper statues, etc). You also have to watch Garrett steal and interact with everything as opposed to just taking things, this wouldn't be a problem except that it slows down your ability to stay out of sight of guards. The combat in this game is an improvement, but as the old Thief games were the birthplace of stealth games, combat never was a big focus in Thief, if you're being seen by guards then you're doing it wrong. Overall, the new Thief lacks the dynamic story and gameplay of the original. I give it a 6/10. If you didn't play the original games then you likely will enjoy the game for what it is.			"

												Normally it would be hyperbole for a fan of a franchise to say this but... I really think this is the worst game I've ever played. With a decade of feedback on how to make your game, it's astronomically improbable to get it wrong this much accidentally. You have to know what to do right to get it all so wrong.These are my impressions of the game on the hardest difficulty with Focus disabled.Pros:Built-in performance benchmarking tool.Objects are easily recognizable as loot. No loot glint necessary.Instant hotkey for using healing items.Cons:AI:NPC's can't detect anything even slightly above them, visually or aurally.1st level alerts of enemies often end with the enemy dismissing the alert as ""just their imagination"" -but they will remain in an alerted state where they are convinced that a thieving intruder is in the area.NPC's can completely forget a chased intruder just 10 seconds since the last confirmed sighting.NPC's don't even comment on -let alone get alerted by missing valuables.Player can dodge all enemy melee attacks while standing still, but when enemies throw things at you, they hit with 90% accuracy regardless of how far you are and how fast you're moving.Animations:Literally every type of interaction with the environment and objects is a pre-animated sequence that takes away the player's control.This amount of animation-centric design causes many compromises, like the inability to open a box from the wrong side. The animation only exists for the front side.Controls to exit to menu or load a save are locked during death animation.Audio:Footstep sounds are totally absent at random locations.All sounds become totally muted when you enter certain areas, and ambient sounds change instantly on the edge between areas instead of fading into the distance.Sound propagation doesn't exist in 99% of the areas in the levels. Sounds travel through solid rock, and sometimes fail to travel past a few pillars.NPC foosteps are often difficult to hear. The earlier games relied on the player's ability to determine NPC locations based on sound.NPC conversations repeat indefinitely and the sequence of lines can get scrambled. NPCs can forget to deliver their lines, resulting in a strange nonsensical monologue.Conversations where the NPCs are hidden inside buildings follow no rules of sound propagation or stereo hearing. It sounds like they're talking inside your head.Looking through keyholes mutes the area you're in. You only hear what's on the other side.Cutscene audio volume is totally messed up. Characters speak too quietly, or NPCs in the environment talk over the main characters.Contextual interaction:Activating objects can accidentally put you into peeking mode (picking up items, dragging bodies, opening containers).Jumping restricted to pre-programmed spots.Dropping down from ledges arbitrarily requires- or doesn't require the use of the ""drop""-key. Player gets false sense of security and can fall off ledges that normally wouldn't allow that.Swooping can accidentally make you climb an obstacle.Rope arrows only stick to specific points, but you can still shoot them at anything and waste them.Controls do different things in certain situations (press cancel to drop even though there is a drop-key).Knockouts are contextual. Blackjack can't be selected manually like the bow.The only difference between a container closet and a hiding closet is visual appearance, and you can't cancel a transition into a hiding closet.Control:Mouse smoothing that can't be disabled.Object targeting is designed for analog controllers with inaccurate aiming, making it harder to target exact objects with more precise mouse control.Unrelated actions can be bound to the same key.Contextual actions can't be bound to separate keys.No hotkey for Map screen.Combination locks have infuriating controls. It would be so much better to just target a dial and activate to turn.Handholding:NPC:s arbitrarily stand by until player has obeyed the demands of tutorials.No option to disable tutorial messages, no option for ""Don't show this message again"".Mission objectives are indicated by icons on the map, and the in-game information that leads you to your goal mostly doesn't exist. The game assumes that everyone relies on the icons.Overpowered automap can be disabled in options, but it also gets rid of the on-screen compass.Player can disable Focus-system, but the Focus-gimmick is integrated as part of the lore and Focus powerups can still be picked up in the levels.Garrett uses monologue to reveal things to the player that he couldn't possibly know beforehand. Players aren't made to find that info themselves.Optional eavesdropping is sometimes replaced by cutscenes that forcefully highlight the relevant info for the player.Keys to unpickable locks are found in the absolute immediate vicinity of the lock.Searching for secret switches is a special gameplay mode that activates from a wide area. Previous games forced players to find small hidden switches.Lightning flashes are timed exactly with little to no variation, and there's a small warning flash before each big one.Interface:Savegames are categorized nonsensically, with a list of huge items where only a few are visible at the same time.Map screen has no option of switching pages. If you go into a house, you can't view city map.Player needs to navigate several menus to read documents even right after finding them in the game.Player can disable lockpicking overlay and play just fine, but not the frame-searching overlay.Stealth shroud effect on screen can't be disabled, but the light gem can. Both should be optional.Light gem is in the corner of the screen, far from your center of focus.Most loading screens are disguised as narrow pathways that waste your time. If you have a fast SSD, you are still forced to wait. On top of that, they have button-mash QuickTime Events.Mechanics:Shooting mechanics with the bow have no projectile drop, and string doesn't need to be drawn to fire off a shot. Easy to accidentally waste arrows.Rope arrows can't be recovered from where you've attached them.The one officially recognized form of melee combat is the modern equivalent of an unintended strategy of strafe-bashing with the blackjack in Thief:TDP.Can't aim flashbombs. Only option is to drop one at your feet.Disarming traps is the only supported way of avoiding them due to the inability to jump over pressure plates.Only unpickable locks have keys. If a lock is pickable, you have to pick it. There are no regular keys in the entire game. Consequently, locks can never be relocked.Many side areas or side quests don't have enough loot to make up for the expendable tools used to get there.Stealth:No matter how stealthily you play, Garrett gets caught multiple times in a cutscene outside the player's control.The amount of lighting that makes you visible to NPCs seems to change arbitrarily. Sometimes very dark areas fail to hide you, and other times you become invisible in well-lit areas.Only a few specific types of objects can alert NPCs when you bump into them. Vases falling over alert them, but kicking around a shovel or a bucket doesn't, even though they do make noise.Ground material has no effect on how loud your footsteps are. Only shards of glass and shallow water make your footsteps loud.Swooping is faster than running, but makes almost no noise.Some objects do not cast shadows from NPC-carried light sources. This can get the player in trouble. "

												I really enjoyed Thief II back in the day, and Thief 3 wasn't terrible, but this latest reboot has almost nothing going for it except the name.I wasn't digging Garrett's new style, but I wouldn't have let that sway my opinion of the game itself.  I gave it a fair chance, played completely through hoping it would get better, and that the story would finally hit its stride and start making sense.Pros: Sneaking mechanics work well, and the 'swoop' ability can really make you feel like you own the shadows.  Wide variety of arrow types.  Visuals are generally very good.  Voice acting is solid. AI seems solid, in the usual lovable  sneaker-amnesiac sort of way.Cons:  Sneaking works well, when the level designers actually let you use it, which isn't often. There may be multiple paths around the city, but they are few and feel like linear A=>B tunnels.  You will constantly be frustrated by the sheer amound of things Garrett can't or won't climb, or won't walk through, or mantle over, etc.The story makes almost no sense. Most of the time when a cutscene started, I would find myself asking ""How the crap did that just happen? And when it ended, I'd be wondering what the crap just happened.  It feels very disjointed, to say the least. Characters pop in and out, changing roles with the spastic plot twists.Speaking of characters popping in... it's downright embarrasing just how many times our hero gets jumped by a balding old creep with a walking stick and a limp. Seriously Garrett, they call you the Master Thief; you sneak up on people for a living. You'd think some of that experience would bleed over into the cutscenes, but no.  I threw up my hands more than once because I could see what was coming a mile away and Garrett was still completely oblivious.And even the final chapter left me with little resolution or warm fuzzies, so I can't recommend this to anyone, really.  Go play Dishonored instead.As a final note, there's one mission that has some fairly explicit adult content that you *must* witness to completed the mission, so take that as you will.			"

												Dear fellow thieves,I don't know where to start. Where... to start the rant.I seriously loved the first three Thief-titles. I own them all (already before Steam was invented) and still got every huge Eurobox standing next to me. I had much fun with them and I played Thief-the dark project like 30 times. (After writing this review I started again to play the trilogy...*cough*)Now a new Thief was released. And what shall I say? It looks pretty? It takes the stealth-genre to a new level? It will become one of the best games of all times?NOPE! It is... a betrayal to all fans and Looking Glass Studios is surely rotating in it's grave...Gameplay:This game is way to easy. The guards that shall defeat you are dumb as nuts. Oh, don't forget they might see you from time to time through a solid wall and kill you without seeing them.This game is so small... Smaller than a birdcage. The levels of the three earlier titles were huge. Amazingly huge and you were able to go (almost) everywhere. And now I try to go somewhere else than developers want me to in their linear-levels? Nope! I even can't jump where I want!Fighting has become ""Smash X as hard as you can, motherxxxxer"". That's it. nothing more. Oh wait, you have a bow. And you get special reward for headshots (Chapter 1). SERIOUSLY? If you are a thief, shouldn't you try to avoid drawing attention?And steal as much as you can? And I mean STEAL something, not just ink..... Another huge dissappopintment are the enemy units. There are guards, several types of guards (some have a torch, some a sword and some a bow, few a good armor). And some creepy guys (which they are is not clearly explained in my eyes). Those creatures ruin the atmosphere of some levels. And that's pretty it.Also the talk of the guards are constantly repeating. Funny for the first moment, it goes boring after hearing it fir the tenth time.And well... just look, we have a minimap (a point I consequently find irritating already in ""Thief - deadly shadows""). This game takes place in which era? Seriously, they have just invented electrical light and Garret already uses radar...? (as Always, Garret is/was ahead of his time....)Technical:What made the Thief-series so famous were their footsteps. Yes, their footsteps. You were able to hear where an enemy was, which ground he walks AND he was also able to hear YOU! In this game... footsteps?Oh and well you can't even hear if someone is a mile away or stands right behind you. So the sound is a complete mess.Another point I might add: music. The background music. Too electronic and soulless in my eyes. Doesn't fit in many situations, but that is just my opinion. WUB WUB WUB! Need I say more?Also I was confronted by several bugs and glitches. Not even fixed yet (four months after release). A disgrace. Game seems not to have been finished. Seriously?Graphics... the game looks good. Still don't know why the game needs to load every 10 meters.Story:Wait.... there is no actual story. This is... I don't even know what I should say without cursing and swearing.It's not even a spoiler, when I say: Energy crisis=> Magical stone explodes => your girl gets affected by explosion => look for her => find her => she dies? (The ending is just... CUT! Open end, wait for the next title!) => FIN.Conclusion:This is no stealth-game or even a THIEF-game. This is a disgrace to fans of the series. Shame on you, Eidos. shame on you. "

												If this were a stealth game with none of the ""Thief"" branding...It would only be somewhat passable. For the sake of my sanity I couldn't go into everything that is so wrong about Thief 4, but to have the nerve to reboot this series as if they could do it better and produce this generic gumbo soup of all of the worst modern video game cliches and boardroom concoctions of what would sell best, is an outrage. First, the story. The story is a joke, not only will you probably not know whats going on but you will not care even the slightest because it is so clumbsy, so poorly stitched together, right down to improperly synced voices and cutscenes that abrutly start and end like a bad commercial. The game revolves around a girl named Erin, an immediately unlikable angsty teen girl with all of the cliches you'd expect right down to ""I'm not a kid anymore"". Your experience with her whenever she appears to further the story is a girl ripped straight from 2016 thrown into a bland, unimaginative historical setting, just to throw a tantrum and behave totally irrationally. You don't care for Erin, yet the game seems to think you should have this bond with her while giving you ever reason to hate her and still never bother to include any context for why shes there. Shes simply a plot device to a further a story thats is painfully dull and shallow. Not only did Thief decide to reject the supernatural elements of the past games, but they replaced it and the lore with nothing more than a religious zealot who wants to control whatever the hell ""primal"" is supposed to be and rejected Resident Evil wall crawlers that behave like discount clickers from the last of us. There is no imagination in this game, there is no care or interest or love of the series that came before it. If there were, they wouldn't have systematically rejected every core tennant and game design element of those games. You'll spend your entire adventure doing nothing else but walking up behind guards and activating a painfully repetitive takedown animation which is so popular among big budget games today. Because why would simply swing your blackjack and knock out a guard when you could wait for a command prompt to allow you to activate their TOTALLY BAD♥♥♥♥♥animation which comes coupled with a sound effect so loud you'd think stealth wasn't a priority. That is one of the most frustrating parts of Thief, the animations tied to every single action you perform, from opening a drawer to picking up a coin, every one of them is paired with this 2 second animation that slows down picking up nickels and dimes to a crawl. In previous Thieves if you were to happen upon a chest with loot, you could pick up everything in that chest in as much time as it would take you to grab a single silver cup in Thief. To add to the frustration, the same command prompt for looting is the same one that locks you into peaking around cornes. You'll find yourself more often than not peering around a desk or shutting a door while you try to loot from a desk or the purse off a guard. Strategy is not necessary. In previous Thief games you were given a wide tool set from moss arrows, fire arrows, water arrows, noise maker arrows to rope arrows, however in Thief 4, you'll occassionally use water arrows and absolutely nothing else. There is no tactical use or requirement for any of your equipment. You'll get from the start of the game to the end with just ""Press Q to TAKEDOWN"", the same guards, over and over and over again. Rope arrows have even been downgraded from sensibly being used on wood surfaces to specifically designated wooden beams with a glowing blue rope tied around it to tell you, ""use your rope arrow here to get to this place"" which is generally just a single piece of loot or an alternate path which really doesn't change anything in terms of navigation. The world design has gone from an realistically designed location to a video gamey linear map that simply gives you a couple of different paths that take you to the same location. You can't get lost, you can't roam, you are given the illusion of an open map while really everything is walled in and blocked off to funnel you to the end. To make matters worse, instaed of a hand drawn map that clues you in as much as Garrett knows about the location, forcing you to become involved in your surroundings and navigate by landmark, they just give you a mini map with quest markers. Despite the fact the levels are basically hallways, they still float indicators all over the screen telling you exactly where to go and exactly where you are. The map alone indicates the greatest reason why Eidos Montreal knows so little or cares so little about Thief and what it is. They simply took a popular, respected name in the video game industry and recycled it into this generic, consolized, casualized mess of modern game cliches. At times you'll be running parkour across rooftops while things explode around you and others you'll jarringly be in 3rd person climbing up pipes and grates like Uncharted. They tried to rip off every popular modern game and stir it up into one game because they figured it would return the most profit. It's an incredibly lazy effort, in fact the ending to this game is so empty, you can literally feel the interest of the devs trail off to a roll credit because they just did not care anymore and needed to finish it for release. I could go on and on about all of the ways this game fails not only the Thief name, but game design in general. Eidos Montreal does not get it, they did not care, they cashed in on Thief and left a stain on the integrity of the series. Nothing about the game indicates fans of the series worked on this project. there is nothing about this game that indicates the developers even played the previous games. They removed Stephen Russel, the iconic voice of Garrett and replaced him with a generic angsty male that turns this now vampiric, emaciated looking Garrett into any other bland, brooding protagonist. Their excuse for this was they needed a motion cap performance that would sync up with the acting, but nowhere in this game does that ever present as either a necessity or even a feature. There is not a single moment in this game that an actor needed to record his lines while doing motion capture work, further insult to injury, but perhaps its best Stephen Russel was not attached to this poor excuse for a Garrett. Bottom line this is a soulless, effortless, completely awful cash grab that did not respect its IP.			"

												I've never felt so conflicted about a game in my whole life. On the one hand, there are so many elements I really like about Thief, but then there is a lot that I really dislike. I am a newcomer to the Thief series and intend to play the originals (just started the original) so I cannot really give comparisons, and I know that many die hard fans of the originals disregard this reboot. But I will offer my honest opinion as a gamer. Things I like: •  Gameplay.Engaging, fast-paced, satisfying, responsive, fairly varied. This is the number one element that makes or breaks it in a game for me. Thief, I feel, nailed it pretty well. I found the controls to be very responsive, so playing with Garrett literally feels like you are a thief sneaking around. I enjoyed the way Garrett interacts with the environment, whether it be to provide cover, create distractions, access secret areas, douse lights, reach new parts of the town, eliminate noise, etc. etc. Very fun and kept me engaged. Plus, I'm a sucker for open world and looting. I personally felt very anxious anytime there were a number of guards in the area, and did my best to stay hidden which was really enjoyable for me. I thoroughly enjoyed pick pocketing, luring them away, performing takedowns (both on the ground and aerial). Very satisfying.  I quite like the variety of items, even if I didn't use some of them much/at all. I felt like it offered a good choice of actions, allowing me to proceed however I chose. I also appreciated the stock limits in shops; later in the game, I found myself running out of stuff a lot and trying to conserve stuff for when I really needed it, which offered a bit of a challenge.I found that it sometimes got a little repetitive, but there was enough of a variation of areas and required play styles between chapters to keep me engaged.  • VisualsI kind of go back and forth about how I feel about Thief's environments. They are quite samey for the most part, but there were times when I'd look out of a window or across from a roof and see all these really awesome environments and think ""Wow, this is pretty cool."" The visuals are, I must say, very immersive. The graphics are great, but I had a LOT of frame rate issues. I customised my lighting a bit to get it nice and dark (and always played with dimmed lights) to really immerse myself, which worked well for me. There was a particular part (chapter 6 I think) where you escape from X location, and the escape sequence is really great visually. Fire everywhere, crumbling buildings, floor, wood, etc. Most importantly, I'm a sucker for Garrett. His character model is really cool and, again, immersive. Anytime I'm sneaking around, picking a lock, opening a safe, searching for trick switches and you get a look at his chipped, dirty fingernails and leather gloves, I really feel like I'm a thief looting in a dirty, degrading city. Plus, those aerial takedowns when you catch a glimpse of him fully masked in his black leather suit are awesome. ""That's me, being a badass!"" • DifficultyI have often heard people say that the game is too easy. Perhaps, but I played on Thief difficulty (medium) and I still found it to be a challenge. I became immersed in Garrett's character and like him opted to never kill (unless it was those certain enemies...people who've played far enough will know what I mean :P). Hence, I played purely stealthily, which offered a nice challenge for me personally. I found myself often reloading quick saves to make sure I was satisfied with my play through and that I had found all loot. If you blaze through the game aggressively, then yes it is easy. Play the game how it urges you to - stealthily - and it's a good challenge.Things I dislike:•  StoryThere is SO much freaking missed potential here. I cannot give the story any praise because it's just so choppy and awkwardly told. It expects the player to assume things and fill in the gaps - gaps which were obvious, but should be told by the characters to give character development to Garrett and other characters. As I said, there was potential for something really interesting, but as soon as it starts picking up speed, it comes to an abrupt halt. I cared nothing for any of the characters, not even Erin. Only Garrett, and that's because, as I said earlier, I felt like I was really him. I can't say more of course, just in case there are people who want to play and experience the story for themselves, but don't expect anything fantastic there. It's a let down to say the least. • RepetitionAs I've said earlier, the visuals and gameplay are sometimes very samey. I don't really have more to say there, but it can make the game a little tiresome at times. Fortunately, I had the patience and the gameplay gave me enough enjoyment to keep playing. • Immersion-breaking bugs, glitches, cheapness. Aggravating AI.  The number one bug I kept experiencing was repeated dialogue from NPCs nearby. If I have to hear about how this guy rolled with Polly Addler one more time, I'm seriously going to put an arrow in his skull. It really got on my nerves, especially because the subtitles kept playing on the screen over and over, or the dialogue came up at the wrong time when Garrett was talking and I'd want to hear him rather than some repeat conversation about how some guy is worried he's getting the Gloom. I had a few instances of enemies lagging and appearing next to me, being hit by projectiles through walls, being seen through walls, glitches in the AI, character model getting stuck and having to reload the game, falling off/through platforms when I shouldn't have, NEVER being able to get on damn ropes until I was at the precise angle, and other little annoyances. Sometimes I'd close a door by accident when trying to peek, alerting a nearby guard to my presence. Very minor, but very annoying. • Side questsBecause the world is pretty open, there was a lot of potential here for some varied side quests. Unfortunately, this did not happen. They are VERY samey - go to X, get this loot, done. All of them, with a slightly different description of why you're doing it. The only side quests I got vaguely interested in was the client quests, where there are actually characters talking to you about what to do, why they want you to do it etc. But there were only 6, and that was just between 2 people. Huge let down. As a completionist, I finished all side quests, but was very let down. • Chapter 5I can't say much for those who want to play this game, but let's just say the tone of the game takes a very dramatic turn and it's really jarring. It was technically a really great chapter, but I suddenly felt like I was playing a different game. I also felt that there was a massive difficulty spike here (in the later part of the chapter) and I was just simply not prepared ammo-wise. Overall comments:I really do recommend this game, purely because the gameplay is really fun, and to me that is the purpose of a game. I can overlook poor storytelling, issues with graphics, and some minor glitches if I ultimately have a great experience and feel immersed in the world, which I truly did.			"

												“Thief” is so disappointing on so many levels.Pros: Excellent visual aesthetic. Scenery looks phenomenal and the sense of dampness, filth, lighting, and props lend a lot toward immersion. Weaponry, though limited, is interesting. Sneaking around is quite fun.Cons: Linear, closed world. Narrow, almost claustrophobic corridor for exploration. Climbing tools are made available and fun to use but you may only climb in certain areas related to the path you are forced to take in the game. No clambering up on random boxes, roofs or pipes even if they look identical to the ones you are allowed to climb on. The world is very static, with a limited amount of interaction. Most doors cannot be opened. There is one story and you have to follow it or quit the game. I knew the game wouldn't be as open as Skyrim but was expecting at least the level of freedom that was available in a game like Dishonored, or maybe even Assassin's Creed. The game is gorgeous to look at, but it feels pointless. Not what I expect a game to be like in this decade.The game is called Thief, you play a thief... but stealing loot is merely incidental, whereas listening to conversations and looking through knotholes for clues that lead you through the story is far more important. At most the player is just a kleptomaniac. The game should be called “Voyeur”. The only sense of real accomplishment to be found is in not being seen – being a “Ghost”. There is no enjoyment in collecting riches because there is very little to purchase with your coin. As for loot, it's repetitive and placed is utterly illogical places. The city is in squalor, yet you can find a sterling brush just sitting on a crate next to a vagrant or a golden cup on a secluded rooftop. There are special items to be found but in the end it's all about how sneaky you are, not how much you were able to steal.Finally, a word on violence. I like both non-violent and violent games, though I prefer the latter. This game provides many opportunities for violence and the overall violent atmosphere of the game actually provokes the player to act on it, yet he player is penalized for using violence, and ultimately for even being seen. It's like putting candy on the table and telling a kid not to eat it. Summary: This game had enormous potential but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it away. You pay $50 to be teased and ultimately let down. Use your $50 to go on a date.			"

												This game is very difficult to review. If you are looking for a game that is a continuation to the original series then leave right now, but if you are looking for a fun stealth then this is a great recommendation. This is one of those games that has great gameplay but a bland story(like battlefield) except the story isn't bad. I would give more details but I believe showing the pros and cons would be easier.Pros:Beautiful GraphicsGreat GameplayGreat AIDecent Voice ActingMade by Square EnixCons:Not really a thief franchise gameBoring storyHardware DemandingGot lost a couple timesItems are too cheap compared to how much money you getRecommended Price: $9.99Final Verdict: Thief players:5/10	               Stealth players:8/10 "

												Like my jazz band director used to say:  ""A for effort, F for execution"".  The new Thief is visually beaufiul but mechanically effed up.  The minute F bombs were dropped in the game, I was supremely disappointed.  Now, I'm not a saint but nary was there ONE inkling of a curse word in the series.  Shock and awe don't work in the world of Thief and it's not a game that needs to conform to the latest trend.  The gameplay, atmosphere and story in the originals were so good that nudity, sex and violence weren't needed.  I feel like a company took one of those classics that FORCED you to rethink how you play games and mainstreamed it.  Kind of like if somebody took a great forward thinker in music and said ""Play more like (insert sellout band here)"".An addendum to the review is below since people couldn't read every other bad review that stated what I had to regurgitate.The guards?!?  Straight yanked from Dishonored.  No originality here.  *waves hand*  These really aren't the Thief you're looking for			"

												I agree, this game is not what a Thief game should be. They really could have worked on making this game more like the original Thief games with a better story, original voice actor, as well as larger and more open levels with tons of exploration.However...I see people calling this game the worst game they ever played. Really? I have played the original Thief games and this game definitely does not live up to those classics. But I still had some fun with this game. It's still a good game but it's not a good Thief game. People are overreacting calling this a piece of sh*t or a horrible game. If you take the game for what it is, it's really not that bad and has some fun to be had.I really enjoyed exploring the city as well as finding loot in small nooks and crannies. 100% ghosting missions was satisfying as well. This game also has one of the most scariest levels I have played in any game!Thief is a good game; it sucks that we were not able to see this game meet its full potential and be a true Thief sequel.

(This review contains major spoilers.)You know what I remember the most about the Thief series? Being inventive.Thief 2. The second-last mission of the game. Making my way stealthily through a sprawling manor, taking out guards and heavily-armored security robots while grabbing as many trinkets as I could. Finding myself with only two rope arrows left and a booby-trapped room where stepping on the floor would kill me instantly. Cue me jumping like Tarzan between a pair of carefully-positioned ropes dangling from the rafters, trying to nab a set of masks while worrying about the danger beneath my feet.There is no such moment that compares to that in 2014's Thief reboot. At its best, it's completely average. At its worst, it's a set of compelling ideas buried under mediocrity and subsystems you have to fight through the entire time to get some semblance of fun.I wanted so badly to love this game. The Thief series is my favorite stealth series of all time, and one I've played for many years (and even reviewed on this site). There's a reason why Thief 2 is often referred to as one of the ""holy trinity"" of late 90s video games - it's the one that defined the stealth genre, via creative and expansive level design, an extremely-memorable villain (Karras), awesome (and sarcastic) voice acting and the freedom to approach objectives as you saw fit.That's why it's so frustrating to see something that feels like the worst excesses of console-oriented development grafted onto the skeleton of the previous titles. You can tell that there was the seed of something amazing here, but it's lost in a haze of its troubled development and conflicting plots.In a better game, some of the elements introduced here could have been amazing. Nearby animals that alert enemies to your presence if you make a wrong move while picking a lock. A dynamic hub world that slowly opens up to you as you progress through the plot and get more tools (a la Deadly Shadows). Feeling like Garrett has an actual presence in the gameworld as opposed to just a floating pair of hands. The use of tools at your disposal. Finding sets of collectibles, all with their own unique models. At every turn, these advancements are marred by a gallery of bugs, glitches and underwhelming aspects.The level design in particular is shockingly bad. You can tell that this was developed for consoles first and foremost. Areas are very small compared to the previous games. Thief 2's ""Life of the Party"" had you go all the way from several blocks away from the Keep, inside and up through several floors without any loading whatsoever. This time around, you can barely turn a corner without having to lift up a board or fade to black while jimmying open a window. The use of hidden loading screens (especially ones tied to button-mashing prompts) kills any sense of exploration or enthusiasm. Not helping are strange access routes - instead of walking through a gate to go from Baron's Way North to Baron's Way South, I have to get to a second-storey window, pry it open so I can get in, then jimmy open another window and wait while a new area loads.In many ways, the enemy AI feels like a regression compared to the earlier games. They used to search for you for prolonged periods of time (sometimes for several minutes before audibly telling their comrades that they were giving up), In this game, they search for a few seconds before mindlessly going back to their original patrol routes. It feels like the exact same AI from the past. The difference is that it was 2014 when they released this, and they didn't make any advancements whatsoever.The plot itself is the worst part. You can definitely tell that it's a Frankenstein-like amalgamation between two different plots.* The entire concept of Garrett's Focus abilities are shown in the last cutscene from the prologue, where Garrett somehow gets a piece of the Primal stuck in his eye... by looking at the Primal for a moment. And even worse, another supporting character knows this, but doesn't tell him about it until the end of the game. Yet you can buy Focus upgrades from her.* Erin herself (who I'm fairly sure was originally supposed to be the young girl from the ending of Deadly Shadows) is introduced as an impulsive, brash, arrogant woman who seems to have been designed just so she can be hated. The player is then expected to be sympathetic hours after her apparent ""death"" when she randomly shows up in visions whining about how much she hates Garrett for what he did to her. There's a reference to Erin having unresolved feelings for Garrett that isn't supported in any way by the plot.* Garrett decides to leave his one true companion, Basso, who is injured and alone in the middle of a dangerous/exploding tower, so he can rob a giant safe. Even worse, this act is the entire lynchpin the story revolves around. The plot can't advance otherwise.* For some reason, the game tries to have an emotional moment over a bird. I get the sense that the creature in question was supposed to be an actual person in an earlier plot.* We learn midway through the game (in a blink-and-you-miss it sidestory) that the original Garrett went to Moira Asylum, hid caches throughout the place, got locked up, had a guy named the Architect trying to find him, and somehow escaped the prison but left behind his famous mechanical eye. Wait, WHAT?!?* The final mission is a mishmash of conflicting images, cutting from two characters standing in the middle of a closed room to one of the characters hanging onto the edge of a collapsed deck, with the wall having been blown open suddenly for no reason.I get what they originally wanted to do. Judging from what we see in the game itself and the leaked trailer with Stephen Russell voicing Garrett, you can figure out that the original plot was an ""older and wiser Garrett"" story, where he loses his protege and fights to avenge her while coming to terms with a new age. Except it's been lost in a haze of muddled character motivations (Garrett is more of a kleptomaniac mechanic than an actual thief), the two faction leaders only show up to hammer their respective goals in before disappearing for long stretches of time, and the main antagonist you face throughout the game (the Thief-Taker General) feels like a laundry list of the worst villain cliches.It's a shame, because the sidequests come close to salvaging the whole thing. Whether you're trying to steal an enchanted skull (that talks to you - seriously), robbing a fellow thief who's trying to muscle in on your territory or attempting to disrupt the black market, the side jobs and the questgivers are more animated and varied than what you find in the main storyline.It is extremely, extremely frustrating, because the game fights you the entire way. Between the horrid map system, the underwhelming hub areas (run into an empty apartment, grab a fork and knife, leave, repeat 50 times), the loading screens and the terrible enemy AI, you'll be spending half your time just trying to navigate to where you want to go. Yeah, it looks pretty, but it's just not worth it.And that's not even getting into the bugs. An emotional moment with Basso affirming his trust in Garrett was ruined by an NPC rambling about nothing in the background. A guard got caught on a street tile and began spinning at mach speed as the AI tried to freeze itself. Guards sound extremely close, even if they're on the other side of a market square.At the end of the day, Thief (2014) is an muddled experience that is brought down by its fractured development cycle, a confusing and kitbashed plot, and a wide assortment of bugs, glitches and dodgy gameplay elements that actually keep the game from being fun.TLDR: No stealth title should end up like this.

												Thief is back. After a long period of waiting and hopes we finnaly got a new Thief game but will you want to play this or stick to the classics ? In Thief you play as Garret. Garret is the master Thief. One day when you and youre friend Erin are hired to steal a stone from a secret cult everything goes wrong. Erin dissapears and Garret falls asleep for 2 years. When you wake up you find that the entire city has gone to hell and its up to you to figure out what happend when you went into the coma. So how is the new Thief ? This game is Bad and it pains me to say that. Thief has done so much to the stealth genre but this time i can only say bad things about this title. Lets begin with the gameplay. The gameplay is a way more clunky version of the stealth you see in Dishonored and you have the ability to quickly go to a place without getting spotted just like Blink. The Visuals are bland and depressing to look at. The Story is probably one of the worst i have ever seen period. The story is all over the place and never focuses on one thing and it throws in too much so its all over the place. The charecters are all boring and dull and you dont care who dies or who lives. The game also has horrific level desing and its probably the most confusing layout i have ever seen. Overall theres not much good to say about Thief. Its Boring Dull and repetative. Only get this on a sale if youre kinda interested. Otherwise just stay away. I give Thief a 4/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Thief is a stealth oriented exploration game about stealing stuff and finding and completing collectible sets. Thats about it. While stealth isn't necessarily required (it's possible to shoot every target you see with your bow) it is encouraged by the means of challenges. I understand the critique that has been thrown at Thief and although i do agree with most of it, i still had a fun time with it. I should also state that i'm a new player to the Thief franchise and have never played the older classic games.PROS:- Visually the game is very impressive with some of the best shadows i have ever seen.- The performance was solid all the way through, with my fps going up to 150 (Averaging at about 110-120) and never dipping below 60. (I'm running an i5 @ 3.4 GHz CPU with a 1070 GPU)- Gameplay is fun and engaging with a huge arsenal of arrows to manipulate your environment.- Voice Acting was great on most characters and sidecharacters (especially Garrett)- Puzzle design was unique and just difficult enough to keep me invested.- Overall the sound design was fitting and thematic. - The difficulty customization is a fantastic addition and allows you to completely design your own playthough. Think the game is too easy and you can easily pass a level by simply knocking out all the guards? Remove knockouts with an add-on. How about a modifier that instantly fails you when you get detected?CONS:- The story and characters are ""meh"" and makes it really hard to get involved in the world.- While challenging at some parts overall the game is easy. Levels can be passed by staying in the shadows and just shooting guards in the the head with your bow and arrows or by just sneaking in behind them and knocking them out with your blackjack (most of these problems can be fixed with the difficulty customization options though)- Level design, while not awful, is not as expansive and varied as i would have liked (there is basically 2-3 ways to complete every level)- The main storyline takes you about 8-10 hours to complete (while it is possible to bump your overall playtime up to around 30 hours by collecting EVERYTHING and doing every side objective.- Enemy variety is limited (there's only 3. Yes it's a stealth game but still)CONCLUSION:Thief is a game best experienced at its worst difficulty with all the modifiers cranked up to 11. While the story does have its moments where it pulls you in, you are mostly going to be wandering around a level searching for your next loot to steal. With its problems there is still fun to be had in the world of Thief and i would recommend it to any stealth lover out there. I would have given the game a higher rating had the story been more involved or the game been a bit more difficult but as it stands it's a solid 7.5/10Thank you for taking the time to read my review <3 Please rate fairly "

												I'm an old hat Taffer. I've been with the series since it started, and I'm not ashamed to admit up front that my review is biased. I have played Thief TDP and Thief TMA to pieces and back and then some. I also enjoyed Thief 3 and while in the end I must admit it was a fairly respectable game in its own regard and I also enjoyed it for what it was. In the origional games you had free reign of the city, go where you please when you please, even if it was something utterly asinine like becoming a member of the rootop climbers guild (some of you may know what I mean, others may not) or seeing if you could jump out of the map or just screwing around looking in every nook and cranny just because you could. This new reboot of Thief, or Thief 4 rather (though I shudder to think of it as part of the series I love) is nothing more to me than a regular run of the mill game that is nothing special or even that good, and a cash grab. There is no jumping in Thief so far. Yes, you read that correctly. You are GLUED TO THE GROUND. A real throw back to when I played FFXI and FFXIV online. At one point there are a pair of floor traps early in the game that any reasonable human being with half a brain could jump over, and for our acrobatically gifted Garrett should be no problem to jump. As you can't jump, you have to take a predesignated route around the traps instead of just jumping over them. Do you want to go up a wall? You need to hold spacebar and can only climb in designated spots. Do you want to go up or down a ladder? If so, you need to hold spacebar until you have a mini cutscene happen (and it IS a mini cut scene, as your character takes control of himself to turn around and face the ladder then takes a few steps onto the first rungs when going down, or takes the first few steps  by himself to latch on before you can go up) and you actually get on the ladder. There is no more auto latching on ladders (a crime in itself) and it becomes a nuisance and frustrating to have to hold a button to get onto a ladder, and then become glued to said ladder until you either reach the top or bottom. Did you enjoy rope arrows and their magical ability to catch on ANY wooden surface in the past? Guess what kids, designated spots only!Speaking of mini cutscenes, lets talk about mini games that serve no purpose. If I want to open a window, I hit ""e"". But wait! We need a mini cutscene where you pull out a crowbar and have to tap ""e"" a few times to open the window. Or move a beam from inside the gap out of the way. Another tap ""e"" moment to make me waste time. The character is completely automated in his movements in both going through the window and gap sliding, so why are you making me tap ""e"" at all. Either let me open the damn window in one smooth fluid motion without having to play a tap ""e"" minigame, or skip the stupid cutscene and just let me interact to open the window and mantle through as I please. Same with being forced to move objects out of the way.I can't speak for the story yet. When I (sadly) finish the game - and I know I will I will likely update my review. So far though all I can safely say is they've used a few throwback names older fans recognize to try and appeal to them. To be fair as well, they added back in things we asked for like rope arrows. They added in options to turn all of the new flashy hand holding garbage off. They added options to make the game as difficult as some of us are used to. It's not enough. The game is just flat out bad to me because it feels so much more restrictive than previous games. It does have a very Thief 3-esque feel to it, but it just hasn't jived with me at all even several hours into the game. On another note, I was more than ticked off at not being able to collect a collectable in a side mission as apparently the game adds a few required tools - in this case a razor and possibly others- to loot specific items -in this case a painting. Unfortunately for me the side quest to do this mission becomes available BEFORE you can even purchase the razor, so if you want to get that collectable then tough luck, you can't go back to that area again later in the game (so far at least) to get it, it seems to be lost to the ages. Not very wise game design there in my opinion. I hope I'm wrong and at some point you can go back because this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to no end, and I don't normally fluster easily.By the way, I was on the fence the entire time about buying this game, especially after seeing it at E3. I decided to try and give it the benefit of the doubt and buy the Master edition of the game. Imagine my complete and utter shock and surprise today to see that there is already DLC for the game, and not only that if you paid the extra money for the game, you don't get all the DLC, just one called ""The Opportunist"". Really? Seriously, REALLY? The extra mission comes no matter what version you buy, and I couldn't give a damn about digital art or soundtracks or TF2/DOTA items. I paid the extra to have the DLC, and then you put out more that isn't even included.TLDR: If you only liked the first two games of the series and hated Thief 3 its a definite don't buy. If you enjoyed Thief 3 then you may also enjoy this, though it is far more constrictive than past games (not such much Thief 3 which was also fairly linear in it's own way, but definitely 1 & 2 where you could pull off some fun and amazing things by going where you shouldn't and/or getting out of the map.) on where you can and can't go (notably because every rope arrow and jump is in a predesignated spot). Removing something as small as the ability to jump when and where ever you want really killed this for me, it takes away a freedom you don't know you've lost until its gone.I really, really wanted to love this game but I just can't. :(			"

												I loved, and still love, the original Thief series. That said, I'm not beholden to the original series so much that I'm closed to new interpretations, as long as they're done well. Sadly, in this particular case, the mark has been missed by an incredible amount. The game is beautiful, and the aesthetic is very well-realized. Beyond that, it's a travesty. The story is a mess: either they cut out a sizable portion of it or they changed the story at the last minute and struggled to make the existing pieces fit the new narrative. Either way, it's a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas and huge leaps of narrative logic. The sound design is all over the place, with characters being far too quiet in cutscenes, over-repeated incidental dialogue from NPCs, and sound positioning seems to be wrong most of the time. I wanted to love the game, as while there are quite a number of stealth action games, very few really focus on the experience of being a master thief: sneaking around and stealing things. Most focus on assassination or some other kind of objectives. While it doesn't meet the criteria of playing a thief, I still would highly recommend you play Dishonoured instead of this if you're looking for a great Thief-like, even if it primarily concerns itself with being a sneaky killer more than a sneaky stealer.

												Thief is one of those games for you stealth purists out there. If you enjoyed Dishonored, DO NOT think this is the same game. Yes, they were both first person stealth games, BUT Dishonored lets you choose whether to be chaotic or not. In Thief, the game is centered on being a shadow. You don't want to be seen or confronted in Thief. On normal difficulty, you have to be skilled at the barebones combat system to survive a fight with two guards. The game doesn't WANT you to kill or knock anyone out. The way the game is meant to be played is to stick to the shadows and leave without a trace left that you were there. The game even has a CUSTOM DIFFICULTY that lets you change several settings. Over all, this game is amazing IF you enjoy stealth.*To the people saying that you CAN play Thief chaotically, I know that, I was trying to get the point across that it is generally not advised and is not the original way the game was meant to be played. Also, many of the comments here comparing Dishonored to Thief are extremely biased towards one game or the other, I love and appreciate both games, and I think they are both amazing in their own ways.

												Feels like Dishonored with less features, which is kinda funny if you think about it since Dishonored felt like the old Thief games if you were playing as the Predator.Either way this game isn't very good. The levels are small and linear. All of Garrett's dialogue sounds like he's trying to be Batman. Between levels you have to navigate an aggressively boring hub with the option to do sidequests that usually amount to running across the city to loot an empty house. Your dead ghost sidekick sounds like a female Donte. The biggest similarity to the old games is that it looks really ugly.If you like the old games, don't get it because it will only dissapoint. If you don't care for them, don't get it anyways because it's pretty bad on its own merits.EDIT: Thief also restarted tuznecotes steam for no reason.			"

												So close to good, I really tried to like it and I'm a long time fan of the franchise .  Oh and just some friendly advice.  DO NOT play this game right after a play through of Dishonored.  Because you'll end up writing a review like this  :)  To start, I can't get past the between mission level design.  Having to re run, sneak, climb the same sections of the map, over and over.  To get from your ""base"" back to the next mission.. every single time you complete a mission. (Imagine if Fallout or Witcher never heard of fast travel.)  I think they left it out because if you weren't  forced to re run the same parts of the map.  The game wouldn't have even been 15 hours of play time.  Speaking of which, I beat it in 20 hours and I was not trying to go fast.         I get that by not having fast travel it ""encourages"" you find new paths and new loot.  But it takes me a minuet to open a window, steal $5 worth of crap, then turn around and spend another min reopening that window. I guess the $$ adds up over time but you get $150-$400 per mission so why bother?         Which bring me to my next grip, the pointlessness of the side quests.. There is no point, unless its on the way to the next main mission.. You don't get a lot of coin. Some offer incentives to kill guards (Which makes no sense since Garrett starts off the game saying ""don't kill anyone unless you have to"").. And after completion, you get to re run back through the same pointless areas to get to your next mission.        For a Thief game there sure isn't much emphasis on money or needing much of it.  Mainly you just need ""$248 space bucks for lunch, gas and tolls""... sorry wrong movie :)   Actually you need $250, that will buy you a sharpen bread knife that you'll need to cut certain painting off the wall.  Why don't you already have a sharpen bread knife being a thief you might ask?  Good question, but you do get a club.. that can't break anything.  Which kind of sums up my grip with the game.  You just need to steal enough money to buy the 2-3 tools you need to complete the game.  After that you really don't need to anymore, unless you're really want to kill everyone or put out every tourch.       Ok now for the good, the bones of the game and game play are pretty good.  The sneaking works well and the AI is either so bad its good or polished but their parents might be cousins.  I really like the main quests a lot and was sucked in at times.  But I wish there was a little more story going into it and a little more plot to carry through. They did a good job creating a fast paced, driven story that keeps it going forward.       Going in I knew Thief games have always been ""Here.... game, story, fire, water, shadows, arrows...Figure it out"".  In the end I really wish they'd have put out more DLC's to add to the world, fill in the blanks, add new depth.  I feel this game could have really have been much more.         But as it stands, if its $10 and you want to sneak around... and are tired of Dishonored, I guess maybe go for it.  But having just completed it, I'm rather frustrated and a little disappointed at the number of little annoyances that added up to killing the fun of playing this game.			"

												First, let me start off by saying that I am typing this entire review with my middle fingers.  Second, I don't normally write reviews, so I'll try to keep this short (forgive any rants that may happen).  Like an idiot, I purchased this game after reading several positive and negative reviews here on Steam, thinking about all the negative reviews as: ""Eh, I think I can look past all or most of that"".  I have never played any of this game's predecessors, so with that in mind, I have nothing to compare it to in the way of the older versions.  Combat/SteathThe combat in this game is very easy to under stand, this button + this button makes you dodge in this direction, etc.  A very simplistic version of Assassin's Creed combat, more similar, to me, to Dishonored (a GREAT favorite of mine).  It is fun knocking people around with your medieval nightstick.  I was satisfied with all of the tools and gadgets at my disposal, with an exception of the flash bomb.  I felt it to be utterly useless.  Whenever I used it in a pinch, the guards always followed me to my hiding spot, so I never saw the point in using it.  I was GREATLY disappointed with the stealth in this game, as sneaking around plundering/killing are a few of my favorite things.  The stealth bit was accurate; guard perifs, sudden movements, etc.  My qualms are the lack of stealth routes one could take to reach his/her destination.  For this game seemingly to be ""open-world"", I felt it to be very confined and restricting, and because of that, I felt this game did not want the player getting too creative in tactical kills, above takedowns, the overall shoot-this-guy-with-an-arrow-to-the-face-then-run-up-a-building-to-hide-on-the-rooftops bit.Storyline/CharactersAgain, because I never played any previous games of this series, I can't compare it as being worse or better than its predecessors.  Seeing as how I don't feel there is really any originality left to be had in this wolrd in ways of video game/film/tv miniseries storylines, I felt this one to be a bit predictable, but still entertaining.  There's nothing more alluring than playing a video game where you get to be the Jackie Chan of all Robin Hoods, thieving from the rich to... hoard the loot all for yourself?  Sounds realistic, but hang on, ""Jackie Chan of all Robin Hoods""?  NO.  Garrett is more like a really cool ninja with a spastic case of down-syndrome that often results in self-termination.  ""What do you mean?"" you say?  Well, I find it VERY difficult to understand how a man in such superb physical condition, who can scale walls, climb pipes, use a prehistoric Batclaw to reach new heights and to rappel - who can do all of that - but who dies instantly if the nipple-head falls more than 15 feet.  Tuck and roll, Garrett.  I am also amazed at how many times Garrett would leap to his death, even though there was a a rope (that he himself attached to a wooden beam) an arm's length away.  Outstanding.  Next time, do us all a favor and tie a loop at the end of that rope.  As for Erin (your sidekick?), I felt her character to be that typical annoying female who is betrayed by her fellow man (a thief by the way, since when did thieves have principles?) and can't seem to let go of things, and wants the world to be as miserable as she is.  I would've liked to push her♥♥♥♥♥off the first building I met her on.  She's young, not as masterful as Garrett, but naturally has that young person ""invincible"" mentality, which causes the whole first mention to go♥♥♥♥♥♥up.  Good job, Gaylord.  Basso, your fat friend who has all the hook-ups for dirty deeds that need doing, is your typical on-the-sidelines sidekick.  He didn't seem to have much character development, which doesn't matter in the big picture.  He's friends with Garrett, 'nuff said.  I didn't care enough about the other characters to write my thoughts on them, so moving on...Other Game AspectsAs with a good portion of the negative reviews, I too was very annoyed with the lack of a ""cancel"" button when climbing through windows.  I don't know how many times I went through a window thinking it was a different window leading to a different part of the map, only to realize immediately after holding the ""open window"" button.  I did like that you could pretty much save your game whenever you wanted, except when the baddies were on high-alert.  I always hated games with check-point saves.  The spookiness of the asylum level was brilliant; I jumped in my seat a couple times.  I'm not fond of the overall cloudiness or fogginess that seems to linger around that entire game.  Turning up the brightness doesn't help much, and makes the rest of the gameplay feel bright in all the bad ways.  I was also not thrilled by the torches in the game, not the ones sort of shielded by the metal grates, but the wooden torches that are fully exposed.  I can't understand why Garrett couldn't grab those ones from the wall and stamp them out, or even douse them in a puddle of water (there were plenty of puddles to choose from).Overall this game left me very angry, and with an empty hole in my wallet.  I did get it on sale, thankfully, but would NOT recommend anyone else get this game.  The cons definitely outweighed the pros for this game.  I made myself complete it because I was curious if it would get better.  But it didn't.  It sucked, right through the final chapter.			"

												Thief (or Thiaf as they originally named it) is a shining example of why it's important that you test your game before you release it. When looking at a new game in a series, it's hard to not compare it to the previous entries, and while it feels like Thief wants to distance itself from the previous games, it does not distance itself enough for such a comparison to not be made. The main issue though is that Thief seem to have scaled back most of the things that made the first 3 entries in the series special. Levels are split up into smaller sections, thus the more free roaming exploration that made the series popular is gone. The AI seem to have taken a few blows to the head from previous games as well, as guards seem to have gone from being intentionally a bit daft (but often making comments to reinforce this and make it ""fit"") to being dumb as a rock. It's shocking that a game released 10 years earlier had far better and more believable AI.Garret, the main character, also seem to have lost most of his charm. He went from a sarcastic and intelligent anti-hero with a dry sense of humor to a generic anti-hero with no sense of humor.  He is quite simply boring. The same holds true for the rest of the game as well, it has lost a lot of its identity. Now guards will just swear a lot because that's what guards do (?), instead of having their inane discussions with each other, and the language used in Thief is just generic ""action movie English"", rather than having some twists of their own, which helped give the previous games some more identity.One thing that the previous Thief games were known for was their excellent audio design. Sound was an important part of the gameplay by design, and in this field there are still not many games that are nearly as good as the first 3 Thief titles. This Thief title is among those games that don't even come close. There seem to be issues with the sound volume for some dialogue (some of it is far too quiet, but not all), and they've made it harder to hear where guards are coming from, simply by making the sound design worse.The one good thing I can say about Thief is that it is a really nice looking game. A lot of care seem to have been put into making the environments good looking, and it's backed up with some impressive tech. But far worse than the limited level design, brain dead AI and boring main character are the bugs & level geometry problems. In my 2,1h playtime I got stuck no less than 8 times. I got stuck in windows when trying to climb through them, got stuck in door frames, stuck in barrels and just generally stuck in the level geometry. It's like they did not even test the game before they shipped it. Even if the other issues had not been there, I would still not have been able to recommend this game due to the massive issues I had with getting stuck in things. So just do yourself a favour and don't buy this game. If you're looking for some more free-roaming stealth gameplay, then get the previous Thief games, if you're looking for more linear stealth gameplay then get Splinter Cell. Or just get Deus Ex: Human Revolution for a good middle ground.  Just don't get this game. "

 Edios drops the ball	 They kicked out original voice actor, for - wait  for it - Not being athletic enough.... if you don't know the original Thief then you don't know how much we loved his voice acting.Positives: Great cinematics. Immersive atmosphere with interesting locations. Intuitive controls and gameplay. Very polished graphics, all areas look excellent.Negatives:   Not a good idea to have a villain find you at scripted segments often, when you are the best thief around.    Not fun to be pulled out of stealth to have a full-on Boss Battle!   They dumped the original voice actor for someone more athletic, and their reason was they thought we only wanted him for nostalgia???!   One of the greatest voice actors in gaming history and the developers think the only reason to keep him is for nostalgia...Talk about dropping the ball come on, they took a major dump on it then threw it over their shoulderPlayed a lot of hours, would have finished if they actually cared about the player base that made it popular.

												Gutted of everything that made the originals lovable for the sake of being edgy.No ""taffer"".No Pagans.No Hammerites.No color.No humor.No arrow crystals because whoever made the game thought ""Hurrrr Thief should be realistic"".No zombies or other undead. Now there's just ""freaks"" which are basically Smeagol from LotR.Story is completely unengaging and I had no idea what was going until the end. I still have no idea what the Primal is or what it's supposed to do. In the last two missions I just stopped caring about loot hunting to get the game over with.			"

												A very, very disappointing implementation, clearly dumbed-down for the casual gamer/console kiddie crowd. The open-world navigation and exploration that made the original so charming are nearly absent: you cannot jump, unless its scripted, you cannot fall, unless its scripted, you cannot do ANYTHING, unless it's scripted. Avoiding guards with a slight diversion so you can shimmy up those crates? Not gonna happen... unless its scripted, and then they hang a lantern on it, telling you exactly what to do, holding your hand like you are a 10yo playing an old XBox game.It's close to playing on rails. Quite frankly, you could watch the videos on youtube, randomly rewind and fast forward, and you'd have about as much control over your character. And so much for the fluid actions of a master thief: see an item? Hold on to your lunch, click E and the screen lunges for it. I actually had to stop playing due to motion sickness. It's inconcievable that someone could actually make a stealthie WORSE than the first Assassin's Creed, which was plagued with horrid controls and animations tailored to look good on tv commercials and make unskilled fanboys feel like they were doing something amazing without actually showing a whit of skill, but Square Enix (yes, the Final Fantasy guys) has succeeded. Next time I'm in Japan, I'm burning the place down. Bring a pitchfork and join me!The achievment system is also buggy as hell: I played through the entire first chapter on ghost, environmental (put out lights), and did only 1 of the headshot achieve (just to see if insta kills count asa being detected - they dont). What did I get the achievement for? The one of four headshot kills I got. No achieve for ghosting the entire level, even though i didnt fail; no achieve for putting out all those lights without being detected... I got an achievement for FAILING. If that's not a No Chiuld Left Behind game, I don't know what is.I'll play, simply in hopes that it gets better; and I'll pray, that the next version SE actually listens to its fanbase and gives us a real open world, free movement environment. In the meantime, save your money.			"

												The old Thief games were the story of a thief just trying to survive in a dog-eat-dog world. Garret, in those games, was snarky and arrogant, yet realistic in his expectations and aspirations, and surrounded by characters that made sense.Thief 2014, on the other hand, loses all of the above, choosing instead to uplift Garret into something much more, connected to a seemingly dead spirit of a woman and adding all sorts of mumbo-jumbo that has no place in the old games. The story, therefore, feels fragmented, annoying and unnecessary.But heck, what if we don't care for the story, but just want some good stealthy gameplay, sneaking around and so on?Sad to say, but that's not here either. In order for a game to have a workable stealth -system, it needs to have reliable and credible enemies to sneak around and avoid. It was within my first 30 minutes with Thief 2014 that I saw a guard get stuck on a slight incline, his feet shuffling and jerking endlessly while his torso and head would not move. He was standing in the only passage through the early area, so my options were to either knock him out (which is discouraged by the theme of the game) or reload a save. Similiar AI glitches happened on numerous occasions during my 6 or 7 hours with the game, after which I got sick and quit.Audio, too, fails to impress in any way. Voice actors are sub-par (oh, and several times faces will not animate while characters speak, for some reason) and the music has, so far, been forgettable.As a final note: this game required me to do quite a bit of work before I could play. I suffered from a glitch in which the game would change the texture quality on the fly, between high and low, every 5 seconds or so. This required me to exit the game and start the separate configuration utility and disable automatic texture quality (this setting is not available in-game). Additionally the game has HORRIBLE mouse acceleration issues, with the camera lurching around beyond control, always feeling a bit slow and lazy. This issue required me to do some googling and disable the mouse acceleration in a config -file in the game's installation folder. Again, no in-game setting allowed me to adjust or change this in any way.All said, I doubt I'll ever finish Thief 2014, and I don't recommend it to anyone. For a VERY similiar game with much more enjoyable gameplay, try Dishonored instead.Playtime: 6+ hours (estimated 20% campaign completion)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 8Audio: 7Story: 6Gameplay: 7Overall: 7			"

												Endlich wieder ein Spiel mit meinem Lieblings-Antihelden.Vorab möchte Ich sagen,das es eine menge Kritik für diesen Teil der Serie gibt.Zum Beispiel ärgern sich viele,das es keine Fortsetzung von Deadly Shadow ist.Das Spiel ist zu linear,die Mechanik zu simpel,keine Verbindung zu den anderen Teilender Serie u.s.w.Das stimmt durchaus,aber Ich denke,das jeder für sich entscheiden soll ob das gut oder schlecht ist.Neulinge der Serie finden sich auf jedem Fall gut zurecht und für alte Hasengibt es viele Bezugspunkte auf die letzten Teile.Mir persönlich gefällt Thief sehr gut.Es gibt wie immer viel zu klauen,vom einfachenSilberbesteck bis zum wertvollen Sammlerstück ist alles dabei.Manches liegt nur in der Gegend herum, aber vieles ist echt gut versteckt.Auch die Story von einer kranken Gesellschaft,wo vieles nur Fassade ist finde Ich gelungen.Mit einem Hauch Sozialkritik und vielen tragischen aber auch komischen Momentenist sie fast ein Spiegel unserer Zeit.Dazu kommt eine passende düstere Grafik und viel spielerische Freiheit.Ich jedenfalls hatte viele gute Stunden mit Thief.

												This game is an abomination to the thief series.As a game, it is ""ok"", nothing special.Graphics are quite nice, to the point of being overdone considering everything is shrouded in shadow.You can play the game ugly, or you can get a really good graphics card, and play the game beautiful and choppy.How well does choppy play in a stealth game?Well, this isn't really a stealth game. it just pretends to be one.As an installment on the thief series, it disrespects the traditions set forth in the original thief games.The valuation of objects is askew compared to past games.There are landmarks Garett destroyed in previous games that are suddenly ""back"".Pretty much, play it as non-canon thief and you'll be Ok.Also, Garett as a 45+ year old guy hitting on a 16ish year old bratty girl  is creepy.

												Like stealth? Like a basic, noncomplex storyline? Like being able to have an open, uninterrupted world for each mission you play? Enjoy having a choice between being sneaky or brutal? Nonlethal, or lethal?Buy Dishonored! That's right, Dishonored! Not this game, which has failed aspirations to be Dishonored. Compare the games, and you'll find this falls extremely short of the game it tried to take the fame from.The story will leave you confused, the missions will find you unable to actually decipher where you're going, and the clunky mechanics will cause you to make countless errors that end up being fatal.The best this game has to offer is a good title in the Stealth games series. Even then, it's beaten by Dishonored (again), or Deux Ex, for example. There's better games out there.Still want to buy it? Wait for a sale, otherwise, you're buying this game for its snazzy graphics and recent publish date, not its quality.			"

												Thief 2014 is the epitome of everything wrong with the games industry in 2014.  Take ""Tomb Raider 2013"" + ""Assassins Creed"", keep the worst parts, and you would basically have Thief 2014.  There are 2 basic problems with Thief 2014. Its *design, and * implementation.Modern level designers have this narcissistic fixation for _excessive_ narrative instead of actually focusing on WHY we play these types of first-person-sneaker games in the first place:  ""To give us interesting exploration options.""But, you want to, p .. pl ... play the game?  Blasphemy!  Heretic!  Why won't you shut up, sit down, and watch our stupid cut-scenes every 5 mins!?!The problem with ""fast-food gaming"", aka, no-thinking button mashers, is summarized with this beautiful picture of level design in 1993 vs 2010: http://furiousfanboys.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/BITmX.jpgOther games continue to advance the art of gameplay.  ""Dishonored"" is much better thief then Thief 2014 ever will be.  The ability to jump and teleport lets players focus on -the- thing that makes (or breaks) a theif game -- exploration.Garret has this fixation on closing every little window behind him.  It makes the game feel claustrophobic instead of an open world to explore.Having the mini-games to open a window or pick a lock is fun the first few times.  It gets old having to do it _every_ single time.Having to press an action key to jump at the ""right"" time without the game giving you feedback _when_ you should feels like it is treating you like a little kid.  I'm sorry, only ""adults"" know how to properly jump -- we don't want to ""confuse"" you.When cut-scenes switch to a pre-rendered video it breaks the immersion.Only 3 save slots?  Another typical re-tarded console port.  What is this? Tomb Raider 2013 all over again??Not tired of reboots, remakes, re-imagined games? You will after playing Theif 2014.  Theif 2 set the ""gold"" standard.  Dishonored is the spiritual successor now.= Summary =+ Can skip cut-scenes+ Arc for throwing is awesome+ Interesting story+ Looks pretty- Gameplay is linear- Can't explore any of the cool surroundings- UI controls are horrible -- having the same key for looking through a keyhole and lockpick is frustrating when you are trying to do one instead of the other.  Having to ""use"" a ladder, or ""use to jump"" is @$$-backwards UI.  It would be tolerable if the game would at least highlight _which_ surfaces you can jump/climb on.Bottom line: Don't waste your money.Edit.1 Fixed misc. spelling mistakes.			"

												All in all, Thief is decent, but far from great. I would not necessarily recommend that someone who isn’t already a Thief fan buy this game at full price, rather saving it in their wishlist until it goes on sale. Anyone with an immediate desire to play a story-driven stealth role playing game should pick up the (by now) cheaper Dishonored, which told a better story in more ways than one. Or, if you are inclined to take your punk “cyber-” rather than “steam-”, Eidos’ own other classic PC reboot, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a better stealth role playing game, as well.Here are some things to ask yourself as you consider whether or not to swoop out of the shadows and snag a copy of Thief:Do you like fancy graphics? Thief definitely has these. The world is richly modeled and textured, and the lights and shadows of The City make for a deep, if claustrophobic visual experience.Are you sick of “grimdark” reboots and grey-brown game worlds? If so, stay away from Thief until you’re prepared for its grimy, lifeless, violent world, and un-ironically moody, flat characters.Do you love stealth games? Thief is a mixed bag where its stealth gameplay is concerned. On one hand, the “pick your path” element is deeply flawed due to the relationship between level design and the game’s oddly restrictive movement system, which results in obvious paths that are very linear. On the other hand, the AI is better than in most stealth games, and if you find that the game lacks challenge, there are extensive built-in difficulty mods which will also earn you higher standing on a global leaderboard (if you’re into that kind of thing).Are you looking for a great story? You will absolutely not find that here. The pacing is off, the cutscenes are of poor quality, the characters are unlikable, and all in all it doesn’t really feel like the protagonist has that much to do with what’s going on in the world.If you like this review, please check out the full-length article at : http://www.protagonistcomplex.com/thief-review/OR Join the PCPLX Steam Group!

												I'm currently playing on master difficulty with focus and like features disabled, the only one I left enabled was the auto-save (I'm not that much of a masichist). I've seen other people complain about length and based on what I've played so far I feel that they tromped through the main story only and on easy difficulty at that. Also I believe The City was segmented on purpose as a homage to the previous Thief games, TDS specifically. I can understand if some people don't like it or would consider the term ""open world"" somewhat misleadingThe game is not perfect: The voice acting sometimes will leave much to be desired (Garret), the controls are solid albeit a little strange e.g. sometimes to drop you press x and other times rmbwith the fail on guard notice switch on some loot is nigh impossible to get to,Some textures are abnormally low res (Beggar Queens fox coat for example)Characters can be forgettableCan't comment too much on the story at the moment, I will amend this review once I'm finished What the game gets right:The dark and sullen Thief world(master difficulty) Slow and methodical stealth that forces you to find alternate pathsMakes you greedy and OCD for lootOn average the game looks pretty good (its no crysis thats for sure)Won't complain too much about the AI, at the very least it has proven to be consistent and punishing on Master, Guards will notice if you leave a door open or a safe/case for a valuable itemalthough its not without its bugs e.g. saw a guard constantly spinning in one spotIf you are a stealth fan I recommend picking this upIf you are apprehensive then go ahead and wait for a saleI believe this game needs to be judged on a per gamer basis, very hard for people to know if they will like it or not but it does recieve my recommendation at this pointCurrent Rating I'd give it ~~~~~ 8.1 (lowered slightly after running into some control issues) ~~~~~ I feel like that is a fair rating, to put this rating into perspective I'd give the original Thief gamesaround 8.8.I will update this once I am finished with the main story...p.s. the game isn't optimized very well so hopefully you'll be playing on at least a midrange system			"

												Horrible disgrace to the once amazing series called thief. First and formost, this game is a reboot of the series much like tomb raider. While both games were bought out by square enix and developed by the same team, the similarities end there. While tomb raider was a fantastic reboot honoring the legacy of tomb raider, thief decided to do a compete 180. The mechanics felt sloppy and seemed that the game couldnt decided what it wanted to be. For instance throughout parts of the game there were the somewhat interesting climbing games from tomb raider which had some potential. However unlike tomb raider they were too short and too rare and really felt like filler. I almost felt like this game was a beta test for the much better tomb raider remake. Furthermore, Instead of relying on the old proven thief mechanics, some genius decided to try and rip off dishonored (rather poorly) and this can be clearly scene with the focus mechanics. While dishonored had relatively good ai and an excellent array of powers including the all too fun blink, thiefs focus abilities were rather linear with the stealth ability being broken. Being that the abilities were so boring or broken, there was little interest to upgrade. Dishonored on the other hand rewarded explorering with new runes ect .Even safe cracking though a good concept got really old really quick as almost every sub heist mission was in the exact same cookie -cutter home/building and had the same old feel over and over again. Not that I needed the money as there really wasnt anything I needed to buy outside of the those damn shears which you could only buy around chapter 3 but were required in many sub missions to steal special art such as paintings.Lets not even start on the AI. so stupid it's laughable. The worst gitch that I exploited was looking through the key hole right before an AI would open the door and instead of opening it, they kept on walking into the door indefinitely. I am not going to even get into the stupid idiots that tried to chase me while I was on a roof and they kept going in circles around the building even when I went back down,Though by far the greatest travesty would have to be the story and the fail attempts at hijacking thiefs past legacy. without spoiling too much (what little there is to spoil) the story itself cant decide what it wants to be with various moments of garret lapsing to subconcious wtf moments that just make you want to uninstall this boring game and the ending being a overblown b rated mess at best as the dialogue was so bad. This game had two warring factions being the rioters and police much like the hammerites and pagans from thief 3. In thief 3, siding with a faction long enough they would offer you sanctuary and even fight on your behalf.  sounds cool at right? makes you want to join a side and determine the fate of the city right? WRONG. the game doesnt allow you to make decisions like the past games did and even worse you never see or feel any of the violent conflicts between the factions. While in  in thief 3 you would see back alley fights between factions, this new thief shows you some lame♥♥♥♥♥in game cutscene with a baddy and all the cops are replaced with rioters as enemies. why the rioters hate garret you are never told. COME ON! this is 2014 and you cant even have live action back alley fight or an explanation on why the rioters want to randomly kill you?Oh and the game also tries to rip off the cradle from thief 3 in a very fail manner that makes me lose even more respect for this game. the monsters known as freaks seem scary at first but soon become laughable as any potential they may of had as something scary soon falls apart.- final score 4/10 game is such a distorted mess that it wouldnt even be fun to play even at 10 dollars. only good things are the graphics and the bank heist mission.

												I was warned, they told me this was not like the old thief games. They told me Garret was now some emo goth eyeliner applying edgy young man, rather than a middle aged cynic with a robo eye and a BADASS voice and always a quip or two up his stealthy sleeves. But then came a steam sale, and I said to myself ""eh why not eh?"" because im super canadian, and it turns out they were right, all of them. The Garret in this game  just stands pale in comparison to the old one, his dialogue sounds like some 20 year old freshman in college saying edgy stuff and trying to be phisopicles like some old♥♥♥♥♥french or greek dude.  His voice is so generic, my neighbor Mohammed  (he's from Jordan give him a break he has awesome barbeques  WITH pork dishes hes cool dont judge) sounds like this Garret, I could have spared eidos/enix whoever these ♥♥♥♥s are a LOAD OF MONEY by just giving them Mo's number, mo is really chill he'd probably do it for free.And the stupid girl in the beginning of the game was just such a tool, her whole purpose was just to tell the player they had choices how to achieve objectives. protip for unisoft: you can have floating text tell the player what to do, and if they disregard the advice and they get found and killed by Benny and his fellow guards, you can say: OH LAWD  YOU ♥♥♥♥IN SCRUB YOU SHOULDA SNEAKED ACROSS THAT METAL PLATE INSTEAD OF RAN AROUND LIKE MASTER CHEF. I rate this game 0/2,000,000,000. They just channeled all their angst  and edge into this game that it paradoxically lost all the intended edge and dark acsetic about it, eh.			"

												Initial thoughs, 1 hour into the game.......Having played to DEATH the original Thief releases my first thoughts are:1. What happened to Garrett's voiceand 2. Who saw the need for the cliched, leather clad girl with heavy mascara and all that ""sass""? Remember that episode of the Simpsons where the producers of Itchy & Scratchey decide to introduce ""Poochie"" the skate-board riding dog? This girl is the Poochie of the Thief franchise.So far, I hate this game to the same degree that I LOVED the originals. I'll play some more and see if I can't bump the girl off ......... or at least have her stop acting like a would be porn harlet / Cat Woman hybrid.UPDATE - So the goth chick died during a cut scene or disappeared form the game without any real explanation - so that's something.Why does Garrett now dress in Edward Scissor Hand's old hand-me-downs?UPDATE - Who keeps locking all of the windows behind me? Break into a house. Break out of a house. Seriously. Who is following me around locking all of the damned windows????And why can't I navigate my way around the city with more ease? I could give a good ♥♥♥♥ about trying to solve a puzzle involving moving about the roofs looking for my next objective. This is just like punishment!UPDATE - I've become tired of attempting to navigate my way around the Stone Market area and can think of a thousand things I'd rather be doing - like volunteering for chemotherapy. What were the designers thinking when they decided that making your way from one mission to another should involve a stupid, convoluted rooftop maze whose aim is to invoke ever increasing levels of frustration? Seriously - I just want to play the missions.This is far too much like hard labour. FINAL UPDATE - Things I think while playing Thief - Why am I stuck in this pile of timber unable to find an exit? Why can I not jump? Why have a rope arrow that can only be shot into certain, pre-determined pieces of timber and is essentially useless?I hate this game................. I really hate this game.

												The game has a very consoly feeling in to it with many features and mechanics, and the game seems to hate to give player freedom to use his common sense and logic in the game world. While it may have some exploration aspects, it makes you damn sure to know that it is definitely by design and not by your own wit. Also there is no clear vision for the game, you are a thief but you like more of gathering information and stealing is a secondary motivation. There are action set pieces that don’t fit at all and actually contradict the rest of the game mechanics. Story has no motivation unless you just happen to be curious. The thing is that curiosity gets thieves killed or in a huge mess at least. Only for hardcore fans who absolutely has to see what Garrett is now about.			"

												Loved the first Thief series, this reboot doesn't come close to the original. Controls seem limited, movement is herky-jerky. Navigating between maps/areas is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There is no over-arching map system that allows you to see the numerous sections and how to travel between them - you can only find out where to go by entering an area map and locating the exit point while you are tracking an individual quest. That's a major over-sight. Would have been a much better game if they followed the Assasin's Creed way with flexibility in the types of movements allowed. Maps are so restrictive you can only get to a certain area(high spots) on a map if you can find the right path. It's ok, but if you don't like being frustrated by limiting game mechanics, this Thief is not for you.			"

												This is one of the worst games I have played recently. Graphically, it looks good but that's where it ends. The gameplay is very weak and it's unbelievably boring. I dragged on through this game hoping it will pick up at some point but nope. When you look at the gameplay on a video, it seems to be similar to Dishonored, as in, a stealth sandbox. How wrong I was! NOT EVEN CLOSE. While it tries to evoke such an illusion, this game is extremely linear for a game which focuses on stealth. You are very limited by the number of paths you can take. What's super illogical is that the Master Thief can climb up and jump to difficult places while he can't climb up to the easy ones. See a low rooftop which you should be able to climb up directly? Sorry, the game won't allow you because it has specifically set out a series of spots through which you must go if you are to take the rooftops. Yeah, those spots happen to be conveniently placed for the Thief to use. And, don't even get me started on the story. It could have been much more but it ended up being pretty lame.			"

Posted: August 24, 2016
												Dear devs, dear publisher, there are many people who love Garret and the Thief series. However, this game is not at all a worthy successor or a worthy ""reboot"".It is a huge, huge disappointment. The game is ruined by many flaws:1) No free jumping, no free climbing, no free rope arrow usage.I found myself very often not being able to use the level in the way I'd use it if I could move freely. I felt very limited in comparison to thief 1-3 as it is so linear. Especially rope arrows suck as you don't know where the arrow will stick and where not.2) Custom difficulty breaks game mechanics.Even if you're the toughest thief veteran you will not be able to complete this game on highest custom difficulty because the game mechanics don't work then, e.g. no feedback about proper unlocking doors or searching paintings for hidden switches. Without focus, you can’t see hidden codes without readjusting gamma. And if you hide the crosshair for the bow, you cannot aim well and waste lots of expensive arrows because you can’t shoot a rope arrow into massive wood at the ceiling. And you cannot find all loot and at the same time follow the rule that you must not stun any guards - you will find rooms in which you cannot take what's there because the NPC's don't move at all.3) Bad storytelling.Thief III left a very open ending and I remember participating in a survey in which people were trying to figure out what people would expect from a new Thief game. Thief 4 is basically the opposite of my suggestions. There were so many possibilities to tell something really deep and interesting. Instead you get an unsympathetic gothic-style murderer girl to run after which is also presented to you in such a superficial way at the beginning of the game that already after the prologue I had no mood to continue. And the rest of the story presentation isn't better. You don't even realize that you were ""away"" for one year and somehow you can still walk. And instead of really deep information you just see a creepy old woman telling you ""Beware, there are more dangerous things than you in the shadows, Garret."" Honestly - who wrote this?4) Catch'em all instead of master thievery.It is realistic to be able to search every single drawer but the animation makes it very slow. It would be better to have a faster ""open inventory and grab all"" system instead of pushing repeatedly ""E"" to pick up single coins, forks, knives, whatever. I'd have loved to see more focus on the ""big"" loot. Thief 3 did the stealing aspect far more entertaining as it focused on less but more valuable loot to find.5) Weird 3rd person climbing.Garret is not Indiana Jones! This doesn’t fit AT ALL.6) Weird controls, weird map.I don't know how many times I pressed ""E"" to open windows or push wood away. And why is it not possible to push one button and show the map? As it was in the older parts. Mark the room in which you are and - enough. This game instead gives too little and too much information at the same time.7) Bad performance.Although using the Unreal Engine which is known for good performance and beautiful visuals, Thief is not well-optimized. It looks nice but the framerate is far lower than in other games with equal or better visuals.8) Bad sound.It is very important to hear your enemies well. Their walking, but also talking about additional loot. But here, as soon as you are more than 3 meters away from an NPC, you hear lots of reverb and it’s too silent. There are also bugs. And when you get caught or die: ""BAIIIIIING!!!!!"" – horrible!If this game was not a ""Thief"", it would be a very mediocre AAA game with several bad design decisions, bad controls, some bugs and an uninteresting story. This would be ok because I wouldn't buy it then. But as it tried to be a ""Thief"" it should have done far, far better because the old thief trilogy was just masterpieces.It is sad that this is probably the last game starring Garret as I heard that if there is a new ""Thief"", it will be put into the future. The problem of Thief 4 is NOT the scenario. The problem is bad game design and screenplay. I'd love to see Garret again in a medieval/steampunk scenario, in a better game.			"

												I really liked the original Thief. I was bad at it, and it was really hard, but it was GOOOOOOOOOD, and the challenge made it satisfying. I'm not one to compare reboots to the original, because I support the sentiment that a reboot should have a unique feel and it strikes me as a bit overly-sentimental when they try to make it as close to the source material as possible, like they're trying too hard to relive the glory days, so my opinions on this game are, overall, how the game stands on its own, but when the game tries to be like the The Dark Project, of course I have to compare it to the standard it's aiming for.Thief does try to recreate the feeling of the original game, while also introducing modern gameplay mechanics, a new story, and more things to steal. However, it fails at almost everything it tries. It can't capture the essence of the original when it tries to, because it has no concept of what made The Dark Project enjoyable. In contrast, it's incapable of forming its own unique identity because most of the new ideas clash with the misdirected nostalgia. The writing is terrible, the voice acting is painfully average and uninspired, every new gameplay mechanic feels more like a tryhard gimmick, and you're tripping over loot to the point of it being an inconvenience and a distraction. Stealing things can be fun when you're required to be sneaky, but amazingly, stealth is rarely a factor since most of the loot is found in completely unoccupied rooms. That being said, when it's done right, it feels great. I really liked the instances of watching guard movment and carefully timing my steps to remain unseen to get that shiny object on the other side of the room, it's just a shame that these moments are so scarce in a game that should be built around this very idea.Old ideas like listening to guards converse from around the corner are insultingly simplified to the point of no longer serving the intended purpose. Whereas the original Thief had realistic conversations that were usually interesting and occasionally informative, the guards in new Thief sound less like actual peers discussing current events and more like robots conveying conveniently useful information to the player, or at least it pretends to be, but most of their not-so-subtle hints are obvious and redundant. But it's not just the written script that makes NPC's feel hollow: the artificial intelligence is absolutely non-existant and seems to have accidentally been replaced by a dementia simulator, considering the only people in real-life I've ever seen act so absent-minded and apathetic to their surroundings were in a god damned nursing home. Why does he keep the most valuable loot instead of selling it if he's a career thief? Because if he sold it, the player wouldn't get to have a collection of shiny things neatly displayed around your dim safehouse for you to stare at. Logical inconsistencies like this are abundant because everything in the game feels like it was designed for the PLAYER instead of the CHARACTER. Windows with scratch marks tell you where to climb, metal grates on the wall exist only for you to use your hook on, and many  paths seem to have been built specifically for a thief that's trying to avoid confrontation in a busy room. You don't feel like you're exploring a city or large buildings because their design is too linear to feel organic and convincing, the maps are so obviously intended to guide the player toward the objective so it's impossible to imagine anyone actually living in these spaces. Developers may try to convince you that it's a design choice, but it's really just an excuse for a lack of effort; claiming otherwise is saying you can't have fun exploring a detailed map, which was half the fun of the original. With video game budgets constantly growing, it's flabbergasting to me that a game from 1998 can be more detailed, open, immersive, and be better written than a AAA title from 2014. It's trying to be way too many genres at once, and it doesn't really nail any of them, so you wind up getting a misguided array of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥assets from better games. You MIGHT enjoy this game if you're into other modern blockbusters like Dishonored, but I can't honestly recommend it to anyone because it holds your hand so tightly that it comes across as insulting and offensive.

												Dreadfully uninspired and doesn't hold a candle to Thief 1 or 2. What potential this game had was marred by terrible AI, bad maps, an incredibly dull set of hub areas, game-y progression systems, terrible story, and boss fights. Thief 2014 is the perfect example of the state of the modern Triple A game industry. Thief 1 and 2 had people marvel at the potential of gaming as a medium and In the last ten years, the industry has progress in fantastic ways in graphics and audio design, but has regressed so much in almost every other way. These comapnies churn out the same game with the same incredibly flawed set of design choices year after year, with rising budgets and less care. Very few Triple A games these days ever have soul put into them, and this game is no different.			"

												I played Thief (2014) halfway through when it came out and completely forgot about it. Finally got back to actually completing it - and to summarize my experience with it:-  The story  attempts far too grandiose things with the little time it actually has and the pacing is so incredibly quick and messed up that you are constantly left with more questions than are answered. Every character is boring and forgettable and some of them are completely dropped out of the story without any conclusions. The cutscenes are rushjobs with poor editing, missing sound effects and they begin and end abruptly. The climax appears to begin at the 4th chapter and it builds up to absolutely nothing. The ending is a laughable letdown that leaves tons of loose ends.  Apparently everyone except Garrett (and maybe Erin?) dies. And Garrett has an encounter with the Thief-Taker General in 6 out of 8 chapters, 3 of which it leads up to absolutely nothing and serves no purpose. It's comical really. -  Missions  are linear, uninspired, dull and forgettable. Most of the chapter missions don't even involve any sort of thieving. And all the client and side jobs are very easy, very short and quite lazy. Once you've earned enough money to buy all the tools, you really don't need much anything besides a few rope, water and blunt arrows. So when you are not using the money on much anything, you don't end up caring for thieving either.  This game even tries to copy Shalebridge Cradle from Thief: Deadly Shadows and it falls completely flat. It's all just sounds, there are no threats until you are clearly introduced to them and even then they are not freaky. -  References to the original Thief trilogy  are plentiful but this game does absolutely nothing with them. Even the special arrows don't really function the same, except for water arrows. Rope arrows are completely contextual and serve to demonstrate just how linear these missions are. In truth, there's no reason for this to be a ''Thief'' game.-  Thieving stuff  is entertaining enough for the first 2-3 hours, but most of the thieving comes from breaking into poor people's homes that consist of one or two rooms and are never inhabited by anyone. You steal one or two items of value from them before moving onto the next empty home. Apparently there are hundreds of valuables just lying around in this supposedly very poor and dying city. So you are guaranteed to get bored by the core purpose of this game.-  Combat  is not a realistic approach despite the game's claims. Damage tools are too expensive and too difficult to obtain to maintain any sort of predatorial approach. You are much better off with stealthing through the game, the way this game is clearly intended to be played.-  The sounds and voice lines  in this game are a botched, buggy mess. They either don't play, they are too loud, they are too quiet, they are not muffled when they are supposed to be or they are muffled when they are not supposed to be. Many conversations between NPCs begin to repeat obnoxiously right off the bat. In a game where it's important to hear what's happening all around you, it sure is messed up beyond repair. For all its audio issues, this game screams development hell.I expected more from Eidos Montreal. They did great with their revitalization of Deus Ex, and thus I originally had great hopes for Thief (2014). As it stands, Thief (2014) falls short and right on its nose. There are other smaller reasons too that tend to hurt the game sometimes such as contextual jumping and occasional bugs but I've already explained enough about the game to condemn it. Stealth mechanics themselves are fairly competent and the customizable difficulty is appreciated as I'm sure this game can offer a worthy challenge to those who seek it.  But if you are looking to be a famous master thief with the skills, challenges and accomplishments to backup the title,  play the original Thief games.  They are easily worth their weight in gold and much more.			"

												I spent a couple of hours in Theif, playing through 3 missions.  I picked this game up on a sale because I enjoyed the studio's previous game, Deus Ex, and despite reviews, I felt my like for stealth would put this game in my wheelhouse.  The stealth is disappointing, no real 'upper' or 'lower' paths to take make traversal uninteresting.  It's all sneaking by guards on the ground level, and when they do see you the combat isn't fun.  Slide mechanic is like Dishonored's blink but less fun.  Weapons aren't interesting.  Environments do look good.  Can't muscle through this one, even on sale.			"

												From the trailer and screenshots, Thief looks like it has the potential to be a beautifully designed game with an equally beautiful story, exploring a fantasy steam-punk world torn apart at the seams by a mysterious plague (cue Dishonored storyline). After completing the main storyline and a moderate amount of side quests I can say that this game is a disappointment, certainly not worth the listed price of $29.99. The game looks like it may be a hybrid of Dishonored and Assassin Creed until the completion of the tutorial level, then you realize it will be reminiscent of the last Red Faction game (the one that was released years ago - a linear adventure that had very critical reviews). When you have a chance to make it out of your base of operations the movement around this city section directs you to set points: there is no climbing up the side of a building so you can utilize the rooftops like other games. The theme of movement is to go to Point A to Point B with two possible routes to get there. I felt like a caged animal wanting to go back to the time of 'noclip' just to experience some sort of breathing room. Moving from city section to another you will experience load times, be it opening a window or going through a passage, something I find even by 2014 standards disappointing. If I do need to have a load time, I would find it worth it if the homes I was looking in were the like the first room you are in at the beginning of the game. But the layout of these homes are cookie cutter, making me feel that the game developers put all their eggs in one basket, trying to have the buyer remember that first five minutes of game play. Voice acting is decent (more of a ""meh"") however it removed me from the game when three characters below try sounding like a group of ten to twenty people. Case in point, I was going from Point A to Point B and found that three city guards where worried about FOUR PEASANTS protesting in front of them. The dialog was something like ""There are so many of them - what should we do?!"" I don't know shower-shoes, how about you shoot the two in back, with Smith and Jones running the two in front through with their swords. They are unarmed civilians with NO WEAPONS WHAT SO EVER so it shouldn't be so hard, seriously boys if The Watch (can you developers call them something else? 'The Watch' is saturated in every media outlet these days) are so brutal like this game tries having you believe, this should happen all the time. In some games you have the option to help out the poor OR make moral choices on who not to steal from. That little detail makes a game. This game shows numerous people in poverity, begging to the character you play for help. There is no option to 'Give Coin' or do something for them. Fallout 3 had the option to aid those people for a moral reward in XP or gear, yet Thief failed to use this system. They have loads of beggers, but no way to help them.I am nitpicking but it's because this game presents itself as a reputable game. Even without good graphics a story is what makes a game. I would happily forgive the lack of graphically wow and game play if there was a good narrative other than: ""You bad, thief, but this guy...let me tell you, he's waaaaaay worse."" I found myself not caring about the characters as there was no driving force behind their own story being flushed out. I wasted hours looking for documents explaining what is happening with no luck.It doesn't matter if you spare someone's life or take it, there is no effect on the ending of the game or the world for that matter. This made me come to a sad conclusion: the only thing that Thief does well is to separate you from your money, something that you are reminded of each passing minute you play this game. If you ever want to burn a day worth of game play trying to find a good story only to not find one, this is the game for you.BUT it can be saved...SOLUTIONS:-Release a major patch with more content to improved the game. Add hidden documents regarding the characters. This is a reboot and new players like myself may be curious to know what are surroundings are. -Add crowds where there should be crowds, three or four people don't cut it. Additionally, bodies in the street set the mood for revolution.-Adjust the sound. If I'm twenty feet away, the people yelling shouldn't sound like they're right behind me.-Allow the player to interact with their environment. Give money to beggers and have the option to bribe The Watch and others.-Adjust the ending or overall play experience. If the thief wants to be Robin Hood have their experience different than the thief who wants to be on 'Pimp my Hideout.'-Don't bait us with a sequal. Give us a bit of closure.			"

												7.5/10Overview: Stealth/AdventureThe Good:+ Graphics are gorgeous, along with the atmosphere. The developers really nailed the industrial/mechanical setting+ Lighting effects+ The game offers a custom difficulty setting, allowing you to set a variety of different modifiers, i.e. no kills/knockouts, no damage taken, slow speed etc. You can adjust any parameters to customize your own difficulty level.+ Challenge map with different game modes to increase game length + The stealth mechanics are solid, it finds the right balance between fun and frustrating. So long as you are completely hidden in darkness guards can't see you unless they are standing right next to you. It can be unrealistic at times but it provides for a much less frustrating experience + Although set pieces have no place in a thief game, I found the cinematic moments in the game to be really impressive. + Upgrades are handled by stealing loot scattered around the levels and then purchasing upgrades through a vendor. However, you can easily complete the game without upgrades  + I found the achievements to have a nice variety between easy and challenging.   + Sound effectsThe Average:The story is adequate but very forgettable. The first problem, it's hard to care about any of the characters. Every character including Garret are one dimensional. The second problem, the main story starts off interesting but doesn't really do anything with its ideas afterwards. The third problem, it leaves a major plot point unexplained. The levels are linear in design especially the first few levels. Even the later levels which are more open ended still feel linear because the levels are designed in ""stealth segments"" You complete one area and then you move on to the next stealth area. Even worse is that there are points in each level that once you pass you can no longer return to. There is not a single level that is truly open-ended. Although I enjoyed playing these levels, the design approach is completely different from past entries, and the game isn't necessarily better off for it either. The original Garret was MUCH cooler and felt more like a thief than the Garret in this game. The original Garret felt like a thief caught up in a bad situation and based on the writing and story was always looking for an opportunity to steal regardless of the situation. The Garret in this game feels like an average run of the mill hero saving the day. The game crashed on me a few times The Bad:- One of my biggest complaints for Thief 3: Deadly Shadows was the loading in-between levels. This game not only fails to address this problem but actually makes it worse. The loading only occurs in the main hub world and when you first enter a new level. The first problem is the main hub world is pretty confusing in its design, its broken up into a several different sections and the entry/exit points are not always obvious. Most loading points are designated with a bright light at a doorway which is a good indication that you will be heading to a different area, however other loading points are not indicated at all, sometimes opening a window sill or squeezing through boxes will trigger a loading screen. It will take a long while before you figure things out. - With tightly scripted levels come tightly scripted controls. The game controls beautifully with the left trigger allowing you to vault, climb and jump yet you can only do these things at specific points in the level. You can only shoot a rope arrow at  predetermined points, You cannot pick up or drop items etc. Everything in the level is strategically placed for you to be ""stealthy'. It doesn't feel like YOU are being stealthy so much as the developers guiding you to the end of the section. In many respects modern game design has taken a step back rather than forward. - If you are a fan of the previous Thief games then this game will be disappointing to you. A lot of the ""thief charm"" is absent from the game. Eavesdropping on guards, ""taffer"", Hammerites, pagans, complex level design, crazy unique levels, ...all gone. ConclusionThis is not a bad game so long as you are willing to overlook its design choices and just enjoy the game for what it is...a modern reboot that lost all of the charm of the original. Calling this game Thief seems to have hurt it more than helped. It feels like there should be two reviews for this game, one for those who never played Thief before and the other for fans of the series. Even though I've played the original games countless times I was still able to enjoy this game only because my expectations were much lower than normal. "

			After a decade in the shadows, Garrett returns to The City to swipe, steal and swindle. Is this reboot the rebirth of a classic franchise, or has Square Enix ruined this master thief's return?		

Thief places players in a sprawling steampunk metropolis known as The City, which after a mysterious ritual is interrupted by Garrett and his protege Erin, is ravaged by a plague known as The Gloom. When Garrett comes to, he finds that Erin perished and the city is at it's knees with the citizens united under a man named Orion who is trying to rid the city of The Baron who oversees it and eliminate The Gloom. It's a bit of a remix of the elements that made up the narratives of previous games with corrupt politicians, shadowy occult orders and, of course, plenty of shiny stuff for Garret to get his hands on. The problem is that Garret himself isn't exactly a silver tongued swindler, instead he dryly pontificates on the city's woes and his predisposition to lift anything with a luster. The plot itself unfolds in an uneven manner with the final act unfolding quickly and clumsily; making it similar to watching a racing thoroughbred breaking a leg and tumbling fifty feet from the finish line throwing up clouds of dust and leaving it's jockey a bloody, crumpled mess. There is never a satisfying build to the major plot points in Thief, they are just thrown out without much in the way of foreshadowing dramatic flair. Ultimately, both fans and newcomers will likely not list the plot of Thief among it's strong points.  Like the previous entry, Deadly Shadows, this installment allows players to explore the city between story missions as well as tackle side missions and steal anything of value that isn't bolted down. From the clocktower that Garret calls home, the city is split between districts that unlock as players progress. A jaunt around the city quickly shows players that Garret's kleptomania isn't his only character fault as he is also prone to eves dropping. Loose lipped denizens give players clues to secret loot as well as adding a few narrative flourishes. The City is also host to a number of secrets and keen players will find themselves stumbling across hidden passages, bookshelf switches, wall safes behind paintings, tunnels and traps to boot. Maps can be located that point players in the direction of some cleverly concealed spoils. All of this makes early exploration of The City a real treat but it only takes a mission or two for the luster to fade. Many secret areas don't really seem to lead to any kind of exceptional reward. The game makes a point of letting you know that you have discovered something intentionally tucked away with an audio cue but the rewards are often the same stupid trinkets that populate every other area in the game. Also, over the course of the game navigating the same streets, dodging or bludgeoning the same guards and visiting the same landmarks becomes tiring and tedious. Many players will pick over each and every home before receiving a specific job from Basso, Garrett's contact, necessitating a return trip. More vexing is how lifeless the city feels. Thief makes a point of trying to explain it's empty streets away with the Gloom and a city wide lockdown but nearly every home that Garret finds his way into is unoccupied. Those who are in the streets often stand in one place or follow a very short path. Many of them don't even speak making your time wandering the streets seem like you are taking part in a steampunk parody of Westworld.  Missions are generally a bit more engaging, offering greater challenges and more intriguing environments. Missions are linear, at best offering a few paths to the next objective. Series fans will mourn the more open areas of past titles but there are a few sections which evoke someof the older game's design like one late game mission that has you infiltrating a huge estate and making your way to it's study. It's here that another disappointing flaw rears it's ugly head, while guards can be dangerous, they never feel cunning or autonomous. Guards can be three feet away staring in Garrett's direction but so long as he looms among the shadows, he will remain undetected. Likewise, the simple patrol paths that guards follow makes stalking them and discreetly taking them out really simple. Being discovered in Thief is usually the result of not seeing a pet bird of dog that draws attention to your presence or bumbling on a surface littered with broken glass. If you happen to be detected while in an elevated position, guards will founder around in the area below in a flustered alert state. Levels are designed around this unsatisfactory AI, so there are still some challenges while playing Thief but they are anything but satisfying. Thankfully, Garret's toolbox is better suited for stealing than fighting, so combat should be avoided at all cost. While players can easily pummel a single guard with Garret's Blackjack, facing more than one foe is usually a death sentence. Garret's bow is also a better tool than a weapon with it's long draw time and limited supply of lethal arrows, that is until he get's his grubby hands on exploding blast arrows... Thief does make some major strides forward when it comes to giving players control over their game experience, and the importance of this innovation for the stealth game genre cannot be overstated. The menu features a number of UI and difficulty options that can be toggled to provide players with and unprecedented amount of control over how much or how little information they have concerning their surroundings. An icon that tells players whether or not they are completely concealed in the dark can be toggled, the mini map can be turned on and off, how health is displayed can be altered, objective markers can be turned off and even the glint given off by trinkets can be turned off. Also, the new focus feature can be turned off as well. Focus helps highlight traps, collectables, switches, breakables and obstacles. With a few upgrades it will also allow you to deliver punishing blows with the backjack, hasten you lockpicking, move silently and even slow time. It's a handy tool for newcomers and even those familiar with the series will find it useful for things like disarming traps. Also, easing newcomers in is the swoops ability which lets Garrett move swiftly and silently for a short distance. In addition to upgrading the focus ability, Garrett can buy upgrades for his bow and clothing as well as perk bestowing trinkets from a Walter White-esque merchant. Thief isn't exactly the reboot fans had hoped for but there are some flashes of brilliance among the stupid AI, performance hiccups, lame narrative and repetive trips through the city to your next mission. There is plenty here to suggest that a sequel could provide stealth game fans with what they are looking for. Make your decision to purchase accordingly.   "

												If you have played Thief 1 and 2 and even Thief 3, you will be strongly disappointed with this game. The attention to some of the important details of the Legacy titles of this franchise have been lost on this very shody attempt at fame and glory by taking 16 and 14 year old works of art and completely destroying the well laid out foundations by trying to make it something it wasn't. This is worse than Assassins creed. The developers would have been better off calling this game something else and changing the characters names and just left it as that. They've gone as far as making Thief 3 look really good comparatively as far as sticking to tried and true mechanics. The dynamic difficulty settings, where you can change how limiting the difficulty is, is a cop-out by the dev's lack of imagination and abilities to create something true to the series, something unique, something next generation. This game is only next-gen graphically, and by that I mean next gen from Thief 3, not next gen for Consoles or PC. You'll largely be disappointed with what is about a 10 hour playthrough. Don't waste the money, wait till it's on a steam holiday sale, if you still feel inclined to experience this huge disappointment.Reasons why I -DONT- reccomend the game. Combat music -  (Music can be disabled, but for some of the decent tracks that there are...)Objectives - Mission parameters aren't always clear. (I.E You can't knock out civilians, if you do, you fail. but it doesn't tell you this until you do it. ) Clunky combat - Previous titles Garrett had a Sword or a Dagger. Killing in close quarters was always the -players choice-, not the games.   You can kill people with a bow, but you can't keep it drawn in close combat if they hit you.   In this game you either have to run or try and clobber the guards to death with your blackjack while trying to clumsily dodge their blades or their projectile weapons. Running is the only  option unless you're cornered somewhere.. which again.. is limited by the fact that you can't actively jump whenever you want to. Voice Acting / Audio execution - It's not that the voice actors themselves are bad. The sound mechanics take what might have been an intriguing narrative and make it difficult to actually care about it. This is coming from a regular speaker 5.1 speaker system on a high grade sound card, and a high end set of headphones.   Also there is an annoying sound que when a guard is getting notice of you in their peripheral vision.  The second part of this is that there's no environmental effects on voices... it literally sounds like the actors are standing right next to you the whole time, even if they're down on the streets below you or a door or two between you.  Which to me makes the game feel very  tacky and unfinished. Music - Again leaves more than a lot  to be desired. It tries to make a slow paced Genre feel more fast paced, and it's just not. Listen to some of the previous games soundtracks and then listen to the sound track from this game. The difference is worlds apart, and the soundtrack for Thi4f falls short. Even without comparison to the previous games, it does little to augment the environment of the city streets or the subtleties of sneaking about some mansion or many of the shortcut areas Garrett comes across. Cut-scenes - Yes there have been cutscenes before, but in this it can't make up it's mind if it wants you to get lost in the first person perspective or run it like you're watching some kind of movie in the third.  The cut-scenes look great but... the execution again is fairly disappointing. I found myself wanting it to make up its mind on the perspective, it falls short. Over all story arc - Written by the same woman who wrote Tomb Raider. Which if you slapped some torn pants and a tank top up on Garrett, it'd almost be hard to tell the difference in the overall plot. Garrett's look - A mask? He's a ninja now?  Eye liner/ eye shadow?  In general, Garrett feels like he's been womanized. He can't fight, he's wearing eye shadow and a mask, and he complains too much.  The witty reserved anti-hero of yore is gone. Replaced with... Lara-ett. And for those of you who are piping in on my play time on steam, PC isn't the only platform Thief is out on.			"

												I played the First Thief the Dark Project several times back in 1998-2000 on Pentium II/III one of the most enjoyable immersive game I ever played in my childhood. Thief created and made Stealth possible in video games. I remember playing Thief 1 full sound in my dark bedroom (curtains closed and no lights). The game was absolutely dark and scary, especially when you heard the zombies in the catacombs. Then Thief 2 the metal age came to life in 2000 which was as well as good as the first. Then unfortunately Looking Glass Studios (developer of Thief and DeusX) went defunct on May 24, 2000 due to financial issues. Years later another studio picked up Thief and did Thief 3 which was a step back from the original Thief games but tried to stick as close to them as possible - to me it was not as good but it was not a total let down.Then came Eidos Montreal, picked up Thief and made Thief 4. Which i am still trying to PUSH myself to play and finish it. Let me rephrase it, I am FORCING myself to like the game and try finishing it which is very sad (especially to me who was one of the firsts to have enjoyed Thief 1 and 2 back in the days - they were my childhood). and yes its a failure compared to its predecessors and the original series and sadly here are the reasons:PROS:+ Good graphics and environment (8/10)+The inventory (arrows, rope arrows, flash bombs etc.) everything is back (9/10)+ Stealing safes is a very good addition+ The picklocking mechanism is enjoyableCONS:- Very poor story, poorly implemented and makes no sense to me (2/10)- The LOOT omg what you have done to the LOOT???? Garrett never ever stole forks, and scissors and and pens. What is he now a scavenger low end thief? - Very very linear game / maps - and trying to find where you are on those ugly empty maps of the city is a big fail (3/10)- As others said the mechanical EYE on Garrett was never explained.- The city's life/environment is dead, pretty bad and boring due to its redundancy (you see the same stuff over and over again, same places to steal, same man hanging at the very start of some missions) (3/10)- The sounds/audio- one of the worst i ever heard. Ive been playing the last few chapters now audio very high and I hear nothing in the background what i mean is the original thief had this humming or creepy noises in the background and other enviornmental sounds which kept you immersed and scared. I did not get immersed in the game at all (2/10)- The guards and the AI - The guards graphically are bad quality and the AI's display on top of their heads kills the immersion. The AI itself is also average, guards detect me, i sprint away and i lose them -waaay too easy where is the alarm?? too easy happened a lot to me in Chapter 6. - I tend to dodge the guards but somehow they always are able to hit me with their swords- Speaking of swords, why did Square Enix and Eidos Montreal remove the sword from Garrett's inventory? why oh why? At least Thief 3 had a dagger to compensate...- The Hammers, The Trickster, Builders, the Pagans and Keepers are non-existant.- no more ""Taffer"" and other old wordings. Also no more creepy quotes on the loading screen, all the magic is gone....			"

												Thief 2014 is a stealth based game developed by Edios Montreal and published by Square Enix. The game was released in 2014 as one of the entry titles on the next gen consoles while also being released on PS3, 360 and of course, Steam. This is the fourth instalment in the Thief series. You take control of a thief named Garrett, and play in a first person perspective. Having only previously placed the other games in the series sparsely, I was going into this game with no real feelings about the franchise, other than I had heard great things.  The main aim of the game is to complete objectives in a stealthy manner. Each of the chapters has more than one route that you can take. Each level is also full with guards patrolling the grounds in order to try and catch you out. You are able to distract the guards in many ways, such as throwing bottles to grab their attention, blowing out candles, opening doors etc. On top of a heavy amount of guards, you also have to deal with another kind of enemy, dogs and birds. I have never seen so many birds in cages in a game before; but the idea behind it is, you have to be extra sneaky around the bird cage, or else you will startle the bird and it will start squawking – this bringing attention to yourself. I thought this was a really original idea that adds that extra level of depth to the game play. Whilst you are sneaking around, you will find plenty of opportunities to steal items, these items are instantly converted to an amount of gold, which you can then buy extra supplies with, such as different arrows, or passive stat increases such as health. Whilst the game is a stealth based game, there may still be moments where you have to use combat; the bow and arrow aspect of the combat system works really well, with an abundance of different types of arrows to choose from, you will always have something for the specific moment. Where the game’s combat lets it down, is the melee; the controls seem really off and it essentially turns into a button mashing competition with anyone you are in a fight with. I know that combat isn’t supposed to be used in this game, but why it is there, and it should be of a decent standard if it is going to be used.  Like I said, the majority of the game play is stealth based, but a good portion of the game also uses the a parkour system; it felt like a poor man’s version of Assassin’s Creed when this was forced on me, there is actually an entire level based on this system which grew really boring very quickly.  Where this game does well though, is the really in depth stealth mechanics, making use of light and sound perfectly. Thief was one of the first big titles to be released in the next gen market, so as expected; the graphics are of a high standard. I couldn’t quite push out a 4k resolution, but I was playing at 1440p and the is awesome. The lighting in the game is done perfectly, and as it is such a key part of the gameplay, it should be! As PC gamers will probably face more commonly now, the gameplay actually looks better than cut scenes.  Water is also a key element of the game, and that too looks really good. Animation of all characters is done superbly as well. The game has varying levels of difficulty, the settings are chosen at the start of the game, with no option to change mid-way through your story mode, so you should choose wisely. The difficulty does take a rather high curve towards the latter stages of the game, but nothing that cannot be outweighed by the skills you have learned up to that point. The higher difficulty you pick, you will also be impaired with certain flaws too; such as enemies being more aware, and your energy bars now regenerating in between chapters.  I would have liked the option to change the difficulty on an adhoc basis, as doing it this way may encourage players to just play on the lowest difficulty and not really have any problems completing the game.  Whilst this can is often referred to as an open world, it isn’t as open world as some games such as Skyrim or Fallout. Yes there is a city in which your hide out is located in, and you are able to explore it to your hearts content in between levels, but once you explore it once, there isn’t any real need to go digging again. The base city is small, so even that doesn’t take long to look around. The game does have a couple of side quests which you can do in between chapters to, these are a good way to earn a little extra gold and to squeeze a couple more hours of content out of the story mode. As you can probably guess though, a lot of the side missions are simply fetch quests, since you are their hired thief. The single player story mode took me just over ten hours to complete on a medium difficulty, I only did a handful of the side missions, as they did start to become very repetitive after a while, but I did take every opportunity to explore levels up and down trying to find collectables.  I felt the length of the game to be satisfying without ever feeling like I was being cut short of content at any point.  This is one of the few single player only games that I will say has a fair bit of reply ability, you can replay missions to complete challenges in them, such as finding all of the loot, or not being discovered by guards, and you could also simply replay the game on a higher difficulty and trying to finish it with the self-imposed handicaps from the start. So you can probably get roughly 20-25 hours out of Thief if you really get into it. No major technical issues were found whilst playing; the game was running at a smooth 60 fps the entire time, with the resolution high and graphics cranked all the way up to full.  The game has full controller support, but I don’t know why you’d want to use it when the controls fit keyboard and mouse perfectly. My conclusion is that if you go into this game just expecting a modern day stealth game, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. The only reviews I have seen that have put this game down, are ones which have the nostalgic connection to the series, whilst this isn’t a bad thing, it just doesn’t do this game any favours. This is just a modern day version of the game, and in my opinion, is a thrilling experience. The regular price of £19, 99 is OK, if you plan on replaying the game at least once to try out challenges or different difficulties, if you just want to see the story through, then you may just want to wait for it to drop below the £10 mark.

												If you are a fan of the original Thief titles (like me), this game will disappoint you.I grew up with Thief and Thief II The Metal Age. Those are far better games than this in any point except graphics. And even those can be tuned with mods for the original old games... The side characters and even the main characters of this Thief here are flat and boring. The story concept is unworthy of the legacy but the worst part is that there are BOSS FIGHTS. And you play a weak thief who is supposed to stay hidden and steal goods... not to mention that the boss fight I am talking about happens in an area of the game after a video sequence at what point it makes absolutly no sense at all that this boss appears out of nowhere and fights you. Next thing are the getaway scenes. Even if you sneaked through the whole level without making a single noise you get chased around in Call of Duty style (what the heck?). I can't understand why Eidos ruined this reboot so much. It shouldn't have the name Thief written on it and it would be an average game. But for the players among us who know what a real Thief game is, it's clear very quickly that this isn't one of them.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but it is just, eh, too vague, I guess. The story is pretty much non existent, and the one they attempt to tell does not make any sense and is just unfinished.Never played the old games so don't know if these had the supernatural nonsense in them, but this one sure does, which ruins the game. Should have been a simple stealth-puzzle game instead (probably the only aspect of the game that is at least half decent).Other than the useless plot, the game is just plain boring:- monotonous dialogue in cutscenes,- no dialogue options in-game,- repetitive NPC speech (literally saying the same one-liner on a loop every 5-10 seconds),- zero character development,- no major heist jobs,- very small areas (the town is spit into several small sections instead of just a single area, so you have to see several loading screens just to get to your objective),- useless soundtrack,- resetting patrol positions after reloading areas,- etc.			"

												I played the originals and in basic mechanics this version does them justice.  How that mechanic is applied in this iteration, however, is disappointing and loses all goodwill that I had brought to the table.Bad:- QTEs, ffs the QTEs.- level design is too limiting and confining- missions are basically puzzles with only one solution to them- controls are clunky/sluggish-  storyline- painfully obviously a port (I will ALWAYS condemn a game that is on a platform that it was not designed for)			"

												Thief is an Action/Adventure/Role-Playing/FPS (First Person Sneaker) game, set in a Victorian Gothic world but, with primitive electric lights and machinery typical of the early 20th century, as well as some unique and very imaginative devices.  The characters are a blend of aristocracy, soldiers, commoners and beggers, some with British accents and, some who sound like they came from the streets of  Brooklyn.  The theme casts a hint of paranormal hope in a disease-ridden city of despair.  The player is a thief named Garrett, who lost his female counterpart, Erin, in an accident which resulted in Garrett's near death.  After his recovery, amnesia swallowed most of his memories of the past year.  So begins his search to find out what happened to him and, to learn Erin's fate.Much of the city hub is hidden in darkness.  Dark alleys and dimly lit streets dominate Stonemarket. There are paths above ground level that take you past flats, through balconies and over rooftops, providing alternate routes across town.  But, many of the ground-level streets and alleys shown on the game map may look like a clear path with no walls or doors but, they sometimes bring you to a dead-end.  Trying to follow the map is confusing, until you get to know your way around town.  To get to the upper areas, you climb crates, walls, ladders or ropes but, only as the game permits. The game restricts where you can climb, e.g. you can climb one set of crates but not a nearby identicle set of crates.  Most climbable spots are identified by a faint blueish-white glow, which is a big help, when in a hurry.     Thief is comprised of 8 main chapters that will each take from a half hour to as much as 2 hours, depending on how much exploring you do.  Plus, there are 6 optional client jobs with specific items you must retrieve, and are somewhat smaller in scope than the main chapters.  Additionally, there are 25 side jobs that usually involve only one or two rooms and also have a specific item that you're after.The promise of a fully stealthy play style prompted me to try Thief.  If you want the frontal assault gameplay of a good, old fashioned First-Person-Shooter game, Thief is not for you.  The main character is not a skilled CQB fighter and will often lose in hand-to-hand combat.  To play exclusively with a stealthy approach will require a great deal of time and patience.  However, a mixture of stealth, non-lethal takedowns and kills from a distance is common and a more fun way to play.  Remaining undetected will often depend on how you move and where you hide.  Swoop past a caged bird it becomes agitated by your sudden movement and will alert hostiles.  Dogs have keen senses and will see you when you get too close and give away your presence by barking.  Staying in the shadows and moving low and slow is your best practice for a stealthy approach.There are a few DLC's that often come with Thief or, are available for a buck or two each.  They are very much worth the small price.  One is an added mission called, ""The Bank Hiest"".  Not as large as a normal chapter but, introduces a new component to the challenge.  Three others are ""Ghost"", ""Opportunist"" and ""Predator"".  These provide scoring of the three different play styles you can choose from.  You can play them exclusively or in any combination you like.  You decide as you progress.  There is no penalty for using one over another or, all three for that matter.  At the end of a mission, the game statistics will show a rating of your play style.- Ghost:  Requires great patience.  Your intent is to avoid any interaction with hostiles or the environment.  Stealth is your primary concern.  Remain undetected and don't alarm anyone.- Opportunist:  Interacting with or exploiting the environment, you try to remain undetected.  Putting out flames or dousing candles, will help you get past hostiles unseen.- Predator: Use any means necessary to acheive your goal, taking out whoever is in your way. A fourth rating of Hybrid is given if, ""You equally blended a range of traits from all three play styles.""Thief has three difficulty levels...Rogue, Thief and Master, in successive order of difficulty.  There's also a Custom Settings menu that you can use to limit many of the features of the game, such as types of resourses, upgrades, HUD display features, abilities, tools, etc.  These self-imposed restrictions can make the game especially challenging.Scattered throughout the game are a few puzzles that are moderately challenging.  However, I must confess, one of them was a little more so than I had patience for.  I ended up looking to a walkthrough for the solution and still didn't understand the logic of it.  All the rest, if you're paying attention to the story and reading the documents you fing along your way, will not be so hard. I should warn you that, if you're trying to Ghost the game, you'll be challenged at almost every turn.  Especially if you're trying to grab all loot and collectables that are available.  Thief employs the usual scripted traps and...well...some cheap tricks as well.  And, many tasks require very precise timing to accompish successfully.  The devs have devised quite a repertoire of situations to foil your progress.  Occasionally, the game sets you up for a fall.  If you try to go slowly and, carefully watch for the hostiles and how they patrol, it will only postpone the inevitable.  In those situations, logic, reason and patience is of little help.  Basically, it's a game of surprises and a few seemingly impossible situations.  As in many games, getting through each chapter is generally a matter of trial and error.  So, until you learn the devs' tricks, frequent use of the Quick-save and Quick-load keys, is a necessity.Then, we come to the Boss Fights.  As for the first one, you have two choices.  One; you can try to fight the Thief Taker General which will usually end in your demise, until you learn his patterns.  (More trial and error.)  Or, two; you can avoid confrontation entirely.  All you have to do is open the exit door and escape.  Well...of course it's not quite that simple.The second Boss Fight is the last challenge of the game.  But, it's not so much a fight as it is a matter of evasion.  Not as difficult as the first one but, still not easy.  Fortunately, those are the only two Boss Fights in the game. As for the story...it's kinda weak and convoluted.  I was never drawn into the plot as I have been in some games.  During the early chapters, I felt it had good potential.  Although, as I progressed, the plot began breaking down, changing and taking new directions.  For me,  it was a tremendous let-down.Of course, what game is complete without bugs.  And Thief has its fair share of them.  Aside from a few technical problems of crashes and hangs that have been reported by a small percentage of players, there are some bugs during the gameplay that can be really annoying.  e.g. there are a few times, when you've figured out a guards patrol pattern, you'll try something that doesn't work and will reload a Quick-save, only to find that the guard now stands still in a spot that prohibits your further progress, and never moves.  When attempting to Ghost a chapter, this can be particularly frustrating, as you'll have little choice but to take action that causes a penalty.  Either that, or start the chapter all over again from the beginning.  Poor quality control.In conclusion, I have to say, this was a fair attempt at a stealth type game but, they could have done much better. For me, Thief comes in only a little above average.  It offers variety in gameplay but, while claiming to be an open world, is still rather linear and restrictive.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 7.  It has pretty good graphics, a lot of atmosphere and a great deal of replay value.  I think it just needed more time in developement and testing.			"

												Thief is a troubled reboot of an excellent stealth franchise. Garrett explores claustrophobic, circuitous city hubs that are linked together with frequent loading screens. Side quests are exercises in tedium as you search for the indirect route into treasure rooms. Once inside you’ll comb through empty drawers and watch Garrett grab every item. Missions take you outside hubs into more focused situations. The Northcrest Manor mission is one of few highlights, with numerous routes of infiltration and flames that encourage the use of water arrows.When creeping around you’ll be disheartened to learn how the ground surface has little impact on stealth. Moss is gone too; so you have to crawl over endless puddles of broken glass that you can’t jump over because Thief only allows contextual mantle. Don’t try to grab anything when on glass because Garrett will crunch the shards and you’ll be heard. Luckily you can hear guards from far away, but they sound like they are inside your ear canal and will never call you taffer. The sound systems are worse than the original and this is compounded when guards repeat quips or copy each other’s lines.Stealing loot and sneaking around guards can still be satisfying. The swoop mechanic has some merit and the focus blue hue is actually useful in the dull, foggy interiors. Unfortunately the story brushes over themes from the previous games as though the Trickster himself wrote it. It ends with an unresolved finale that does no favours to the jumbled story. This was not the way things were supposed to go. 6/10 "

												First off, I never played the originals so I will judge this off its own merits.-The story is abysmal.-The gameplay is linear.-The mechanics are terrible, there is no 'jump' button and so you cannot jump on many things that look as though you should be able to.-Overall it is a very boring game with very few paths to take (usually just one but sometimes two).Do yourself a favour and play Dishonored instead.

												They clearly have no clue what made the Thief series special. I understand the necessity to streamline for a broader audience in order to finance the development of a AAA reboot. I do not understand however, how you'd plan out the reboot of a series and simply forfeit the key things that made it unique. A typical Thief experience in the first 3 titles:- player agency is king- Garrett is a master thief, as in the kind of person who pulls off difficult and challenging heists- the world is mysterious but largely consistent- the various factions' beliefs determine the world's institutions, shape, and nature of places Garret visits- Garrett is intelligent, witty, and cynical- sound is the primary means of conveying stealth information to Garrett (direction and distance of footsteps, voices, etc.)In this new Thief:- player agency is severely hampered (contextual jumping, pre-determined spots for rope arrow, mostly linear map design)- Garrett does not come across as a professional thief, more like an emo-batman, and the missions are way to easy and linear to require any thought or plan at all- the world is generic, inconsistent, not plausible, and therefore boring (loot placement, decorations, outdoor design, interior design)- there are no factions representing any kind of beliefs, the little struggle there is between factions is not shaping the world, it's just alternating who's running it- Garrett's writing and voice acting has declined sharply from previous titles- sound is not important at all, there is no robust sound propagation in this game, thus... Garret has a radar mapI could have enjoyed the game with all the other things that water down the experience for the sake of a broader audience: takedown mechanics, focus time, radar map instead of rough sketches, shallow side-quests, shallow character pseudo-progression, whatever rocks your AAA boat... But a set of features does not make a good game, especially not one that needs you to feel like you're there, in a dangerous place, pulling off a heist or rescuing a friend. For that you need depth, and that has gone out the window in this game. "

												I don't recommend this game unless it's on sale and I'll explain why.The world, although masterfully crafted, is rather bland.  Many of the apartments that you break into, if not all of them, are just completely devoid of life.  Outside of missions specific places there is no one sleeping in a bed that you have to creep around to avoid waking, no one resting on a chair by a window watching the world fall to crap, no one eating dinner at a table.  In fact there is simply no one at all in these apartments! You loot away without a care to be quiet at all.  You're basically just looting abandoned houses.  Other than some traps that might be set up you're pretty much danger free and this makes the whole experience just an act of opening a treasure chest in any rpg/adventure game -- only now you have to root around in it and watch annoying animated repeatedly of you opening and window by mashing away at a button.The world is segmented and the game doesn't save the state of one area when you leave it.  Any guards you took out just a moment ago will be reawoken and walking the same path just because you opened a window leading to another street or pushed aside yet another beam to squeeze through some boxes.  The annoying women standing alone by some food stand for some reason in the middle of the night, adjusting her hat over and over again, is just going to be standing there adjusting her hat again even though you clubbed her head in just a moment ago.The story!  A big giant head full of WTF is waiting you when/if you beat this game.  The cut scene feels like it's just mashed in there with no regards to what happened beforehand and you'll understand what I mean if you make it to the end.  Which you will be treated to a very short and unsatisfying conclusion to what you've invested your time in.There's points in the game where you can make a choice and I was hoping that it would play out somehow further into the game, have some sort of bearing as to what would happen later on.  Nope.  The treasure trunks!  I know this is just a small thing, but it was something that bothered me enough to write about it.  Why is it when I open these things, which stand about two feet tall, I'm greeted with a 4 in deep interior?  That's it, 4 inches and you hit wood?  I don't know if it's supposed to resemble a removable layer, like a tool box or fishing kit and there is more below, but I can't help but feel that's not it.  I think it was just a lazy♥♥♥♥♥design and they didn't take the time to, maybe, throw some junk texture in and make it appear that the loot your taking is sitting on a pile of crap and giving the trunk the appearance of depth.  No, instead you open up a deep looking trunk and peer in just to see a lonely cup and maybe some change sitting on some wood that's 4 inches from the top.The sound!  What the hell was going on with the sound?  Two people would be talking and one would be really loud while the other one could barely be heard?  Thankfully I play with subtitles on otherwise I would likely have missed out on a lot of conversations.All in all though, the game was incredibly beatiful and ran incredibly smooth.  Some parts were just wonderfully done and gave a rich experience, but I think I walk away with the feeling that this game was actually rather boring, empty and devoid of a real caring touch that could have turned it into something amazing.  Almost like all the development time was spent on the graphics and modelling and the rest was thrown in as an afterthough.			"

												By no means is the game as bad as people say.But by no means will it ever be worth more than 5 bucks in turn, and at most an hour or two of your time.Even assuming you set all the options to the exact experience you want, the story is bland and forgettable, the kind of thing that looks good only when you compare it to something as safe as, say, Watch_Dogs, and the gameplay is insanely bland and meaningless in light of numerous games that do everything this game has, and more.Even assuming you can look past all this and accept a bland game, however, the game as a whole is loaded with bugs and was visibly rushed out the door to meet a release date, despite almost five years in development.For something with so much time and budget put into it, this game came out of the oven way too soon, and it shows in the sound design and overall glitchy status of the game.If you're looking for a far more interesting experience like this one, go for Splinter Cell (Chaos Theory in particular), ANY of the classic Thief games, and if you don't have any cash on you at this moment in time? You can always download the Dark Mod for free and improved experience of what this game could've been.			"

												You know, Yahtzee Croshaw joked that you could probably beat this game by just running through all the guards to between checkpoints, slamming the door in their faces without much hassle. And no♥♥♥♥♥♥ that's actually what I ended up doing.It's hard to describe why the game isn't very good. It's got a very compitent stealth system and its mechanics work extremely well. It's just a shame you're never using them to do anything interesting.The main character's motivation for doing anything is never really given.The city is pretty open ended but divided painfully into small areas that all look pretty much the same. It's a nice aesthetic, but not for an entire game.Your only motivation for exploring is to steal stuff, but your only motivation for stealing stuff is for more money, but you don't need money! The basic mechanical system is more than enough to get through the whole game, you don't really need any of the items.It's just a very lifeless experience. Well done, you made a very nice stealth engine. Next time, use it to make a game that's the least bit engaging!			"

												Worst thief game. I've played them all, own them all.Pros:Great graphics, easy to find loot (shimmers), large cityscapes, darting between shadows, new items (screwdriver, wire-cutters, etc.), semi-non-linear maps, Good remake of Thief 3's Asylum, new inventory/arrow selection menu, a few good twists in the plot.Cons:Worst plot to date, loss of wall cling for hiding (closets are only hiding spots), rope arrows only work in suggessted spots, other arrows are weaker-usless, blackjack knockdown system is pointless, Nudity (a BIG Con for me),Overall, I give it a 3/10			"

												I bought this game from a sale so I'm not that disappointed but I didn't like the game. The first two chapters were okay but after that I didn't really enjoy the game anymore.The boss fights in the last two chapters were horrible, they are one of the biggest reasons why I'm not recommending this game.Dishonored beats this game in every aspect, in my opinion.So if you want a good stealth game, do yourself a favor and buy Dishonored rather than this game.

												This game is....problematic in many ways. It tries to ride the coattails of Dishonored, but Dishonored has a coherent storyline, compelling characters, and gameplay that feels less buggy and more intentional. the vast majority of the time that Garrett falls of something, it is not because I was being dumb, It's because the free run/climb things button is the same. this is...nearly impossible. Assassin's creed gets around this by having climb and interact be different buttons so when you fall it is at the very least more likely that it is your fault. Also, the guards run from dumb as an actual brick to upsettingly clairvoyant. Unfortunately, most of the time they're clairvoyant it's right where the game dropped you at a save point, so you spend the first 3 tries just hunting for a safe spot. But none of this compares to the truly lackluster storyline. Garrett acts like he could not care less about anything. Not got, not stealing, not Erin, nothing. LIke, stealing and his commentary about items stolen is delivered in this monotone that I ususally reserve for how I personally treat dog poo I have stepped in. But no, this is his career.Update: I finished the game and if anything, it has made me dislike it even more. Without any spoilers, suffice it to say that you're left wondering if you accomplished absolutely anything over the course of the whole storyline. That's not a good thing. The final boss was kinda cool, excepting for how bizarre the cut scene at the end was spliced. It felt like I had accidentally skipped some of the cutscene, but that is just reiterating how little the characters seem to care about their lives.			"

												What the game has: Prettiness.What it doesn't have: Engaging gameplay, a sound engine worth a damn, a good story or at the bare minimum an immersive atmosphere.This game was one of those where the publisher driving the studio behind it really needed to listen to its core community about what to do and what not to do with their game during its earliest stages of development. Instead, Eidos / Square Enix decided to throw caution to the wind, give their players the finger and create a game so riddled with bugs, with so immensely weak a story and with so much of what made its predecessors great stripped away it doesn't deserve to have the word 'Thief' in its title.The only reason I bought this game was because I'd already played through its entirety before buying my own copy, and I specifically waited for it to be available at the lowest price possible.I would not easily recommend it to anyone however as issues with its sound engine and NPC scripting are /still/ unresolved and break immersion /completely/ at more than a dozen points throughout the game, leaving the player confused, frustrated, or both.

												A number of things prevent me from recommending this game:1. It is too repetitive. There simply are not enough things to do, or enough ways to do them in; both the stealth aspect and the combat aspects are too limited. Many of the things you can do are boring or a bogged down in unnecessary animations (window climbing animation I’m look at you. First time is boring enough, 15th time you wanna kill someone). 2. The story and the characters are generally boring and predictable. The hero has very little personality and the villain even less. The world seem interesting, but is barely presented more than “oh the city is so bad… so bad… really bad I promise.”3. There are not enough reasons to explore. There is constantly an arrowing pointing you in the right direction so you’ll never really have to look for the way. And the loot and secrets you can find… why bother? It’s just money and you don’t need money to progress. Unless you’re a completionist there is no point. 4. I was considering sticking it out to see what happens, but why? I’m not enjoying the gameplay and I’m not enjoying the story. I think I’ll just stop here (about halfway, finished the 4th chapter). I’d avoid buying.			"

												An amazingly horrible game. I played all the original Thief games, but none were as in-your-face-bad as this ""updated"" new version. Load screens for entering the window of a house you need to move five feet through and exit again? Oh, that makes sense. In fact, it is pretty much load screen after load screen. The AI also seems oblivious. Really that's it. Between loading screens and the AI it's a horrible mess. Besides the updated graphics, this might as well be the old school Thief we grew up on. Compared to other new games of it's time it is a down right horrible game. It is currently the only game in my library that I look at and ask myself why I purchased it.			"

												Being a bit on a Stealth game trip, i wanted to give it a second chance. I love the other thief games. But after playing games like Dishonored(2), Deus ex, Styx, i find it ABSOLUTELY impossible to play a stealth game, where you can't even jump when and where you want. Like from a ledge to the ground. A invisible wall stops you.... You can only jump an certain spots.Levels feel completely linear and preplanned when you can't move freely. And the big open levels were always the best feature about Thief.Maybe it has a nice story (although Erin is just annoying), but sadly i'm never gonna find out.With that little playtime, i deinstalled it now and won't ever touch it again.It looks nice runs smoothly (at least for me, very high q settings and everything but WTF have they done to the Thief series....

												Thief is $49.99 right now, the average price of a AAA title. The graphics are good, but there seems to be a lot of flaws. I'm an hour into the game and I've seen AI's mouths not synced up with audio, and at least once where in-game music drowned out pertinent game volume. Hopefully they fix these with patches.The game itself doesn't feel like it's ""memorable"". Most cut scenes are bland, and not well thought out.All in all, I am enjoying it a at times, when I'm able to get past the ""rushed"" aspects of the game. The graphics/lighting are great, I just wish the rest of the game fell into line with those two things. I don't feel the game quality is worth $49.99. If it were cheaper ($20-$25), I'd recommend it.			"

Posted: July 24, 2015
I'm going to give two reviews here, one in comparison to the rest of the Thief series and one as a standalone game.TL;DR Version (Read the first and last lines of the quote)Comparing it to Dark Project, Metal Age, and Deadly Shadows is somewhat pointless really, as the developers themselves hardly decided to take their predecessors amazing talent and creativity into account and ask ""Is this really what Thief is about?""  As a passionate fan of the series, I was incredibly disheartened to see major elements removed that made the games what they were- everything from full freedom of movement to the City itself, along with all of its inhabitants. This reboot, whether it belongs in a parallel dimension or in the future, or wherever the developers intended it to be, is unfortunately a hollow shell. Sure, you're a Thief, in a City, Stealing.  However, that isn't what made Thief the beloved series that it is.  Having the untethered abilility to climb almost anywhere or shoot a rope arrow into any wooden surface- and thus allowing unparallel choice, is what made Thief incredible. The games felt alive- all the way from the poorly scribbled maps to the various written correspondance that you crept upon.  The reboot just feels lifeless. Garrett is dull, the menu-generated maps and letters are a pain to read, and the progression is forced.In the end, there is hardly any way to compare this game to the first three.  Of course, the classic ones had plenty of flaws of their own; however this Reboot did not attempt to evolve from its predecessor in any way besides graphically.  In some cases, it's even a step back like in level design, creative direction, and most importantly, freedom of movement.So lets talk about Thief without comparing it to the other games in the series.  Right away, if you've played Dishonored, you'll feel like this is some strange spinoff.  The environment looks the same. The story sounds similar.  There is even this blind enigmatic woman.   Level Design:  While the city is fun to explore for the first few jumps and crawls, it gets repetitive quick, especially since you're forced to go through the same locations constantly.  There is hardly any dynamic changes to the guard patrols as the story moves on.  The main level here is the city- it's the hub between missions and locations. You'll spend most of your time here, buying expensive arrows to reach inexpensive treasures or constantly tapping your keyboard to jimmy open a window- a function that becomes infuriating once you realize that its a key ""feature"" of interactive design.  The actual missions become more challenging and sometimes offer multiple options of progression, often making the difference between ""Ghosting"" which means not utilizing any resources and basically leaving no trace, or being an ""Opportunist"" and snuffing candles, using vent shafts, or rope arrows.  While it's nice to have different routes based on playstyle, you usually end up in the same exact location, no matter the playstyle.  The illusion of choice is there, but when your only choice is to go into the same room, does it really matter whether you go through the back door or the window that's right next to that door? Not really.  Lastly, everything in the main hub resets when you complete a mission. All doors need to get unlocked, all vent shafts need to get unscrewed.  It's nothing short of repetitive, especially when you have to see the same action over and over again. Audio annd Music:  The audio is very erratic- sometimes people talking next to you are very muffled and other times you hear guards or other voices talking through multiple walls.  You constantly pass by conversations that are supposed to occur behind closed doors or windows but it sounds like they are right in front of you.  Speaking of conversation, you'll be hearing the same lines of banter over... and over... and over.  Sloop sellers here, sloop sellers there.  I didn't really get an ambient feeling- the music was pretty forgetful and sometimes overpowered the audio, especially in dangerous situations when I was attempting to listen to footsteps. Speaking of footsteps, there was hardly a difference on what surface you stepped on, whether it was noisy glass, metal, or water.  As long as you move slow, you won't be heard. Even though I'm hearing the glass being crushed clearly beneath me, Benny the guard can't, despite being right behind me.Character Design:  As I mentioned, most characters are boring.  Even Garrett.  He isn't some ""master thief""- he's a clumsy brigand that relies too much on his tools rather than his wits. I've had to do massive amounts of reloading soley due to him missing a rope that was right in front of him, or falling off a rail for no reason.  The context sensitivity is ridiculous on all accounts.  Regarding his tools, its amusing how in the prologue, Garrett scolds his protege for relying too much on the grappling hook, yet as soon as he takes possession of it, he can't survive without it.  For a city that is supposed to be alive, it looks and feels dead. You either talk to the same three questgivers who say the same things, or to some blackmarket vendors who all look the same. The guards look no different than the criminals who replace them later in the chapters.  Despite the detail and hardwork put into the city, the appearance and dialogue of the NPCs seem more of an afterthought than anything. Story:  Bland. If you haven't played the previous games, you'll uncover a gleam of possibility in the muddy cracks of this city.  Unfortunately, it ends before you get anywhere.  If you've played the previous games, at the least, you'll be incredibily disappointed at the writers for missing an opportunity to re-establish some beloved factions.  At most, you'll probably feel a bit insulted that they attempted to make some subtle references to the city of the past and left it in the shadows. Overall, I give Thief 2014 a 2/5.  Almost a 3/5 for being a playable standard game, but personally, I can't help but compare it to its precursors.  The developers decided to make it a part of the series afterall. Play Dishonored or the original series instead. "

												This game is not epic, it will not stay forever carved in your memory and it probably won't be on any GOTY lists at the end of the year... but it certainly isn't a mediocre game like some critics would make you think, it's quite enjoyable if you don't expect it to be something it's not (Dishonored would be the first thing that comes to mind). Thief is meant to be played stealthily and if you play it differently, you won't have a good time with it (and believe me, I tried).So the positives and the negatives... let's start with the bad things shall we?- Horrible optimization on some systems, while it works great on others (I was one of the unlucky ones and had to play the game with the textures set to very low or else my game would freeze every 10 seconds).- This game's ""open world"" harms it more than it does it good. It's very tedious trying to get to your quest marker, as you will constantly run into walls that aren't there on the map.- The story is not engaging, you will probably forget it easily.- There is something crazy going on with the game's sound, you will constantly hear people talking even though there is no one around you (maybe Eidos wanted Garrett to have some super hearing power, I really don't know).the positives:+ Really, really, really fun gameplay (as long as you like stealth games and are playing this game as one).+ One of the chapters surprised me by being something totally different from the rest of the game, and it gets props for scaring the cr@p out of me.+ The game's atmosphere, the world and it's inhabitants are dark and that fits this game like a glove.The game has more negatives than positives in my humble opinion, but the negatives aren't really that bad, except the game's optimization, but that issue isn't there for everyone, and it will hopefully get patched soon. Overall Thief was an enjoyable experience, and it gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												Despite loving the first two games, and owning this since launch, I've only been able to spend 6 hours in it so far. I'm still hopeful that it might improve at some point, but so far it's been very linear. On top of that, the on screen hand animations for every single coin you steal, as well as the contextual movement is annoying. Cut-scenes are also awful up to where I've played, and the co-thief is worse than useless. The sound system also seems fundamentally broken, as you can sometimes hear people whispering from far down the street, but struggle to hear someone talking loudly on the other side of the door.			"

												Not being able to jump at will in this game may have been forgiveable if it didn't also break the game in Chapter 3 for many people. Apparently the only 'solution' is to restart the game from the beginning on a new save file and play the last few hours of gameplay over again. Jumping was left out to 'enhance immersion', in reality it achieved the opposite. Much like the rest of the game's interaction you feel as if you're on rails. Simple tasks like opening doors and picking up objects are laborious due to complete loss of character control while he peforms an overly lengthy scripted animation. Lazy and misguided development created a slow and frustrating game. 3/10			"

												I'm going to make this short. Although the original games were some of my favorite games of all time, I'm going to post my brief thoughts on this game as a stand-alone title, ignoring the existance of it's ancestors.This game is very bad. At the very core of the game, there's a glint of enjoyable gameplay, from swooping from shadow to shadow and avoiding detection from guards. The issue is... literally everything else. The story was stolen from some fourteen-year-old's submission to a fanfic site, the level design is shallow and frustrationg, the dialogue, while I think was delivered by competent voice actors, is dramatically written and over the top, even the very structure of the city feels messy and difficult to navigate, and not in a fun, artistic way. Instead of going after very valuable items and planning out your course, you're stealing a bunch of pens and scissors. This Garrett is not a master thief, he is a kleptomaniac with delusions of grandeur. There was not a single character I cared about, the story was confusing and did not invoke any sort of emotional response. Playing this game felt like a chore. Except I'd rather be doing chores, because after you do a chore you feel like you accomplished somehting. You don't get that feeling of accomplishment from this game.I didn't feel like a master thief at work, I felt like a clumsy tourist making my way through a boring city where everyone's depressed, trying to take everything that isn't nailed down, and even some of the things that are. I tried three times to play this computer program. This 'game'. I failed. Please save yourself the frustration and money and skip this title.Unlike love, it's better to have never raged, than to have raged and lost. "

												This has been the first Thief game I've played in the series that I got around to beating and with that being said; I can see why this game has a lot of hate. The game truly struggles with a story since the story is pretty much inconsistent, jumpy and overall hard to follow and get invested in. Gameplay wise, it's kind of a mixed bag since I did enjoy some parts and I despised others. The A.I at times were really brain dead compared to previous Stealth Action games that I've played (Mainly Dishonored and Splinter Cell.) and overall just weren't that much of a challenge to get around. You can level up your gear/buy new items with Gold you steal around the city or gain from completeing levels/sidemissions but I barely spent my gold on the upgrades since I never really felt that most the upgrades were nescessary with how easy things are in this game. I'm actaully kinda sad this game isn't as good as it could've been since the level design and atmosphere at times were quite lovely to run around in and it had potiential to create a world that could've held a more interesting story than what we got instead.I don't truly dislike this game as much as other people do since I did found some value out of it but I won't recommend it if you are in the market for a really good stealth action game or a good story driven experience.TL;DR - Mediocre Story           - Average/Mediocre Gameplay           - Beautiful Game enviroments and Level designs           - Offers upgrade system that can be useful, but I never found the need to upgrade my gear much           - A.I can be braindead at timesOverall, I would only invest a few bucks in this game if you are interested in the atmosphere of the game and don't mind a horrendous story and average/sometimes mediocre gameplay.

												A lot of people are hating on this game because of what it didn't do right, but I didn't see enough people give credit where it's due.- it's a very difficult game (playing on hardest difficulty). You have a very limited number of lethal arrows, their cost is prohibitive. The AI is very good and there are no apparent ways to cheese your way around, blackjacking everyone, like in the original Thief games. You lack a consistent way of taking out guards if they spot you, so you're forced to use the stealth approach most of the time. The combat is stacked against you and you're certainly no Corvo Attano.- the atmosphere is incredibly well executed. The animations are excellent: the way Garret nudges doors closed, the way he  opens chests and safes, his light touch as he feels for hidden buttons behind a painting. The sound effects are very good, the overheard dialogue is great; you'll once again find yourself trying your best to only walk on softs carpets, or standing still in a shadowy nook listening to the guards chat. The lighting effects are gorgous and very reliable in terms of  where you will be hidden and where you will be lit up (with a couple of exceptions, here and there).- the world is executed with a clear attention to details. The environment is very rich and believable.- it is mostly a linear experience, but there is at least one huge level, open for exploration, that for me counter balances the rest of the game (A Man Apart - Northcrest Manor).- the developers put quite a bit of effort into creating missions that feel different and are not just variations of a manor raid. The morgue, the brothel, the ancient ruins, the asylum - they are all memorable locations.All in all, Thief isn't the perfect reboot, but I think it's very good if you approach it with an open mind and not expecting a reskinned The Dark Project. It's main weaknesses are that the level design is too linear and that it came out after Dishonored, really. If the developers take into account the feedback they got from the players and focus on a more open level design for a potential sequel, it will be a very good game.			"

												Having played all the previous games, I couldn’t pass on an opportunity to try out the latest in the Thief series. This one in particular seems to have also gathered a rather bad reputation, but that didn’t really deter me from trying it out for myself. I did manage to play it all the way through the end and came to the conclusion that this game is basically a weak upgrade to Thief: Deadly Shadows with a bit of Dishonored thrown in.Gameplay is altered a bit by the new ‘swoop’ mechanic, which allows garret to zip across short distances similar to the blink ability in Dishonored. At first this seems almost like cheating but it is counterbalanced a bit by noisy surfaces and broken glass, which give the sound effect as if you had sprinted over them. You get the usual myriad of special arrows including the new choking and blunt arrows used for stunning opponents and remotely triggering devices and switches respectively. The rope arrow makes a return, but it’s pretty gimped and can only be used as a “key” to get to certain highlighted areas. You also get a few purchasable tools usable for unlocking areas and disabling traps. Finally there are a bunch of passive and active focus abilities that can augment Garret’s ability to stealth, pick locks, fight, and other useful thief-related things. Playing through the game on highest difficulty, I kind of expected something akin to previous Thief games where I would be required to loot a certain percentage of the level’s treasures. Unfortunately, the new challenge system no longer requires that you meet specific requirements to complete a level. Instead, you receive bonuses for meeting certain criteria like “avoid detection” and “knock out X enemies”. The only overall requirement the game seemed to impose, even at the highest difficulty, was “don’t kill or knock out civilians”. So basically you can just zip through levels and avoid collecting any treasure if you want (not very thief-like!) Most of the upgrades are pretty useless for stealth playthroughs too as well as most of the arrows and tools.Towards the end of the game I kind of stopped caring about looting places and picking pockets because, to me, the whole game started playing more like an action-fest than what Thief is supposed to be. Even exploring the hub areas for secrets and treasures is soured by the requirement of buying expensive rope arrows, only to find out that the loot you uncover barely covers the initial cost. This is essentially punishing the player for exploring levels, and a huge no-no for making a Thief game. The collectables system doesn’t even pay out until you’ve completed a set, further forcing the player into unnecessary debt from spending arrows to reach secret areas. The whiney female sidekick dream sequence levels didn’t do much to improve my mood either and probably could have been handled way better. Additionally, they decided that adding boss battles to Thief would be a good idea (it isn't).Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of previous Thief games. If you’re completely new to the series, you probably won’t care and it’ll be another barely-memorable action game to you. Thief’s only saving grace is that it wasn’t AS bad of a game to its series as Absolution was to Hitman, but man, it’s not very far behind either.			"

												As an original Thief series fan, I find it difficult to enjoy this new installment:1. Opaque, over-used, slow-to-open, worse-than-loading-bar windows are the real plague.2. None of that stop its texture pop-in, especially in zoomed view, it's high-res for sure but not seemless.3. This is not the same Garrett, and arguably a less intriguing character.Maybe Thief is trying to find new root in the Stealth genre (seems to be taking a lot of cue from Hitman, another SE product), but the little I played of it didn't seem promising.

												I'm a hard core THIEF fan, I was there when THIEF 1 hit the shelves, addicted ever since.  A complete THIEF outfit & blackjack, a real nut job over this game. I too was drooling when Theif 4 was on the horizon, but put it off till after I began reading the reviews...  Still, I bought it far later when it was on super-duper sale ($8 bucks).   So lets get to the facts that whatever you heard about this game is true: 1. THIEF 4  is an artificial soybean byproduct colored & shaped to look like the original Franchise game.  (ie: lacking)2. They did get alot of things right~such as great graphics and interesting storyline + grappling hook for climbing.3. However, they simply got far too many things wrong ~ annoyingly wrong - to the point gamers wonder if the developers even bothered testing a play-through before release.  In reality, they could have fixed some outrageously annoying bugs after-the-fact with a simple update: but did not.  So why is it there is so much UTTER HATE for this beautiful game that had such a loyal following  ?   well...3.a: Even if you never played THIEF before, you will wonder why they designed EVERY window entry as ""Carpel Tunnel Syndrome"" with animation ??? this was one of their top idiotic moves.  Imagine having a severe repetition compulsive disorder every time you had to open a door EVERY DOOR (but a window instead) = now you understand.  (tap key 10 times EVERY time= omg, omg omg.. stop omg why did they design it this way?... omg !)3.b: THIEF 4 has the most Frustrating map design system you will ever experience (seriously) its so aggravating to try to find your way around that you just give up.. thats right... just say ""screw this!"" and give up, because the place you need to get to is only a few feet away, the map flag shows it as such, but you CANNOT find a way to get to it... its flabergasting that ANYONE let alone a game developer would design such a wonky broken map.   3.c:  Do you get lost often playing THIEF 4 ?  you're not alone, it's because the mini-maps links to mini-mini-maps- even loading for a single (yes ONE TINY ROOM = mini-mini-mini map)  its so annoying that it saps the fun out of the game, your life and your own existance (its that aggravating).3.d: Forced play cut-scenes: ?  Developers, you DO NOT force people to PLAY through cutscenes where you can die and have to do so 10 - 20 times forced to watch the same damn animation over and over and over again until they either get it right (or) trash their console with a nearby broken chair leg!  The lead developer of THEIF 4 should go hide in a cave in the deepest reaches of Nepal ~ his name forever shunned.4. Garrett already had a back story ~ as the unsung hero that faded into the shadows, sacraficing far more than he had ever swiped:   Now, Garrett is but a ... well, just a lowly lame Thief: steal this - steal that - go back to the same place and steal same stuff again - or only find empty LOCKED safes ?  and who keeps relocking the grates ?  and why are there grungy weapon merchants in God forsaken holes in the ground or ruins that makes No sense whatsoever.  Reliving the Asylum and the undercity was a tad unoriginal ~ we really expected more creativity.5. Okay, so done with the rant, the point was there were alot of silly flaws with this game that could have been so easily fixed with an update (but were not for some reason) that would have made the experience alot more fun.  NOTE: forced animation and compulsive disorder on every window entry is a FAIL!  plus; the map design is an inexcusable FAIL FAIL FAIL!   Now considering this is a 20 (yes twenty) gig download and as drooling fans waited 10 years for Thief 4 we expected some meat & potatos, not the knob of a water arrow in the♥♥♥♥♥♥6. (buy it on sale) It was worth the $8, but would not pay retail: and it took 48hrs to download via DSL; replayability ?  maybe for some in Hard Mode, but I won't bother because I NOW HAVE CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME (thanks Eidos)  and would rather not have to take medication due to mental distress from navigating the map over again.OVERVIEW: This was a surprising fail for an Original Series that had such great promise and Loyal Gamer following; I truly hope the Taffers at Eidos Montreal didn't kill off the THIEF franchise with one to many club taps to the skull and  Garrett sulks away forever into the shadows; and hope a New Developer worth their sack of gold will continue his legacy. ...It's a Keeper !

												In MY opinion, Thief was good. I liked the atmosphere and the setting. The gameplay was really fun for me, but could use some improvements. There are side quests, and I feel like there should have been more. The story...yeah, not the greatest, but it's not too complex. Oh and let's not forget the collectibles...I do love me some collectibles!All the hate is from fans of the original games. I understand, reboots sometimes don't work.			"

												Playing as Garrett (master thief), you roam the streets of the goth/steampunk area ""the city"" doing missions, stealing everything in your path while dealing with your amnesia of the past year, conspiracies and finding your friend Erin.Graphics are beautiful with nicely detailed levels. The cinematics/animations could have been more polished but still good. Game levels are full of loot and secret areas, Unfortunately the AI aren't too bright making the levels a lot easier than they should be. If you're looking for a Challenge I'd recommend the custom difficulty feature.Story is interesting in the beginning but feels a bit flat at the end.Overall opinion/score: I loved the graphics and gameplay but the story and characters... could have been fleshed out, not to mention the ending... Still had fun playing it though, 7/10.			"

												I do not recommend this game for impatient people. I never got the chance to even finish it because of constant pathing or glitching issues. Finally I just removed it and called it a day. I had no patience to be interrupted in my game play from dev bugs. Even people who did walkthroughs very early on youtube experienced the same thing where a 30 mins recording turned into 6 hours. It doesn't look like a patch was deployed early on to fix these issues either for PC version. Great story and game and was having a lot fo fun with it until a another bug came to it's surface. If you want to play it and have patience through it's bugs, it's great.			"

												not a bad game at all, but for some reason wasn't as good as the first for me, probably because i didn't explore the open world and NPC mechanics much because i was in a hurry to get the game over with.But Thief3 for me was one of the best games I ever played, because it's story and game play gripped me by the bones. didn't hapen with this one, maybe simply the story isn't that good. maybe i'm just getting old.

												This game made me take a break from PC gaming.After watching my other beloved stealth series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, turn to hell, I was desperately wishing the same wasn't true for Thief. I desperately wanted to play this game and find out that all the negative reviews were inaccurate, and that the few positive reviews that claimed all the haters were just playing on the easy difficulty. I desperately wanted to believe that cranking up all the difficulty settings and removing all the visual aids would actually matter. But everything the haters said came to be the truth. In a great stealth game, patience is essential for perfection and spending 3 hours on one mission is completely acceptable if it leads to that 100% stealth rating. In a great stealth game, like the older Thiefs or Splinter Cell 1-4, the more slow and careful I am, the more fun I am having and the more immersed I am. In this game, the longer you take, the more ugly flaws you realize in the mission design and it kills the stealth experience. Guards are literally on a non-stop patrol loop, repeating the exact same actions and phrases over and over without ever throwing something new at you. Everything looks and sounds great at first glance, the lighting is undeniabely good, but at a closer look it is never that impressive. How can a master thief like Garrett not be able to do anything about a store that is ""closed""? A ""closed"" sign should be a signal that I can go inside and steal stuff, but not in this game. The only places that are accessible have a great big orb shining on them so you'll have no problem finding where to go. It is horrible level design. I wanted to get immersed into this game with my ridiculously powerful PC but I was never able to, and because there are no good stealth titles coming anytime soon, I decided to sell my rig and take a break from gaming. All because of this garbage modern rehash of a legendary stealth series, just like what happened to Splinter Cell. It should be a crime for these AAA developers to make sh***ty games, put a coat of fancy graphics on, and than slap on the name of a legendary series just to trick people into buying!!!! Maybe one day they will get it right...			"

												Before I get to what I didn’t like, I suppose I should get to what I thought was alright about this reboot. Visually speaking, it sports a solid look—from the environments to the characters, lighting, shadows, and art style. That’s not to say that it holds up in every regard visually; a lot of people don’t like Garrett’s redesign with a common complaint being his black eye liner making him look “emo,” but it’s not that hard to overlook if you don’t get caught up on it and you could even come to view it as something that makes sense given his chosen profession. The change of voice actor also didn’t really bother me, which is another hangup some people have when comparing it to its predecessors—other voices are either good or mediocre.Of course, the audiovisual side of things is less important than the gameplay, and in that regard I found Thief to be underwhelming but (mostly) competent–from the mission design, to the sneaking mechanics, pacing, level design, etc. Unfortunately, a lot of what’s good about the game gets bogged down by various annoyances which include:— Lots of repetitive forced animations. Grabbing loot, opening drawers and cabinets (many of which are empty and just waste your time), opening windows, enemy takedowns, etc. There’s also a long animation of Garrett moving a wooden beam out of his way that they reuse way too many times—sometimes they want you to mash X to move it and sometimes they don’t, although unlike the windows (more on those below) these are always used to section off map areas within a map or serve as a transition to a new area.— There’s no indication as to whether or not a window leads to a lootable room within the map you’re in, or if it’s a transition to another area until after you’ve already initiated the animation; if you get the prompt to tap X it’s a lootable room, if you don’t it’s a map transition.— I don’t believe the glow on rooms that strictly serve as loot locations goes away after you’ve cleared them and left, so you might end up going back into an empty room at some point if you don’t remember all of the places you’ve been.— Somewhat clunky, limited movement. The context sensitive run/jump/mantle function screws up sometimes. There are areas you should be able to get to but can’t because the rope arrows only work at specific points. I understand the need to keep you caged to some extent, but there were times where I felt my options where limited when they shouldn’t have been.— Cutscene direction and dialog was a bit stilted, the story felt like it wasn’t fully realized and the ending was kind of a mess. The only thing notable about the “Thief-taker General” is his massive bald spot and his penchant for being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ other than that he was just a one-dimensional filler character that never amounted to much and got too much screen time.— Awful audio mixing; sounds cut off abruptly instead of fading in and out and there are inconsistencies in how loud some sounds are compared to others.—I understand it’s a reboot and they want to do their own thing, but I wish they had kept the Order of the Hammer in as a prominent backstory element. They only ever really indirectly refer to the Hammerites when they reference “The Old Gods” and with the brief appearance of the hammer symbolism in a specific area later in the game, outside of that it’s pretty much been taken out of the lore.— Lastly, and perhaps most egregiously; the guards don’t indiscriminately call people taffers.I don’t have much attachment to the original games but this one still managed to disappoint me in various ways; however, with all that being said I didn’t necessarily dislike it, it just has some glaring faults and questionable design decisions which left me feeling like it was largely wasted potential—unfinished and average in nearly every way.

Posted: February 25, 2014
												Just a quick first impressions of the game so far. I'm one of the people who thought this just looks like a reskinned version of Dishonored (and I don't know if they've changed anything visually since then because it no longer does look like that to me) but so far I'm happy to say it is its own game overall. (review is a bit lengthy... sorry, I tried to clean it up a bit and categorize things.tl;dr: if you want a purely stealth game with minimal combat and story elements, you may like this. If you're looking for anymore than that skip this game or wait for a price drop)Visuals/animationVisually, it's pretty fantastic and I don't have all the settings maxed out. Models and animations are very well done as well from what I can tell (random NPC animations aren't the best but whatever, they're not that important). I just wish I could play it in third person due to the character movement being really annoying (there's a lot of bobbing, too much for me). Almost all textures on max settings look great. You might run into some blurry or muddy ones but they are quite rare.The one thing that is a bit annoying to me is the character movement. Whenever you walk forward the camera zooms in a bit, when you stop, the camera zooms back out. Same with all directions, it gets annoying. It has WAY too much of a ""bobbing"" effect and I absolutely hate this about the movement system and the reason I wish I could just play in third person.I've now gotten to a point in the game where it goes into third person for some wall climbing/scaling sections. Animations look great, camera however... it kind of swings wildly. It's very hard to control and doesn't let you view much yourself, you're better off just letting it automatically show you the way to go.Story/gameplayIt seems to have some supernatural elements to it like Dishonored did and the story also seems to be pretty similar to Dishonored's so far. The ""gloom"" is a sickness and people are quarantined, just like the plague in Dishonored, everyone tries to avoid these people and they're treated quite harshly. The most obvious similarity to Dishonored is probably the ""focus"" vision that highlights all interactables, traps, loot, etc... This has FAR more atmosphere than Dishonored in my opinion though but unlike Dishonored I haven't run into any memorable characters (yet). They all seem pretty bland and unimportant.It has also been a bit hard to tell where you can jump and where you'll just fall to your death. Sometimes the game prevents you from walking off of ledges and sometimes the game doesn't. When it doesn't prevent you from walking off you can die or get seriously injured (kind of a minor nitpicky thing but I thought I should mention it. Also, not being able to jump AT ALL outside of predetermined locations feels a bit awkward). I wish this was more consistent.Checkpoints/autosaves seem pretty scarce so make sure you quicksave (F5 by default) often, you can go through an entire mission, instantly die to a trap and start all the way from the beginning again.The QTE events are a bit annoying to be honest... I don't feel like mashing 'E' to open windows every time. I found three of them in a pretty short distance so to have to do that gets tedious and annoying.The missions for me seemed very slow going and I'm struggling to continue playing because of that and the fact that I don't know WHY I'm playing. I feel like I'm just going around stealing crap for no good reason. Yeah I'm a Thief but what is my purpose, just survive? Why am I doing this? The game has yet to tell me. I'm assuming/hoping this will change in the future.Stealth, what can I say? It's nothing special. It works. It seems fair. There's nothing ""bad"" about the stealth mechanics, they seem pretty solid. I kind of wish I could see the line of sight for enemies or have some way of telling who is going to freak out when they see me (civillians sometimes freak out and start yelling, but some don't... there doesn't seem to be a way to tell who's who).Audio/musicOne small annoyance is that some of the music is very poorly implemented. Out of no where some weird, loud, techno/dubstep/electronic sounding music started playing and I had no idea what was going on since right before that started there was very soft ambient sounds and music. There was no action and I wasn't spotted or anything. It felt very out of place. I'm considering turning off the music entirely, it was jarring and unnecessary.Another very minor annoyance is that the audio seems to travel through walls unobstructed. There's no sense of distance between you and the characters speaking. This makes it kind of hard to pinpoint where people are by sound because they might sound like they're right next to you when in reality they might be outside of the building or several floors above/below you. They really need to work on this.The rest of the audio like the voice acting and ambience is very good. Especially the voice acting (lip syncing and facial expressions kind of let down the quality of the voice acting since those aren't too great, especially for random NPCs. It's a bit weird hearing someone moan in pain or complain but their face is not doing anything to express that). Sometimes there isn't even any lip syncing at all just a blank face for random NPCs, this is really disappointing to me.I've run into several audio bugs now, NPCs constantly repeating lines and getting cut off. And there is little to no variety in the random chatter. You might hear the NPCs say the same exact thing three times in a row, or every single time. It gets annoying since it doesn't add anything to the game at that point.Quality of the PC portThe PC port is great, probably one of the best. It has all of the options you would want and then some (I just wish you could disable the bobbing). Menus are great, you can navigate with your mouse, press escape to go back to the previous menu, pretty much everything you would want in terms of functionality for menus. All keys are rebindable, lots of options for toggling on/off UI elements, so that's great.The ability to have custom difficulties is absolutely fantastic for the people who really want to control every little aspect of the game. You can play it as hardcore as you want or as easy as you want.Overall thoughtsThe game is very slow paced and not action oriented at all. Do not expect this to be like Dishonored in terms of gameplay. Combat is terrible, however, I think they only added in combat to give you SOME option of survival rather than immediately losing when you get spotted. It's almost a 100% stealth based game which means it can be very very slow paced. If you are looking for action and combat, this is definitely not the game you want.The game can also be very linear (and I feel like there might be a lot of back tracking if you want to get all the stuff). The first few missions and areas there are several places you can't go and items you can't get because you don't have the tools. You buy those a bit later, then you have access to certain passages.The game kind of pushes you in the direction they want you to go while having the illusion that it's much more open. Not necessarily a bad thing and it's not extreme linearity but it's still a bit disappointing. Definitely not like Assassin's Creed and probably not even like Dishonored in most cases, it's a bit more linear than the latter.Mixed feelings about it but I am only a few hours into the game. If you are heavily into stealth based gameplay and NOT into combat, I think you will enjoy this game. There aren't many other games out there that cater to this genre.			"

												I ended up having to borrow a copy from a friend + finish this on a console - it's terribly formatted for PC and prone to crashing - even on above recc'd settings. 8) 8) 8)I was looking forward to this game when it came out, I wanted to be optimistic about a continuation of the Thief series. The setting, the characters, the story - it was a really fun little universe and I missed having a pure stealth game to play with the kind of open, sprawling levels and dark corners you could hide in while you listened to guards and NPCs gossip and♥♥♥♥♥♥ There really wasn't any of that in this game? There are *improvements* to the detection system and some neat little gimmicks like swooping (moving quickly from one corner to the next to try and avoid being seen), but movement in general is limited and clunky. It's hard to distinguish what you can and cannot climb on initially, and once you realize what you're able to mantle up on ... it's a bit disheartening, to say the least. You cannot jump (a LOT of puzzles and simple obstacles could easily be avoided if the player could jump over them), you cannot place rope arrows in areas that would be practical, etc. Not all doors, windows, etc are accessible when you're in the City.It's a minor nitpick but I also cannot stand how clunky combat is should you actually end up in a situation where you are detected. I realize the justification behind it is ~Garrett doesn't fight / kill~ and ~you should try to ghost this game~ but ffs, you really do need to smooth out combat just a little so you can properly defend yourself enough to back out of a fight if you want to encourage your players to be nonlethal. There are other ways to motivate a player to try a ghosting / nonlethal route, annnd this is not really the way to go about it tbh.The City and levels are pretty much barren via a plague plot device and it's depressing - and not in a good way. NPC types are severely limited, lowering any challenge you could have in planning your approach to each level and client job. The story itself is incredibly short, disjointed, and reaches an unsatisfying conclusion. Levels feel repetitive and dull. I *did* enjoy the shorter client job missions you could pick up optionally from various NPCs throughout the CIty, but even then it didn't feel worthwhile.Framerate issues abound, no matter what your settings are. Cutscenes love to crash and load oddly - animation is awkward despite the use of mocap to try and (I guess?) inject realism into the characters' facial expressions and body movement. Dialogue is unnatural and - again - severely disjointed. From what I understand of the history behind this game, it's no wonder it turned out to be a mess. It's just a shame - really disappointing. It can be fun at times, and I see the potential behind it, but as it stands it's just ... Yeah.I don't really think I can recommend this game to anyone, Thief fan or not. 8(			"

												A game that's painful to play in several ways. It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into Thief, but the end result is so confused and poorly executed that I actually feel sorry for the developers.The game is so linear it's practicaly on-rails. Even that might have been OK if there was something to support this design choice - a great story, perhaps, or thrilling combat. Unfortunately, there isn't. The game is dull, dreary, and depressing to play due to its relentless mediocrity. This really isn't worth your time or money.If you want a great modern stealth game, I instead strongly recommend Splinter Cell: Blacklist or Dishonored.			"

Evidence of console port keeps rearing its ugly head.Lighting and shadow stealth system can be hit or miss e.g. your in pitch black spot and moving a bit one way can light you up somehow.Map system is pathetic, HUD map is almost useless.Action and color palette quickly become monotonous.Lazy, ridiculous, and disappointing ending.

												This game has nothing of the original Thief, which I dearly loved and still do as the best stealth games ever made.The gameplay basics are there, but the excessive linearity of most levels and the consequent lack of freedom left to the player prevents them from reaching the excellence of its venerable predecessors.Finally, the story is in itself asbolutely, cringeworthy terrible - it is poorly written, it is replete with the most shallow tropes of the genre and doesn't fit the character of Garrett at all - without mentioning Garrett's character design itself, which I find completely anachronistic, ill-fitting and poorly motivated.What an incredible let-down, and how much good programming and art wasted.

												So many bad things!----------------------Omg! I don't know what type of budget they had for this game, but MAN! Sid they have a director or anyone that looked over things in this game project!? Hidden coins on large maps as part of treasure collecting... I mean like 1 coin small enough to not notice in the first place and then hidden. Dialogs that makes no sence what so ever AND don't forget the stupid ending with in game cut-scene and then video cut-scene that made no sence between eachother.Overal this game was one of the worts Thief games I ever played. Did the team even know what the other thief game felt like?! The thing I hated the most is the ratings on missions, because they have side quest with things you can do to gain extra point on each level and that clashes with the rating. SO WHY HAVE IT!!! So many many things wrongI would give this a 5/10 BECAUSE! the side quest were good and feelt like thief. The rest of the game was bad and if I rated this game as a game and then sidequest I would give the game 3/10 and Sidequest 8/10. I so regret pre-ordering the game. I took me half a year to just get this game done because it was that bad!			"

												At first glance I was excited about this game. I bought upon release and then uninstalled after about 2 and a half hours of playing, which even after such a short time left quite a grimace on my face until payday when I bought a much more fullfing stealth game. I decided to give it another chance awhile back....never again...I deeply regret paying money for a game that I wasn't expecting much from and still ended up horribly disappointed. Having played and loved the orignal Thief, I was hoping to see a retextured world with a proper physics engine that would allow me to feel more like Garrett than I had in the original. I got none of this, the game does not play well, and it is flat out and simply put...boring.			"

One time is oke, but the other 1000 times just weren't necessary.- AI is not bad, it's simply broken as sh*t. - level design is a bad joke, i died many times cause i thought i could climb dead ends. -.- Maybe it's just because in the old titles there were more than one way to get to your target,but in this game the path is so linear you can't miss it. Well at least if you know that, otherwise you die like me in dead ends.- Characters, yeah well there are none, beside Garrett, which i do remember.- Story funny thing, there was something about a disease or so but well, that's it.Don't buy it. Really - don't do it. Try Dishonored, or the old thief games instead.			"

												Ah Thief. What nostalgic memories of games gone by. That feeling of lonely vast halls, tall-ceiling buildings, creepy abandoned (really?) houses. Those were the first three games.This last Thief is nothing like that.Linear it may be, and frustrating to have to access areas again and again and each time discover those re-spawned npcs. Damn it! And rooms that go nowhere when you're trying to get through to the other side, access points to other parts of the map that let you in but don't let you out so another way has to be found, falling down ladders until you realise on pc it's W+Space. Wha? But still, I enjoyed the game, it looks good, there's still some strategising and some difficult areas that have to be worked out. Characters don't have much dimension and the game felt short and rushed. But all in all, it was a great Christmas present and from my son at that. It's replayable as well.  "

												Thiefs back from a long hibernation to prove its worth, is it any good? Thief is a stealth first-person stealing game set in a alternate steam punk age where poverty is strong and plauge is common, in this mess you play as Garret the master thief from the previous games and you run around stealing expensive things. I found myself loosing interest a bit in to the game and I could never realy get back to playing from where I was so I just left it as it was. This is a very slow paced game that realy tests your patiance, now you could either love this or hate it. As you are a thief, combat is not realy a viable option and as such you often find yourself doing odd choices you wouldn`t do when you have a flame arrow and a gaurd walks pass you such as lerk in a closet way to long just waiting for the gaurd to leave as he never does. Sure it can be very satisfying to sneak pass a dozen gaurds unnoticed but after a while I found myself growing tired of the same exact scheme that I had been pulling the 6 or 7 hours that I had been stealing that being acting passive. Anyways, the visuals are pretty great and there is some nice 3D tessellation going on which of course looks great! The games is I guess OK optimized with weird FPS drops here and there ( tested on R9-290 ) could  definatly need some smoothing out. Hard to recommend this game for everyone based on its extreme stealth elements. Still a great game with lots of atmosphere. I'd say go a little loud with the weaponry to spice things up at least if you cant take the slow gameplay.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original Thief games which are in my top 10 favorite games of all time. So I was worried this new game would not live up to the original. I am about half way thru it and I think it does it justice. In many respects they improved things, such as the graphics, which is to be expected. The sneak aspect is tough in this game like it should be., They leave it optional how you want to power your character up, so he can have an easier time or not, They add some stuff like dogs and birds in cages that can react to your presence, which is great, The voice actors aren't the same but are OK. A problem with this game that the older game did not have is the characters have limited sound bytes so you hear the same dialog a lot. The old games were good about not doing that. The writing isn't as good, but its not bad. It's just that the original games were top notch. As good as Half Life games. This is solid but not quite as powerful. The original games had a creepy feel to them that was actually very effective. You always felt danger was around every corner.I just replayed all of them and they still worked on me. This game doesn't do that quite as well. But it is still very good, regardless, and it is not easy. It also has excellent puzzles and Tomb Raider style climbing skills which it needed. So I would say it's well worth the money and I want more. Thief is an awesome series.			"

Steampunk stealth-action with an idiotic story. I have not played the original ""Thief"", this is my first game I traversed in this series and I can not compare it to its predecessors. The game begins with the fact that Garrett got into the apartment what that drunken man and begins to rob him and idiocy happening immediately catches the eye. Garrett steals from the poor man all, start from spoons and purse and ending with the chandelier. In the beginning it was not annoying, and it looks very interesting thanks to good character animation action. After the protagonist leaves the house of the victim and starting with a story about the history of the master thief and his unlucky pupil. In the course of the prologue Garrett says very funny phrase Originally posted by Garret: No matter how much you steal, it is important that you steal.In this case just remember the first 5 minutes of the game where the main character stuffing their pockets with junk, just do want to bridle attention to the fact that the main character steals everything that caught his eye, and because of the passage of the locations on the 100% is a very dull and boring. Then begins the exposition of the plot, which at first seems quite intriguing. But the whole affair fades as the story progresses, because he is stupid, predictable and just boring. Rhianna Pratchett unlike her father is unable to come up with something less interesting and memorable. Sometimes it seems that the storyline made ​​only for the sake of what would at least like something to explain the appearance of Garrett on the affine or locations. In a plot full of logical holes, and some things can not be a cynic Garrett intelligible explanation. But unlike the story of the gameplay and the dark atmosphere of the game very well. There is nothing innovative, and the levels are linear and sometimes lose out in terms of design another game from the same devs - DE: HR, but they still have a variety of passing. In Thief can not play as DE: HR or Dishonored killing all in its path, as Garrett is very weak in open battles with guards. Although all the enemies you can just kill with a bow, because the AI ​​is very stupid. Another positive feature of this game is a great implementation of a bow (with a really very convenient and fun to shoot) and a large supply of various arrows, which can help in any given situation. But the city in the game feels empty and dead. Main characters in the game template and uninteresting. In general, if not pay emphasis on story and the stupidity of what is happening, you can get a decent stealth action with a great bow. But if you plan to find here a great steam-punk history that I disappoint you, there is no such.			"

												I spent a lot of time mulling over what can be said about Thief.Unfortunately, nothing in the game is particularly bad, or good. There's very little of anything actually interesting to do or to see.Gameplay is standard 1st person with stealth elements. Hiding in the shadows, breaking into buildings, stealing loot. Picking locks gets repetitive after the 100th time, like most of the content in game you will be repeating over and over. The fun part is plotting your method to break into a building, most of the missions will give you multiple ways to do so.Graphics are fine, but performance is poor. Frame-rates dip when entering new areas. Sometimes characters glitch out and start spinning in a circle or textures take on a strange rainbow-like flashing colours. The city is a gloomy, depressing place and the visuals reflect this very well.Audio is weak. Half of the time, I can't even hear what characters are telling me. The other half, I can hear people through solid walls as if they were stood right next to me. Add to this there isn't any noteworthy music or voice acting.The game is relatively bug-free. Aside from the rare graphical glitches and framerate issue I previously mentioned, I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs during my time playing.In conclusion, it's a very ""meh"" game. Not bad at all, but it fails to impress in any area. If you can pick it up for 50% off, I would recommend it. Again, it's hard to think of anything to say about this game because it manages to straddle the ""average"" line so accurately.			"

												Let me put it very simple: These idiots destroyed the classic! The first biggest and stupidest mistake is to not keep Stephen Russel's voice as Garret. Not even close to good as the first 3 titles that came out. Has good graphics but I think it still lacks a lot for today's tecnology. This Garrett acts and sounds like a sissy imbecile. Very different from the original Thief series.  Didn't like it! I have played the first 3 a several times and will play more in the future as they are a master-piece. This game is NOT Thief, it is Teef or something else.			"

												This game is not Thief, it's nothing but a brew of concepts from all Thief Series, mixing it with Assassin's Creed, Dishonoured to try and pull a massive base of console game players. The game is totally dumbed down.  If you though the voice actor sage was an issue, that's considered minor now. I played the previous Thief Games, I finished them a few times. WEAK POINTS-Firstly this game was totally bugged out running 64 bit version, extremely choppy and very slow gameplay, This was solved a few days later buy running the 32 bit version of game. -The level design is very linear, very simple, (no longer can you roam freely) No more big size levels, with great detail like the old series games. (it's like the Thief version of Call of Duty)-Their are no more hammers, keepers, so much lost. -Their is no atmosphere. -The Character can not jump (bizzare!), the AI and enemy are not up to the standard as before. -The Character sneaks too slow and moves too quickly this destroys the gameplay. You would never want to press the sneak button. -The Audio gameplay is basically gone ( walking on tiles, carpet, rock isn't as sensestive as before)-The story is just weak. -This is probably one of the worst game's I've played. nothing memorable about it. -PROS-Graphics seems good (but everthing else is a totally failure)Totally regret buying this game, even if it you get it on sale, it will just be a waste of your time. I think that's the end of Thief Series.Don't give your money to Edios for this. Edios have turned in snake oil sales men, selling you inferior products, created by bunch of game developers have NO  IDEA! how to create a Thief Game.I still can't fadaom how such a studio can can screw up the Thief Series, one best series every released on the PC turned into the worst increment in living history. I want my money back! I paided 50 dollars based on repuation of the other three games, what I got what was not a THIEF game or a successor. But a generic, boring, dumbed down, cut scene, half game, hold your hand type of game, that would bore any serious gamer.			"

												Growing up, the Thief games were some of my favourite. Even today I still hold them close to my heart. From the distant call of the Horn of Quintus,  to the ambient terror of the Shalebridge Cradle and everything in between, there was never a dull moment. It was a magical feeling that I rarely got with other games, that within minutes of loading the game I would be hooked for hours. So upon hearing the announcement in 2009 of 'Thi4f,' naturally I was extremely excited. So I waited...and waited...and waited.Then came the announcement that broke the hearts of many a diehard Thief fan. Stephen Russell (the voice of the original Garrett) would not be returning. It was like being 5 years old and having your favourite teddy bear torn apart in front of you. Yet I still held somewhat high hopes for the game.This hope was short lived. I bought the game, and loaded it up. The Hammers that I had grown to hate, yet love were gone. The Trickster and Builder were non-existant, the Pagans and Keepers all but vanished.I didn't even hear a single mention of the word taffer.That magical feeling I got with the original trilogy was no longer there. Thief was no longer Thief. After 3 hours of playing, I knew this wasn't the game that I'd grown to love as a young'n. Saddened, I put the game back on its digital shelf, where to this day it gathers e-dust.TL;DR, diehard Thief fan becomes saddened upon playing this taffin' piece of non-canonical nonsense. "

												I wanted this game to be good.  Thief games are smart titles, a welcome breath of fresh air in the din of shooters and roguelikes.  Alas.  It's not just that it fails to meet expectations for a Thief-lover, it's that the game itself is littered with so many problems and poor choices that it fails to even be a great game- Thief entry or no.This game is, in a word, inconsistant.  There are great things here, but there aren't enough of them to counteract all the terrible, annoying, broken crap.  For every one good thing there's about ten bad ones weighing it down.  If you didn't preorder this game, there's really no reason to pick it up unless you are a diehard stealth gamer, and even then trust me, wait for a sale. As to fellow Thief fans, well, I am sorry this is the game we were all waiting for for so long, because not only is it easily the weakest entry in the series, it wipes away all the canon we came to love, and it ruins a beloved game character that didn't need reinventing.  In short, this is not a Thief game, nor is it a particularly good game.--absolutely insulting choices made by the dev team to constrict player freedom at nearly every turn.  This studio clearly has control issues if they don't want the players to jump or mantle on just any surface.  This game felt like someone was telling me what to do and limiting my approaches at every turn.--Levels are nothing to write home about but they work.--AI can be a challenge on master.--the audio is a completely broken mess.--The music goes to some strange places.  I could've done without the dubstep wobbles, but I like that they aren't going with straight orchestral.  The originals had a disctintly odd dark D&B thing going on that I always liked, so at least there's some throwback.--The NPC's are some of the worst in any game in history.  Forgettable, cookie cutter, constantly raving and yelling, always saying the same phrases over and over in very close bursts.  Super annoying.--Garrett.  They got Garrett so, so wrong.  I can not put into words how disappointing this is.--The story is weak and superficial.  None of the characters feel real, and I don't feel for any of them.  They don't seem like people, they seem like fictions in a made up world to serve the story.  It's the most unfortunate thing about the game IMO.  Even when things start to happen in the city it all feels very contrived and forced, I never once felt immersed in the story to the point that I forgot I was playing a video game- with the exception of some moments in Moira, which stands out as the best mission in the game.  Anyone who says the Thief games aren't about narrative haven't played them.  A single mission from the originals has more depth of content than this entire reboot.--Start a mission with a cutscene, play the mission, watch a cutscene, mission over.  It's not so far from the original thief model, it's just that the cutscenes are poorly done.  they are trying to be hollywood or something, i dunno.  it's not well done.--There are boss battles.  Someone please tell Eidos Montreal that there do not need to be boss battles in their games if they write them well and design the levels well.  It didn't work in DX:HR and it certainly doesn't work here.--The main city hub has got to be one of the most irritating things in any game in recent memory.  They should have cut the hub system from the game entirely and just made good missions.  It didn't work in T3.  In fact T3 suffered from a hub system that is fragmented and difficult to navigate.  That was a BAD thing about T3, why they saw fit not only to emulate it but to expand it and make it worse is beyond all reason and logic.--Some of the side missions show promise, but they are short.--The stealth system is servicable, but the loot placement is ridiculous and opening drawers gets old real fast.--I will play through one more time without custom master.  I may have crippled the game with not using the new items and focus.  (Not playing with focus the first time through did get a little frustrating when you can't jump over pressure plate traps, but have to look around for a single brick switch or something.){mild spoilers follow]I couldn't help but notice these things:--garret's hand gets injured and it's wrapped up for the rest of the game (bioshock infinite)--there's a plague infecting a city that is on its last legs (dishonored)--there's no jump button and the contextual edges that the gamer can jump on are painted white (tomb raider)--there's QTE's to mash a button to open things and to relocate from area to area (tomb raider, other games)--there'a  couple parkour-style sequences where you hold down sprint and hit space to vault (mirror's edge)--there's a ""hold button to observe"" hotkey (bioshock infinite, other games) (i despise this trend)--there's a third person climbing system (ala splinter cell blacklist/tomb raider) but it only appears a few times			"

												I enjoyed this new Thief, but the paranormal stuff about halfway through made the game less and less enjoyable. I'm going to sum some things up again, so here we go:+ Realism is great and can be very tense.+ Stealth works great.+ Graphics are gorgeous.+ Plenty of content; collectibles, secrets, sidemissions, jobs, story missions.+/- Lots of upgrades could've been more interesting. Plus, I didn't feel like traveling through 5 seperate maps just to upgrade my gear and character.- Paranormal activities halfway through the story.- I don't think I've used that many arrows, except near the end of the game. They are a bit useless.- Seperate maps instead of using one big city; frequent loading times = annoying. I have no idea why they chose to do it like this.- Routes aren't always obvious. It took me tens of minutes to find an entry point sometimes. Very time consuming.- Jumping is context-sensitive but doesn't always work properly. Many times I fell to my death or the jump didn't register properly.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												I usually only write long reviews when I give a game a thumbs down.Reviews like this only come when I did not enjoy a game.Now theif was a game that I thought was really interesting and when I started playing, it was a lot of fun going into stores and looting things. In fact, looting and stealing is what makes the game fun, however the fact you're stealing silverware and mostly small trinkets here and there that happen to be made of precious metals just isn't that fun.I haven't played the previous game in the series, and though this game is supposed to focus on stealth, I found that the clunky controls and plenty of load times in between places and areas made the game a chore to play. Perhaps most people like this game but I did not enjoy it for various reasons including the optimization and game play style.Thumbs down from me.			"

												I guess I should not be playing this just after finishing my second run through of Dishonored 2.PROS: Graphics are really good. Music / cut scenes not really that bad. The abundance of arrows and types make for decent game play.CONS: Everything else. You can only climb in certain areas, and only when you approach it correctly. You can only jump accross certain places, only when you approach it at the correct spot. They advise you to stay to the roof tops when moving about the city, which would work, if you could actually stay there. You spend less than 1/2 you're time on roof tops. The working you're way through areas where it has caved in and only just a bit of space to get through, pretty cool the first couple times, really old after that. They could have tried for something else to get from one area to the next. Getting to areas, you only get access to specific areas when you reach certain chapters. Making some of the side quests unacheivable because you are not on that chapter. Unnecessary runnning around just to get to the next transition. (i.e. Chap 7 where you end up within visual distance of a switch to call a elevator but can't get to it without going all the way around. You could easiliy climb down, walk accross the exposed rock and climb up the other side, but you can't climb at that spot. You HAVE to work you're way around and through guards to get there.)I could go on but I won't. I'm done with this game for now, Got other games to play and may return to Thief later this year. For now, definately a thumbs down.			"

The core characters, including the protagonist, are all unlikeable and frequently behave inexplicably.  The quiet antihero of the original games turned into a chatty jackass.Dishonored is a better Thief reboot than this is.

												I finished Thief as the sun set, left my apartment for a walk to stretch my plague shrivelled toes. Emerging from that dark world, I reflected on the deceit of Orion, the moral quandries of our nobal thief, the cries of terror and hollow moans of a city squeezed by the plague, and the stench of rats and fecal matter in the streets. I eyed the windows I passed, assessing each based on ease of entry and likelihood of occupants, unconciously feeling for the crowbar at my hip. Total play-time: 18 hours.Thief is set in a dark world, bridging stealth gameplay with linear horror elements. The ambience was great, once you get into it. Sad to say the first 10 hours of gameplay was spread out over a number of months, as I just couldn't really get into it very quickly.Gameplay: 5/10The controls are all over the map. And the map is a murky labyrinth at best. I almost quit playing because I couldn't figure out how to drop off a dangling rope. Turns out there is a seperate key for that.Once I became comfortable with it the game became much more enjoyable, but it takes a while.A/V: 8/10Ambiance, thy name is Thief. Excellent enivronments, albeit slightly linear, but that's ok because not every game released these days is obligated to be open-world survival. The architecture and attention to detail was great. The background noises and sounds drifting through the city were haunting. The music got old after a while, so I turned it off and was still immersed by the sounds of the city.Dialogue/Storyline: 5/10The dialogue was sub-par, but the overall storyline was quite interesting. Nothing is really explained in detail as most of the characters don't mince words much, so there are some intuitive leaps in the story. Most of your journey will take place alone in the dark, if you're not prepared for that then go play Nekopara or something. You really get a sense of  stoic pessimism from most of the characters that sits quite naturally in their bleak world.Overall: 18/30I love horror games, and I do enjoy stealth, so this one was uniquely catered to my tastes. That being said I can't recommend it for everyone. If you do give it a shot, give it some time, keep it on the backburner as it moves pretty slow at times.			"

												Fascinatingly bad. I made it through thirteen hours before having to bail as I just couldn't take any more.There is no fun to be had in this game. Not a single bit. No satisfaction to be gained, no immersion to accumulate, nothing worth experiencing. Joyless. Dead.It's interesting because it's a high-profile game. A lot of work has gone into it. I think it's an excellent example of what what's wrong with major title game development. This is product. It's not art, it's not designed to make a statement -- it's designed to be as bland and marketable as possible. It is completely generic. It might as well be called ""Action Video Game"". There isn't anything you won't have seen before many times -- it feels like took as many bits from other popular games as they could and shoved them into a machine which mushed them together and sucked all the individuality and interest out of them.Let's cover the good things first, because there aren't many. It looks nice. The Unreal engine is very competently implemented, and the Mac port which I played has many thoughtful little features (like disabling notifications).That is it. There is nothing else I say to compliment this game.The original Thief: The Dark Project is one of my all time favourite games. So much fun. Sure, it had its flaws but it was bursting with life, with personality. So much thought and care had gone into it. It was completely immersive, kinda hard and a privilege to play. It's safe to say that nothing of the original has survived.You reprise the role of Garrett: Master Thief, but you'll tire of him pretty quickly. Before, he was a likable scoundrel, a master of his craft. The sort of guy who'd sneak an apple off from the table by a guard and slink off munching it. New Garrett is insufferably banal - he'd have been much better as a silent protagonist because every time I heard him I mentally disassocaited myself. And the master thief? He's now spends his time rummaging through hovels stealing mugs and scissors from poor people. Oh good, I found a bracelet in a drain. I stole a pair of scissors from squalid flat. This goblet that the beggar sitting opposite can't even be bothered with? I'll have that. It all goes into the enormous invisible bag of loot I'm presumably lugging along with me, full of hand mirrors and picture frames. You don't even get to fence them, they turn into cash instantly. Forget eyes on the prize, Garret's going for candlesticks now.They've tried to make him into Batman, but didn't take on board that the main appeal of playing as Batman is that YOU GET TO BE BATMAN. Garrett is not Batman, no matter how gruff he is or how many time he reminds you that he's wearing leather (he will do that a lot).The game combines elements from other popular titles such as Dishonoured, Batman, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider & Mirror's Edge resulting in something not nearly as good as any of them.At every turn this game gives the impression that the makes had an incredibly strict script they want the player to follow. You will do this thing, now you will do this. Now you will go here. Now you will jump. Now you will climb a rope. Now you will think this thing. There's no sense of free will. There's no fun. It's horrible. Bad level design, terrible writing/story, awful acting, banal main character, frustrating gameplay, 0/10 avoid like the plague.			"

												I really don't understand why all the hate of this game... I really don't. I personally enjoyed every aspect so far of the game I've played. First-person prespestive, seeing your hands in front of you, and if you look down, you see your feet. This adds a sort of atmosphere for me that I highly enjoy. It's worth the buy, especially now being on sale. Make your own opinion, I almost didn't get it because of all the hatred I've been reading. I decided to try it out, and I'm happy that I did. It's a worthy play.			"

												This game is no way closer similar to any thief before. The one before were great, immersive, tricky, of course. But this one is just pushing it quite far in my opinion.I've made it to chapter 2 and am completly clueless about the puzzle (The stairs turning..) I am not one to check online tutorials and after multiple hours of going back and forth at the search of a clue were not giving any success. You get to have some naked action in the second chapter and hell, if I could figure out this chapter's puzzle, I'd probably still have fun but anyway.The sneaking system is pretty lacking, I've made a whole lot of playing in the first two chapters and the ennemies seems to ""know"" where you are even when the noise was on the other side. For example, throw a bottle on one side of a door, hide behind said door. Guard turns up towards me instead of the side of the door where the noise was from. The crows are terribly annoying, just standing there and quacking the very second you ""dash"" alright, walking can make it easier. But not when there's a dozen guards around that one candle you want to extinguish to proceed. I am not an expert then again so I can't complain.Will probably update once I get back to it, but for now I wouldn't recommend it to ""casual"" players. I'm good with puzzles but that one is literally making me clueless.			"

												The Thief series is one that's been near and dear to my heart as one of my most favorite franchises.  I still remember when the first Thief came out, it blew me away.  And then Thief 2 upped the bar.  Thief 3 had one of the scariest gaming experiences ever and it carried the franchise forward.  Thief 4 took years to come to fruition and the fan base was so eager to see the fourth installment.  When it finally did get released, excitement turned to disappointment as the game didn't meet the standards set by its predecessors.  Keep in mind, open-world games like Skyrim (which was released in 2011; Thief 4 was released in 2014) were embracing giving the gamer ultimate freedom.  Meanwhile, Thief 4 boxed the gamer into small ""cells"", giving more a feeling of a chlostrophobic Assassin's Creed than what we were accustomed to with Thief.  The developers shot themselves in the foot by giving us a restrictive, linear, consolitis let-down.  Now don't get me wrong, the game mechanics were enjoyable, but the knowledge that you're moving from tiny cell to tiny cell ruined the gameplay for me; that and the linear way the levels were designed.  It was disappointing, because Thief 4 should've been so much more.  I envision a world of Thief 4, much like Skyrim, a huge world where a thief could thrive and gain limitless wealth.  I hate to keep comparing Thief 4 to Skyrim, but if you look at the thief aspects available in Skyrim, it's what Thief 4 should've been.  Thief 4 is the first in the series I didn't complete, because of its flaws.  Nowadays, I get my fix with Skyrim, because it simply does everything better than Thief 4.  I still love the Thief franchise and I have high hopes that a lesson was learned and that the developers scrap the restrictive aspect of Thief and go for open world awesomeness.  It is possible, as evidenced by Skyrim.  That's what Thief players want, a large unrestricted and open world to explore, missions to complete and a game worthy of the franchise.  I can't recommend Thief 4.  Instead, I suggest you check out Thief 2 and 3, both of which should put you in the right frame of mind for the franchise.  Then, if you're still left wanting, go be a thief in Skyrim and enjoy a massive game world with gravy loot.			"

												I finished the game. As most people know I am a big fan of this franchise. Rather than doing a normal review, while playing the game I kept notes of the thoughts that occurred to me, and thought I'd share them for those who've been asking me what I think of the game.• No taffers, no Hammerites, no Keepers, no Pagans. No mention of the builder, one mention of the trickster in passing. The ""rich vs poor"" meme is not a good substitute. UPDATE: there is one reference to the Hammerites at the end.• This is not Garrett. Different voice, different face, different clothes, different personality. Same name.• Looting is fun• Sneaking mechanics are pretty solid, they fixed issues from previous games where guards never looked up and where you were always invisible in doorways. However it is annoying sometimes, you'll be sitting still they won't see you, but then they start ""seeing"" you more, and suddenly shout out ""IS THAT SOMETHING MOVING?""• Graphics are fine. Very good performance.• No distinction is made between killing and knocking out??  There are no blackjacks, you sneak up behind someone and press an action key to perform a melee takedown.• Contextual controls are dumb. I'll decide when I want to jump, thanks.• The paintings are pretty... interesting.• I missed the old thief-style cutscenes• Lockpicking minigames are terrible in all games, this one is less terrible than others.• The city in this game is better than the one in Deadly Shadows, and I like the sidequests.• Rope arrows are limited to only specific anchor points, they seem to disappear when you reload the zone and the arrows cannot be retrieved.• Much of the humor and personality of the city is gone. The humor that does exist isn't nearly as funny or clever.• No more crate stacking, and no jumping• Hate the name, we already had a Thief. This is Thief 4.• The city lost a lot of the steampunk vibe.• I enjoy the rooftop navigation, but wish there were fewer loadscreens.• Windows are annoying. You have to go through a button mashing process to open one to get into a house, then the window immediately closes and you have to do it again to get back out. It quickly becomes tedious.• The asylum seems like a less-scary ripoff of The Shalesbridge Cradle.• If a guard sees something has changed, like a door open on their patrol route, he will investigate. This is great. I also noticed on occasion they will investigate every time they pass that open door. If the room is fairly big this can mean you add a significant delay to their patrol, which is strategically interesting, if not particularly smart AI.• On the hardest difficulty, when playing passively, Thief is more difficult than Dishonored.• Some fun puzzles for getting to loot• Why is Garrett collecting a  bunch of crap in his home now instead of selling it?• Be very careful about hiding in wardrobes as it forces the game to quicksave.• It seems like the new developers only played Deadly Shadows• The story was mostly an incoherent mix of cliches, and ends unsatisfactorily.• The Thief-Taker General is pretty ridiculous.The game is not horrible, but given the source material and what it could have been, it is very disappointing. If you want a true Thief expierience, Thief 2 and 1 (Gold) are still perfectly playable, and still the best games ever made.			"

												This is a qualified recommendation. 1) Only buy it when it' on sale, like 75% off. It's hard to complain when you get a game at such a low price.2) The criticisms of the game are valid, such as: 	a) The maps are small, a limitation carried over from the console versions.	b) The story seems unfinished, in particular the abrupt and inexplicable ending.	c) You can only jump, climb and use rope arrows at designated locations. In other words, it feels constrained.3) If you play the main story and scour the maps for loot, you'll get about 20 hours of gameplay. Side missions could add several more hours.4) The one redeemable aspect is the high quality graphics. This game looks great on an Nvidia GTX 970. The graphics contribute to the atmosphere of the game.5) I suggest that you put aside any comparison to the previous Thief games, and play it with the eyes of a new player.Now, comparing Thief with Dishonored, Dishonored is definitely a better game. However, Thief is still, mostly, an enjoyable game that's worth $7.49 for 20+ hours of gameplay.			"

												The beautiful thing about these review is that I don't need to be neither objective nor neutral, nor fair. I can simply vent my frustration and anger! This game is a disaster. No other reboot as ever been so unfaithfull to the original thus far. Having played all the previus Thief games and loved all them (yes even deadly shadows to a minor degree) I can hardly believe what they did with number 4.This game is a PARODY of modern gaming. It carefully surgically removes everything that was great about thief and replaces it with all the elements that old schoolers hate about stealth and video games in general nowdays. What possesed Eidos Montreal to develop a game that clearly was meant for Thief fans, carrying it's name, and then disfiguring it in front of them. Midlevel cutscenes, concentration (highlighting in neon all things you can climb on), locked on jumping, locked on jumping, locked on rope arrow, mandatory paths, levels that are glorified corridors, mandatory chase scenes, BOSS FIGHTS?! For the love of God you might as well you might as well put achievements for headshots (I believe there are). A bad game on it's own. As a Thief game this is ♥♥♥♥ing BETRAYL! Behead the entire development team, rehire competent people and try not to ♥♥♥♥ up Mankind Divided. Thank you very much!			"

												This game is not the successor to the theif franchise we were hoping for.Instead we have an artsy ""edgy"" take on the thief sereis with none of the good lore, factions and characters from earlier games. The devs exhumed the corpse of one of eidos's golden franchises to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. I am not speaking as a nistalgia criticbut as someone who liked the character and gameplay when it was done right.When items could be moved. and were not set pieces to collect.Moving to steal didnt cause motion sickness.Arrows could be fired anywhere to hilarious effect.TRUE multiple paths to a heist. You used to get dropped into a keep or fort. With a map if you remembered to bring oneor find one. BIG houses of rich people whos guards went about their bussiness and maids cleaned and so on. No its all set pieces and you scurry like a rat in the rafters trying to go where the action is instead of making it like you (as the protaginist) is supossed to do. "

												Game has a great atmosphere,art and premise, but it fails to deliver.  Each chapter feels increadably small. I don't know if they were trying to optimize the game for weaker machines(It didn't work), but I feel like there were much better ways to do it. How small is it? About two streets for an area. There are about 2 areas each chapter, and maybe a few rooms. If you were living in that gloomy city it'll take you 20 minutes to walk from one end of the city to the other. That's when you combine ALL of the areas presented to you, sans the tomb-raider level (I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not). Each level has only 1 or 2 possible ways to do it. Don't bother trying to wander off and explore - you will probably have to get back after getting yourself into a stiky situation.This feels increadblt constraining. Isn't the point of stealth is to find the optimal path best fitting your playstyle?I recall when I wandered off to loot something in a hallway, and got stuck between two guards. That's right. Neither was moving. I waited a solid TWENTY MINUTES to get an opening to slip away. and even then I alerted one of the guards and he attacked me.Not only that, but you also have a restriced set of...things to interact with. A few beams to walk on. Only some walls can be climbed. Only some beams can be shot with a rope arrow. LOTS of loading screens in the middle of a chapter. They did this clever thing where the animation of opening a window is loading time for the game. So you are trying to complete a level. You find a window and think that room will lead you to there. You wait for the loading of the room to complete. Then you open another window on the other side of the room to load another area. Or maybe it loads the area you've just left. And after getting there, you suddenly realize this is the wrong way. Or you want to pick up a quest. Now you have to go back throught TWO loading screens.I don't even know what are they loading - each area is incredably small (as I mentioned) and there aren't a lot of objects to render. They could have just as well loaded the entire thing all at once in extra 30 seconds and saved us the pain. The art direction of this game is great. I wish it was a big less dark and a bit brighter, so we could see the world better. When I got closer (really closer) to objects I could see how beatifull they were. Shame everything's covered in shadows and you can't see it. The story is the only reason I completed the game. Although it was predictable, I still enjoyed it very much. I WANTED to get to the ending and feel the world around me. Magic is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Magic is used as a cheap device to deliver plot. No I don't mean plot device. It literally, on a few occasions, delivered plot to us. It was like an exposition. With clouds. Nothing of intrest is ever done with it. I would have liked if they pulled the magic aspect all together out of the story, except the last reveal about Erin(which still can be done differantly but I accept the fact that the screen writer are lazy). Any character that Isn't Erin or Garath is a cardboard that speaks. And this is coming from someone who read Twilight and didn't want to kill themselves. There are lots of characters that have an interesting design or concept, but don't do anything and don't contrebute to the story at all. Game time is short. It says I have 17 hours in game. That is a lie. Remember I said I was stuck between two guards for 20 minutes? This is the entire game. You wait for guards to♥♥♥♥♥♥off so you could climd that wall behind them. Then After going through more guards, you relise that it's the wrong way. Shame on you - the way back isn't as easy. Better wait some more. I'd say I probably only got half of my total time on record with actual gameplay.  Side quests are boring and hard to get. In all my error prone exploring, I've only managed to complete two or three side-quests. THREE. I was TRYING to get some. But they were in the 'only one way to do it' catagory of how to get to the room that has that quest. A lot of people are complaining about combat system being ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They are right. It's so horrible it's only there to laught at you because you can't use it. But a stealth game doesn't have to have a good combat system. I respect the devs decision to make this game stealth-only. It only becomes an issue when the stealth mechanism is horrible. but the combat is even worse. And then you are left with two ♥♥♥♥♥♥ options, when one would not get you killed but will kill your patience.Ususally for games like this I'd recommend buying it on sale. But this game is so bad, that it's not even about the money anymore. If you were to recieve a one million dollar inheritance I'd still tell you to not buy this game. The time wasted on it is not worth it. tl;dr - Bad gameplay, Bad stealth. Bad characteres. Bad Level design. At least it's pretty "

Posted: March 27, 2014
												Well, to start I want to clarify one thing – the game is not bad, it’s just mediocre.While I have played all previous instalments (and The Dark Mod) I’m not going to judge Thief developers for the level of fidelity to its predecessors. I don’t mind changing the backstory and getting rid of the known and established lore, the conflict between the Pagans and Mechanist etc.The thing is – new Thief fails in creating something equally interesting on its own. It just has this generic XIX century steampunk vibe, that didn’t manage to tackle my interest.I will just try to explain why I’m rather disappointed in this game. There is no single game feature that would make it mediocre in my opinion, it’s just the sum of little things, that create this rather bland experience. I will try to explain it giving just some points as an example.Lack of the ability to jump – it’s not that limiting as I initially was led to believe, because you can mantle practically on any surface you would like to, with only few exceptions, so I’m ok with that.Contextual rope arrow – I can live with that, but implementing that solution causes the rope anchor point to stand like sore thumbs and screaming invitation – “look, here you can climb, this is the way further to something interesting”. Sound design – now this is a big letdown for me. Original Thief games had wonderful sound design that let you place characters and objects in 3D space. Judging by the sound of footsteps you were able to determine the surface someone is walking on, but also whether someone is closing up on you, or getting away further.In new Thief it’s hardly the case. Footsteps really doesn’t give you good sense of direction, and to make things worse – they are often muffled by generics speeches that persons give. About♥♥♥♥♥♥rings. From the other side of the stone wall. With audio repeated twice. And alas, that happens frequently, especially when you load new area (which also happens frequently). So often what would be a tense moment of hiding from a patrolling guard will be ruined, because you will only hear repeated generic guard chat (to loudly, even from the other side of the wall (sic!)) ad nauseam that will muffle the footsteps.As for the random chats and guard lines – they have a big variety of them, but it seems like every person you encounter has only 2-3 limited lines, that they repeat constantly. So you creep for long minutes around the guards that are having the same conversation over and over. Occasionally you will encounter a scripted exposition conversation that shed some light on the world, characters, or even gives you clues about hidden loot. But Karras forbid you raise their suspicion level, because if you interrupt them, there is no coming back (except for a load long before you encounter such situation).Staying with that – voice acting is pretty decent, albeit there are some issues with lip-sync, and Garret on liners are sometimes over the top.Speaking about conversations we go to another element – the writing. It’s not that good. I don’t know how the story was butchered and changed in its turbulent development process, but the outcome is average at most and sometimes straight out laughable (so the protagonist is a Thief – lets name his nemesis Thief- Catcher General). Conversations imply sexual things in not very subtle style, like it was written with teenage audience in mind. Plot is uninteresting and cliché-ridden, not to mention that it bears unhealthy resemblance to Dishonored (city dying of plague, you are the only saviour, your allies betray you).Going back to gameplay – City hub is divided into many districts, all separated by loading zones, and sometimes having loading zones in them. It’s painfully boring to navigate, especially if you have explored most of it on the beginning, because some side missions are available only after finishing main story “Chapters”. So, one mission requires you to go through 3 separate loading zones before you get to the mission area, and there is nothing to do on the way. You have to sneak (or fight) past the guards with, well known by that point, patrol routes, listening to the same conversations.The City itself seems lifeless.  I didn’t expect crowds on the streets by night (and the plague is a poor device to justify keeping NPC’s of the streets), but even if there is a public event, like hanging  there are 2 persons performing it, and just 2 citizens watching.Main story is divided into Chapters, but they are designed rather linearly, with multiple loading sections (cleverly disguised, I admit). They just feel like a scripted set of arenas you have to complete in order to move forward, to the next arena. And what’s worse, they feel even more limiting than Dishonored. Admittedly, there are some missions, where you can freely roam big mansions, and they gave me big enjoyment and this “Thief” vibe I was longing to feel. The plot sometimes acts as just to give you a pretext to move your character to a different setting.The graphics are nice, and lighting is especially good looking, but not always working well. For example if you hide behind a crate with only your head sticking out and the passing guard will have a lantern, the screen will flash to indicate that you are fully visible (another not good design decision), but you will still remain hidden. Or you will be spotted on the other side of the fence, even if you were hiding there (maybe the can see you through the space between planks?). But those are rare instances. Other than that, the bluish tint in everything, and the repeating window textures for rooms that you cannot get into got me bored after some time. On the other hand, interiors are sometimes exceptionally well designed, and underline the differences between mission locations.As for exploring the City – almost every breaking and entering will be proceed by a loading screen, which takes form of your hands working a crowbar animation, paired with a QTE. Also – your hands are almost constantly visible, and you can see the animations for doing almost anything – looking for a hidden switch, working a lock pick, or taking the loot. But since the most common loot is a pair of scissors laying precisely in the middle of a drawer, it quickly gets boring, and rather brakes immersion, because you know that behind every pair of golden scissors there is an 1-2 second long animation, that you can’t do anything about. I don’t know why they just didn’t go for stacks of coin here and there.The AI – while they seem competent, when alerted, it’s painfully easy to lose the chase, even by going around the corner and hiding behind a crate, or changing the climbing up or down. Other than that, the change their patrol routs on the basis of your current location. So even if they have no indication of you moving to a different area, they will go and do their routine over there, because the game says so – also a poor design decision.  Other than that they react rather properly to you dousing the lights, or making too much noise.Now for the good things. Side missions proved to give me most enjoyment so far, and some have really brilliant moments. They are well thought out, loading screens are better incorporated (talking about bank job mission here), the gave me the thief experience I was hoping to get.But, alas, those few great moments drown in the sea of mediocrity.And that is why I don’t recommend buying this game for its current price. I’m rather disappointed with the experience, and while I’ve spent around 30h, I had to fight boredom on much more occasions that I wished.So, to sum up – while not a bad game, it’s not good either, I would recommend waiting for a 50% sale before buying it.

												What a massive disappointment. Incoherent story, innumerable load-zones, broken movement mechanics, and a boring protagonist. This game butchers almost everything that made the originals great, and then adds a host of technical issues that diminish the experience even further. If you want a great stealth experience, spend your money on the original trilogy of Thief games, or even Dishonored. All of those are more satisfying than this reboot.			"

How the new Thief managed to steal my enjoyment from it.What the hell, Eidos? How could this game be an abomination like this? Don't you have a little respect left for this IP? Did you guys tried to copy Dishonored but make it worse? This game was clearly in development hell and the true vision of this game got butchered.Everything wrong with Thief: many scripted moments, smaller linear levels with loading screens, rope arrows only on certain spot, no modding/custom campaigns support, no jumping and only on certain scripted spot (some traps could be easly jumped over, but nah, game says you can't!), uninteresting story and cringeworthy characters, uninteresting faction and lore, a lot of cutscenes, enemy variation and bad AI, horrible audio, designed for consoles and a younger audience.The game is so heavily scripted, streamlined and linear, that it feels like I was playing a movie instad of a game. You will not feel in control at all, the freedom of movement/action and emergent gameplay is what defines this genre. You can't lean, only if you're on the wall. The controls really feels sluggish because it plays an animation for every action you do. You will button smash or hold ""E"" for every little thing in the environment, so it can play every time some animation, it's clearly designed for consoles. Every little prop/scripted jump area will stop the flow of movement for a moment and it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when you're being chased by guards. You can't even jump in this game! Only on designated scripted spots, where the devs allowed you to. There where many little obstacle throughout the game where someone could easily jump over, but naaaah! The game won't let you, you can only jump on designated spots. The same thing with the rope arrows, only on designated marked spots, while in the older games you could use the rope arrow on any wooden surface.The sounds in this game is pure trash, you can't even hear the footsteps of guards and which ground they walk on. In the old games you could hear them and locate them with sound, they could hear you too, for example when you run on a metal floor. The lips of NPCs sync not right when they talk, even in the cutscenes. Audio is so horrible and buggy, when a NPC talks, it sounds like they would be next to you, but they're actully upstairs and they didn't even bother to patch this. The AI is buggy sometimes and exploitable, not really challenging. They sometimes stuck in the wall and starting to spin around wildly. The levels are so small and linear, that the level desing feels like one small railroad compared to the older games. The new Garrett is melodramatic and they tried to portrait him for some sort of Batman, you can even see it in the offical comic, how he's posing like the Batman on the roof top, watching the streets. What disgust me the most about the new Garrett is his new appearance. He looks like a emo with all that eyeshadow and his corset, it's way too edgy and let's me wonder what they were thinking when designing the new Garrett. The old Garrett was more badass, while the new one let's me cringe when ever he said something (""It's not how much you steal—it's what you steal"" RLY? Most of the loot is cheap trash like forks, scissors, ink wells , etc.), like all the dialogues in this game. And don't let me start on Erin the Super Edge Girl with her anger issues.The story feels so rushed and unfinished, even if the game is full with cutscenes. It's like it was written by an edgy highschool goth kid in the recess. Maybe they were aiming for that younger audience? They didn't even put a level editor/mod tools in, so they can sell you map DLC's (The bank heist should be in the main game but they cut it for pre-order bonus and with the current price it isn't worth it.) You would be surprised how creative the classic Thief community is, if they had the tools for mod/mapping for this game too.This game is a good example of todays bullcrap that most modern AAA games do: buggy, heavily scripted, streamlined and linear, with really small levels and bad writing. I couldn't finish it, so I watched a mate playing it. Couldn't drag myself to finish it and for my mate  it was a chore to play it. I hope Eidos takes some notes of the reaction of the long time fans of Thief and do it better next time. Edit: Oh! And in the first old game last level (Spoiler): you travel to the world of a god, so you can steal his artefact and stop him to take over the world. The level desing is bizarre, waterfalls that stream up and function as elevators etc. No bizarre world here or undead walled off cities,folks! Just boring generic victorian era city with no orginality.  4/10 for this game. Get Dishonored or any other Thief game with some fan missions or Styx: Master of Shadows and stay away from that. "

												I hated this game.  If you have played the originals you will likely hate this game too.  The main character feels fake.  He now wears a gay ninja mask over his mouth.  He talks way too much, each time reminding you that this guy is not the real Garrett.  Some how the Devs thought it would be a good thing to give their version of Garrett a Sister named Erin.  What were they thinking? They killed off the fan's favorite fanatical group ""The Hammers"".   The levels are badly designed and linear.  You can't play your own way; only the way the level is setup.  The player is forced into actions.  Time events and button mashing.  Some how thief has become a platformer/parkour type game, which you would think would open up more areas to the player, but no in fact when you platform its because that is where you are meant to go to progress the level.  No alternate routes at all.  The Thief series made you feel like a thief, but this new game's feel is way off base.  When you blackjack a guard you have to sit through the same wack him over the head cut-scene each time.  Taking a purse off an AI is way over used, everything starts to be repeatative fast. The Dev's had feedback before the release of this game as to what fans wanted and expected. So how did they still get it so wrong? How many thosands of people tried to warn them to use Garrett's original voice actor even having a signed petition. Did these Devs even play the originals? The story is not good, but more than that, how Garrett reacts to the unfolding of the story again reminds you that this is not the real Garrett.  Each mission sould feel in itself meaning full even if it dosn't progress the main story line. In this game you don't feel a sence of acomplishment.  I am not against alot of the new concepts introduced in this game, but they were done so poorly.  Focus can be turned off but it is the whole base for the storyline.  So you have a choice to use focus which make you feel less like a thief or turn it off and have no idea what the storyline is talking about.  This could have been a great game, and I tired so hard to like it.  In the end you just have to give up and call it what it is, TRASH.  I would like to have my money back.  I even bought a new computer just so it could play this game when it came out.  So here are my last words.  If you like Parkour try Mirrior's Edge.  If you would like a thief games try Thief Gold, Thief 2, and Thief 3: Deadly Shadows.			"

												Thief is one of the better sneaky games, i like the story behind it.You are a master thief, and your first job was with some girl.The girl did something stupid, and now she is gone.She is haunting your mind and soul, so now you need to clear the case.Figure out what is happening. The game as an amazing gameplay, and very good graphics.So i would say its worth to buy,4/5			"

												The new Thief was a game that struck many right chords with me in principle. A steam-punkish world, semi-open, stealth-based and riddled with rare loot to steal. However, the game falls short on many levels.The steam punk is present but only lightly, in the form of electrical (?) lighting, occasional pipes and elevators as well as a piece of equipment you hold. But that's pretty much it. Now, this wouldn't be a big problem if the world didn't feel bland. Since you move about exclusively at night, all the colours will be washed out - everything is a shade of grey and boring. The game ""Dishonored"" created a compelling, brilliant world in which you played, but the world of Thief leaves a lot to be desired. Cramped quarters of narrow streets and buildings throughout most of the game leaves you wanting.Coupled with this, the semi-open nature of the game doesn't really reward you. Find a hidden vent up on a roof? Unscrew it, crawl through it and lockpick the mysterious door at the end to find a room full of junk. Where's the treasure? Ahh, a single silver spoon. I'm not kidding, a lot of such areas will make you jump through hoops to collect a single, boring item.This brings me to the point of loot. It doesn't feel like you're a master thief, but more like someone who's donned a leather suit and decided to perform petty crimes. You rummage through drawers for forks, spoons and candle-holders. I was expecting missions in the style of ""Mission Impossible"", where you would get tasked with stealing a priceless item from a heavily guarded and trapped building somewhere. Sorry, those moments will be few and far between.The story is nothing special, but it does get a little more interesting towards the end if you're a fan of such things (can't really spoil it).All in all, I felt playing through the similar-looking grey corridors and wooden boxes somewhat of a chore throughout the game and only felt compelled to explore further occasionally.Sorry, but this is not the Thief you're looking for.

												Don't play this game as a sequel to the original Thief trilogy. I played those, really loved those and for me Dishonored feels much closer to them than this game. Apart from the occasional reference and the name of some characters, the protagonist among them, this game has not much to do with them. If you can accept that this is not a sequel, if you can somehow separate the two things, than you will find a great game. It's a different Thief, but it still do things quite well. It has a great atmosphere, nicely working stealth mechanics, less combat options (which for me in this genre was an improvement), and quite a lot of stuff to do (haven't seen much of the main plot yet, though I liked it so far, because I was sidetracking a lot). I think this game would have been much better received, if they gave it a different name, because people nowadays have crazy expectations and amazingly whiney attitude, and feeding them hype is the worst thing to do for any game, almost anything is doomed to fail this way (just look at Watch Dogs, which is also a decent game in my opinion). So if you like stealth games with great atmosphere and lots to explore, I can really recommend this one, but if you want to pick up the story of that (ok, it's true, won't deny it) better and cooler Garrett of old and see what happens after Deadly Shadows, then you will be disappointed.

												9/10+ some of the  best graphics i have seen in gaming (if you can run them on ultra settings that is), not only technically but also artistically+ sound is also fantastic, with a great soundrack, excellent voice acting+ the well known from previous games in the series atmosphere is here, especially when just exploring the city, you get that mystic feeling+ garett seems darker this time, story is also darker, some david-lynch moments in the presentation, like the visions+ gameplay wise, stealth works although the enemy's ai is not the best, still you have to play using stealth, the known accessories are there, this time garett can climb and use ropes to access higher points, nice new swoop movement+ excellent side missions- enemy ai is the biggest concern, sometimes you stand in front of them and they are not alerted or they pursue you and if you just change location they stop, you can't hide the bodies in closets etc something you could do in hitman etc- as with other square enix/eidos new releases, gameplay feels automatic sometimes, they have to invest more time and polish gameplay since everything else seems to work finei don't really understand the negative reviews and i don't really care, this is a modern thief game that i really enjoy and will replay for sure.

												Let me first say I'm recommending it, but only just.In terms of the Thief series, this game doesn't hold up quite the same. Your freedom in traversal isn't plentiful, you will have more than a single path to get through areas, but these more or less come down to simply what the dev has provided in terms of following a path you have selected to its end, you will have options, but not quite open freedom. Do you like to jump? Forget that with this game, the only ascent in any form is achieved by climbing things, and you are only able to climb onto objects which the devs have allowed you to.The difficulty options are nice, in that you get to customise them more to your liking. It has the typical easy, normal, hard, etc, but on top of that, there is a custom setting where you can turn on/off various other things. This includes the infamous perma-death setting (applies to being caught, seeing as this is a stealth game), no upgrades, no kills or knockouts, no manual saves, slower movement, more expensive items from sellers, and a few others. Personally, I'm doing my first playthrough using the highest difficulty, with all these settings turned on except for the perma-death and no manual saves.A little nuisance, however, is also something that might just bother completionists, as it is impossible to get 100% on the hardest difficulty. This is because certain difficulty settings make it impossible to complete certain objectives in various missions. Just recently I have completed a mission where I did everything perfect from a stealth standpoint, found all loot, never spotted, never harmed an enemy in any way, and so on. But you couldn't count it as 100%, the reason being... one of these objectives was having exactly 1 kill or knockout, which is impossible with my difficulty settings.Ignoring the previous entries in the series, it is a pretty decent game, I find myself mostly using it to kill time, though being a stealth fanatic, I can get caught into fairly lengthy sessions despite its flaws. It can still be fun, provided you're a fan of stealth, to just get by without being caught while stealing everything, that is available, in sight.In terms of performance, it seems well-made for PCs. The only issue in terms of framerate I've encountered being during pre-rendered cut-scenes, where it was noticeably choppy, but otherwise, the game runs smoothly for me with the highest settings. The general appearance of things can also be admired, considering what they were aiming for, seeing as the scenery in this game doesn't necessarily pass for ""pretty.""I managed to get this game for $37 before release. I'm not exactly unhappy with that amount, but to those of you looking to purchase, I'd have to say it's more worth your money to buy it in the $20-30 range.			"

												Thief follows the concept of Deadly Shadows (its predecessor released 10 years ago) with its City in the center of the game which is freely explorable between the story missions. The story consists of 8 chapters and while this number seems insufficient, these are great and interesting levels. There are two more clients in the City giving Garrett - our protagonist - additional missions and a guy in the local inn giving him several jobs. Overall, it took me 25 hours to complete all missions but I missed a lot of collectibles, secret areas and other loot. In fact, the missions have optional criteria which can yield some extra gold so it's worth checking them again. And once the game is complete you are free to move about in the City and replay the missions for the missing items.The good stuff:-- Graphics. The game employs some excellent lighting and shadow effects. Since staying in the shadow away from the light sources is a must it is good to know the developers took this part of the game seriously. There are several cutscenes and not just Garrett but everybody else turning up in his story look very detailed and realistic. Accompanying voice acting is top notch. Locales during missions are diverse and interesting.-- Atmosphere. Hiding and stealing has never been more fun! I like how you can take almost everything in the game: golden saucers, candles, silver cutlery and all kinds of jewels. Robbing has never felt better! You can look for secret doors by pulling books on shelves or lockpick a safe that is hidden behind a painting. These are regular activities coupled with the disabling of several deadly traps. -- Equipment / AI. Rope arrows help you reach higher places, choke arrows eliminate dogs silently and water arrows will extinguish almost any fire you encounter. Enemies do notice them - guards can easily be distracted and the AI is clever enough to look for you even inside of a cupboard.-- Longevity. As I have already mentioned above it takes a while to complete all missions and it takes even more days to find every lootable item scattered across the City and its surrounding areas.The bad stuff:-- Optimisation issues. Before being able to properly play Garrett's story I needed to tweak the game a little. In fact, it took me a while to realise it was not my rig that caused the problem; some effects are simply not worth being turned on. Interestingly, most of them were shadow-related and I barely noticed anything when I turned them off. The game looks just as good and the stuttering - for the most part - ceased to exist. I hate when I have to look up numerous websites for tweaking advice.-- Audio issues. Sometimes you hear people speaking but you have no idea where the voices come from. Since you run on rooftops or ledges next to windows I gathered these could be people indoors. But then again sometimes you hear them as if they were next to you and at other times you don't hear them but the subtitles are shown. Occasionally more than one citizen speaks and the audio overlaps. Pretty annoying at times.-- Stuttering / loading screens / hub system. The hub system the game uses requires a lot of time to get used to. The map can be annoying and you do have to remember if it is a door or a window that takes you to the next district. But these areas are not that big so I did not really get why the game was divided up into so many sections. Loading, therefore, is common, especially when a mission is complete and you have to get back to your client to terminate it for good. He, of course, stays at the other end of the map. Sometimes you have to go ground level to find a pile of boxes that is the only means to access another area... this was annoying as hell! And once the next chapter begins Garrett always finds himself next to his Clock Tower hideout. This is the central part of the City and loading it up takes a lot of time and stuttering, as well. Some of the cutscenes also suffer from loading time - until it is done low resolution textures will appear for many secs.-- Gameplay issues / nuisances. Garrett's blackjack. Really? A melee weapon to stun enemies usable in combat, as well? Where is his sword? Or a knife? The game already labels you a Predator if you kill someone with a bow from a distance. So, why cannot we do that close-up? Sometimes I felt like going with the failed stealth and dispatching the attacking guards option but when I saw how slowly it can be done with the blackjack I loaded up a previous checkpoint immediately instead of wasting my time with the soldiers. The developers should have looked at Dishonored.  With all the excellent arrow types Garrett just looks lame with his blackjack. Moving can also be difficult at times. Sometimes Garrett jumps and grabs a rope in front of him while other times he falls and dies. Long jumps after running can only be used where the developers intended them to be used. Many times you'd like to jump down but Garrett crouches and looks down. Overall, I liked Thief. But I found its stuttering, its optimisation issues very irritating at first. Its hub system - the navigation in the City - and its combat with the blackjack took me several hours to accept. I expected more from such a remake and from Eidos. I wish they had looked at other games such as Dishonored and borrowed some good ideas. Or simply look at the Dark Project from 1998 - the first Thief game that had no issues with Garrett wielding a sword.I was not interested in the Bank Heist mission and Forsaken challenge DLCs, therefore, I cannot comment on those. I do not like that some of the content are intentionally pulled so that it can be sold later on.Thief could have been much better. It is not a bad game but not a very good game, either. Once you have gotten used to its nuisances you can immerse yourself in the City's steampunk atmosphere. If you achieve that, long hours of gameplay are guaranteed. My rating for the game is 6/10 at best.			"

												I honestly think people bash this game far too much. It isn't the originals, no, but that doesn't make it bad. I personally found it to be very fun and very immersive - there's quite a lot to do, and a fair bit of loot and collectibles to find. It's honestly hard to get them all if you play without a guide or something.The graphics and the simple flow of the game are quite beautiful, and really well done. I enjoyed the storyline, too - simple, but easy to follow, logical, and quite fun. Aside from the Thief-Taker General and such (Who you're kind of meant to hate), the only character I really despised was Erin. I just found her annoying.Most people's complaints are about Garrett not being the original Garrett, and that everybody hates his new voice, his new look, and the fact that he's shown to somewhat care for characters like Basso, the fence. Honestly, there isn't a problem with Garrett's new voice, and I reckon his new outfit is badass. Also, while there are a number of references to the older games, it's clear that this is a different Garrett - as in, he's seperated from the old Garrett by several centuries. He even makes an open reference to the 'old Garrett'. So, yes, he ISN'T meant to be the old Garrett, but he's still a shadey and edgy character like the old one.Really, this is a great game, and I honestly hope we get another one with the new Garrett (And no Erin, oh please). Old Garrett was lovable, but I see nothing wrong with this one.10/10			"

												It's not a bad game but it's horribly scripted. All FPS games are scripted to some extent but this one is extreme. For example I have to get from the ground to a rooftop. From where I'm standing I can see many possible paths to the roof but only one path matters and that's the one that's hard-coded into the game. I may want to jump on a box on the left, then onto a fence, and then leap and grab the roof and pull myself up. Unfortunately, I can't jump on the box on the left because it's not highlighted and I can't interact with it. It registers as too high although it's identical to the box on the right. I CAN jump on the right box however and then find other things I can interact with to get to the roof. It's frustrating being unable to interact with 95% of the items on screen because the developer has left me only one way to do any particular thing. I can spin my wheels forever and never get anywhere until I find that magical formula that was the intended path. The entire game is like that. Parts are fun and their storytelling is nice but the limited nature of the interface made me lose interest every time another game came out. You should judge on whether the strictest form of linear game appeals to you. If it doesn't, they you won't like this at all because it's among the most linear I've ever played.			"

												It's just not the Thief that I remember. It's become a boring, linear AAA game, with scripted scenes, epic visuals and an uninteresting story. Where is all the suspense? The fear, the anticipation? I remember playing Thief 1, 2 and any wrong move you made would result in death. Where has the passion of the level design gone? The levels are so linear and it feels like a boring journey from point A to point B. Worse off they give you waypoints too, ugh what the hell… What happened to figuring out levels and reading maps? The entire medieval feel that was once present and interesting is now totally lost, this is a modern wish wash game. The sound isn’t what it used to be, the weapons and gadgets are there for show rather than purpose. Huge shame, I’m a little bit disappointed and angry. What’s going on guys? I hope they go back to their roots, this is a huge shame.To summarise, this game has become a bland Assassins Creed “wanna be” experience.It’s a total fail by me. It could’ve been so much better…			"

												Thief is an interesting experience. It doesn't seem to have much middle ground. The good parts are good, the bad parts are horrible. You play as Garret, a black-clad amalgamation of edgy cliches trying to steal a thing because this guy used another thing to do a thing. This is not a story-driven game. That would be fine if the gameplay made up for it, but it was frequently frustrating and confusing.Pacing is all over the place. This game doesn't know whether it's a deliberate, slow approach or a heart-pounding chase, and ends up being a jumpy block of neither. Every action has an pre-rendered animation for it, from opening a door to picking up an item, which breaks the flow of gameplay and pulls you out of the immersion. The hand-holding is painful, with the 'optional' focus mode forcing you to choose between using the blue-tinted cheat vision to do almost everything or you get lost trying to do things on your own. The city (which by the way is simply named The City) feels unfinished, with branching paths that don't actually go anywhere and entire streets that serve no purpose. The levels themselves are pretty small, with dimly lit sections of the City hub separated by- OOH THIS PART.Incoming rant brace yourself.WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF THE LEVEL SEGMENT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOADING SCREEN. HOWEVER, TO ACTIVATE THE LOADING SCREEN YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE A QTE. I SWEAR HALF OF THIS GAME IS LOADING SCREENS AND QTES. HALF OF IT.Ahem.Sorry about that. The character development is minimal, but some of them are interesting. The level design for the hub world is pretty awful, but the mission levels are layed out in fun, puzzle-like corridors reminiscent of Dishonored or Deus Ex. Gone is the atmosphere of the old Thief games, but the feel of this game can stand on its own. The story is rubbish but doesn't really need to be anything more than an excuse to get some stealth action in. The stealth AI is laughable, but has the nostalgic charm of the original Thief games enough that I'll let it pass. The puzzles are a breath of fresh air, the takedowns and pickpocketing are satisfying, and the items are very fun to use.Overall, this game could go either way. While it's not a very well-made game in my opinion, you can get a lot of hours out of it in a scavenger hunt for every last valubale.I'd give it a 6/10. It's passable, but DO NOT BUY IT AT FULL PRICE.			"

												With more bugs than you can shake a stick at, there's no way I can recommend this game. I can't even get past the first major cutscene without it automatically closing to desktop (a problem that many others face but which remains unresolved). Avoid.			"

												I've never played the original thief games, except for the first one and only for a couple of hours but I didn't like it. I purchase this one on sale (thankfully) and give it a shot since I enjoyed Dishonored and there were some similarities between both games according to the internet. I don't know how much this game relates to the original ones but the game itself is repetitive and kind of boring, it looks awesome but that's it. Get ''Dishonored'' instead.			"

												They tried to make a good game and they failed. Despite the idea is great there are some flaws that you can't simply ignore. In a game based on stealth, exploring and freedom of movement you can't be restricted to climb over the exact point they want you to climb, for example. It breaks a lot the immersion being able to climb a large wall and a second later can't do it over a small roof or even a box on the floor.I bougt it attracted by the stealth gameplay style and now I couldn't care less, it's more efficient to go running and ignoring everything and everyone.

												This game is awesome. I believe it got robbed in the reviews which gave it a 6/10 for stupid reasons. Apparently they think playing as a THIEF means wanting more combat and less lootables. This game has a fantastic environment, smooth and not stressful gameplay, suspenseful stealth sequenses, and is nearly bug free (aside from a couple of crashes that happened during chapter 1 but never occured again after that).At the time of this review i have completed up to chapter 4 of the game plus the entire bank heist DLC (which is very well done i will add) in 7 hours. There is 8 chapters and lots of side robbery missions to do which should easily make the game's length acceptable.So far I cannot say enough good things about this game and will recommend it to anyone i can. 9/10			"

												This game failed to catch my attention from the get go. I started playing the first level and it reminded me of playing underground in Rome from the game Assassins Creed. The problem with the reminder? Reminded me of how much pointless building jumping I did in that game, and how much more I'm about to do in Thief. Thief is essentially a first person Assassins Creed game which doesn't really offer anything new or substantial. Yes it's first person, yes you can see your hands, but is it really that amazing turning dials on a safe or cutting rope?To me, I don't think so. I'm not even going to bother to rate.			"

												Not a bad game, just does nothing to expand on the original gameplay layed out from Thief 1 and 2. Nice atmosphere and animations but the gameplay is where it falls short.Every action you do is contextual, even shooting arrows. Makes me feel constricted in choice unlike the Original 2 Thief games which are full of open gameplay mechanics. Do you want to climb this ledge? Even though it looks climbable, you cannot do it! Do you want to move to this spot? You can't, you're blocked off even though you can easily move up the slope in real life. Want to jump? No. Ironically the most interactive mechanic is lock picking, which was purely contextual in the original Thief games.I loved lockpicking and framing. However, framing is impossible to do without the little indications. Lockpicking is possible without the HUD because Garrett has a special animation during lockpicking when he can pick, but not with framing. Both of these mechanics are really interactive and I wish all of the interactions you did in this game involved the mouse.Garrett has nice animations, but they detract from gameplay. When you grab loot you can't move for seconds at a time while Garrett looks at it. When you pick up special loot Garrett will take 6+ seconds to observe it and only by glitching can you do anything in between the animation times. The blackjack has a really good feel to it, similar to how Half Life 2's crowbar gives player feedback, its a shame that the blackjack is NOT useful in this game because you can only knock people out with a contextual button push that goes into a first or third person animation... instead of letting you do it your self. See the problem with contextual actions, developers? Same argument goes for the crowbar, the screwdriver, the wire cutters, and the razor blades.Another note: Garretts movement animations are top notch and it's always how I imagined him moving in Thief 1 and 2. Except swooping, which is impossible to do in real life.The world building and environments are very nice looking and even pretty nerve wrecking, especially the Asylum level, which is an obvious re-do of the Cradle level from Thief 3. It was still a great experience, infact I love it as much as the Cradle. My favorite level was easily the Brothel level, both parts.It's a shame the story wasn't well told. Everything was a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥idea from the start in terms of story and this Garrett is way too motivated to save the world and conflicts with his character in this game. It's all just a huge step down from the previous titles where Garrett was just unfortunate to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and kept getting sucked into the story even though it wasn't about him at all.The graphics are top notch. Not much to be said here.In Thief 1 and 2, the environment was a huge gameplay element. However, in Thief it is a big step down in some areas. Lighting in Thief is both amazing and confusing, as this game uses dynamic lighting for the light/dark stealth element (similar to Thief 3), but it is hard to see what areas are light and dark for the light gem to function the way I want it. It just wasn't clear on where areas were dark or semi-dark or not dark since a light area and a dark area looks kind of similar unless there's orange light from fire sources.Floor types are almost gone in Thief, no more carpet/wood/grate/metal/grains/grass/marble floors like in Thief 1 and 2. Instead we have normal, wet, and ""uh-oh there's glass nobody cleaned up"". This is a huge step down from previous titles.Sound design is weaker in this game, you can no longer lean against walls/doors to get sound information in the next room like in Thief 1/2 thanks to contextual leaning and since every floor is the same, it's hard to position guards with sound on vertical planes.It's just so wrong that the older games in the series are the more advanced. I know that video games are in a huge slump right now in terms of gameplay design, but developers need to take more risks and I think the only developer who would take a risk for something great is Eidos, since they have the torches of the companies who DID take these risks like Looking glass studios and Ion Storm. Overall if you liked Thief 3 you'll like this game just as much.7/10, played it too safe.P.S. Please give Garrett's sword back!			"

												--> Unlike every review I normally make, this one is serious. <-- To start off, I have a warning to all those people who have played the past games, This isn't that ""Thief"" This is something else. Unlike the older games, it is actually possible to fight and kill enemies, and be REWARDED! Unlike the title would sugest, you dont need to sneak around to suceed, as long as you make it out of every mission with enough gold to buy more arrows, your can keep shooting with your bow, instead of blackjacking your way in and out, unseen. And The blackjack, Garrett's most reliable ""tool"" is not even used to knockout guards, its used as a replacement for a sword, or dagger. Paths around the areas are much to obvious. The map is TOO easy to use, I prefered it old style, where you had to guess where you were. Garrett's right eye seems to have lost its greenish glow. And Focus, whether or not theres an option to diable it, ITS WRONG! Focus is practially ""Eagle Vision""(Assassins Creed Series) with a different name. all Focus does is simplify the game beyond how simple it already is. I was given high expectations from the hype (as little as there was) about this game, only to have them ruined, There was potential, it just wasnt used correctly, or even at all. I would not suggest buying this game if your a returning fan, but if you've never played the series, play the first, second, and maybe 3rd game. I'm disapointed that a near $50 when to this game, and the only part of the amount I enjoyed, was the pre-order bonuses for other games. Don't get me wrong, this game did somethings right, and the graphics are ""Enjoyable"". If you happen to find this game on an incredible sale one day, consider it, but if its not on sale and you have $50 to spend, buy the older games first ;)			"

												Caution! This is only a ""more or or less"" thumbs up, but ONLY if you turn on many of the custom difficulty options before you begin the game (leave the one about game saves and focus, these are okay as they are).Otherwise this game is such a bore to play.But, lovely graphics and sound, sure.Nevertheless, a huge disappointment, basically a rail stealther, no freedom in the city, you can't jump and climb where you want to, only at the few spots where the level designers put it there. TERRIBLE.Makes you wonder if they even knew what was fun about the old THIEF games.Wait for it to drop to 20$, then if you get it, TURN DIFFICULTY UP HIGH (which brings it close to the old Thief games), and play it for the athmosphere. If you do that, then stealing your way through the missions can get quite enjoyable at times.A game supposedly for a wider audience, but an audience that's never played games before, it seems.			"

												You'd be better off playing the original Thief trilogy, as this reboot does not live up to the Thief name. This game offers some of the worst stealth gameplay I've ever had the misfortune to play through, alongside abhorrent sound design, terrible voice acting, and an incredibly cringe-inducing narrative that is impossible to suffer through. I really wanted to like this game; I can even look past some of it's superficial flaws, such as how the developers replaced the voice of the main character with a newer (and blander) actor. However, there are too many glaring issues, the horrendous sound design being chief among them, but also the over reliance on contextual cues and poor level design. As I said, you'd be better off playing Thief: Gold, Thief II: The Metal Age, or even Thief: Deadly Shadows if you want a more meaningful stealth experience with an enriching story and fully realized characters. This game doesn't have that whatsoever. I'd even recommend Dishonored over this. Also, if you want to play a game like this but DON'T want to spend any money... download The Dark Mod. It's totally free, and fan made, yet it's so much better than this game. Again, it's free, so you really have nothing to lose if you don't like it. I think we can all at least agree that it's better than this game...			"

												This game was on sale and i decided to give it a try, i mean why not. The game itself is not as enjoyable as other stealth based games. The city itself feels narrow and linear the stealth mechanics are some what fine but not the best. The main quest is confusing and i find myself wondering as to why to i care about Garrett when he comes off as a cross between Batman and The Crow some of his dialogue come of as cringeworthy. The puzzles you are required to do to obtain a certain item are excruciating and could have been handled better.This game had the potential to be great especially since i don't mind stealth games but i ask myself where is the loot where is the fun of doing these easy missions that take only minutes to complete. You don't have to kill anyone and by pass the level with ease. I wanted a challenge instead i found myself thinking that i could be doing something else with my time.What is great about the game are the visuals especially with the lighting of certain levels and the city itself looks like a real filthy and damp city and certainly keeps you immersed for a while. The weapons are creative for the most part but i felt there could have been more effort put into it.I would recommend the game if it goes for cheap on a steam sale but in my opinion it's worth a try just don't pay full price or you'll feel ripped off.

												I found it very difficult to find a review that wouldn’t shut up about Thief’s superior predecessors, talking about how garbage it is compared to the previous incarnations……Of which I never played. I am free from the shackles of nostalgia for this particular franchise. This made it all the more annoying when I could barely find an impartial review. One one side, there’s Zero Punctuation, a well known fan of the older Thief games who lambaste it for audio editing. On the other end of the spectrum there is Rock Paper Shotgun, who enjoyed the game despite its various flaws.I’m the type of gamer who looks at franchises as a whole package. I enjoyed all of the Fable games for different reasons. I play all the Mass Effects despite 3 being my favorite. All serial media has its ups and downs and you sometimes have to take the good with the bad.Frankly, I am inclined to agree with the RPS side of this thing. The game is not without flaws.I will say, the game is neither difficult nor terribly exciting. Some of this is self-imposed, like setting the difficulty to its lowest which mostly translates to simpler AI behavior. ZP actually hated this, about how guards just tend to walk six feet, stare at a box for a few seconds, walk another ten feet and stare at a clearing for a few seconds. I’m inclined to agree with this rather boring method of patrol scanning. Each area only hosts 2-3 guards (At least, so far).There is the occasional exciting moment, like the end of Chapter 2 upon meeting the “Thief-Taker General” who sounds an alarm and all the guards (Again, just about three of them or so) are on permanent alert mode. That was probably the most fun I’ve had on the game so far, partially due to the fact that the alert status put them on unpredictable patrol paths, for the most part.I will say the game is visually stunning. I find new desktops at least once per chapter or quest, and it has a great atmosphere that gives me a sort of Dishonored vibe, except even more dire. Dishonored’s situation was more grim story-wise but it was a more colorful game.Every other odd complaint I have are merely petty grievances that don’t sap too much away from the game.Having to press E three times to; 1) Activate the object, 2) Lockpick the object, and 3) Open the object with the occasional 4, 5, 6, and 7 of picking up silver forks and spoons. I just feel like there should be a catch-all, ESPECIALLY if Garrett is in full darkness at the time. I can understand if there’s a light source on you, and you don’t want to be stuck in a big ‘open’ animation but I didn’t like having to slam E for stupid reasons, like just opening a damn window.I didn’t like the cutscene every three steps during the tutorial. I found them unnecessary as it could have just let us follow the girl around without needing a cutscene. This generally goes away once you get into the game properly. The tutorial also failed to explain certain things like jumping off ledges or actually meleeing enemies when you do get caught. I found myself being pummeled by guards before I got angry enough to look in the key bindings.The talk of hand-holding is present in reviews and I did notice this; This is the same company that made the new Tomb Raider games. At least in TR, you are generally more active when jumping around obstacles. Here, all I have to do is press a button that goes in the general direction of where I’m going and Garrett does all the work for me. I have mixed feeling on this, as it leaves less room for stupid, glitchy failure because we don’t know when the game will mess with us and not detect a specific platform. (Took me ten minutes to do a simple puzzle in Tomb Raider for this very issue). On the other hand, it’s not very engaging.I think it was RPS who said this game is “safely” good, as it doesn’t do too much to challenge you, or current day standard stealth mechanics. It even has the usual fare of Detect-O vision that highlights things for you (Which again, you can choose not to use or disable entirely).I admit I do want to continue playing but it doesn’t try very hard to keep my attention and that’s a shame.If you are as incapable of looking past a few petty flaws while wearing the nostalgia glasses like most reviewers then yes, I do not recommend this game. If you’re looking for a solid, if easy stealth game then there’s no real harm in nabbing it on sale. Or not, 30$ isn’t terribly demanding. Neither is the game, really.			"

												So I'm going through the turorial and my sidekick who looks to be in her early twenties starts quoting Hayden Cristiensen. I think to myself, Thats strange she dosn't look 14 though, the super heavy eye shadow makes me suspisious. Garret is going to need to card her before anything happends I thought. Hmmmm Garret's voice sounds old but he is saying things a 16 year old would think are stupid. I console my self after deciding the writers were 12.The side kick is whining about how Obi-wan dosn't understand her. Now she has killed a guard with her claw thing that is clearly an overworld item and I hope to myself she won't need to die for me to get it. We are half way into a dangerous heist and she has a big problem with Garret having a problem with her killing. Mature people would have this argument later or abort. I have enough in my pocket to call it a worthwile trip and these two clearly have history whats the hurry.The combonation of her current borderline age and the idea that garret knew her even younger has made me uncomfortable. I decide to show solidarity in her murder by hiding all the bodies and knocking out everyone I see. This should drasticaly midigate the effects of her ""mistake"" and mend the frayed nerves.I meet her on the roof and she has killed again. Given it is the one part of the roof that was fully lit and there is no place for the gaurd to have gotten up here let alone patrol I doubt she had a choice. Garret confronts her and she pulls a full on dark side monolouge.  Woah, must be adreniline. She is probably going to feel a serious guilt hangover later and seems barely stable now. She moves ahead but clearly wants to finish the heist with me and is using the idea of a race to keep her distance but goad me to keep up. Clearly I need to go on for her sake and if she breaks down she might get hurt or killed. When I start to note that captial P pride will be a big part of her character giant white text appears over her head and she freezes.STEAL THE CLAW THINGY [E]!No. Why? I have not seen a single place I needed the claw thing. I don't want the thing. She has clearly grown dependant on it to get arround and to defend herself. It also represents her advantage over Garret psyologicaly. The chip on her shoulder is a mile wide and stealing her tools is a heinous betrayal. Garret was worried about a body up here on the roof so clearly I can't knock her out or strand her here in the middle of a mansion grounds. Garret is not her mentor or guardian they are partners in a now double homicide crime.My pocket has a month of living jangling in it and a necalce made entirely of rubies. I don't need this. If I am woried about myself I should quit. If I am worried about her I should try to calm her down and make sure she gets through this alive. Its at this point in my crisis that I realize she hasn't moved at all. She is trapped half way through an anamation where she is squeseing past a box. She hasn't said a thing this whole time. She isn't even breathing. It's astounding that there is no speech or falure condition for taking this long. She dosn't react when I shoot water on her head or toss a fragle glass cup.The only things to keep me company on this roof are a bloodless corpse of a guard, an uncariteristicaly bright light, and a white cursor over her butt displaying:BETRAY YOUR COMPANION [E]SCAR HER TRUST [E]STEAL THE CLAW [E]I couldn't bring myself to go any farther. I will never know what adventures reboot Garret has in these linear tunnels with 1 to 3 guards at a time. 9.5/10 GOTY ""It's astounding..."" -Corbec			"

												Wow, where do I even start? I guess, by saying that despite a LOT of dissapointments, bad design decisions, few rare but horrible glitches, the game is good. It really is. When thinking about what I'm going to say about the game while at about mid-point of the game, I was thinking of ""really good"". But the last few levels are quite badly done, so ""good"" it is.One thing that surprisingly Squenix decided to be quite about, and I really have no idea as to why, is that Thief is, in fact, not a reboot but a sequel. It happens in the same City as before, even if Garrett is a different character. Just several centuries later. And yes, I do consider this fact to be important, because trying to learn more about the game world, the surprisingly rich and intriguing world, of the original trilogy after the trilogy ended was one of the most enjoyable things in this game. Which is not surprising, since the story the new Garrett is involved in is absolutely abyssmal. The concept behind the story is more or less okay, some of the characters are intriguing, but the dialogue, the feel of the world and it's inhabitants are just flat at best, and the story simply goes nowhere. At first, after seeing Rhianna Pratchett's name in the credits I thought I had the answer as to why this happened, but apparently even she wasn't really working on the game and was involved rather briefly and in the early and mid stages of development.And the fact that this happens is really a shame, since some of the characters and some of the hooks are pretty nicely done, and visually The City looks nice. Voice actor for the new Garrett was good, reminding of Stephen Russell's delivery, but at the same time creating a different character. Music, composed by Luc St. Pierre according to credits, is actually very nicely done and reminiscent of the fantastic score of the original trilogy done by Eric Brosius. Not quite the same mix of weird creepy and industrial ambient with trip-hop and industrial metal sounding stuff, but very close and, because of the fully dynamic nature of music in the game, feels more natural and enhances the gameplay.The gameplay itself, though, is where you start asking questions. Now, some of the ideas were nice.They did improve on the Deadly Shadows' claustrophobic City - it's bigger, has much more stuff to do, but at the same time, still fell in the same trap of pointlessly boring backtracking, ""upgrades/tools"" (think climbing gloves from TDS), which you absolutely have to get, and do it almost immidiately, making the idea of buying them in the first place almost redundant. And added to this a really big problem of doors and other closed things re-locking after every mission and even side-mission (client job type, not just a mini-quest thing) for no apparent reason, rather then to just waste more player time.I also did like how now Garrett had to physically interact with everything - be it grabing loot, opening doors, flipping switches and etc. It means, no ""telepathic"" interactions, more thinking about where any interaction places you and how long each interaction takes when thiking about guards or other enemies around you. To somehow balance this idea out the movement became much faster and quiter, though, but actually not completely silent when crouched and on ""loud surfaces"", as it was in TDS. Plus, the ""swoop"" move is a really nice idea for the kind of gameplay the game created.The bad thing about this swoop, however, is that it completely overrides the jump button. Instead, all the jumping in the game is context sensitive and if you understand that the jump should be easily possible, but the game doesn't want you to jump there - you just can't. It, along with a few other ""context sensitive"" animations restricts the game much more than one might want to. But, at the same time, it doesn't matter, because the problems with gameplay lie much deeper than that.The actual problem with the gameplay is that, despite understanding it and getting it almost 100% right in their previous project DX: Human Revolution, the developers completely misunderstand the core idea behind Thief's gameplay. Which is not that far from what Deus Ex gameplay is, in it's core. Because Thief, even TDS, had very simple rules during missions - no cutscenes, at no point the controls are taken away from the player, all that happens in the level happens because of the set and, if not bothered or rarely scripted, never changing character routes and player interaction with it, and the level as a whole. That's it - if there's a ""cinematic action moment"" during the level, it's because the player screwed up somewhere and alerted the enemies, not because the script says that there is a cutscene, during which Garrett gets discovered and it cues into an actions running away scene. And, because of this ""forced storytelling"" approach in the new Thief, levels are much much less open ended. And, you know what - with this approach it is understandable, that jump button got cut and rope arrows work as tools with very specific use in specific places (think more Tomb Raider 2013, than classic Thief, hell even less than climbing gloves from TDS). There's no point in having normal jumping and proper rope arrows, if the levels are not structured in the same vein, as in the original trilogy, now is it?And it becomes painfully obvious, when the game tries to directly reference those unforgettable missions from original trilogy. Sure, one of the levels does look like that incredible mission in T2 with Angelwatch tower, but the magic of the original was in how huge, varied and almost completely non-scripted that mission was. How breathtaking that run across rooftops was. Here it's just a super linear level with a forced ""run away"" sequence jammed in the middle for no good reason. And they try to do their own Robbing the Cradle. And it is good. But where the original in TDS was brilliant because it worked just as a normal mission, but with no enemies at the start and with almost completely silent and frighteningly deadly enemies later, the mental sylum mission in the new Thief feels more like a first person horror game, a lot of free ones of which are constantly been created lately. With jump scares and horribly banal twist to the history of the place, where the original was just a sad and scary place, which got really unlucky at some point.Also, there are two ""boss"" fights. Yep. Developers who got severely burned by including boss fights in ther previous game did it again. And while Deus Ex actually had boss fight encounters from the very first game, Thief never did. Now, granted, you're not required to fight, hence the quote marks. And the second one actually works much more like the ""boss"" encounter at the end of the TDS - more of a stealth puzzle than anything else. The first one, however, is ridiculously badly done, especially for ones playing on highest difficulty with several custom difficulty settings. The fight can be avoided, but the boss is so erratic and his attacks have such a wide spread, that it's just painful to try and avoid him. Especially if the game does a rare reloading glitch, where the game just goes to a black screen after the loading and has to be force quit. And since I mentioned glitches - the other really bad and very noticeble glitch is AI reset when reloading - sometimes all the NPCs would just return to their starting places on the location and do the starting things they might do upon reloading, which may make some levels almost impossible to complete with full stealth/no knockouts approach.But since I've mentioned custom difficulty - it is a nice, but, to be honest, pointless thing that will, most likely, just make your playthrough more painful. They set restrictions, which give you ""points"" for leaderboards, but that's it - points, not multipliers, so there is a max of 1300 and Top of the leaderboard is full of those.So yeah. Lots of bad things, but a good stealth game.			"

												This game is an utter disappointment.I can't even say anything for most contents - I didn't get that far. I would have liked writing a review if the game could live up to my thief franchise expectations.                               BUTIt doesn't stop stuttering (avg about 10fps, at times dropping to 0.5fps slide shows) when playing, not even in the lowest resolution and with all settings on minimum. I have a rather decent rig, that runs Deus Ex Revolution in highest resolution. But not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!How did it come so far, that companies can throw unfinished merchandise onto the market, probably without playtesting it on any other rigs than their high-end, new-tech, sponsored company PCs? Not only that this game doesn't run for many users, they release it with another 5€ release -DLC piece so that even buyers of the Master Thief addition have to pay more for the whole experience (of you could get it anyway).How can a studio release such a brilliant game with DE:HR and fail so utterly on their next heist?I feel misused as a paying Beta-Tester yet again!!A N  °°°°    U T T E R   °°°°°     D I S A P P O I N T M E N T=================================Edit:I tried the User-Tweaks from the support-forums (note well: users had to find this out) - Renaming the Win64 Folder of the Binaries into something else, copying the Win32 folder and renaming that to Win64. It helped to an extent. Partially the game was playable for 10-15s until severe stuttering ensured.The downside is, that loading crashes the game then. So you are then mandatorially playing in hardest mode ever, no loading, no failing.			"

												Well, in general this is an awesome game. You can actually feel that the developers put in tonnes of effort to give you the old, dark and corrupted slum of city. I have not played any of the previous Thief title but this game gives me enough freedom to play and approach each quest. Thief is basically a semi open city game where you have to try to avoid being detected while achieving your goals.The graphics is awesome specially when you maxed out your settings. However there is a serious performance issue after playing a while. There is a benchmark feature in the game and with maxed out setting I can get 50-60fps. The game is smooth for a while and after a mission or so it begins to lag terrible as if the game is trying to reload the texture for the location. The only work around I can find is to set graphics to the lowest possible. Even running on low texture will cause the lag issue. The background music only plays during encounters or certain event and you can only hear sound effects the other times which is excellent. The story mission brings you to different locations and settings. Each mission feels really unique. The side quest are basically, well, item retrieving but there is a short story to accompany it. There aren't many side quests but in my opinion it is just right. As you progress, you will be able to purchase enhancement item, upgrade your equiptment and even skills. The game offers a selection of ammunitions that gives you more options to play the game. After each story mission, you are able to freely roam in the city completing side quests or simply finding loot. This process can be time consuming but it does give you a really great sense of completion as your collectibles loot are show cased in your hideout.Apart from the performance issue, there are a couple more things that can be frustrating. The game allows quick save and load. But I do notice each time you reload, the enemies behaviour are reset. Example the guards are suppose patrol in certain pattern but instead they are teleport to a certain location and stationed there. There is also this particular guard in the city when you reload a quick save nearby, he will spin in a 'fasionable' manner while stationed. It is really difficult to approach him then because he will spot you (spinning 360). The city is divided into 2 region. Within each region the map is again divided into 2-3 areas. Now crossing between these areas will not cause the guards to respawn but moving across region will cause the guards respawn. This is extremely annoying and time consuming because you might need to travel between these area several time to complete side quests. And to travel between these areas, you might need to find the exit/entry point which could be an apartment, roof, blockage or door and there are no markers in the map and might be a little frustrating since you haven't memorize the entire map.Now looking pass through all those set backs, Thief is a really great game and if you are a fan of first person stealth genre, you can give this game a chance.

												This game is full of poor design decisions, user interface mistakes, idiotic save system. It has great potential but once again - poorly executed. The save system and checkpoint system guarantees that if you accidentally die after there is a cutscene in the middle of the mission - YOU HAVE TO REPEAT THE WHOLE MISSION or from your last manually saved position ... Why not putting there a checkpoint after every cutscene??? Why making a huge budget game and not making the simplest things as a save system the RIGHT WAY??? This otherwise semi-enjoyable game is so friggin' annoying thanks to this lazy a$$ mistakes that I DONT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS UNTIL THEY FIX IT!			"

												Good but could be better. Ai is kinda stupid, loading between areas can be frustrating, controls and platforming can be a little akward at times. What holds the game up is good stealth mechanics, story and atmosphere, graphics, looting is a lot of fun, pick-pocketing can be really satisfiying, and there are tons side missions. Game allows you to play with 3 different styles; predator, ghost and opportunist. Predator is just killing everyone who dares to stop you, ghots is completing the quest without being seen and leaving no trace, opportunist... well I couldn't figure that out actually. It's about using the enviroment to your advantage or something.Ai is just stupid. Predictable, blind idiots with memory of a fish. They still can see the little differences you made and react to them. They can look for corners, covers and closets and find you.Story is cool and captivating enough to see you till the end. There are good cutscenes and tons of lore in the world.My biggeest issue is the loading screens in every 5 minutes. This game is supposed to be an openworld game. This was unnacceptable for me. But even with that I managed to suffer though it because looting is really satisfiying.I recommend this game, but only to people who love the genre, people with patientce and nerve.			"

												If you are a fan of Thief 1 & 2 I can sum this game up with one word.  ""Refund"".Once can only assume that the research that went into this game was a half-drunken conversation with a console gamer who once saw the Thief box on the shelf in the 90's.  Because it's clear that they have no idea what Garret or the game was about.  I can't even go into any more details.  It's just too upsetting.  I need to go and mourn my loss.  They say it's healthy to cry.  Basicly everything you loved about the first two games has been torn to shreads, mixed with vulture vomit, and served up with annoying characters with american accents who make me want to break my no-killing rule and put a broadhead between her shoulder blades.You can't even JUMP, for fook's sakes.  I shouldn't need to say any more.This is a horrible, horrible release that shouldn't be touched by anyone with any fondness for the original franchise.  Or any one else for that matter.  Get Dishonoured 1 instead.			"

												A gem of a game hidden under layers of filth.  Setting is darker and edgier, with a lot of charm and character of the franchise forgotten in favor of modern ""Mature gaming.""  Mechanics are mostly smooth, with sneaking and thievery feeling great.  However the game is bogged down by poor narrative, a slew of odd bugs, a barely working sound engine, and a save system that can ricochet the game back prior to the last manual save.There is a good game somewhere in here, but you really need to want it.

												I never played much of the original Theif, but the hour or so I did in the original was way more enjoyable than this mess. This reboot about as generic as it gets. Straighforward missions, crappy AI, crappy hard to navigate HUB world, and a bunch of useless stuff like Eagle Vision, Opps, I mean focus and totally not the thing from Assassins Creed. The few hours or so I played in this reboot I was extremely bored nor did I have a clue what was going on. The stealth is hardly there and when it is its incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I once got chased into a room by three guards and was cornered. Before they entered the room I crouched down in a darkened corner as a last means of hiding, seconds later all three gaurds ran in and stood not even 3 feet from me and could not locate me. It was only when I stood up by mistake did they actually see me. Around this time I just closed out of the game. It left a bland taste in my mouth and a few hours wasted, much like alot of Triple A cash grabs tend to do.			"

												Well.. I'm pretty dissapointed.It's mostly the story and the gameplay that bothers me a lot in this game.The game was interesting at first, a little confusing though. But I went through the game and finished all the chapters to find out what the hell was going on in this game and what the story was about.Oh man.What the hell is the ending. I have no bloody idea what happened.The ending is just... So unsatisfactory. You just have no clue what's going on and that's just it, end of the game? (People who finished the game will understand me)GG devThe gameplay is extremely repetitive, with the ridiculous AIs that can't even see you if you're standing in the dark. (https://youtu.be/5u9VOPSqdqQ) and some chapters were pretty annoying to go through.Just the SFXs in the city are so buggy. You can hear a dude snore like right beside you when you're 3 meters away from a house..And oh boy, the many many MANY loading screens are so annoying as well.But the graphics are alright I guess.

												Nowhere near as good as the originals, but I won't go so far as to call it not a ""true"" Thief game. It's Thief alright, just not a very good one. The levels are too small and too linear, the guards are too aggressive (if you're on your 127th straight night as a guard in Lord Inbred XIV's mansion, you're not going to be jumping at shadows and raising the alarm every time you hear a rat), and the City's lost most of its charm, as has Garrett.Play it if you absolutely need a stealth game with all the shine of modern graphics, but if you want a true quality gameplay experience, pick up Thief II. This new effort did a few things right that I wouldn't mind seeing again, but the developers need to go back and look at what made the old games great. And dramatic fiery action sequences weren't on the list.The much-hyped Bank Heist addon was designed to be an homage to the bank level in Thief II, which apparently the developers thought meant ""a bank level with steampunk security cameras."" The attempted homage basically comes across as more of an insult, with the bank being painfully tiny and linear compared to the sprawling, three-story building from the original, with a suffocatingly increased guard density, nonsensical arrow traps, and security cameras that are somehow candle-powered and can easily be disabled, robbing any challenge they posed.Let's hope if they squeeze a sequel out of this, they don't include an ""homage"" to the warehouse level which consists of one rental box, three offices, and twenty paranoid soldiers to look after it.

												The main reason I've marked this recommended is because I'm a huge fan of the Thief series and would really like to see another attempt at the game a little more closely aligned with the original games.That being said... I was disappointed in this attempt. I like the engine for the most part. The tools are pretty good (aligned with the originals fairly well). I thought the story line was alright if a little vague and a bit odd. But, games of this nature tend to be a bit odd. The story line does seem a little patchy, with several holes in it. But, I'd like to think that it is so they can make new games filling in those blanks.Sadly, if the reviews I've been seeing are the deciding factor, I fear this franchise may have come to an abrupt and untimely end! If that's the case, it's REALLY unfair! The stealth gameplay that was truly initiated with the Thief series is the one style of game play that I really enjoy. I hate games that essentially force you into running headlong into a hail of bullets and hope you can kill everybody before you die. Then hope you can find enough med kits to recover enough health points for the next assault. That's just stupid tactics. (But, that's another issue)Down to more specifics.As I said, I like the basic engine. The stealth worked well in my opinion although I'd like to see all the paths to different locations be two way, not just one way. (Minor annoyance)I'd like more opportunities to acquire more of the points for adding to the special abilities.Unfortunately, I felt somewhat frustrated at different points in the game. The most notable is the end-game ""boss"" fight. It's really not a fight. The things I don't like about the end is... first, the idea is NOT to hurt the ""boss"" because you're trying to save her, yet, just one or two of her flashes of light can kill you. Second, the objects you have to gather are spread out and hard to see, making them almost impossible to acquire without getting killed. The rest of the game was challenging enough to make it interesting most of the time, at least for me. But, the ending frustrated me to the point where I had to walk away before I punched my monitor! Using a walkthrough I found, I'm going to try and complete it, but I'm not sure if I'll play it all the way through again.Bottom line: I would only recommend this game at a discounted price. I normally like the products Eidos produces. But, with this one, I regret paying the full, pre-release price for it.Dear EIDOS,If you read this... I'm begging you, PLEASE try again! Only, stick a little more to the style of the original series. I understand you wanted to be a little more realistic. But, this game series was originally set in somewhat of a mystical time. So, you could get away with mixing a little mysticism with science and still be believable. "

Not Recommended: Thief's newest iteration is a game that had to deal with lingering in the shadows of it's predecessor.  It's functional, technically-competent, and that's about all the nice things I can say about it.  The characters have been turned into overwrought, ""gritty"" stereotypes, the setting has been turned into a not-Dishonored-honest steampunk magical setting, but most damning of all, and perhaps the only thing that is important: the core game mechanics just don't work cohesively.  Get it on a sale maybe, but don't expect it to live up to the name it's using to market itself.Full review is available here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												I had to refund it because the performance was just to bad at my end, I don't have a great graphics card, but even at lowest settings and resolution all the way down to 1280x720 I barely got 15fps while I can play games like GTA V and Hitman with 30+ on medium settings. And this game as far as I played it had only small linear levels with not all that much to render so it should perform better than it did. I have finished the prologue in the game and the gameplay up to that point was also not all that good. It was hand holding all the way and moving from one visual marker to the next marker (on a restricted linear path) and stealing some meaningless stuff from dressers and the AI also seemed pretty bad as far as I encountered them. At the end of the prologue I also started to notice that the gameplay for the rest of the game will have a lot of QTE's (melee combat for example) and if there is one thing that I don't like in games it is QTE's. The story was ehh... no idea, I already can't remember anymore what it was about. Something about the main character and a thief chick you are running after. If this would have had the gameplay and movement of a game like Dishonored then I no doubt would have liked it a lot more, but this game feels like a bad attempt at being like the game Dishonored. Not recommended unless you have a high end graphics card (higher than advertised on the store page). And even then I would buy Dishonored if I were you (if you haven't done so already).			"

												Dishonored is a hundred times better than this shoddy ripoff.The story is as generic as it can get, it definitely feels like a ripoff of Dishonored and it has a lamer villain than Turok Evolution's Cpt. Bruckner. Also their much touted ""advanced mocap"" is used with cutscenes where Garrett is just standing around with his mouth half-open, wich is the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥explanation of Eidos for not using the superior acting skills (and sexier voice) of Stephen Russell.Gameplay wise, it's your standard sleath fare, but with a game touting so many ""choices"" for tackling any given situation, you're VERY restricted on what you can or can't do, for instance, you can't jump and you can't use rope arrows on any wooden surface like in the old games, instead you can only use them on very specific places.And be prepared to mash the X button, as there are plenty of QTEs that repeat over and over, one for opening windows and another one to move a large wooden plank. And that's not counting the same animations for opening safes, lockpicking doors or stealing paints.And don't even bother attempting ghost runs, it doesn't have a ""morality"" system if you kill NPCs and it's not really worth the hassle to do ghost, you'll only have a miserable time if you do.It has a rather serious bug with the sound engine, where you can hear NPCs right next to you, but they're at the other room or several feet away from you. One of the most important aspects for a game like this is completely botched.Most of the missions are okay, with the highlight being the Bank Heist DLC mission, though it definitely losses some steam after a copy of the famous Craddle mission from Deadly Shadows.Go play the first two games instead of this, the second game has a bigger and better bank heist mission, heck, go play Deadly Shadows if you're new to the series. Or better yet, get Dishonored instead of this.It's rather ironic that Dishonored aimed at being up to the high quality standards of the old Thief games, but the new Thief 2014 ended up as the imitator. And a bad one at that.Stay away, you'll feel robbed if you buy this.			"

												I love SpinterCell series. I loved Dishonored. I love <your favorite stealth game here>. I love stealth overall, hiding unseen and unheard and waiting for right moment to do what is needed to do :)New Thief? It is not so bad, but it is not so good also. New Thief ... just it is.Pros:- very nice atmospheric stylized graphic- very nice architectonic of whole city- possibility to tweak gaming UI (aka HUD) to get feel like in old Thief games (you can turn all dumb ""action key"" notices, you can turn AI awareness icon etc.)- possibility to tune your difficulty to your needs (to be honest, on Master difficulty with HUD all turned off you could start feel fun from playing this game, everything feels almost OK)- very strong immersion into the game due to visible hands and feets of player character GarretCons:- VERY, VERY, VERY poorly optimised game, long loading times and with 1GB GPU forget about textures higher than ""lower""- after short time very annoying action animations of opening windows/squeezing somewhere between crates to get to other part of city- VERY glitchy sound engine. Game like this should rely on sound, moreover human eye is easy to trick, but not so ear (i.e. you can hear someone very loudle, his steps, his speech, but he is far away, much more than it sounds or imagine two characters standing each together having dialogue in large hall, one sounds like in large hall and other not etc.)- STORY? WTF? You are Garret. You had an amnesia for last year. No word about who is who, story is dull and very boring and something you can't just believe. You are here in city to do your job - just bounty thief, nothing more- sometimes the visibility meter shows you are completely hidden in shadow, but reality on screen makes you feel like ""guard you can't see mee in the middle of light flooded space?"" or so- all main story levels are strictly corridor designed- VERY POOR vertical movement freedom for player. Good old rope arrows are here, but there are only few and significantly marked spots in the city you can use for rope arrow. Also no possibility to recycle used rope arrow- VERY POOR vertical movement freedom for player again - you see some crates under some balcony or platform and you think ""i could get there easily""? Forget about it. There are so many unclimbable objects or locations and is pretty obvious THIS IS THE WAY developers controls your way through game- you can loot citizens flats where is nobody inside houses and all civilians in streets one can count on fingers of both hands- visuals are nice dark, but after while dark atmosphere of city is gone somehow- sometimes AI is so smart - when guard sees torch or candles to blow out he comes back and lights it again, same with open doors - when guard sees opened door which should be closed he will go investigate. But sometimes doors doesn't matter and same with torches/candles (most curious situation is when you shoot blunt arrow to someone who carries a torch; he just drops torch /torch goes out/ and AI continues with suspicion in dark and never picks up torch from ground and never lights it back)Thief looks very nice and just WOW! when you enter the game, when you see it for first one or two sights/gaming sessions. But after while, when you conquered game mechanics one can see how stupid and how simply is level design on most places. And i'd rather spent gaming time by doing all side/client jobs in the city, rather than continuing in main story.Also for older Thief fans - there is no connection with Thief world with Hammerites and Keepers, Mechanists and Pagans - story of new Thief is ... just poor and very uncomplex and just very unbelievable. Only a few things remind old Thief games - Basso and guards saying ""one should walk the streets with bronze hammer"". This is all what one gets to remind older Thief games, which had very strong story.Conclusion? IMHO wasted potential. New Thief could very easily become GOTY, if done properly. But if you like stealth and if you like dark visual you can get it for less than 10€, go get it, you will enjoy it.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the original series, Thief II: The Metal Age being my favorite game of all time. Compared to the originals, even the 3rd one which doesn't hold a candle to 1 & 2, this is an abortion. This is what happens when you spend 6 years making a game, with frequent changes in the design staff leadership, and attempting to turn a niche game into something with a wider audience based solely on market research. In all honesty, what makes it so bad is comparing it to the originals. If this was just a standalone IP, it might not seem so bad. Not great, but not awful. It'd be about average of the market today, which really isn't something to be proud of. Now of  course people might say ""Hey, you can't really compare it to the originals because it's a reboot and it's 2014 and blah blah."" But I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that. If they didn't want people to compare it to the originals, then they shouldn't have used that IP.Pros:Garrett has more weight now. It feels like you're controlling a person, not just a flying camera that can move things.The art design(minus Garrett's design, which is terrible) is pretty good, if monochromatic.Graphically, it is pretty.The menu for choosing your difficulty options is pretty sweet.Cons:Literally everything else.The story seems to have been written by one of my 16 year old cousins when he was high.As does all the dialogue(One character literally says ""We're not so different, you and I."").Speaking of dialogue, NPCs will just repeat the one line assigned to them, over and over again.Sound design if awful. Someone speaking outside in the street will sound like they're right over your shoulder, when you're inside.The music choices are incredibly jarring and do not fit the atmosphere at all.Level design is linear and mostly a rehash of levels from the originals.Loading screens out the♥♥♥♥♥ Especially annoying are the ones hidden behind an action(I.E. opening a window or crawling through a tight space). They probably wouldn't seem to bad if they didn't occur roughly every 10 minutes.The contexual jumping mechanic is awful. A game is almost never improved when control is taken away from the player, especially since this is based off a series of games in which freedom of movement was a huge factor.FYI: If you don't like the review, you need to put forth an actual argument, or I'll just delete your comment.

												DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NEVER PLAYED ANY OF THE THIEF GAMES BEFORE THIS ONE. I HAVE NO NOSTALGIA TOWARDS THEM EITHER. THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON THIS GAME ITSELF.All I can say about this game is to stay away unless it's on sale. I haven't picked it up since 2014. The graphics are really great but the characters are as boring as a piece of cardboard and the gameplay is mediocre at best. It judges your score based on how many kills you don't get, and it makes you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥about it if you end up taking a life for the sake of your mission. There aren't a lot of ways you can succeed in a mission without killing an enemy, unlike Dishonored, which is a similar game. Overall, The game is bland, the story is bland, it discourages the use of all of the -many- killing tools it gives you,  the characters are bland, the graphics are pretty good, but overall it fails to be interesting enough for me to even bother finishing the game. 2/10, I wouldn't even buy this if it were on sale.

												This game was designed for console Call of Doody kids, riding on the coat tails of the ""Thief"" franchise in name only.  For this reason, I cannot recommend this game.  If they named this game something like ""Call of Burgler"" then I would give it the thumbs up if it were on sale.  Gameplay consists of being funneled to checkpoints to unlock cut scenes and avoiding guards in the meatime. The story is convoluted and world is totally bizzare and not immersive in the slightest.Credit is due to the artists and the folks responsible for the PC port (yes, this is a port). The environments are exquisitely detailed and there are numerous options to tweak the graphics, UI, and difficulty to your liking.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the franchise, I've waited patiently for new Thief for many years. To be perfectly honest I'm not disappointed with THIEF, I'm enjoying every minute of it. I've read many ""harsh"" reviews, I can't agree with them. Times have changed, but you have a choice to play it just like the old titles with hints or objects highlights disabled. The amount of game and difficulty options is truly impressive. There's no other game like Thief :)			"

												I can't even continue with this game. I got this in the eidos anthology with a crap load of great games. I paid about 31 dollars for 34 games, so I paid less than a dollar for this game. I played the original thief and didn't really understand everything that was going on but found it enjoyable. I was expecting this to be the 21st century update with better stealth gameplay and graphics. I was looking forward to hearing Garret's sarcastic comments about the people he was robbing blind once again. But I was given a game that had was weak in character and threw the Thief name to the wind and replaced a beloved franchise with a game with less content and less intrigue than a game that came out 20 years ago. I can't even begin to express my frustration at the linearity and how streamlined this series has become. I give this game a 4/10. It wasn't worth less than a dollar			"

												My good experiences as a thief or burglar in video games typically stem from a freedom to choose which house you want to rob, what items you want to grab, where you need to fence the items, and what gear you can take with you. Take any of those elements and add depth with leveling skills or abilities and you have a deep, worth-while experience. They all add together to create the illusion that you are actually a thief and that you are responsible for everything that happens. This game seems to lack the depth and freedom necessary to hold up to those standards which have already been established in games well over ten years old. I can't reccommend this game knowing that there are others out there which have nailed the burglar experience.			"

												Suddenly it makes sense why this game was stuck in developmental hell... Well, it actually doesn't make sense since this type of game should be so simple to do right, but here we are.A terrible and pointless story. It detracts, never adds. Honestly, why bother? You'd be better off spending that money on talent to develop a proper THIEVING game. Gameplay-wise you feel more like a thief in Skyrim and Oblivion. The mechanics in this game are so half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ implemented so poorly it really doesn't feel like a dedicated Thief game. There are no satisfying missions, dialogue is just as terrible as the story and there is no thrill to the hunt. Poorly designed levels and AI. Hitman Absolution had better stealth tactics than this nonsense.I know we'd all complain if this game was never released but, well, sometimes publishers actually know what they're doing when they want to cancel a game that was almost finished.Thief isn't a TERRIBLE game but it sure as heck isn't a GOOD game. Not by today's standards, at least.			"

												I just can't like this game. Aside the fact this is not a title for legacy Thief fans, its just a poorly executed in itself.Beautiful level design and detail, but feels like a benchmark program that you have been dropped into and can walk about in. You can't actually do that much with the environments around you that are 'thief like' - the open world-ish side to the game that it tries to pull off is a lie.Stealth and AI is acceptible but again you are confined by the level design; for example, In the open city Stonemarket, there is a side mission to steal something from a local doctors. To get in you must open a window, inside there are 2 guards, 1 civilian NPC but you are tied into 2 rooms and one corridor... if you are seen and need to hide... where do you go? You can't dash out the window... you are running into room 1, then chased into room 2, then into the corridor, dodge, back to room 2, back to room 1... your ♥♥♥♥ed basically. To open the window you have to mash the use key, which you can't do in (shudder) 'combat mode' anyway... Who thought this was a good idea? Garrett, the master thief, trapped by a window he just opened two minutes earlier... Really?Every action is a cumbersome longwinded animation of Garretts busy hands, rummaging through drawers, opening doors, peeping round corners, lunging up rooftops, opening randomly placed wardrobes and cupboards to save the game.... on top of not being able to quickly open anything like a total tard, actually makes you feel like a bumbling gimp in a tight leather suit, not some master thief.I tried to like it, I started the game again and again and I just can't bring myself like it... Other than the impressive visuals, the gameplay, well its just a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't find any fun or satisfaction in sneaking about or climbing up the clearly marked white bits of the city.Developers should have kept it simple, stuck to the roots of Thief 1,2 and even 3 a bit more. Made it a quicker, more punchy and fast paced sneak in, sneak out. Risk vs equipment vs partolling guards. Thief fans of old, definitely avoid. New thief players - Honestly? Buy the Dishonored collection, despite being a different game it does the whole thiefy thang a lot better than this. "

												I'll give this version of Thief a luke warm recommendation.  It does a lot of things right, but the things it does wrong can make for a frustrating experience.Let's start with the good things.  This game is beautiful.  The graphics, environments, lighting and particle effects are amazing.  It would have been nice for a little more variety in locations, but the environments are amazingly detailed.   The mission levels design is excellent.  You'll find many paths to navigate to reach your goal, and will be hard pressed to find 100% loot each mission.  Even when I thought I was being very thoroughly obsessive searching for loot, I've always come up short, and a few times nowhere close to 100%.  The looting animation is really well done.  You'll feel like a sneaky thief as Garrett lightly plucks items off unsuspecting persons and rummages through desks and cabinets.One final thing well done in this version of Thief is the options menu.  This is how all PC games should be treated.  The amount of customization is insane.  Not just video and sound, but game play features that allow you to find an exact level of difficulty outside the confines of the Easy, Normal, and Hard presets.Let's now discuss some flaws / complaints.  The first being the double edged sword that is the hub city.  The hub city is where you'll do all your side jobs, and navigate to the locations where all the story missions load.  It is both beautifully detailed and intricately designed, but infuriatingly frustrating to navigate until you've learned your way through the various shortcut locations.  The map / mini-map are relatively useless as it will put a marker at your destination, but show no path to get there.  I enjoy freedom to do missions my own way, but a little pathway help through the hub city would've saved me a lot of time and frustration.The second flaw is poorly executed positional sound.  In a stealthy game sound is probably the most important feature besides the shadow mechanics.  Many times in Thief I'd hear a loud conversation as if somebody was near, only to look and see nobody in sight.  Conversely there were times I was spying through peek holes and could barely hear the conversation.  This inconsistency makes it difficult to depend on sound to detect where guards are, and you become strictly reliant on visual contact.The third issue I noticed was broken or poorly programmed AI.  There were times I saw enemy patrols stop their route and stand forever without moving again.  At first I thought it was intended, but after reloading a save game the same guard that was standing still once again started patrols.   This bug frequently caused me to lose ghost status, as they'd often stop exactly where I needed to go.  I started losing my patience waiting to see if guards will resume patrols, and elected to change style by forgoing being undetected for a swift opportunistic knockout.My final issue is minor complaining about mechanics and story.  While I'm glad they totally removed the Quick Time Events, I'm not sure the platform segments were a necessity either.  It felt like a weak attempt to copy Assassin Creed, or Tomb Raider, while the story felt like a copy of Dishonored.  This story was to bland for Thief.  I wanted Hammerites and Pagans, and we got city guard by the truck load.  I usually get into a games story and soak in all details of backstory, but I had a difficult time with Thief.   Half the time I couldn't remember why I was doing the mission, except for looting as much as possible.  And I literally said, ""What just happened?"" at the final cutscene.So,  all in all if you can tolerate a few bugs and frustrations Thief has some memorable cool missions despite a shallow bland story.  It's definitely worthy of the current $15 sales price.			"

												Not good at reviews. I didn't particuarly enjoy this game. I was kind of going okay through it up till about Chapter 4, then as the plot shifted in Chapter 5 I just lost all interest, by the end of Chapter 6 I gave up trying to collect all the loot and documents in the chapter, and the cinematic railroad ending to Chp 6 was more annoying than interesting. I slogged through the remaining 2 Chapters (that ending left me seriously no plussed) and then unistalled it without going back to finish all side missions. I'd done about 18 of them and that was enough. For me, basically, the story was rubbish.The stealth mechanic was largely well done, chunks of the game had a nice set of alternative routes and allowed you to sneak as you wanted. Combat I basically avoided, and did just reload when I alerted too many enemies.The video segments seem to run at a horribly low framerate compared to the game. Steam was claiming it was running at 60fps during the videos but they looked more like 24-30fps; horribly stuttery (even running from SSD).Music and atmosphere were well done, though something was wacky with the speech. At times it was buried too far to hear clearly even when you were looking at the two people talking to each other.The game generally ran at a solid 60fps on my rig (i7 4790k, GTX 970, 16GB Ram, Win 10), though there were times when the fire effects (in the area just before you start Chp 7) and other atmospheric effects which were making the framerate tank.Little things that bugged me, the loot you steal throughout the game, the narrow passage ways that you shimmy through and ALWAYS have to lift a beam by mashing the E key, that if you start to open a window you can't back out, you have to open it and go through by mashing the E key, the fact that the NPC soldiers skins changed each time you reloaded a save, sometimes terribly blind AI and so on.

												Sadly, Thief is one of the worst games I've ever played.I wanted to love it, the originals were very formative to my gaming tastes back in the day, and I loved the work Eidos-Montreal did on Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Unfortunately, somehow events have conspired to produce something so poor I wouldn't recommend it if it were free.Now, clearly as a fan of the original games I'm disappointed by the disconnect and huge disservice that the game plays to the Thief lore and world, but lets put that aside for this review. Those gripes have likely been well-trodden on forums and review boards all over the 'net. Instead, I'll focus on the game as it exists outside of 'Thief' cannon.Mechanically, the game is average to poor. The stealth mechanics are servicable enough, although the controls are fairly clunky (I played with keyboard and mouse). Sneaking about feels relatively fluid, but with levels so linear they'd probably better be described as two-pronged corridors, there's little need for inventive stealth. This isn't a game that respects your options and input, it's a game that expects you to jump through hoops. Your objectives are telegraphed in stages, almost corridor-by-corridor, and there's little room to explore beyond these objectives within the main missions. I understand there are side missions, but with main missions as dull and poorly written as I experienced, I couldn't think of a reason to want to wander into side mission territory.Then we come to the worst crime the game commits; its narrative (again, even disregarding how it fits into the Thief universe). The story focuses on Garrett, 'master thief', who starts the game annoyed by an old protogé, Erin. She's loud, petulent and obnoxious. I think we're supposed to think she's 'cool' and 'edgy' however, as the game tries to set her up as something of a damsel in distress. When she 'dies' during the prologue you breathe a sigh of relief, only to find that she crops up constantly throughout the game as an angst-ridden ghost spurring you to save her for some reason despite her constant angsty objections. This teenage angst is somehow supposed to be inspiring and a driving factor, but it just constantly grates and grinds.The cutscenes feel strange and out-of-place, like they were rushed and unfinished. The game feels like it was scrunched together from several disparate parts... there's an item called the primal (which causes the angsty ghostiness), somehow it's related to a book and a ring (which isn't really explained), there's a giant arc being constructed at some point (which is also never really explained), and there's a plan to 'bring order' to the city through some ritual that is left so vague as that you seem to be expected to write a reason in yourself. It looks like it might involve robots, but who knows, really (and I've completed it). The ending feels like it comes out of nowhere, randomly introducing a few new parts that are given no explanation, and the actual ending cutscene doesn't make any sense, simply leaving you with the credits rolling as though you're not supposed to expect an actual conclusion to the story.The game suffers from constant continuity errors within it's own plot, the world itself feels quite shallow despite looking interesting, and none of the characters feel like they have lives and goals outside of their simple existence to spout off cheap one-liners and clumsy exposition in cutscenes. There's a level of immaturity in the writing and content that feels like a child's idea of what an adult game should include; the frequent swearing feels like it's trying to prove the game is gritty and serious, there's a level designed around the cheap thrills of viewing people having sex, talking about sex, and being naked in a brothel, and one of the villains genuinely has a moustache that I reckon he twirls when you're not looking. Now some of those may sound like amusing positive points... but trust me, they're really not.Furthermore, there are multiple s-shaped narrow corridors you must squeeze through, halfway through these there is ALWAYS a fallen wooden beam which must be moved via a button-mashing quick-time event. These are used to thinly disguise a loading screen, giving the game time to load the next miniscule forked corridor. These are repeated constantly and shamelessly, you recognise what is happening by the time you reach the second s-shaped corridor, becoming an immersion-destroying reminder that you're playing a subpar game and destroying any hope of creating an engaging atmosphere.In general very little care and attention to meaningful world-building has been made, instead the developers seem content to use cliché shorthand techniques and shallow characters to create an 'epic' feel to a game that doesn't do anything to deserve that feeling, leaving you cheated. Overall, the game is an uninspired missmash of disparate elements, mediocre mechanics and terrible level design all wrapped around a dire plot that never quite connects together. I wish there was something worthwhile in here, but the whole experience grew more and more painful the further in I got.Perhaps the only thing I can say in the positive; there's some nice visual design to the city itself.Other than that, I'd recommend avoiding the game, no matter how cheap it gets.

												First you'll cringe at Garrett's new voice. Then you'll wince at the new story. Then you blink, absorbing the visuals and trying to ignore the audio. Then you warm up to the game, starting to appreciate the reboot's new direction. Then you start to enjoy yourself, getting into the meat of the level designs and AI quirks. And then you facepalm, repeatedly, non-stop, forever, as the story erodes every last shred of goodwill, with cheese-bursting cutscenes about ghostly energy and Primals and megalomaniacal siblings unleashing cult members to change the world. They could have scrapped the hub town, deleted the story, and just made ~10 large intricate sneaking levels, saving production money, and everything would have been fine, even without Garrett's old voice. As a game, Thief is competent, even beautiful, and its apparent many people worked hard on it. Buy it on sale and get lost for a few weekends. As a Thief branded game, its a disappointing mess, discarding old characters and methods for misguided AAA marketing ideas and can only be recommended for rubbernecking at the train wreck. No Hammerites, no Pagans, no taffers. But plenty of expletive-laden spit-shined shlock.

												Thief is a game that exists between two worlds--the world of classic PC gaming and the realm of contemporary trends. Credit must be given to the developers for striking a balance between the two. The more imporant question, however, is whether this balance accomplishes the lofty goals and expectations that it set out to achieve. My answer is: somewhat.The mechanics of the game do take some time to become acquainted with, even for veteran PC players. This is often the case for many games, simply adjusting to the movement, flow, pacing, control schemes, and rules of the game. Once the player gets the hang of things, it becomes slightly second-nature to explore the game world. In full disclosure, certain aspects of the controls and mechanics do occasionally disobey the player's command, though far less than some of the other contemporary games out there.In terms of visuals, audio, and mood and tone, the game is mostly successful. It looks good and plays smoothly enough with properly attuned graphics options. The audio, which is a significant component of the game, does its job, though nothing stands out as impressive or iconic. There were times when certain sound effects, in response to player actions, were too loud and distracting--particularly for a stealth game. As for mood and tone, the game's setting and world feel alive and fleshed out, though perhaps not to the same degree as its forebearers.The plot and characters were a weaker aspect. While a reboot, essentially, the character of Garrett felt off for that of a master thief. The original Garrett was someone that preferred to be alone to ply his trade, whereas this Garrett is a man that is more sympathetic to others, more trusting, and less of a loner. Old fans will find it jarring, but new fans should enjoy it well enough. The Thief series was never strong in the story department, and this entry is no different. Most of the charm comes in the details of the world and its inhabitants--notes, rumors, and environmental cues. Those are the rich tidbits that make the game interesting. Veteran players will miss the tropes, jargon, and factions of the old series, but there are subtle, silent hints of the setting's history.Replayability is strong. The game allows the player to revisit missions in an attempt to steal more items and attain a higher score than before. Many hours can be spent in the game, at various paces set out by the player. The difficulty ranges, and the player can customize difficulty options prior to starting a game. Some mechanics and user interface options are entirely optional, which is a boon for players, old and new.All in all, Thief is a very fun game, though it will not scratch the itch of the old games in exactly the same way. Much effort clearly went into this game's creation, and there are many successes with few failures. I recommend this game to PC gamers that appreciate stealth, creativity, and a deliberate pace. Just know that it won't win any awards.			"

												Ah Thief. A beloved franchise that is quite dear to my heart!  I'm a huge fan of the older Thief games, which I played multiple times over the years ever since the release of The Dark Project in 1999/2000 and I was quite excited to learn that a new Thief game was being made. To put you into perspective, I was so happy that it got announced and confirmed that a new Thief game was being made and best of all, developed by the talented Eidos Montreal who made that great gem which is Deus Ex: Human Revolution, a prequel game set before the events of the older Deus Ex games. It was all raved and I did too, loved that game very much. They didn't messed up the story, continuity of the previous older Deus Ex classics. Eidos Montreal earned my deepest respects with that masterpiece! Sure, that game may not be better than the first Deus Ex, but it was the second best of that franchise.Then, came the announce of ""THI4F"". At that time, not much was revealed but it was hinted to be a sequel to Thief: Deadly Shadows (Thief 3) so at that time, no big deal, I was quite excited! And then, silence... for a long time... until news arisen that the game was being, made into a ""pseudo reinvention"", not totally a reboot nor a remake; and especially not a sequel. ""Pseudo"" as this Thief game doesn't explain Garrett's origins and starts the game with him as being the super master thief around... Like it is a game that occurs in a different universe than the Thief Classics.Now, I got worried... especially with the E3 2013 showing (lots of AI issues shown live)Months later, I was beginning to be very concerned for this game. Why discarding the previous work of the franchise? Thief is a niche franchise and the fans holds dearly the past games! And once some scraps of info got revealed time to time, my concerns were completely justified. Bad news after bad news (QTE, Stephen Russell replaced, etc), I was getting so letdown by this new Thief game. I tried to be hopefull and even dared to PreOrder the game, to show my support to EM but alas, they really disappointed me badly with this product.This Thief is not a mediocre game, it can be fun at times and many missions are reminescent to Thief 2 style. But for the true Thief fans from the original classic games, you will be VERY VERY dissappointed. This game doesn't really have the same ambiance of the classics. Benny's and taffer pals are gone, meaning no more humor between the guards. Citizens wandering around the city do not acknowledge you or even see you; giving them a robotic feel. The story is totally the biggest con of this Thief. It did everything to forget and distance itself from everything related to Thief Classics. In this new Thief, no more magic, supernatural elements are gone, THE CITY ain't steampunk anymore! And, what happened to the Hammers? The Pagans? Keepers? Trickster? Viktoria? What about Mechanist robots, Pagan creatures, Keepers, Gods? GONE!!! All discarded! Worse, your mechanist eye has different story and ain't even ""mechanist"" anymore but some bullcrap like ""Primal"", which explains the use of FOCUS function in the game; that highlights your surroundings / loots / traps to ease of your gameplay.A big annoyance in this game (it is also present in many other games and I'm very annoyed by it) is the many contextual applied for this game. You have to watch Garrett steal and interact with everything as opposed to just taking things like the Thief classics. Why a problem? Well, it slows you down for crying out loud! I haven't really dabbled with the combat in this Thief since this game is all about being stealthy and not a tank warrior! From what I tried in the Master difficulty level, you die in two hits... so you better be good at dodging! Still, I'd say this combat system is more realistic and modern. The game offers 8 Chapters and about 30 side missions. There is also a challenge mode that you play a map of your choice, then try to accomplish a set count of challenges. It can be fun for a while but since the game only offer three maps now, it'll get stale fast!Now, I will go with the pros and then, the long list of cons.PROS:+Stealth ambiance/atmosphere is there and mostly well done.+Graphically/visuals impressive.+Fun missions and many side missions.+Custom options on your gameplay. Can disable HUD, Focus, etc. Lots of possible customizations!+Upgrade system is kinda neat but also, weirdly implemented as your supposed to be THEE Master Thief!+Swooping mechanic is neat and quite a blast to perform.+Refined combat system compared to past Thief classics.+Asylum level is tense, creepy at times too but short of being as scary as Thief 3: Deadly Shadows' Shalebridge Cradle level.+Bank Heist DLC is very reminiscent of Thief 2 Bank mission. Highly recommended!CONS:-NO BENNY! NO TAFFERS!-Stephen Russell, aka the voice actor of many characters on previous Thief games (Garrett, Benny, Karras, etc), was replaced by Romano Orzari; ""a disconnect"" the developers said but it was the developers who were disconnected from the true Thief genre. Full body motion technology was barely witnessed in-game so it was really a cheap excuse to dispose of Russell's that easily.-A few stuttering issues, bugs and unstable at release. Mostly fixed by now though.-Everything ignored on past Thief games except ""Garrett, The City, Basso and Jenivere"" names in this game. -Old factions gone! No Hammerites, Mechanists, Pagans, Trickster.-Mechanist Eye is gone and replaced by some ""Primal"" crap, which explains the FOCUS function if you enable/use it.-Sandbox navigation system is bad in this game. You easily get lost and try to find the proper path for a side mission or main mission. There's many loading too in this game... way too many.-Abysmal story. Lazy poor a$$ narrative writing.-Way too many contextual situations. Like being forced to do the developer's desired action.-Boring and uninspired NPCs.-No Eric Brosius soundtrack composer. This Thief Luc St-Pierre composer ain't bad but no Brosius.-You cannot jump at will, you cannot use your rope-arrows on any wooden surface but only the developers specified areas. Your ""choke-arrow"" (known as Gas Arrow on Thief classics) only ""choke"" the targets and do not render sleep.-Buggy AI-Sound propagation is messy and at many times, you either don't hear footsteps or door opening/closing. Also, there's sound clipping and repeated sentences.-Forced boss fight. Sure you can run and escape but it is so tedious that doing the fight is just less of a hassle.-Limited replay value.-STILL NO BENNY!OVERALL:Thief is an okay stealth game but as a THIEF-based game, very bad. Lots of bad decisions during development. The developers kept telling about ""a disconnect"" between fans and them, well duh! You, Eidos Montreal, made many bad calls for this game and it shows. And actually, EM simply should have used another name and make their own stealth game instead of screwing the great masterpieces of the past. Why didn't they just created a new character instead of messing up Garrett? A big irritant is why oh why did they just ignored the fans feedback for their game? Fans knew what was correct and what wasn't, yet, EM gave the fans the middle finger!RECOMMENDATION:Honestly, the worst Thief game. If you loved the Thief classics, you won't love this one. You may enjoy parts of it like I did but still, you'll be very disappointed in this iteration of Thief. My best advice... either play the GOOD OLD Thief classics or if you seek a modern game, play Dishonored! Granted Dishonored is more action-oriented but you can choose to play as a ghost as well. As for this ""THIEF"", wait for a sale!Eidos Montreal, you are big TAFFERS for screwing up this franchise!RATING:As a Stealth game: 6.0 / 10As a Thief game: 5.0 / 10FINAL:5.5 / 10PS: That river must really stink in The City... every NPC keeps talking about it!

Fairly quick but still a break in the flow.Overall, I had great time with Thief.			"

												     So far, the gameplay of this game has been pretty nice. I haven't really gotten into the storyline yet, but I've already found something that really is annoying. When I read the ""Nudity"" rating on this game, I assumed it was going to be an easily avoidable thing on one mission, like Dishonored at the Golden Cat. But no. Literally 99.99% of all framed pictures in this game (that I have seen thus far) are of naked females, and there's no reason for it. The paintings aren't very high-res, but it's still really annoying.      If there was a mod or something to get rid of this, I'd certainly play through this game, but as is, I don't see myself playing it again. If you don't want massive amounts of Nudity in your games, stay away from this one.			"

												Screw you all - turn off ALL the helper settings (and I mean ALL, no exceptions) crank the difficulty RIGHT UP, and get immersed in the game.  This is a worthy successor. I feel like I'm lost in the world of Thief again, a feeling I haven't felt since Thief 1 and 2.  For the record I enjoyed Thief Deadly Shadows but it was fairly weak in comparison, and overall felt poorly made.This one is oozing hard work and meticulous care at every turn and every crevasse - and I mean that.  The city is so full of nooks and crannys, I felt myself getting lost in the alleyways and staring at a doorway with a sign above, wondering what its like for that house or shop during the day.  The city is layered upon layers, of old buildings somehow impossibly built upon other old buildings and streets, in a fantastical dream-like way which still seems believable and gives me the impression that people actually live on these different levels.To me, the AI is impressive yet fair.  No matter how good I get at the game, I cannot race through the city towards another side mission without stopping and taking time.  Even with the swoop mechanic (which I love by the way) moving fast will almost certainly cause some guard to turn their head at the moving shadow in the alleyway, go investigate, cause a fuss which will put others on alert, and your careless continued running will certainly be spotted - and you'll be chased.  This will likely end in your death, and best case, cause you a lot of lost time and potentially lost resources as you do what you can to escape and wait till the whole thing blows over.  Damn you, developers! I cannot carelessly exploit the AI as I could in the original game - I MUST take care and play like a proper thief!  (PS. that means they did their job.)As for the artwork, story, dialogue etc. it has the same level of care, but I want to keep this review short.  Watching the dialogue between the effeminate (male!) brothel owner and the ThiefTaker General had me invested in the conversation, as he stood up to the brutish General and would not let him mistreat the women. Original things like the sex workers at the brothel being called ""Petals"" show that they really have taken care to flesh this world out and want you to get immersed in it.And the plot is multi-layered enough and full of enough content to be worthy of the Thief title.  By that I mean, there is initially enough content there for a full game - main bad guy, baddies, storyline, quests along it - but then it turns out there's something else, which leads to a different set of content than those things... and maybe something else again... I tell you, there is so much work put into this.Why am I gushing when so many have written the game off, claiming they've completed it easily and  it was boring? Well, they didn't turn off all the helpers and max out the difficulty settings - this is the way the game is meant to be played, and causes you to take your time, and experiences all the subtleties that make the game what it is.And I believe this is the fault of the developer.  Sorry guys, if you had more guts and confidence in what you had to offer, and hadn't bent to the apparent whim of the general public to have their video game challenges made ""easy"" and ""handed on a platter"" then you would have not watered it down with so many ""helper"" options that neutralise all the experiences the game has to offer, and, like Dark Souls, simply presented the game the way it was meant to be played in the first place, and then taught the user how to play the game as they progress through.Even if someone held a gun to your head and said ""No! You must provide a fisher-price baby easy way to play the game, or people will complain it's too hard!"" then you could have opened with a simple difficulty choice menu that said ""Easy mode - for casual gamers."" and then  ""Thief mode: play this mode for the full experience"", the latter would disable all the helper settings and crank the difficulty up.  And then as a third option, a ""Customise..."" option which takes you to the settings menu that you have, where you can toggle the helpers and difficulty setting.I am glad this game exists, and that I'm still playing my way through (I think I'm half way?) and that there are so many damn side quests and extra jobs that I will be busy enough for the foreseeable future!   And yet I am sad - that the public opinion of this game has been sabotaged by the developers themselves, for not having the confidence to present the game the way it was meant to be played, by default, and as a result, it's unlikely we'll ever see another thief game again, especially of this calibre.

												I try to avoid too much in the way of spoilers for things like this, primarily because I know that it will never live up to my expectations. I had hoped - following on from the decent work done on the latest Deus Ex and Tomb Raider - that Squenix would be properly placed to do Thief some justice, even if it failed to meet my lofty requirements.And, if you don't know the Thief series, and have little exposure to any kind of stealth-style games, then you might actually enjoy this title more than I am. For me, its plagued with crashes, out-of-sync audio, and mediocre-at-best stealth gameplay.My primary gripe, and one of the things I'm struggling with not boycotting it for, is the lack of Stephen Russell's voice as the excellent Garrett - a choice made for the purposes of full-body motion capture; and a point that is entirely moot since the words spoken are out of sync with the lip movements anyway. Such a shame. Perhaps I am just unlucky in my PCs spec though...I was going to play through before writing any kind of review, but the fact is, I can't. The game crashes at a certain point and I cannot progress.Being sneaky still carries a certain satisfaction, but rather than a true 'Thief' game, this feels a lot more like a cut-rate Dishonored, and I LIKED Dishonored.Give it a go by all means, but you'll be better placed playing the first two installments (and the third, if only for one of the levels - if you've played it, yes, I mean THAT one), and you'll same some money in the process!

												What an absolute waste of time & money.Only good aspect of game is its' artistic side. High quality models, environments (for the most part).Gameplay is too slow paced, mostly due to slow♥♥♥♥♥animations during everything you do. It gives a sense of immersion at first but they are so frequently used so it gets hell of a boring thing just to open a window, pass through a gap etc...Compass works weird, you can't navigate which game ""cell"" you are supposed to go to do your quests.I've seen AI hasn't really been the strong aspect of such games but I can say ""Thief"" has the worst AI similar games probably.I advise ""Dishonored"" if you are interested in stealth games, just pass this for your own sake.

												A good sneaking game with great stealth mechanics is hard to come by these days.I have been a fan of the Thief series since the original game, Thief: The Dark Project by Looking Glass Studios came out in 1998. The games were great fun finding your own way to sneak into a building or residence, and taking the target loot from them. The Thief games have always made shadows your friend, and in many ways was a pioneer with lighting in games. Players use shadows to hide from the guards and hoping they don’t see you. The series for the most part has almost always been about stealth and not confrontation, and this is no different in Eidos Montreal’s take on the game.Players take the role of Garrett, a master thief, and he has been hired to steal the Primal Stone. Along the way we run into Erin, another thief, and discover that stealing the Primal Stone is a two person job. Once you reach the location of the stone, however, some bad things happen and Erin is presumed dead. During this mission players are given very easy to follow and understand tutorials, helping players to understand how the game mechanics work.Once the prologue mission is over, Garrett must make his way to the clock tower, and there the game truly begins.The world of Thief is a fully imagined fantasy world with a dash of industrial revolution. It’s a dark, very compact city making traversing the roofs fairly easy and fun, making you feel like an actual thief. Garrett’s handler, Basso, sends the master thief out to steal various objects around the city. At this point Garrett can make his way to the mission point in the city any way he wants or just break into a house to steal some trinkets  — just make sure the watch isn’t around. Once Garrett reaches the starting point of a mission, there is a brief cut scene and then the mission starts.Garrett has many tools to use while sneaking around. Tools for making distractions, putting out light sources, stunning guards, etc. Aside from his hands, he can use items like his bow with water arrows to put out light sources from a distance, or rope arrows to help him climb. His blackjack is used to knock out guards, the claw is used to hook onto ledges and help pull him up out of range of guards. As items are taken during missions, they are automatically turned into gold, and then can be used to upgrade or buy new tools.Sneaking around during missions is extremely satisfying, especially when sneaking up on guards and relieving them of their wallets, keys, or whatever else they have in their possession. Players will feel very satisfied when successfully avoid particularly well placed guards by using all the tools in their arsenal. When guards think they see you an eye appears over their heads, the eye slowly fills up as long as you are in their field of view. Once it fills, the guard has seen you and he alerts other guards around him. Once guards are alerted, Garrett can run and try to hide, or fight the guards. Combat in Thief is extremely clumsy and difficult and for the most part if you engage in more than one target at a time, which makes it obvious that Garrett is a master thief not a master swordsman.One of the tools that Garrett has in his arsenal are empty bottles. They can be found in the environments and thrown to distract guards. But be careful, if you do it too many times in the same area, the guards will be alerted to your presence. A big complaint with this mechanic in the game is that more than once I have come across a couple of empty bottles that I could not take, and Garrett can only carry one bottle at a time.A nice touch within the game’s environment is the placement of notes and other objects that can be used to find loot. For example, early in the game players come across a note written by a voyeur detailing where a safe in a house is. Overhearing conversations can also reveal details on where valuables can be found in the city.This Thief review is based on the PC version of the game, so the issue may not be present in other versions, but there seems to be issues with the audio.When ducking out of the rain, such as breaking into a jeweler’s store to relieve them if their product, the noise of the rain gets dulled just like it should. The annoyance comes from if there is a window open there is no gradual increase in the sound of the rain the closer you get to the window. The sound of the rain is either there or not depending on how close to the window you are. Similarly, when eavesdropping outside a window, the conversation happening on the other side of the glass is heard clear as day, even across the street.When spotted, a tense music theme starts playing to create a sense of urgency to get out of sight and hide. However, the music can be a burden, also popping up while you are sneaking around keeping your ears open for guard’s footsteps. A stealth game like this should be quiet with no music unless spotted, as a thief’s ears are one of his best assets.Overall Thief is an enjoyable experience that deserves to be played and explored if you are a fan of stealth games.

												This is a tough recommendation to make. Thief is an interesting enough reboot of the classic franchise, but it can't be compared to the older games as it's a much less open game. That being said, the levels are pretty large by modern standards, and there's plenty of ways to tackle each situation. Stealth is your best option, as combat is (intentionally) difficult. You're no super hero or anything here.Eight story missions (outside of the prologue) doesn't sound like much, but it'll last you a good 10 hours - more if you go for all the side quests and try to loot everything (there's a LOT of stuff to steal - this IS a Thief game after all). Theft is your only source of income, though there's not much to spend it on other than skill points - which you don't NEED to finish the game, and are available for free at certain points.Thief is surprisingly demanding on your hardware for a game originally designed for almost ten-year old hardware (Xbox 360/Playstation 3). I can run most things pretty well, but even with most options set to low, I had a few performance issues. Perhaps not a well-optimised port? In any case, I managed a reasonable framerate throughout, and rarely came across any particularly bad bugs - a few clipping issues and ragdoll glitches mostly.Is Thief a good game? Yes. Is there room for improvement? Definitely. Some of the levels aren't designed particularly well, and a lot require you to go down a set path to get through undetected. I'll give the game credit for actually making me think about my approach - a rarity in today's age of hand-holding, corridor-like gameplay.My biggest complaint is the jumping mechanics - the jump button serves a few other functions as well, such as climbing. This leads to Garrett jumping down pits to his death instead of across to another ledge. It gets very frustrating and ruins the fun. There's plenty of other keys available - why can't I map climb and jump to seperate keys?Anyway, if you can get past a few poor design choices and a story that goes off the rails towards the end, I'd recommend picking this one up. I enjoyed it while it lasted, for the most part.			"

												This  game released in a ton of negative press: reviews were in the ""it's okay, perhaps quite good"" realm of 7/10; fans of the series were ANGRY (some of it justifiable); the story was absolutely appalling; there were many questionable design decisions such as quick-time events (QTE's), action scenes and even two boss fights that were heavily criticised.The bad The story really IS a mess! The sequel became SO overdue that all the work done on early Thief 4 was useless (it took 10 years to release a sequel). Instead of starting over with a reboot, the early sequel scraps were glued together as best they could, and the game renamed from ""Thi4f"" (its working-title) to, simply, ""Thief"" and marketed as a reboot instead. Trouble is: the story appears to begin by picking up where Thief 3 left off (a young girl taken under Garrett's wing to learn the art of thievery), the protagonist is still called Garrett, but all the old factions that gave the early titles such atmosphere and lore were gone and the events are set some 800 years later! None of it makes sense. Worse, what the game does obviously well it never finishes: there are some excellent NPC characters you'll meet, but their story goes absolutely nowhere, and side missions often lead to nothing. The Queen of Beggars for example. You'll meet her and she's set up to play some unknown yet significant part in the game - yet she is then not used any further beyond a scripted trade point for skill power-ups. The QTEs have no real place in the game, though aren't quite as bad as was feared from previews of the game (a lot were stripped out after the preview backlash). Garrett's inability to jump where he might fall is annoying and removes all challenge from his parkour elements (plus can lead to him getting stuck behind barrels and boxes). And the cardinal sin: points of no return are rife - something that has NO place in a game built around finding collectibles! There are loads of side quests, many of them done well, but too many are all about sneaking into an empty room to steal something (no point beyond finding how to access the room - and people are just oddly missing when it's supposed to be the earliest hours after midnight). To make this more of a challenge, Garrett can no longer fire rope arrows just anywhere, and this upset a lot of players though I can appreciate why it was done (quite frankly there would be zero point to the side missions otherwise). So much else was criticised (such as the original voice for Garrett not being used - flimsy excuse provided, masses of loading sequences just to access an additional room or two, terrible and as yet unfixed audio problems and broken NPCs) that it's a wonder it scored anything at all!The good Despite all, the game is hugely atmospheric with gorgeous graphics and the stealth play is brilliantly done (the best of all the Thief titles). While the story is linear (and disjointed, often pointless), the locations are mostly of a good size and, like Dishonored, offer many points of access. Stealing is done really well, with the whole scene animated beautifully with Garret's arm reaching out tentatively, then whipping up the chosen object and concealing it (ie object doesn't just vanish in thin air). The scare chapter IS genuinely scary and very hard to get through for people who aren't seasoned horror fans, though opinions are divided on whether this is scarier than the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief Deadly Shadows (having played both games quite close to each other, I personally found Thief 2014's asylum more frightening). While there are those unforgivable points of no return, any mission can be replayed in any order just by walking to its 'access gate'. The controls are intuitive and gameplay is genuinely enjoyable. The Bank Heist DLC integrates well and is worth the extra for an additional couple of hours of stealth entertainment. I suspect that, if Square Enix had made more of an effort with the plot instead of rushing out the mess of bolted-together unfinished stories they released, it would have been more deserving of its Thief pedigree. I actually pre-ordered the game (doh!) but despite all the bad, I don't regret it and have replayed the game a couple of times since release.In summaryBad design decisions and broken plot with a muddle of reboot versus sequel marred the release of Thief 2014, yet underneath is a game that is genuinely entertaining and atmospheric with great gameplay mechanics.

												I had doubts getting this game, but I have heard of the Thief series being amazing in the past, so I went with it.**--Attention, there may be spoilers ahead!!--**Looking at the old games, they are indeed good. But this isn't something that connects to the old ones.Here are the game's pros/cons as I experience them (each explained later on). Note though that I've only played the main game and have not gotten around to downloading The Bank Heist yet.Pros:-looks good-a lot of gameplay (if you choose to complete every side quest and get every achievement, also making this a con for me)Cons:-not much gameplay for people who don't want every side quest and achievement-short story (ridiculous, too)-relatively small and linear maps, lots of points of no return-bad sound mechanics-bad fighting mechanics-bad enemy AI-a lot of stuff you don't learn until you either try every key in every possible situation or hope that the loading screen tips give you actual tips-no challenge unless you force yourself with achievements and side questsThe pros here definitely don't outweigh the cons, at least for me. Now, to analyze;Beginning with the story, it's short and pretty much meaningless -- the background and city are basically the same as Dishonored, some girl absorbs some magic from some ritual,♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down and from there on, you're partially Batman, there to save the world from the evil and gloom but only so because the game forces you, while your other parts of the brain are trying to piece together what the floop is happening. Spoiler; you never find out. You're expected to just ""roll with it."" You steal something for one guy, steal something else for another guy (boiling the gameplay down to that of the first AC game or even less) and after that you sneak around some (if you want to) and the game ends. The characters aren't any better than the story is; there's a damsel in distress, the power-hungry villain (who only appears to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good guy), the villain that really isn't one yet everyone wants you to think he is and the villain that appears every once in a while to hurt/chase you. There's also Basso who, for some reason, I like the most. Perhaps it was the slight sense of comedy and irony you got from him. I can't forget Garret, but there's not much to say about him as he's mostly silent. And when he isn't, he's boring. If I had a choice, I'd play the game as Basso. Sure you couldn't run or climb or do anything but at least he isn't as flooping boring.The Focus ability is never really explained (not like anything is, but this is a thing you're supposed to use all the time). Sure, I get to see things in blue and Quake Pro-like FOV, but it's not until the loading screen tips tell me at the end of the game that I find out I can get upgrades for it at the Queen of Beggars. The 3rd person climbing parts are annoying until you realize you can press ""X"" to go/fall down which would also have been a nice tip. You'd really expect to see a manual...Now I know I'm the kind of person who doesn't like side quests and achievements much, but this game takes my hate for them to a whole new level, solely because over half the game is hidden in there.The maps are small. Add to that the points of no return (PoNRs) and the maps feel even smaller. There is no room for exploration because you don't know where the PoNRs are and after you pass one, there is no going back unless you reload your savegame. And even though there are sometimes more ways than one to get somewhere, it's always the same effect. Speaking of PoNRs, they take a lot from the gameplay because you don't get punished if you just run around alerting everyone and jump into a PoNR. All alarms stop and nobody chases you after you pass them.Adding to all that ""notactics"" nonsense, there's more than meets the eye. You don't have to steal (which is funny because the title of the game is Thief), killing everyone is always an option and being stealthy is near impossible at times (forcing you to bring out the big arrows).Speaking of arrows, fighting needs discussing. You can't melee until you get proper upgrades (and even then you don't get any explanation) and even the biggest arrows in the forehead don't kill aware enemies. That said, you can escape by using other equipment, but that's meaningless since you then either blind yourself as well or make everyone explode, alerting even more guards to your presence.Ooh, and now we're hit guards; how wonderful, it all just keeps connecting.The enemy AI sucks. They're barely ever aware of you, as if they don't want to see you and are just asking for a hit over their head. The hardest enemies to pass are the weird pale monsters, but even those have an algorithm you can easily predict and swoop around.Sound. Ugh, don't get me started on that. The AIs keep repeating what they've already said, a lot of times they don't even finish the first thing only to somehow be able to speak from their butt to tell me two things at the same time.There's no difference in sound if a guard is walking next to me or if there's 2 walls between us and every time you take a guard down, the sound effects make you think somebody has seen you while you were doing the takedown.I've saved the worst for last.The game cannot decide what it wants to be. A detective game? Open-world exploration? Assassin's Creed? Free-running? FPS? Horror, perhaps?Who knows? But Thief somehow manages to be all that, and it does not succeed. The main reason is because you're supposed to be a guy stealing, not Batman and definitely not the guy from Slender: The Eight Pages. It wants to be more than all this, but fails to deliver in every aspect. And the most disappointing thing is that it fails to be a Thief game.I know the review is a bit long and I know it's not all connected as good as it should be. But then again, the game isn't apologizing to me, either.			"

												I had some serious framerate issues going on with this game, and I have not had this type of problem with other games I've played, but I'm not really sure if it's the game or me. Honestly, the story didn't kick off until chapter 4/5, but what they did with chapter 5 was pretty good. I'm awful with scary games, and most people would say it wasn't even scary so take that as you will. Having never played the original Theif games, I can't compare it to the others. I really liked the shadow concept, the stealth is a lot different than Dishonored and I found myself throwing bottles at people to knock them out which I thought was hilarious and I never tried that in Dishonored because of blink. The swoop concept is the same thing but less fun and weirdly executed, sometimes it just didn't work and felt awkward. I'm sure there is audio problems in this game as well. Focus was pointless, the game was not bad. If I didn't have framerate troubles I'd say it was definately decent, but Dishonored was still better. (Although I am aware that Dishonored was at least made by some of the same people who made the original Theif games, I believe?)			"

												It wasn't a very faithful reboot of the original series, you could breeze through missions by just going in all bows blazing (literally) and find it excruciatingly difficult while trying to be stealthy (which is the main point of the game). Coupled with annoying boss battles that are ridiculous and or cliche, as well as some scenes just straight up taking a dump on the original franchise e.g. running over a rooftop from a bunch of guards, explosions and chasing dogs. It also ended very suddenly, ambiguously and didn't explain much.When putting all that aside and considering that this is a company that most people won't have heard of as well as this being a Triple A title shows just how ambitious this project is. It's fun, dark has very impressive graphics and it's nice to have a new stealth game that isn't AC or Hitman. I also got very good Gametime (28 hours) out of it which is very refreshing.Overall I'd give it a solid 7/10 (Definitely recommend buying it in a sale but probably not at its full price)			"

												So I 'm climbing through an air vent and as i approach the exit I see a guard below. Either I press Q to use my takedown attack or I wait and then  jump down and be all stealthy. I decide to wait it out and be stealthy, the guard walks off and the press q to takedown text dissapears. Alright time to jump down says I. Go to jump down, cant jump down. Going back the way I came I can jump down just fine. Head back into vent and try to jump where guard was, cant jump down. This is very frustrating for a Thief game where I can't even decide whether I want to use a take down or not and its forced upon me.			"

Still game vas too easy with master difficulty. You even don't need to use any special arrows in whole game. City streets are something that developers shouldn't have left off. Side-quests are boring and rope arrows something that even Dark Messiah of Might and Magic made better. I have palyed Dishonored and Thief Gold, this should have something to do with my opinions.

												I did not feel that this game held true to the original Thief games. I did not like that you could not interact very well in the environment. I felt like I was forced to follow a particular path in the game when in the original's yes there was a format and a point but you could explore your environment better. There were aspects of the game that were OK, but overall, as a Thief fan, I really did not feel like it was a true Thief game. I can say that the look of the environments were pleasing and it looked like Thief, it just didn't feel like Thief. The side character was just weird. If we were able to interact better in the environment and maybe shoot a rope arrow on whatever wood surface we wanted to instead of just ""certain"" posts or points, then I think it would be better. If we could climb to the top of a roof of various structures, and move around where we wanted to, that would be more enjoyable. I think if this game was updated a little and fitted to the original structure, it would be more playable.			"

												Since steam has only recommend and dont recommend button i choosed recommend,but you can take it as maybe recommed.. Took me 22 hours to finish it. didnt do all the side quests,but quite many,i think if you rush its gonna be something like maybe 12-14 hours depending your play style.Im gonna write this review with 2 grades. once for those who never played thief series and one for those who played them before.Who played thief before:If youre looking for sweet gameplay and storyline as thief 1 and 2 forget it. this game is not ""Thief"" anymore. It has Garret whos not the garret. Forget hammerites and pagans.What comes to gameplay its totally ruined because sound just isnt there. example you gonna hear footsteps and the guard who is making the sounds is mile away,like 3-4 doors behind you,or upper floor or somewhere not even near you. also there are like 3 differents footstep sounds, 1: you step on any surface, 2: you step on water, 3: you step on glass and thats it. remember the rope arrow,how cool was that you can shoot it any wooden surface and climb up,forget it now you can shoot it only spots that has neon white rope on it.Story is fairly good tho,its not thief 1,2 or 3 good but is good enough to play it. ending is bit matter how you look at it and how much papers you read before ending.World looks like they tried to make somekind semi open world game but it fails. Side quests makes you rip your hair out cause navigating is annoying and makes you miss the old way that you spawned in mission and had paper map with no active marker on your location. there is like hundreds of doors that are not active and ´same ammount of doors that are active and lead you nowhere.remember thief 1 zombies,how ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying they were and only holy water arrow could kill them.. just thinking of the sounds they make gives me chills oh god..not gonna spoil it for you,go and see.but as die hard thief fan you still want to play this cause its thief. and to be honest its still entertaining if you look at it thief game that is not thief game and still is a thief game.still give it a high as 7+/10, since its fun to play even with stupid sound and you will be fool not to accept the fact that games are now what they are,going back to old with resurected game series is not option. Maailma muuttuu eskoseni.New to thief series:IF you never played thief games this gonna be victory for you. gameplay if probably something that you used to with map self marker navigating and stuff. you prob gonna be bit annoyed with the sound tho. graphics are nice and its fun to screw up with guards.and the best thing is that story will be fresh for you as i see it supposed to be since you dont constatly try to find connection with old garret to new garret. 9/10 for you probably			"

												It's probably worth addressing the biggest issue straight up; this isn't a very good Thief game. Compared to the original trilogy, some of the design choices are inexcusable. Even if this is a reboot, there are some things that simply should never have been added to a Thief game. I'm talking quicktime events, linear levels (complete with points of no return), boss fights, canned takedowns and various other things. The setting is also grittier in many ways, without the charm of the early games (which I sorely missed here). Even when it isn't compared to the original games, the flaws are still difficult to overlook. But on its own merits, Thief isn't too bad a game. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but it's still an enjoyable (albeit flawed) stealth experience. The basic gameplay is acceptable enough, and stealing loot is as fun as ever. Thief even welcomes some interesting ideas to the series; an expanded hub world, side quests (both in the form of jobs from Basso, and self-contained missions from Ector and Vittori), collectible loot items and customizable difficulty settings for those who like a more challenging stealth experience. Fans of the series will also appreciate that there are many nods to the previous games and existing lore, which vary in subtlety and significance. Overall, if you want a true Thief experience, you're better off going back and playing one of the earlier games, or even giving The Dark Mod a go. If you're happy with a Thief-lite experience (or just a stealth one in general), you could do much worse than Thief. It's a bit of a mixed bag of good and bad design, but with the right mindset can still be enjoyed. I don't want to call it a disposable experience, but you really don't want to expect too much of it.7 / 10			"

												Thief is competent and often enjoyable when it wants to be a stealth game, but it squanders any goodwill it earns by insisting on trying to be an action game at least once per chapter. These segments are at best terrible and at worst among the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had. I can't recommend it unless you get it either free (like I did, thankfully) or for very cheap. Pros:- The lighting system is quite good. The default brightness settings ruin this completely, so turn it down to 50-75% of the base before playing. - Guards recognize open doors and containers, which is a nice touch that's often missing from games. The same applies to extinguished lights. - At the highest difficulty, the levels are often enjoyably challenging to get through undetected. - The difficulty and UI are amazingly customizable. Every UI element can be toggled, and you can set things like disabling knockouts or focus to increase the difficulty. Cons:- The last two chapters feature endgame bossfights. Combat isn't required, but even dodging is almost unbearably frustrating when most attacks are fully capable of one-hitting you at full health. - The QTE segments from early showings of the game are gone, but they still feel out of place. One in particular doesn't warn you when you're back in control and is nearly guaranteed to kill you the first time through. - Jump and swoop are both tied to the same key. This can't be changed and results in many, many deaths by running off of ledges because the game didn't interpret correctly. The same key is also used to get onto hanging ropes. Since it has other functions, it's unclear if the reason you can't get on a rope is design or more misinterpreted keypresses. - The environment is only usable when the designers wanted it to be. There's no logic to why certain objects are throwable and others aren't or why you can use rope arrows in one place but not another. Other:- The story requires immense suspension of disbelief. The Thief-Taker General shows up at the end of 6 of the 8 chapters, which requires an astronomically unlikely series of conincedences and also for him to be an even better ninja than you are. It's silly more than anything else. - The silliness carries over to the level design. (Minor spoilers ahead) The 5th chapter involves breaking into a prison, which for some reason has a pipe that spits fire. This pipe is later revealed to be completely empty and to start from a tiny box in the floor of the control room. (end spoilers)- The audio glitches that early reviews mentioned are largely gone. I only encounted the infinitely repeating dialogue glitch and the echoing dialogue glitch once each. Performance dips remain an issue. - I have no idea what happened in the final chapter. The feeling I get from Thief is that the devs wanted to make an action game a la Uncharted but were assigned a stealth game. They compromised by *mostly* making a stealth game, but sticking in their setpiece and action moments randomly throughout the game without any regard for whether or not they made sense. It could've been a great game with a consistent vision, but as it stands Thief is too disjointed and frustrating to recommend.			"

												While it was interesting revisiting the world of Garrett, to be honest there were too many needless frustrations with this game. After 25 hours gameplay I still found the city map incredibly dull, tedius and annoying to navigate, and avoiding guards through it an incredible irritation. While the majority of missions 1, 2, 3 and 5 was a pleasure to play, mission 4 felt like a tired venture into every other mysterious asylum in recent gaming history, and failed to produce the labarynithine tension of original Thief, while the last two missions were principally a dull trawl with one mildly interesting and one truly snoresome boss battle. While some of the art was gothic and interesting, much of it was bland, and textures were poorly rendered for close inspection. The main problem with Thief, though, was Dishonored, which I completed a few weeks back, and which sadly blows Garrett clean out of the water. Coupled with its graphical, geographical and frequent enough to be annoying physical flaws, Thief unfortunately had a poor overarching plot. The early game is not overly concerned with this, and fun side missions assist in detracting some attention to it, but ultimately and inevitably we're dragged back to it, particularly for the last two missions which are little more than a relentless slog to the stories conclusion, which when we arrive at it, is unfortunately disjointed, flat, tired, predictable and due to some poor pacing of the story throughout the game, uninvolving. I'm sad to say it, but unless, like me, you're a lover of the original Thief and feel compelled to see what this reboot does with it, and are prepared for some reasonably major disappointment and irritation along the way, interspersed with enough good/ interesting moments to just about keep you going for long enough to see it out, steer clear and play Dishonored instead.

												If you're looking for a game that is simply about stealing stuff and evading guards, like what the trailer of this game shows, this is not the game for you. The paragraph below is basically all the things I could think of that really bothered me about Thief.Now, since I haven't played the previous Thief games, I couldn't have expected so much of this story to be so paranormal. It's actually something I greatly disliked about the game, especially how one chapter turns it into a horror game. The ending of the game is also very disappointing and left me thinking ""What the ♥♥♥♥?"" The level design is very linear, at least in my experience, making sneaking around guards (or at least trying) very futile. There are too many times where areas are ""Mash 'F' to move debris/open window,"" which makes the game feel extremely repetitive and boring (ESPECIALLY when picking things up for money, you'll get tired of that real fast). The controls are unresponsive at times which can be extremely irritating at inconvenient times. One of my main complaints of the game is how empty it all felt. The story, as stated before, was disappointing and left mostly questions than answers. The character development was awful, you barely got to know some characters before they blatantly die (which is supposed to propel the story forward, which it didn't feel like it did). Garrett also has the personality of a brick, showing little to no emotion, which is just... ugh... The City was supposed to be lively with people roaming the streets with pouches of gold ripe for the taking (at least that's what I thought), instead, we get this empty and drab city that's populated only by people sharing secrets way too loudly inside, poor and sick people who die in one hit on the streets, civilians who do nothing but scream if they see you do anything illegal (like attacking someone, but I don't even think they react to you stealing stuff or you know, sneaking around while covered in weaponry), and guards who never respawn once you take them down until you reach the next chapter of the game.Here are some things I liked. There's actually quite a few things to do throughout the game. There are lots of little odd jobs which are short but unique. And although I never used it, there is a custom dificulty setting where you can set all sorts of little things to make the game difficult in your own way, which is something I have never seen in any other game.Still, I wouldn't recommend this game. It's too empty and drab with a story that doesn't really make too much sense (I mean it kind of does but it doesn't give me any closure about everything throughout the story). I'd give it a 4/10.

												Thief had great potential, but I feel that it fell short. While its gameplay is solid, its narrative leaves much to be desired.If you don't care for the story and just want cool gameplay: buy this game. It has some really fluid animations, and I had fun sneaking around and parkouring across the City. Some of the chapters were particularly challenging (yes, I'm a noob, I suppose), and the mood and atmosphere of each level is well done. There were points when I felt like a wuss because the area just felt too creepy for me. The collectibles are scattered all over the world and in the most creative places, too.My only gripe is that the City itself is not fully interactive: the game designers have a set path for you to take to various places, and you can't use your own genius to get there. If you care even an ounce for story and character... think again. I have never played the Thief franchise, and so I found this Garrett endearing. Unfortunately he loses his status as ""most important character"" about halfway through the game. The story and lore of the City had wonderful potential, and I was genuinely curious... but the story fell short. Disappointingly so.Tl;dr -Pros:+Amazing atmospheric setting.+Fluid, intuitive gameplay.+Many collectibles across the City and chapters+Rich lore.Cons:- Story fell flat.- The game's focus moved to the deuteragonist.- You have to personally visit clients to check if they have new side quests.- Fixed paths to destinations.

												I haven't played the old mythic statements of the series, so I''m not biased. I did enjoy the art, the atmosphere, the graphics and specially the way the first person perspective works. But it does not feel like an open world, neither I felt that I could plan the way of completing the missions. You can see how everything is set the way the programmers wants you to play. Certain routes to take or actions to make. There's no room to a creative approach.I wish they took this in consideration for a possible sequel.			"

												This game fell way below what I had hoped for it. Loads of one way, parkour action scene with falling buildings and exploding pipes. Fire chasing you. Forced into countless escapes and into the gaze of many guards without any control of it.There was more parkour than their was stealing.Toward the end I found even the rare few items, always contained in one of the only 4 basic lootable things, dresser, wardrobe, table, floor. Countless pens, ink wells, coins. Loot variety was shocking limited.The story was poorly connected and even at the end was not wrapped up with any good feelings, I just felt confused and wanted to close the game for the 20th time.""Horror"" segments where you trawl your way through a haunted asylum ques the game to start trying to be anmesia. Monsters that 1 shot you and run around corners only to vanish. Jump scares while looking through key holes made me want to get out as soon as possible. Loot in these levels is again lacking, mabye 5 ink wells and countless again... pens litter the desks that all look the same. Countless puzzle segments where you endlessly spin your mouse to move a staircase or structure only at the end to have your screen spin rapidly 3 or 4 times becuase there is no clear indication of when to stop spinning.Segments where you are thrown into areras with countless guards, only to have them pat in terrible, thinkless patterns almost as if they were automations. And even on the hardest default difficunty ""Master"" I found myself able to simply shoot countless guards with a smog arrow and run around and take them down, even if more than 1 was on me at once, as the quicktime event of a takedown PAUSES other guards combat.Overall a very poor game, trying to JAM ""FREE RUNNING"", use the term free lightly as there is only 1 path for up to 5 mins + of running at a time, into a stealth game, and does so poorly.The story did not leave me urning for me, mainly only wanting to stop following it, at the end you are FORCED into a boss fight, and the only way to avoid it is a lengthy and tedious task of repeating the same basic mechanics youve already done 9000 times, and hope the boss with super hearing dosent turn around and use his attack that will ONE SHOT you even behind a pillar.  The city hub is disjointed and annoying, you feel forced to wait over and OVER again for guards to tediously pat, repeat dialoge and move on EVERY TIME you move through it. The city seems lifeless, a couple citizens walking around, saying again... the same things. So no, I do not recomend this game, dishonored, the game based around killng, had more stealth than this.Avoid at all costs if you are looking for a game about STEALING, and if you're in the mood for quick time parkour GALOUR, pick this title up.

												I SO wanted to love this game. I love stealth games. I loved the old Thief games (1 & 2....although Deadly Shadows is looking pretty damn good next to this). But..I...just.....can't :-/And my main reasons for this are: (I won't mention the rubbish story, as if the mechanics were great, and the game was fun it wouldn't matter). Traveling arouund the city  is so very, very tedious, and NPCs appear almost pointless giving it a very empty feel.Loot itself isn't varied enough, and locations are ridiculous, with golden goblets to be found absolutely ANYWHERE (abandoned shelves in a backstreets anyone?).Inability to jump, and the linear use of arrows. The levels are really uninspired, and samey. The side missions mix it up a bit, but there's very few  of them.The sound. My god the sound levels. And the looping conversations will drive you mad.Those jarring, awful, AWFUL grappling sections.And the world itself just feels so unresponsive, you can barely interact with it at all.Now when Dishonoured, a game (that I adored btw) about a magical ASSASSIN, is 10x the 'Thief' game that Thief is, you know  you've done something terribly wrong.If you're a Thief fan, don't buy it, if you're a stealth fan, don't buy it. The only time I can recommend it is if it's heavily discounted, as in £5 or £6...seriously.....unfortunately.......tragically, that's all it's worth.			"

												The story makes little to no sense. The AI is mentally challenged on all difficulties. The hub (city) is segmented into several parts, with a bunch of loading screens to annoy the hell out of you. Traversing the town is, simply put, a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There is no way to set custom waypoints, apparantly. Sometimes you have to climb through windows to get to other parts of the town, and I find that really, really annoying. And to replay chapters, you have to find the starting point (which isn't marked on the map). And to make matters even worse, every guard wants your head on a pike as soon as they see you. Which wouldn't be so bad, if I wasn't too busy trying to find the exit/entrance to another part of town, which the developers, once again, did not bother to mark on the map. The NPCs suck, and you cannot interract with them, aside from killing them or stealing their stuff. There are lots of audio issues; the music will drown out dialogue, or the dialogue will be too loud (or quiet). However, I do have to admit that the chapter missions (and some of the side quests) are fun. If it were not for the worst hub world I've ever dealt with and the other annoyances, I would definitely say that it's a great game, even with the AI flaws.			"

												Bought at gmg for $16. not worth it. Tried playing it twice for a total of almost 1 hour, where alot of the time has been spent in menues or googelig for fixes to annoying aspects of the GUI, like the smokey shadows at the edges of the screen and white flashes that give me a headache within minutes of starting the game.  The movement of the camera everytime you open a drawer or pick up something does not help.Having to buttonmash to lift stuff and force open windows rather than just pusing 1 button like in every other game ever just adds to the feeling that it`s a console game.The little i`ve seen of the story have been uninteresting and poorly delivered.

												6.5/10Thief; the game where you play as a thief that has to save the world from a supernatural force from taking over and destroying everything. Luckily the protagonist whose hesitant of his role during this apocalyptic event has to do the only thing he knows how to do which is rather convenient for a man who was in the wrong place in the wrong time! Better a thief than a baker I always say.Between frantically changing through your quiver of 10,000 arrows, zooming between shadows, darting across rooftops, and dealing with inbred watchmen/guards, Thief leaves a lot to be desired. Although the game is as aesthetically appealing as a Victoria's Secret Model, it isn't enough to compensate for it's overused plot, repetitive gameplay actions, and completely pointless quick-time events. The two highlights I can take away from this game is the 10 minute break I took while peering through a peephole in a brothel, and the fact that I gave birth to poo babies in the Asylum mission.			"

												I had pre-ordered it, since I loved the Thief games. Started it up today and was utterly disappointed.The optimization is complete crap. The game runs pretty good on my rig, but as soon as a cinematic starts, or I turn my head to the wrong direction I get such fps drops that I can make 5 cups of coffee and a batch of guacamole in the meantime.Also, this doesn't feel like a Thief game. This feels like the developers may have known that the Thief franchise existed, but spent most of their time playing Dishonoured. All the while giving a crap about optimization and gameplay. One of the great things about the Thief games was your freedom to approach situations. You could move in any direction you wanted, exploit small ledges, anything that's short of a 90 degree wall. Even then you had the climbing gloves in Deadly Shadows. Here everything is contextual. You can only progress in directions the game allows you to. And you can no longer jump. This limitation helps breaking immersion even further. Heck, you can't even drop off ledges if the game thinks you shouldn't go there. Seriously, how can a game developer think ""Man, we have this successful game series where the player decides their approach and has total freedom in moving about. We should definitely remove the ability to jump and design everything linear.""My guess is, that was done for all the consoles, but who knows for sure...And what about Pagans and Hammerites? I loved those. They added more dynamic to the game, either being friends or foes, depending on your playstyle. But those were pulled out, to make more room for a dull story that's directly ripped out of Dishonoured's still warm body, instead of coming up with something better and Thief worthy. I'm aware that Thief's storylines wouldn't win a Pulitzer, not by a long shot, but they were much more engaging than this piece of crap. Graphics are alright, I guess. But in this day and age, what game doesn't have good graphics? So no score for that. While I was playing it, I was constantly thinking ""Man, I paid 60 bucks for it, but I'd rather play The Witcher than this horrifyingly optimized monster right now...""That's usually not a good sign for a game.To sum it up, neither worth your time nor your money. Stick with the old games.			"

												If I had to pick one word to describe Thief, I'd choose ""shallow.""Everything it tries to do it does it with such little vigor and lack of polish, and so little depth and care. It's not broken (except for the audio), but it still feels like so much of it was left untouched once a feature was deemed to be in working order. The audio is the only part that feels sloppily done. Poorly synced, horribly queued, and when it works it still sounds bad. Music overtaking conversations, conversations repeating themselves and even overlapping each other. So terribad. So does the art of thievery actually satisfy in a game titled Thief? You would hope so, but you would be more disappointed in this failure than any other part of this bleak affair. Garret makes his living by taking the paltry possessions of everyday citizens; in a city where people are heavily taxed and can barely make due, where stealing a loaf of bread is punishable by hanging. But hey, Garret's the good guy because he doesn't like killing. And those paltry possessions? Well you're looking at filling your coffers with scissors, magnifying glasses, the occasional bracelet and so many cups, all for several coins each. That is not fun! Digging through drawer after drawer after drawer is in no way preferable to stealing rare jewels and ancient artifacts (oh, and any rare items you do steal go right into a chest, earning you no coin, because Garret likes to look at pretty things and sell common items). Oh, and if you're worried that while you're breaking into a home you'll alert some guard dog or be caught by the resident while they are grabbing a late night snack, dont' worry - not one house is occupied. Not one. This is a world that has an established strict curfew, and no one is home. In a game called Thief, thieving should not be a chore.In fact, if I had to choose a second word to describe Thief it'd be ""chore."" The gameplay never evolves, it never starts simple and begins to take shape into something unique and engaging. From the second you start to the moment you finish you are doing the same thing over and over and over. One of the joys of stealth games is the kill/knockout. Taking down a foe with an instant of an attack after doing your best to elude them or setting yourself up to pounce or trigger a devious trap. There's no feeling of accomplishment here when the AI can be so easily fooled and predicted. Any given guard has one path, and moves from point A to point B, usually lingering at either for about 15 seconds - more than enough time to slip past, steal all their valuables, or put them out of their misery. And yes, I know that it's supposed to be hard for them to see you in the shadows, lurking about, and I accept that. But why is it I could more than easily walk right past a guard, who is brandishing a lit torch, and only get a fraction of a glance from him before he figures it was nothing worth note and continues on to point B. The story is just abysmal. It's cobbled together from different ideas the ""writers"" had that never were fleshed out but all told made for enough chapters that they could call it an early week and get started on a six-day weekend. I can't even bother to go into more detail because just thinking about the narrative bores me to the point of suicidal thoughts and I wont let this game have any more negative impact on my life.			"

												I'll start this off by saying that I will be writing in some spoilers to the main storyline, and additionally that I really did try to enjoy this game.I'll try to give some pros first:The graphics are visually appealing. The game LOOKS nice.The audio quality isn't bad.The voice acting is pretty goodThe story is...okay, I guess. At least at the beginning.The lockpicking in this game is very, very good. It's probably the only thing I genuinely liked. I think it's better than what Bethesda did with Skyrim.Now for the cons:The audio quality SOUNDS nice. When it works. Regularly, there are skips in the audio files, the NPC's around you will start their voice lines and then 3 seconds later start them again, over the first one, so that one person is saying the same thing twice with a 3 second delay. Additionally, sometimes your footsteps will cut out, and being a stealth game, THAT IS NOT GOOD. You need to be able to hear how loud you are in order to effectively execute your actions in a quiet manner. Distances also screw with the volume at times, sometimes you can hear things far away, sometimes you can't, even under the same circumstances.The gameplay:The stealth mechanics are okay. the Swoop ability is cool, the tools you have are mostly useful. Some you will never use, some you will NEVER have enough of, and the game really doesn't always give you enough to effectively get the job done, and you have to improvise if you screw up even once and waste something.You can't jump. That's bad.Climbing changes your character perspective from 1st to 3rd person. They should have made the entire game 3rd person, or not included the poor climbing mechanics.Some controls are not explained to you, such as that X will drop you down from a rope or a ladder. It did not tell me this. I had to scour the control options to find it.Stealth DETECTION:The birds and dogs that will alert your enemies to your presence do not work. At all. Either you kill them, or they go ballistic when you're close, even if you make no noise. It's not noise that sets them off, it's fast movement. Which wouldn't be an issue, if the game didn't tell you that it was noise that sets them off.Interactivity detection:Sometimes you'll need to hide bodies. Sometimes the button command to pick them up doesn't appear. You're simply standing over the corpse wondering if you can actually pick it up, unless you push the button just to try. In addition to that, sometimes the crosshairs for the bow will disappear for a few moments, and won't re-appear until you put the bow away and take it out again.It is also extremely unclear whether or not you are able to climb something. Sometimes it'll indicate that you can climb it with streaks of white paint on the object, or scratch marks. This is not always the case and thus makes it difficult to determine what you can and cannot climb.Let me get to the worst of it:When I said the story was okay, I lied. The story is god-awful. I've seen what Square Enix can do, with Deus Ex and Final Fantasy, and this is utter garbage in comparison. If I didn't know who made it, I would not guess SE. This story was like dead animals talking to me. There was a massive difference in who worked on this at SE, because FF 14 had me screaming in agony or joy over different characters, where as this had me screaming in agony because I wanted to bash my head against a wall. The characters are emotionless, dead, gave me no cause to like them. The crow in the clock tower had more personality than Garret. I had no interest in pushing Garret to achieve his ultimate goal, which was confusing as hell. Cutscenes:Despite my FPS counter being at a steady 60-75, the cutscenes looked like they ran at about 20. Lip motion to voices was awful and poorly synced.Here's the kicker, and my final point. This does contain spoilers for the end of the story.At the end of the story, you walk up behind Erin and try to use the shiny rock to pull the primal energy out of her. Once you do this, it jumps to a cutscene. Between the end of the gameplay and the beginning of the cutscene, Erin has somehow gone from sitting on the ground inside an enclosed ship, to holding on to your hand over the edge of broken wood, over the ocean. What happened. I don't know. Erin falls to her death, Garret looks solemn or something over the sunrise after she dies, I skip the credits, mark the game under my ""completed"" list, and uninstall it. 3/10, this game is awful. It makes me sad that this is the same company that made Final Fantasy 14.			"

												EM has managed to kill Thief for good with this stinker. Gameplay is more linear than a second rate side-scroller. The main charcters resemble a couple of sad emo kids with smeared makeup. Game mechanics are laughable. Garret for the most part only does scripted actions. Hit the jump button and he stands there like an idiot. He needs a special key binding to drop off a ledge - with out it he stands there like there's some kind of invisible wall.  Want to shoot an arrow ? Just zoom in and dinky little marrkers will show your way, line themseleves up and you hit fire. Forget about compensating for arc, distance or wind. We have a ♥♥♥♥ing bow and arrow with magical sights. Stuck in front of a window or by some crates / objects you would normally pick up or find a creative way around ? Just mash a key and iniate a brainless scripted scene. That's right just walk along and mash keys. I'm waiting for the tablet or smart phone version where we just swipe garret through the game.  By far Thief 4 has the worst player controls and mapping of  all 4 games. That says something given how much time passed between versions. The bugs just add icing to the cake. It's very fitting that the PC version locks users into using M$ windoze. A Linux / Steam version by Valve would look better, play better, be relatively bug free - and open to the community for modding. The last part is what really popularized the Thief franchise, but if EM didn't get anything else, why would they get that ? Ah, I see they have a Mod contest using, get this, Darkradiant from the DarkMod team / Id Tech 4. What a shame ID, or better yet, Vavle didn't handle this Thief sequel so it would have been done right.			"

												This has one very dissapointing thing compared to the original series:When you encounter a challenge to surpass, does it feel like you're **inventing your own** solution to the challenge, or does it feel like you're **discovering** the pre-made solution to the challenge that the level designer put there?This new game makes it feel like your job is to discover the solution that was implemented by the level designer.  In the original games, it felt more like you were inventing the soluton yourself by applying the tools in your theiving skillset.  Even though you can turn the hints off that still doesn't change the feeling that there's a single solution hardcoded by the level designer - it just takes the clues away to help find it but in the end you're still following the method intended for you.This isn't about the plot, the graphics, or the glitches.  This is about the basic game engine design.  In the older games, Looking Glass studios hooked your thieving abilities directly into the low level behavior of the game's engine.  Whether or not the environment allows you to peek around corners, shoot a rope arrow, or jump, were all the responsibility of the game engine to decide.   If the person designing the level wants to make a jump possible, they have to abide by the rules of the game engine and make the jump the right length to make it possible.  If they want to prevent a rope arrow from working they have to abide by the rules of the game engine and make sure no surfaces are made from shootable materials. In the newer game, however, they took the lazier design of doing that all backward.  They made it the responsibility of the level designer to TELL the game engine where those abilities work and where they don't.  The game engine isn't in control.  The person who wrote the level is.And that means inventing your own solution to the challenge isn't possible anymore because there is no such thing as ""the rules of the universe"" that you can work with to create your solution.  Every solution that works works because the level designer allowed it to work at that location.And that ruins a lot of the feel of the game for me. Eidos Montreal got the rights to the game's name but ignored the entire design philosophy that made it good, and stole control away from the player.It's a shame because using modern computer hardware you could have made a game with the ""game engine in charge"" design and gotten something a lot cooler than what Looking Glass did with 1999's limitations.  But instead they ignored that part of the game design and managed to make a game that was somehow worse despite using modern technology that makes everything prettier. "

												The game is not good enough. Square Enix has taken a nice known and familiar brand and turned it into something nobody can really relate to. If you like these sneaking games where you actions actually matter, i would ANY day prefer Dishonored, which also costs less. This games does not look good, does not run well, is liniar, predictable and above all - boring! I find it hard to even go through the entire campaign... Sad but true.			"

												The new Thief has almost nothing in common with the old games. This is understandable, because in order to sell good it had to be made acceptable for anyone to play. Maybe I'm getting old, but this game seemed dull and bland to me. Even the overrated Dishonored felt better. The graphics could be better with system requirements like these. The story is ridiculous, nowhere as good as in the old games. The gameplay... well, repetitive cutscenes, dumb AI, castrated controls (this is not Hitman, I want my jumping), wardrobes, wardrobes everywhere further ruined it for me.I'll just pretend this is some other Garrett, the phony mockery of the old.

												I really tried to enjoy this game for what it is, but it's just incredibly dull. The game experience feels mediocre and sometimes just straight-up bland. There's absolutely nothing to motivate you to keep playing.On a technical level, there's really nothing wrong with the game; it has sharp graphics, fluid mechanics, and it also has terrific options for PC users. On a mechanical level, this game is a top-notch product. The problem, however, lies in everything else from aesthetic to story and to its core gameplay experience, which is all as dull as dishwater.			"

												How are you supposed to care for an unlikeable arrogant murdering teenage goth chick, that gets introduced in one chapter? Well, you don't. The storyline is the worst I've seen. So predictable, cheesy, with no likeable persons. It feels often like playing any other game (Dishonored, Dead Island, AC, F.E.A.R, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, Batman etc.) but not like Thief. Sounds are broken, music and conversations stop randomly, guards repeating the same sentence over and over again. Also city of whiners ""My neck aches"", ""My back hurts"", ""I feel so tired lately"", ""I need sloop"", ""I need coffee"". So not even the citizens are in any way likeable. People in one house seem to discuss a thieving job over and over and others talk about that shut down bakery. Over. And over. As if they have nothing more interesting to say.Mechanics are bad. Sometimes you need to hold x to drop, sometimes just space. Why is there a button for using the bludgeon and another one for take down? Why not use the same button as you use the same weapon?The missions and client jobs often feel like replaying a bad remix of old, beloved missions of the previous games.Winks to old gods and the Keepers don't feel like winks, but more like slaps in the face.The open world would've been nice if the Map was working. It is not possible to find your way back to the Siren once Basso isn't there anymore. How is the player supposed to find anything in the City when you have no district names on the map and no marker on where to get to the next level.This leads me to the next point: Animations of opening windows or squeezing through crates and trash to get to the next district: It is annoying, it takes so much time and mashing the E button won't make the player any happier.And city of cousins: I found Truart's, Karras', Artemus' and Garrett's cousin.Only good thing is the graphics. Can't say anything against that. And the Client's jobs are really fun. If I'm replaying this, I'll only do those jobs and then leave the story be. Whoever wrote this should be taken out of the games branche and put back to 50 cent cheesy novels (or FF.net).			"

												As a long time fan of the series, I was really excited to hear Eidos was making this game (especially having enjoyed Deus Ex Human Revolution so much so I expected good things).  That said, this a pretty sorry excuse for a game regardless if you are familiar with the previous titles or not.  First of all, let's start with the awful storyline.  Not only did I find the story completely predictable, it was not even remotely well written or interesting at all.  There really is not much else to say about the story, moving on.The number one complaint I have against this game was how little it actually felt like previous thief games.  Sure there is a sneaking mechanic, but the rest of the gameplay completely falls flat when the AI is asked to anything other than move from patrol point to patrol point.  The second you are detected, the horrible AI reveals just how bad it truly is.  Expect to see guards running into walls and unable to show any signs of intelligence in trying to track you down.  When I was detected, the simple act of clambering up onto a dresser or balcony is enough to evade them for good so long as you wait for them to give up.  If I was not getting annoyed over how easily I was able to sneak wherever I pleased with little to no resistance, I was facepalming my way though all the parkour driven rush sequences which feel completely out of place in this game.  Hey Call of Duty does these types of sequences great, that does not mean I want to see it in a game like Thief Eidos, COMON!When there actually were brief moments in the game when I thought it had a chance to feel like the Thief games of old I love, those moments were quickly erased and forgotten amidst the horrible dialogue, out of place action sequences that you are forced to endure, and laughable AI that was about as challenging as pressing DELETE from my installed games...

												Well this is a far cry from the original series, and Thief 3. I read the reviews and decided to take the plunge with the humble bundle. The graphics look alright but the gameplay is just shameful.I am in the first mission and holding space to climb contextually won't even work in the scripted spaces, and the character ends up climbing up to fall back down. Having E be the key for every action including cover means that sometimes I loot, sometimes I take cover. Clumsiest spaz thief ever.Given that Dishonored came out years before this, I am suprised that Eidos was able to make something this ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												Thief was one of the games I was looking forward to play because I like stealth games in general and played all the predecessors. Unfortunately Thief was a disappointment. While the game has very nice graphics and a strong, sinister atmosphere in a well designed, credible steam punk world, the game-play is troublesome and a drag. I had to force myself to play Thief and it felt more like work than fun. In fact, I can't remember a single moment of joy I felt in this game.Satisfaction? Sometimes. But it was no fun.Pros:- Beautiful graphics- Strong, sinister atmosphere- Highly detailed settings of difficulty, allowing you to adjust the difficulty to your personal preferenceCons:- Path-finding in the open city is terrible. You can't just walk from one quarter to the next. Often you have to break into apartments so you can leave them again on the other side of the house in order to reach another part of the city. Terrible! Moving through the city is like a riddle in a maze.- Very few, repetitive pieces of thieves goods- Really bad story - Horror elements. Do we really need zombie like creatures in a stealth game?- Ridiculous, annoying riddles- Unrealistic hiding places for jewelry- Boring and troublesome game-playIf you want to play a really good fantasy stealth game play Styx. So much better than Thief in every aspect.			"

AI, the most important part of the game, that in theory should carry the game flawlessly - glitches quite often, and enemy bahavior feel... plastic, and game feels shallow, synthetic. I have no words other than this game disappointed be greatly, not even as a Thief game, but just as a sneaker.

												As a longtime fan of the Stealth genre and the Thief Series, this game was a huge whiff for me. My complaints: 1) The level design feels as ""on rails"" as most modern FPS games.2) The city map which connects all of the mission locations feels more cramped and claustrophobic than most of the buidlings you'll navigate.3) In spite of recurring characters from the series (Garrett, Basso the Boxman), the world and lore was needlessly stripped of all previous context. Hammerites, Pagan's and Keepers are all conspicously absent from the story, replacing them with a ""Baron"" that we're supposed to be concerned about. You can see a few places where they swapped out previous factions and story, and replaced them with generic story elements. I can't understand the decision to keep the main character and his associate, yet distance the game from every other part of the established Thief Lore.One positive I have is that the new voice actor for Garrett (Romano Orzari) is pretty good, and almost allows you to forget that they decided not to bring back Stephen Russell. Almost.I'm a long time fan of the original series, and I purchased this with an excitment I've not had for any other game announced in the past eight years. I was ready to overlook a lot of issues just to sneak around with Garrett in the modern era. After playing about halfway through, I realized that I had no motivation to finish the game; neither for the gameplay, nor the story completion.My reccomendation: Play Dishonored instead.			"

												One a 5 star scale I would put Thief at 3/5 stars.  Now, that's actually not bad.  2 stars is bad, 1 star is horrible.  3 stars simply means that it was average, enjoyable, but not so good that I need to go brag for it to everyone I know or replay it ever again.  4 stars is an excellent game with some minor flaws, and 5 stars is a perfect game, of which few are.  But Thief is fun, but its easier to quantify what is wrong with it rather than what is right.  The graphics are well done and they seem to run well on most systems.  The game is solid, although I did encounter one bug and one game crash.  The stealth system, I thought was lacking.  It was sorta like the Elder Scrolls Oblivion stealth.  If I crouch walk and stay in the dark no one cane see me.  Yes, there are other obstacles like walking on broken glass makes noise (the city has a serious shortage of janitorial staff, glass is everywhere), but overall the stealth system seems undeveloped.  It occurs to me that the stealth in Watch Dogs was actually more fun, and that's only a small part of that game.The scenery is bleak and dull, perhaps that is unavoidable with a stealth game set entirely at night.  The characters are all dull, undeveloped, and uncharacteristic of themselves.  Most bothersome to me is how righteous Garret, the protagonist, is portrayed.  Garret is a hero, saving the city.  The people whom he gives concussions to and sometimes kills are evil greedy pigs – how dare they work for a living, including those damned guards.  Further, there is so little choice about who Garret is that its like you are playing through a boring movie.  The plot is very strange.  In fact, it makes little sense to me even now.  I pulled out my trusty smart phone and headed to Wikipedia as the credits rolled to see if anyone summarized it for me.  No one had, No one!  So I think other players might be having the same issue as I had,  We are not entirely sure what the story was about other than some weird blue crystals, a freak girl, and a rich pig-man.			"

												The game is dood, just not as good as we hoped for.The thing about Thief is that it’s inevitably compared to the original series.  And well… I have to admit it doesn’t measure up.  Much of the freedom of the originals is gone, for example rope arrows can only be shot at per-defined by developers spots rather than any wooden surface.  With that freedom much of the emergent behavior and lateral thinking is gone too.  The significance of sound is also reduced - you no longer strain your hearing listening to guards footsteps, you no longer get caught because you accidentally put left headphone into your right ear.  The planning and observation are dismissed in favor  of more action style… you no longer watch the guard patrol route for minutes at a time, keeping count under your breath, looking for that one prefect moment, a tiny window of opportunity to sneak past.  And you CAN get through the game by killing everything that moves.But… if you stop comparing Thief to original games, you will find solid stealth game, with interesting settings, descent story, pseudo-open world, RPG elements, and plenty of content.  If you like stealth games – it’s definitely worth playing. "

												This game is pure nostalgia. If you want to travel back to when console devs were destroying beloved PC franchises (2005-2010ish) then this is the game for you. Console devs and publishers need to die or leave PC franchises alone. This isnt even remotely close to a Thief game. Stealing is an option whereas in the first 3 games stealing was the main objective. The items you can steal are the dumbest things ever and littered throughout the incredibly linear levels in random places. Who the hell makes a golden magnifying glass, gold bottle, gold or silver scissors, gold gear cog, or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gold syringe. Im not even going to bother stating anymore problems as the thousands of negative reviews over the past year since its release have covered them all. I had to hex edit a file in order to remove that annoying console shroud that they use to force console gamers to focus to the middle of the screen.I feel sorry for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that paid $60 day one thinking a console dev could do justice to a classic PC stealth franchise.

												Using the name of an established gaming series is already a task riddled with expectations. It is a difficult and often daunting task to replicate and improve a milestone of any genre.Like the gentrification of your favourite suburb; Thief, as much of a title as it is a testament to the gameplay, has deducted the core values of the franchise and replaced them with shallow marketable features.Any game focused on the design principles of 'stealth' would do so with intelligent level design, a player directed experience and tools that feel valued to their potential contexts. However I found a substantial lack of engagement in all these areas, both in my experience at home and while playing at a friend's house.Although the game falls short on everything that should be expected of Thief, the nature of a purely market-orientated game gives rise to some impressive features. Features that I did enjoy, were the noise hazards, expanded options to tailor your gameplay experience, and the visuals. They did an excellent job exploiting the first person medium; having you direct Garret's hands over containers, paintings and items of interest. This feature could be perceived as redundant, but it gave you some ephemeral agency in your role as a 'thief' and made you feel much more engaged in the action of stealing itself.However this could not save the game for me. On every objective level, the game fails to deliver innovation relevant to it's title, legacy and to this era of gaming.The common challanges that drive the appeal of stealth are replaced with linear environments, predictable enemies and uneccesary assistance in beforementioned challenges. Players will feel little agency in their navigation through the world, and any illusion of choice will always be broken from poor combat mechanics and a lackluster sandbox attempt.This game would be worth the money for $20, but I feel there are many games out there with half the production size, but infinitely more in gameplay features. For this, my time with Thief was frustrating and in the personal space of my own home I felt uninclined to continue my gameplay experience. "

I started beating him badly with my blackjack and had to wack him 3 or 5 times until he crumpled to the floor. He then fell down the stairs into the basement. I hope he recovered and turned out OK because I really felt bad about it.I hid behind a building on one mission only to hear growling behind me. This damn dog was going to alert the 5 guards in the courtyard around me... I was trapped and he was starting to bark now. I had to shoot the dog. Yea thats right I shot a dog. I love dogs. God, what have I become?!?This guy was blubbering in the corner begging me not to hurt him. He saw me shoot one of his guards in the face and ran to alert another nearby guard so I had to fight him too. Little crybaby really messed up my stats for this mission and now Im all wounded and stuff. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so I smashed him in the face with a blackjack and threw him to the ground. I went to a brothel and had to beat a woman to the floor cause she caught me stealing a candlestick. She screamed and cried at me the whole time. It was horrible, I felt like a monster. I had to hide here unconcious body so the other ladies wouldnt find her lying in the middle of the room like that. I little bit of me died when that happened.I recommend buying this game if you can get it on one of the sales. It isnt perfect, and it certainly isnt The Dark Project the one we all love and cherish in our hearts, but it is still a really good game.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game, but I just couldn't. It's the most linear stealth game I have ever played. There's only ever one efficient way on how to complete areas and get past guards. Another terrible thing about this game is that dreadful and disgraceful dash ability you get. The developers clearly didn't care about the level design so they slapped in the dash to make things a little easier. The dash makes it more like a cover to cover stealth game than an FPS stealth game. And that dash basically becomes the only way to get past guards in some situations. It's way too much checkpoint to checkpoint. Overall: the stealth in the game feels lazy and implemented in a hurry. In short, this game sucks.			"

There are few challenges, for example I played on normal difficulty, but i didnt need to use focus ability, also not to kill or knock out someone, disarming traps and I didnt even found a use in stealing stuff for money, and still I finished the game in 14 hours with spent 1/7 earned gold. Sometimes it was nerve-wracking, but I think if you accept the fate of predator, it won't be hard to finish the game even on master difficulty. Another thing, this is first game I wasn't desperadly after all collectibles, because there wasn't nothing more in it, except just the act itself. Eventhough I liked some parts, sneaking around in the middle of well guarded places. Overall  6.5 /10			"

												Just wanna give it a try cz i always support SE game, but this is quite disapointing (again).Good job UE and SE yet still, Square Enix game is hard to play as always.The graphic is nice, the characters are cool, the map is interesting, yet the story is quite boring (quite exciting at the begining tho).The controll system are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that before ure totally immersed into the atmosphere of the game, the controll keys already make u fed up, it keeps stopping me to enjoy the game.Sometimes the characters' behavior is quite weird in a way, maybe i could said it is not logic enough? Nah, sometimes logic doesnt exist in games hahaha.Hence if ure a SE fan, then sure it would be worth to try, while if it is in the other way round, then nahhhh.			"

												It is pretty much an outrageous clone of Dishonored, but poorly done.  The worst part of the game is the city layout and how you navigate it.  It is long and tedious to get from one place to the other and the mini-map is pretty much pointless.  I have no idea why they decided to build the city in such a manner as it really spoils an otherwise somewhat OK game.  Probably one of the worst entries in the Thief series.  I would skip this or, if you are a glutton for punishment, purchase it for $5 when on sale.			"

												Before buying Thief, I spent several hours watching videos of playthroughs. Thief looked like the ideal stealth game:1. The ability to play a thief; an anti-hero (or heroine) who avoids combat wherever possible. Armed with a blackjack and a bow with only a few arrows? Garrett won't last long against a few armed guards so he'll have to be super sneaky much of the time. Looks like the main character in Thief is my kind of stealth dude.2. Overlapping with point 1, looks like I will be able to immerse myself in the game through  ""being"" a character who appeals to me. Yes, I'd like to live vicariously by projecting myself into Garrett. Even though I acknowledge the quality of The Witcher games, I can't bring myself to play the main character. He's  not my kind of guy. For me much of the appeal in a game is about projecting myself into a character with whom I can empathise. Immersion in other words.3. Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere. The Gothic/Steampunk ambience of Thief oozes out of the screen. Ambience is another aspect of the immersive experience for me. After drinking in the ambience through watching video walkthroughs, I was already halfway drawn into buying the game. OK, Thief ticks all the boxes. Next, what do the reviews say? Golly gosh, Thief has not been well received. Hmm…are there any gamers who have had positive experiences with Thief? Yes. Not many though. Do these positive reviews make any sense? Yes. To me anyway. The positive reviews are consistent with what I've seen of the game while watching playthroughs.A myriad of well articulated reasons have been advanced to support the majority view that Thief is not a ""good"" game. Fair enough, but I never decide against buying a game solely on the basis negative reviews. Given what I had seen while watching playthroughs, together with the comments in a (small) number of positive reviews on Steam, I was sure I would like Thief. Atmosphere/ambience, an anti-hero stealthily traversing rooftops,  breaking and entering, and living in a clock tower? I'll have some of that please. Nerve tingles while exploring the Moira Asylum? A well executed insertion of the supernatural that meshes with the Gothic atmosphere. And the challenge of completing missions by pure stealth is about as good as it gets.Bought the game and, yes, it's a goodie. Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere and I'm loving it: Thief has atmosphere by the cartload. The sense of danger is palpable and the game creates a sensation of the need for constant alertness and caution. As I progress (umm…I will progress? ha!) no doubt I'll encounter niggles, annoyances and so on. In fact, a niggle has just niggled. The sheer number of keyboard commands are a tad confusing. That's probably just unfamiliarity. What is a genuine niggle though is the jump sequence of commands. They are far from simple and they've caught me out a couple of times (spotted by de guards) Annoyingly, I got stuck right at the start, trying to follow Erin over the rooftops. Took me ages to suss out how to jump a gap. But these niggles are minor irritations. The game in itself is everything I had hoped for. My only regret is paying 20 quid when I could have had it for a fraction of that price during the recent sale on Steam. Prevarication be my middle name. Actually, it's not but it might as well be. Recommend? Yes, provided your expectations are broadly similar to mine and you are willing to spend some time becoming familiar with a lot of keyboard commands.Off to skulk my way to the clock tower. Hopefully. Them guards be well nosy.			"

												Pathetic. New rule for Eidos Montreal before proceeding with anything else like this: hire new writers. Especially applies when you're creating a new title in one of the most beloved and creative storytelling franchises in videogaming history. It's tragic, so very tragic, that they focused on the wrong thing. The graphics are great. The stealthing around is pretty good. But these are incidental. These aren't what made the Thief games so incredibly, stomach-knottingly, deliciously, terrifyingly immersive. Even now, playing The Dark Project, you can look past the now-somewhat-awful graphics - because the story and the world-building is so damn good, and sinister, and sometimes absolutely petrifying.You had one job, Eidos Montreal. Instead, you base the game a century after all the others and largely threw that world away - but then brought in all the familiar names, and....oh, I can't go on, it's like trying to criticize the plotting of an Uwe Boll film. Nothing makes much sense. That's unforgiveable.Don't be fooled by those lovely graphics, Thiefers. Their allure won't last for long, and then you'll be wincing at a tone-deaf, cack-handed, Dan-Browned travesty of a game series you love. The story is tripe. The way it's told seems badly translated, but not in that lovably insane JRPG way you'll happily put up with for foreign titles. It's rendered in English by people with no apparent flair for dialogue, no sense of plotting continuity, no eye for the little details that bring digital worlds alive - including expansive arenas you can sneak around - everything's cramped in a way that upsets gameplay - and if that's because the graphics were too good to handle big arenas, well, scale back on the graphical detail. Dishonored managed just fine, guys. We'd be fine with less pretty as long as it all worked.This was horribly disappointing - and avoidable. In trying to reinvent everything (weirdly, pointlessly), it looks like they threw out 95% of what worked. The previous 3 games laid the world out in detail, with plenty of themes to continue to explore. This game's script should have been a no-brainer. Instead, this game is hollow, bland and painfully clumsy - the Star Wars prequel film of stealth games.Verdict: would willingly ram lockpicks into my own eyes instead of playing this again.			"

												As someone who's never played Thief I was interested in trying out the newest game in the series. To put it simply, Thief 4 is a fun game with some big issues.Story - You are Garrett, Master Thief. During the tutorial your friend goes missing and you must rescue her while robbing the city blind. Overall the story's pretty generic so there's not much to talk about. It serves its purpose although the characters are quite bland and unmemorable (the only ones I liked are your fence Basso, and Garrett himself).Gameplay - The gameplay is a mix of stealth, action and stealing. You'll be sent on various missions and have to use your skills to complete them. I liked these missions. There were various ways to get through them, the environments are diverse and Garrett has a lot of tools are his disposal. Arrows in particular are a big focus and can be used to light fires, distract guards and so much more. You can buy these with gold you earn from stealing loot (which includes both regular items and special collectibles) and there's loot EVERYWHERE. It really feels like you're a Master Thief who's robbing the city of everything it owns. Unfortunately being a thief has its dangers and if you get seen then you're pretty much screwed. Garrett can only take a few hits and dying will send you back to your last save (although you CAN sneak behind guards and knock them out first). This brings me to another negative which is the hub city itself. Things are put VERY far apart and often have several loading screens in the way, which turns city exploration into a huge drag as you have to find the particular gate/window that gets you to the next area. Overall the missions are fun but city exploration is sluggish and can slow down the experience.Graphics - Here we go... Thief 4 looks great and there's LOTS of graphical options too. However it's horribly optimized and ran poorly on my computer. I did research and it's a common issue so keep that in mind if you get the game. Music - Nothing much to say here. Pretty generic but serves its purpose.Difficulty & Replayability - I played through Thief on Normal and found it pretty easy, that being said there's a great amount of customization with the difficulty and you can tailor the experience to your personal tastes. This increases the replayability but I don't see myself playing through this game again. There are a lot of collectibles if you'd like to though.Final Verdict - Thief 4 is a fun game with some big issues. If you can get past the poor optimization, generic story and sluggish exploration then you'll find an enjoyable game. I would recommened it, but only when it goes on sale.			"

												Where to start.....I first played this when it first came out in 2014 on the old gen consoles and found it rather an odd way for Eidos to go in the series. As a standalone game i could see it working but it is definitely not a good 4th game in the series (More like the Blacksheep of the family)The music and sounds are continously at odds with each other, id reccomend muting the Music so you can actually hear whats going on around you, and the Dialogue.... It's just crude and crude and crude and crude... Oh it's also extremely repetitive after the first hour or so hearing different guards talking about the same things.The gameplay itself can be pretty exciting if you are new to the Thief franchise but if you are a veteran player it is to linear, forcing you along a set path to your end goal (not what thief is about, impo) The city is less linear although you will find yourself going back and forward along the same routes, again hearing the same dribble from the same npcs over and again.Graphics wise, cant really argue there. It's got nice crisp scenery and some decent cutscenes (Although for a next gen game i gues it had to be a cut above the rest)I only bought this on steam recently as they had the Eidos Anthology on offer at £24 down from £160.If you like stealthy games and are a fan of Eidos then for £20 i would reccomend Hitman: Absolution instead, there is a lot more gameplay and it stays true to it's franchise.....Overall if you have never played the Thief franchise and can get this on offer then i would say go for it. If you are a longtime thief fan i wouldnt reccomend this to continue the ""Adventures"" of Garrett (Again unless it's on offer)6/10			"

												Bought the Thief collection when it was on sale for $11. Never played the originals and wanted to play this first, to judge it without as much bias. After playing for two or so hours I thought it was alright and not as bad as people made it out to be.Then, some things started to irritate me. Nitpicks I suppose, but after playing the original for a bit, the issues I had/have compounded. Contextual jumping is my biggest issue, having Garrett decide the best way to grab a ♥♥♥♥ing rope in front of him was to jump off the 3 story ledge he was on, straight into the ground below, killing him. This has happened more times than I can count in the 15 hours I've put in. The pseudo-AssCreed style 3rd Person climbing in certain places just feels like it shouldn't be there, and really is pointless. Every time I try to open a drawer in a desk, the contextual leaning decides I wanted to lean, not open the drawer.Nearly every action you can do is contextual, causing issues as I've stated, and essentially turns everything into a small cutscene or an animation in which you've no control. Knocking out a guard, pickpocketing, even opening ♥♥♥♥ing drawers. It makes everything feel sluggish, even in the rare moments Garrett decides to skip the aftercare when knocking a guard out. What comes to mind is an attempt to mimic Deus Ex: Human Revolution's takedown system, and as much I love that game, that takedown system wasn't good there, or here.The story, so far, is best to be ignored. Every supporting character seems to only be there to annoy you, Garrett seems to think he's discount Batman, being about as intelligent as the caped lunatic. I've gotten to the point where I've dropped the pretense of Garrett just being a thief, trying to stealth his way through the wallets and safes of poor saps, and just killing everyone in my path just to get through the game quicker.The focus abilities seem to be damn pointless, the upgrade allowing you to see lock mechanisms when picking just makes it even more difficult to pick, as the pins actually fight against you now. The stealth Focus upgrade doesn't appear to do as advertised, that is, keeping you hidden in light for a brief moment. With the standard eye ability, the best thing you can do for yourself is drain the focus meter entirely, and just tap the focus button, as the ability will flash on and off, but highlightable objects will be highlighted for a moment. On the subject of safes, I have found maybe 2 combinations in the entire game, and at least one of them you get no matter what because of story reasons. I have found it to be more prudent to brute force or even flat out looking up the combination, as I'm not going to scour the entire city for some cobbler's damn safe combo, for 20 gold.There are a lot of moments this game has where it could be fun, but it seems to be content with spoiling it as much as possible. On a more positive note, I absolutely love the swoop mechanic, and ignoring the focus ability for it, I enjoy the lockpicking as well.The only reason I'm still playing is I can't stand not finishing a game, but as soon as I beat it, there is no way I'm touching it again. I suggest you don't bother with this.			"

												What you are in the game:You are a theif yes. You are named Garret yes. You live in a city called The City yesAnd you use a bow with a quiver of awesome arrows... yesWhat you are not:You are not a Master thief. (Speaking of being feared throughout the ciry)You are not THE Garret. (Master thief, Ex-keeper, Holder of the Glyph, etc, etc ,etc. Or in one word ""Awesomness"")You do not live in ""The City"".  (Built upon the old City of the Fishmen, Eternal conflict the Hammerites and Pagans, Lore of ancient magical artiffact who have a will of their own.)Though you sill have you bow and arrows whitch is a plus. Ok so, point of this review is to say that this game in only ""Thief"" by name and not its content. I love the Thief franchise and I thank all thos who have created it. But I don't find parts and gears that makes up the world of Theif inside of the game ""Theif 4"".  Such as the Hammerites, where did they go? They bult and ran the majority of the city for goodness sake. I understand that they where outlawed but when does that stop a group of fanatics from meeting in hidden rooms and uner the streets! You should meet them at some point! And the the Pegans? Dude they are the poster child of hidding and fighting the power. They were hunted then and they are hunted now. For them nothing has changed.For the fish people, the very foundation of the city was built upon them... literaly. you can't just pass over them. (Pun intended). Now I come to the last of the pillars of the city, the Keepers. the power  behind it all. Yes, the glyphs were taken way from them but they were much more just the glyphs. They would have servived and goen on as the keepers of The City.So if you were simply looking for a game the involded stealth and crime, this game will satisfy your hunger. But if you are looking to walk the streets of The City. With each foot step echoing throuh the forgotten halls  buried  below. Lisening to the bells of metal ringing while the chaos of narture grows. Enbracing the shadows as theever watchfull eye passes by. Knowing that the Keepers are lisening... and waiting. Then I'm sorry. Garret ,the maste theif, had not risen. "

If you love games like Skyrim and will spend hours of your time in games looting bodies then Thief is definitely for you.

Maybe im just thick skulled and didn't catch on fast enough but towards the end I found myself more confused than anything.

												I finished the game about an hour ago.If you want a list of reasons why this game is bad, watch the Zero Punctuation review. Nails it.Here's why I didn't like the game:-Assassin's Creed style wall climbing-Assassin's Creed style ""thief vision"" (aka whatever-the-♥♥♥♥-its-called-in-Assassin's-Creed vision, but in Thief)-Assassin's Creed style wall-jumping knockouts-The story seems promising at the beginning, but quickly becomes confusing and badly told. The supplemental documents you can find in the game don't help much.-The scary level isn't even scary. It was just creepy.-What the ♥♥♥♥ is the ""Primal""?This game can easily come under fire from gamers who've played any of the previous installments (like myself), but the game still isn't that great. The developers tried to milk an old franchise by adding elements from successful recent ones (like Assassin's Creed). Some new elements were great: being able to sprint, explosive arrowheads, etc. (the ""thief vision"" was actually helpful sometimes), but gameplay elements are only part of a great game. The story has to be there.			"

												This game is unfortunate that it suffers for being a reboot of one of the greatest and most important series of games of all time. Thief is a very good stealth game on its own but as a reboot, it is a terrible Thief game. What made the original Thief games great was thrown out the window for linear-looking levels, weird A.I and lots of problems and bugs for some Steam users who preordered the game although I was fortunate not to have to deal with it. And don't get me started on the story. There's potential but the execution was bad. And the last third act leading to the ending was a complete disappointment. Without Stephen Russell in the role, Garrett's voice sounds pretty flat most of the time.However, Thief The Reboot FELT like a Thief game and that's where this reboot excels. Stealing here is as fun as it was in the original games, maybe even better. The tension as you're opening a drawer to pocket a bit of loot is there and the glee as you watch your loot count rise brings back memories from the old games. Challenge Mode is brilliant, that's where the replay value for this game is. Its more tense and more exciting than the base game itself. No need to worry about the story or anything, just focus on good ole stealin. Not a great game but not a terrible game either. Thief 2014 will probably be remembered years from now as a missed opportunity but hopefully, it will ignite an interest for more returns to the Thief universe. But it looks like we'll have to wait some more for a more triumphant return of the Master Thief.			"

			Thief: Impressions We go over the reboot of an old series ""Thief"". We talk about the mechanics and how it holds up to modern stealth games in this impression.		

This is my impression video of Thief. In the video we talk about the mechanics and how it holds up to modern stealth games.Thief looks great and has a great amount of options. Unfortunately the stealth play is pretty generic. The game doesn't innovate in any way, and every thing about thief's mechanics have been repeated and done to death. It has some promise, and for those who do enjoy the game I can understand where they're coming from, but I personally did not enjoy the game.			"

												The story is just...terrible. I've only invested as much time as I have because the side quests (when I can move around the environment quietly) are a nice way to relax. If you want a good Thief game, play Dishonored, which was a better follow-up to Thief than this ever could be.			"

												I played the original Thief games when they came out over a decade ago and really enjoyed them a lot. I remember thinking how much more fun a game like Thief would be in the future once computing power and graphic quality increased. Well, the future is now and I can safely say that it isn't good. Sure, the graphics are obviously nice and the story is decent - but, this is a game that hasn't captured any of the charm of the original. Where are the wide open cities and its huge potential to do anything? Why with the decade of improvements in game engine design, computers, and so forth does the game need to turn most 1-bedroom houses in the main city into their own little loading zones?Such wasted potential, I'm really sorry to see how badly they missed the plot.

												Unagitated and slow. I loved this always about the Thief-Series. Nowadays you need to deliver something more. Sure. But does it has to be on every single particel in the universe? No. And so my dear friends of thievery, don´t expect the old Garret in a new shine, it´s a new shine in the old Garret. Sadly. But hey, it´s still Garret. With flaws and stuff, but it´s still a Thief-Game. Just not a good one. But better than nothing. So, you grap it on sale you maybe won´t regret it. And don´t be excited about the first half of the game, it´s really good, but the second half it´s...... just not. Yeah, so enjoy. Anyhow.Cheers "

												Here is a thing, a city is in a miserable situation and you think about your benefit. so you become a thief. This game is really deep for this 'theme'. I saw so many 'not recommended' comments down there, i don't know why. But who is not liked this game -for my opinion- shouldn't say i love or play stealth games. bc this game is one of the biggest stealth game. If we talk about gameplay, i'm not seeing any problem. The way and variety of attacking is limited -which this is specified bc i'm saying over and over this is a stealth game, if there is more way to attack this would be an action game.-Anyway, The only problem for me is how big is the city. Actually, how big is the map. We need to look so many places for find to valuable things or collections. and this took our time. And the man who is selling equipment-smth. like wires cutter- is only in 1 or 2 chapter as far as i remember. He should be in every chapter.Well, i really don't get it guys why you don't like this game. you should be play more chapters to understand how deep is this game. one of the best game no matter what.

I wanted to love this game, one of my favorite game genres is stealth but this game just left a sour taste in my mouth. I played this game for the most part on Xbox One and very little on my PC. But that's because the gameis just boaring. This game is just a loading screen simulator. I do not recommmend the purchase of this game. I give Thief a 6/10.			"

												Thief, a flagship series in the stealth genre, has devolved into a dissapointing and outrght bad game. The shadow mechanics are inconsistent at best, the game itself is buggy, and the plot and setting are ripped straight from Dishonored. Not to mention that this Thief has lost all of its dry wit and humor. Don't. Buy it. You will regret this purchase.			"

												I've played the other Thief games many years ago - they were superb for the technology at the time. New isn't always better. The interface feels broken, movement is sluggish, the voice acting is often annoying & sounds noticeably generic. The actor they picked up to voice Garrett sounds like he is from either Brooklyn, New York or possibly the Bronx - I can't tell which. I'm starting to see why this is getting low scores on reviews. The sounds overlap and mute each other out, the music drowns out important dialogue at times. I'm wondering how this can feel broken if they've had so much time since the game was announced? How do you &*@^# something like this up so bad?  When the intro screen popped up I wasn't sure if I was about to play a Batman game or a stealth game.  If they're not going to work with Stephen Russell for the voice acting (I'm thinking it was a greed-based decision) then make a new character in the Thief world rather than have someone new pretend to be the old character and mimic his voice. I just can't imagine Garrett spent some time in New York/New Jersey prior to this next installment where he has somehow picked up an accent. Stephen Russel played a sharp, seasoned, calculating, intelligent thief, the new guy sounds like he could play an Italian hitman in some other game or whip out a tommygun. I really want to go all out & cuss about this game but I'll  just say one final thing - wait until it's $7.99 - $14.99. Give them time to patch this game because it needs it.			"

												Being that I never played the original Thief, I got this on it's release and I never bothered to review it and up until a while ago, did not touch the original, So here is my run down.The Good : - For a while it's incredibly immersive- It's world is definitely something that is interesting- Good atmosphere - You don't need to kill people at all- It's stealth is better than, I dare say a lot of stealth games now a days- Quite a nice looking game- Some big open areas- Takes longer than 10 hours- Some replayability through the difficulties- Flowing movement (Excluding the unexistance of jumping)The Bad : - The story is all over the place- Erin- Game falls apart if you aren't a stealthy person (Don't even buy it if you aren't a stealth fan)- A lot of the locations are very bland- City Hub is tedious to explore often- The AI can be pretty stupid- Incredibly easy on lower difficulty settings- Voice acting feels pretty weak- Tries a bit too hard to be a Supernatural horror at times- Really begins to feel bland after half way Overall the game is very pretty and the definitely tries to be an incredible game, but it does feel really lacking, I feel like Dishonored did a good job of being a stealth game better than Thief but I definitely admire it's effort, this game definitely needed more time to be polished since these are the same guys who made the incredibly Deus EX Human Revolution. But if you are looking for a good stealth game but don't feel like being too retro, I'd suggest trying Dishonored then this, I'd recommend paying at around $20 as it's still a likeable game just feels as if it tries to get too far ahead of itself.

												You have to first understand that the city is the game. The characters, plot, and the gameplay is all an extension of the city that is gloomy, full of sorrow, dark, and even humane-less. After this, you will take advantage of the controls, adjust the hud to the way you think is best to get the most out of the game, and you will enjoy being lost in this city! If you strictly follow the story and feel no connection to the exploration factor of the setting based on the way this game allows you to (its not meant for you to go everywhere like youre spiderman, just play with the mood of the game) then this game is not for you or you need to give it some time.

												As a fan of the original games, I cannot recommend this. Game is very linear, having to reloot entire areas because Garrett forgot how to grab a rope and fell to his death, aswell as 'DLC' which is buying consumable items for a single player game. Constant load screens between areas, and the same 'SPAM E AS MUCH AS YOU CAN' over and over with the same animations. There are hardly any other ways to approach situations although it has 'playstyles' which really don't determine much. Have to go the way the game tells you constantly. All parkour mechanics are on certain areas and parts, you cannot freely climb whatever you like to achieve the goals. The game is very strict on this.Not the worst reboot of a franchise, but still seems to have completely killed it. Overall verdict: 3.5/10 , disappointing "

Combat feels odd and clunky. Story is nothing worthwhile mentioning, no character development what so ever, and the only two characters which i somewhat cared about(Garrett and Erin) was ruined by the poor ending. The game looks pretty good, and there is alot of details, the  characters looks nice, but i do think that Garrett looks like a emo with emotionel problems and prehabs a bit of a hobo.I would wish that i could equip a diffrent meele weapon or a diffrent bow to mix up the combat. The diffrent arrows is nice but you are gonna end up only usinh two or three of them.I really tried to get as much gameplay out of this game, but i only got about 15 hours or so.( I do think you could finnish this game in 4 hours)I suposse it is a okay(-ish?) game to buy if it's on sale, but have low expectations. 6/10			"

												Game beaten in 8h30. To sum it up briefly, the game isn't bad, but it's not good either. Just the typical average game you'll pick for like 5~10 bucks max. The problem is, it's too linear. It's basically a corridor game with stealth element in it. And the thing is, the choices to pass are just not so noticable. Like any average game today, it ""needs"" a skill tree. Those skills are worthless. I beat the game with some of them but I could have done it without those. However, the shop is kinda neat. You can buy your arrows there and some new tools to steal collectibles, or upgrade some of your tools. Some of those tools will give you access to new areas, but I suspect them to be just bonuses since I couldn't try them all.The AI is mostly dumb, however if you get caught, you better run for it, since it's easier to dodge them all instead of hiding or kill them. Something that bugs me is the navigation between chapters. You'll be in the City and go around to get to the mission or side mission to start it. It's longer than a menu, it's boring and more importantly, the city has huge performences issues, even on a good hardware. The City for me was running like♥♥♥♥♥♥as if the map was still loading when the missions were running well, and not to mentions some audio desync, frame drops in cutscenes, and other glitchy thing that needed a checkpoint restart.The Level Design is uninspired and they recycled some layout or other stuff from mission to mission. The story is meh, the voice acting is below average. The main story feels written so quickly, basically it's you're a thief,  your girl teammate dissapears, go get her. There are some side missions to do, and they sound a little interesting, so there are stuff to come back to in this game. Besides, stealing thing is fun and doing it undected is fun too, but not for 30 bucks.			"

												When the first news about this game appeared, I couldn't get my arms down in cheer, but after having played through the main story and finished the game, I'm totally like WTF!!! Game is too short compared to Thief 1 and 2. This so called reboot is nothing like the Thief I used to know. The atmosphere of the game cant reach the atmosphere of the previous games. Dynamic music when spotted, why??? This isn't a FPS, this is a sneaker dammit!!! It doesn't need dynamic music. The city does not feel like the steampunk city that I used to like so well.The general clothing is too modern, its like we moved from middle age to Victorian times and it does not feel right.Garret is too obsessed with a girl, something the lone thief never has done before and it makes him a weak character with too much emotional crap involved.The fact that you cant jump, only when you stand in front of crates designed to be jumped or when you can climb a wall, again designed to be climbed makes the possibilities very slim. Compared to thief 1 and 2 where you could use rope/wine arrows at wood and grates, you can only use rope arrows at certain spots designed to that, again a limitation to your movement. There are too many limitations in this game.The game also features client jobs to be done, but none of these does actually appeals to be interesting enough to divert from the main storyline. The only reason to do these client jobs as to get gold enough for some extremely expensive perks, that aren't really needed anyway.All in all this game feel like a console game addressed to the many FPS gamers out there with no taste for quality and only need some cheap thrills.

												Thief 4. A game that i have been waiting for for a long time.A game that has completely lost me in the first few minutes and a game that i came to dispise in the first hour.Let me classify this game. ITS NOT STEALTH.Yes , there are stealthy bits and the game presents itself in that way , but for it to be a stealth game , there would have to be consequenses when you mess up. This game however does not prove that as it resets the situation after a few seconds.Yes it has good graphics , but when i compare this game to The dark project , then i find that the graphics do not balance out that which thief is about.Not to mention that the protagonist ""Garrett"" has become another soulless character. A Batman singularity for a lack of a better term.What is it with games these days or writers. Is it really so hard to provide us with actual characters?In short this game is bad and although i hate to say something like what i will do now , you are better of spending money on call of duty or battlefield.Yes i did have to bite my tung for that.If  you want a stealth experience , then don't buy this.

It is full of button-mashing ""minigames"", quicktime events, invisible walls and unintuitive design where giant objective markers guide you every step of the way.If you're looking for a decent stealthy adventure game, this isn't it. Try past Thief games, particularly The Dark Project. Thief (2014) falls under the same catagory as Duke Nukem Forever: a terrible game that nobody asked for that utterly failed to live up to the predecessors it shamelessly exploits for some easy money.

I actually didn't mind the overall experience until there was some sort of glitch which would not allow me to progress to the next stage of the game - I had reloaded from the last save game; even started the whole level again but I got the same glitchy result so I uninstalled the game there and then and was very annoyed.So, if the devolopers haven't released any patches/fixes, then don't buy it as it isn't that great anyway.Some of the other reviews, I have read and I have to agree with - the story and narrative are pretty crap, the mechanics are a little clunky at times, AI was a little dodgy too.Overall - average at best and I'm sure you will find much better games than this on the market.

												Thief is a huge letdown for fans of the original series. Thief is a thief game in name only. The gameplay is incredibly easy for a stealth game. In the originals, guards would spot you from across entire rooms, in Thief (on the hardest difficulty) I was able to walk to the side of someone, easily within their peripheral vision in a well-lit room, and was not seen. I do like the amount of options they give for changing the game to suit your own style, but a lot more needed to be done to this game to be worthy of the originals.			"

												LASTING IMPRESSIONSThiefGENREStealthSTORY (SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST MISSION)It was supposed to be an easy job. Get into the manor, get the stone, and get out. There wasn't supposed to be a ritual. She wasn't supposed to die. It's been a year since then, not that Garrett would know of course; he's been unconscious all this time. Things have changed, and not for the better. There's a plague going around; the Gloom they call it. The City's been quarantined, death fills the air, and the watch is worse than ever. There's risk all around, but reward is always nearby as well. Besides; since when has a little danger gotten in the way of a master thief's paycheck?GAMEPLAYAs per usual for stealth games, you must stick to the shadows at all costs. Running is a good way to get yourself caught, as is walking, so you'd be wise to be crouched at most times. When sneaking, you have three states of being. (I guess that's what I'll call them.) You can either be highly visible, in the light, barely visible, in the shadows, or hidden, in complete darkness. To better help you move from shadow to shadow, there is a mechanic known as the swoop. This will allow you to move quickly for a short time whilst crouched and is essential to stay out of sight. You have your two main tools, the blackjack and the compound bow. The blackjack is a simple club like weapon which can be used for combat, breaking levers, and creating distractions. The compound bow allows you to fire an array of arrow types to help during your missions. The arrows available range from the lethal to highly dependable. You also have the ability to lockpick and pickpocket. (I'd hope those don't need an explanation.)ABILITIESYour major ability in Thief is known as Focus. Focus will allow you to do a variety of activities with higher efficiency. Loot items, NPCs, and various other things will be highlighted blue. With the help of upgrades you can be lead to unique loot easily, slow down time, conserve your vision meter for effectively, silence your footsteps, and many other improvements.  Something to note, many people are very averse to this ability. It CAN be disabled when beginning your game by choosing custom for difficulty.VISUALSThe game doesn't look too bad. The texture quality is very decent at the least; many of them look good even from a short distance. The game has great cloth physics; due to the engine used. Lip-syncing is good as well; dodgy is some parts but fine overall. The atmosphere of the city is probably one of the best parts of the game. It expertly conveys the image of a plague-ridden society. The game runs at a solid framerate as well. I can't remember exactly, but I believe it ran at about 58 to 61 fps. The main menu has a benchmark feature to test the framerate.FINAL THOUGHTSI wanted to like this game. I wanted to enjoy it so badly. It looked like the kind of game I wanted; the stealing of Sly Cooper mixed with a cohesive stealth system? Great, seven dollars during a sale is a steal! (Pun intended.) The game gave me what I wanted but had forgotten just one thing, charm. Garrett is a boring, cynical,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at most times when I know they were trying to make him sound like a loveable smartass. The story makes no sense; it's bland, boring, and uninspired. Even by stealth game standards, the game is a chore. Nothing happens, ever. At one point (SPOILERS) a building blows up. Mass hysteria, death, fire, rebellion; none of which had any impact. You're immediately thrown into an elevator, which is followed by some platforming without any guards and minimal danger. It has its moments, but with all its untapped potential; Thief did not leave a lasting impression; not a good one anyway. I wish it wouldn't have gone this way.If I'm gonna be honest, I think Carrot is more of a kleptomaniac than a 'master thief'. I've never seen one man take so many ashtrays in my life...			"

												I just couldn't get into it easily. I found that I didn't care for the characters so I ended up not follwing the plot, which in turn led to not caring about the progression of the game and then the whole experience fell short. Loot didn't mean anything to me by the end of chapter two and I started to just screw around to see what I could get away with. I'll have to come back and finish it later, but that was my experience with the opening few chapters up until the third/Overall, I'm torn. I don't feel like this is a horrid game by any means, it's just not a game for me. I'd check it out, but not when it's full price			"

												* The gameplay was alright. Not necessarily amazing, but semi-decent enough to be enjoyable for the duration of a play through I think. Not really made me feel like replaying the whole game but whatever.* There's a decent amount of content in the game, so there's that. With all the side-quests and the main story you should probably get 15+ or so hours out of the game.*Story is overall pretty ""meh"", though I wouldn't call it outright bad. It's not really good, not bad either in my opinion. Maybe a bit boring.Unfortunately, aside from that, the game had some very grave bugs/issues for me. On at least three occasions, I ended up with seemingly randomly occurring corruptet saves, loosing between maybe 20 minutes to over an hour of gameplay saves. I am not sure of this is an issue with me or the game itself per se, though from what I have read the game did seem to have some issues on that front for others in the past and I can't really think of anything I did to trigger save file corruption, so I figured I should probably mention it.Overall, the game itself is... ""meh"" I guess. It's not the best game around, not the worst either. Still, due to the issues I've had with it, I wouldn't really reccomend it personally, especially not for the price it's currently being sold at.			"

												I've played and beaten all of the Thief games, including this one, and I have to say that this incarnation is NOWHERE NEAR the quality of game mechanics, story, or level design as ANY of the previous games in this series.  I had high hopes upon loading this game for the first time given the sheer brilliance of the original games - this was quickly dashed as the linear, closed, languid environment was set before my eyes.  The graphics are nice, yes, but where is the ambiance?  Where is the quirkiness or the eccentricity of the townspeople and guards?  Where is the magic, the factions, the religious zealotry that I grew to love about the believable and engrossing world that encompasses everything about Thief?  Nowhere.  They have now decided that these things should be stripped out in place of a boring, lazy version of the game that simply takes less time and imagination to create.

I have bought this game on pre-order and I regret that I've paid that much money for this garbage, let's see, no jumping, the rope arrows are shot only at designated locations, ""blink"" ability? what the hell is that? huge and frequent loading times, the game probably looks good on higher end machines but looked decent in mine as well (GE 60 with 660 GTX)If you can find an offer for the game buy it, otherwise stay clear and go play deus ex, hell even the original thief series once again.

Different types of arrows was pretty neat but didn't really use them that much.Story was boring as hell. Boy loses girl, boy goes on and saves the girl.Did a few side missions too but they were all the same basically.Voice acting and lip sync was terrible.First the soundscape was just horrible, but after the Mantle update it worked pretty well. Mantle also gave a really nice boost for performance.No replay value at all, for me atleast. Hopefully some people find the custom difficulty and scoring system fun.			"

Games made in year 2000 had more open world than this. So many Limitations I sometimes wonder ""so what CAN I do?"" The map is a total failure... I completly can't find myself arouind it. Even though the sity isn't that big comparing to almost all games I've played, I'm always getting lost and I can't remember which place I've visited and which I haven't. The upgrading system of the character is terrible too... and the fact that it's so hard to find arrows... the only way to get them is to go all the way to the other side of town... go through many window-opening animations and get them. VERY UNNECESARY animations! They just waste our time!To be honest theis game is so horrible, I don;t even want to write about it... Biggest dissapointment and waste of mone I can think of right now.			"

												We must say clearly and that Thief is a good title, can offer an adequate number of hours of play especially in light of his being only single player. The story is sliding in the ups and downs, the gameplay is strictly stealth old style but lacking a degree of freedom in dealing with situations of the game and technically looks up to expectations although not resulting ever stunning. However there are numerous elements that keep it far from ideal wall litmus probably due to a long period of gestation that forced developers to return on the numerous initial ideas leading to the creation of a product which in some respects is simplistic resulting in a bit 'rough. And then of course there is the inexorable confrontation with Dishonored that over and over again, playing Thief, I could not help but notice, from a combat system too rough. I repeat once again: it is a good game that will please most fans of the genre but it is the new benchmark of stealth.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review This is a very disappointing game. I enjoyed Eidos Montreal's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. So when I heard that they were doing a reboot of the Thief series I was excited but then I played it. This game is nowhere near as good as Deus Ex: Human Revolution as this game story is terrible and the stealth elements aren't their. This game is more of a platforming stealing game pretending to be a stealth game. As you can see from my playthrough above is that I played on the hardest setting and yet the guards A.I are still laughable. It was times where I was right in front of them and they couldn't notice me and if they did notice me all I had to do was hide for 3 minutes and they would go back to normal like I was never their in the first place. The story is also terrible and it's not helped with Garrett being one of the most boring videogame protagonists that I have ever played as. His monotone voice and nonchalant attitude does not work well with the narrative. And the worse part is that the game's plot is all over the place and makes no sense. I don't know what went wrong when Eidos Montreal was developing this game but I hope that they learned form their mistakes.  "

												I tried to like it. Unfortunately, there were way too many problems with the game. First, the atmosphere is very spotty: at times the setting looks incredible! It's awesome to crawl around the streets, lurking in the shadows, or sneaking around the inside of some castle. Other times, it just looks ugly and lazily designed. The character designs are putrid; Garrett looks lame to say the least, and Erin... just terrible. I don't know who designed her. The characters were a major turnoff for me.As far as the mechanics go, they're smooth and intuitive enough, but there isn't the same level of variety and openness to experimentation with one's toolset as there was in the original games. The stealth was fun, but very shallow and predictable overall. My favorite part of the game was actually just doing the side mission thievery in the sandbox area of the game given to you by Basso, I actually felt more like the original Garrett while doing those. But they're just minor side missions at the end of the day, so there's not much to speak of there, and it doesn't improve the overall game a whole lot.I bumped into quite a few glitches while playing as well, mostly with the AI. They'd get stuck in their patrol paths, following some crazy loop for eternity, or they'd get stuck in the environment in some way. Sometimes the lighting bugged out on me and I was caught for no reason.To top it all off, the ending was also terrible. That ""final boss"" was completely unnecessary and ruined whatever dramatic buildup the game's story had so far managed to establish, for me at least. I mean the game isn't 0/10 worst♥♥♥♥♥♥I ever played, but it's just not good — it's somewhere around 5/10 for me.			"

												Garrett didn’t need a reboot, nor if we’re honest did he really need a comeback. He had two excellent games and the third episode didn’t mess things up too badly.There’s enough good in Thief to convince me that Eidos had all the moving parts required to herald the return of the Master Thief in style. The bugs and inconsistencies could be addressed in an update, but in an age where publishers push games out half-baked and some prioritise DLC over fixing game-breaking issues, I just don’t see it happening.

												I've played and beaten the other games in the series but this 2014 vision of Thief is just weird. I am mostly confused by the changes made to Garrett and also the movement is wonky as hell. You're supposed to be a world class thief but the environment is so restrictive and I can't forgive that.The original Thief was released in what... 1998 or something? '99 maybe? The AI, story, and level design were 100% better back then. This new Thief just feels like they took 10 steps backwards.I refused to play after having learned that I can get rope arrows {that you could shoot and attach to any wood surface in the other games) but could only use them now on very specifically designated locations. You also can't jump. You're a thief who can't jump, can't climb, or interact with anything unless it's GLOWING.Dumb. Just dumb, sad, and boring.			"

												Huh. It's not a bad game... but not a great game either. Given I didn't play the original games so this reboot was my first playthrough in the series. And I liked it actually... but also there are so many flaws in the game. Wish there is a mixed option for games like this. If we are talking about a numerical value I'd give 6 or 6.5 out from 10 to this game.There is no background or prequel story (as I said that was my first game from the series) but still I kinda wished they told new players what are the Thief games about. It just stars ""in medias res"" without any further ado. Just play and have fun.Also I didn't like when the game went from stealth to horror in chapter 5. Overally I enjoyed the game but that chapter was too creepy imo and didn't fit the style of the whole. Other than that the overall story is nice but just a bit shallow.As I was writing this Dishonored came up in my mind so many times. I know not every game should be Dishonored but one must compare the two games and honestly Dishonored 100% better than this. From every point of view. And that's my biggest problem. Because this game could have been so much better. Like it fails on every single thing but not by a huge margin... yet still enough to notice the negativities.I got the game through the Square Enix Humble Bundle and honestly that was a good price for it (considering I also got a lot of other games too).But long story short: don't buy this game for full price. It's 5,99€ if it has a 80% sale and honestly you shouldn't pay more than that.			"

												Thief is the fourth installment in the classic ""Thief"" series of video games. The franchise has been known for its outstanding contributions to the stealth genre and is favourably remembered by the majority of the gaming community. Thief, rather than serving as a sequel, is a reboot for the series. This is a new start for the series, and it should be stated that the purpose of this game is to reinvent the series for the new generation, rather than build on the successful formulas used in Thief, Thief II and Thief: Deadly Shadows. This game shouldn't be compared to previous titles; with that said, in this review, I will treat Thief as a completely new game and will not judge it based on earlier titles in the series.Thief lets the player play as Garrett; Master Thief and one-liner delivering badass. He's been in the trade of stealing goods for years, and the game opens with Garrett on a job that almost immediately gives him a ""bad feeling"". This provides a set-up for the events of the game, most of which doesn't make a lot of sense from a writing point of view, and leaves the player feeling confused and a bit disappointed with the lacklustre and muddled story.Fortunately, the actual gameplay in Thief is far better. You can crouch, sprint, walk, scale wales, climb ropes and peek around corners, all of which feels really fluid and genuinely makes you feel like a trained thief. Hiding in the shadows gives you the best advantage over roaming enemies like Guards, and you can also use the 'swoop' ability to fly from one shadow to the next without being spotted. You can also climb walls and certain objects to obtain a higher vantage point over your enemies. These enemies can also be distracted with a variety of tools such as water arrows, fire arrows, rope arrows, smoke bombs, and small breakable glass objects. This all makes for a diverse stealth experience and really sells the role of being a Master Thief.However, the level design of the game often makes it difficult for the player to fully embrace these options. Level design is often linear and constrictive, and often misleads the player by being inconsistent with climbable and non-climbable objects. The level design is repetitive and somewhat bland, and doesn't really allow the player to be adventurous or explorative. The only exploration to be found in the game is the constant scavenge for loot, which while fun, doesn't make up for the overall limiting design.Additionally, enemy AI is also quite poor. Guards sometimes spot you from a fair distance away, and sometimes they fail to spot you even when you are two feet away. This kind of inconsistency feels frustrating and lazy, especially from developers who are known for producing excellent games like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which didn't feature any of this laziness or inconsistent level design and technical flaws.With that being said, I really did enjoy this game. It has beautiful visuals, and the lighting effects look fantastic on any graphics setting. The game was a very enjoyable stealth experience, despite the lack of innovation, and offers loads of replay value and additional challenges beyond the short 7-hour campaign. Pick up this game if you like a decent stealth game reminiscent of Dishonored, although lacking the polish. This game deserves a solid score of 7.5 / 10.			"

												Don't let the name fool you, this isn't a game about a thief at all. This is actually a simulator in which you play a sanitation disposal tech who is tasked with picking up various rubbish strewn about a mysterious, grim dark quasi-steampunk city. As a disposal tech it's your job to scour the city for various types of trash such as old ink pens, used flasks, empty ink bottles, cracked vases and various other manner of similarly exciting items. You'll often have to squeeze into tight spaces to remove fallen timber and push it out of the way in a most exciting mini-game. Occasionally you'll have to sneak by various thugs and hooligans who are most likely the people that deposited all the rubbish in the first place. Definitely one of my favorite sim type games and it's almost as good as the gold standard, Garbage Truck Simulator.			"

												I've only gotten to chapter 2 of the game and I'm having technical issues. The game freezes and completely locks up my computer. I've followed all troubleshooting advice with no effect. I currently have a ticket in tech support but I have a feeling they are going to tell me to uninstall and re-install. Now only being on chapter 2 that wouldn't be too bad but I've read on the forums that the same problem happens in Chapter 6 as well. This is why I don't normally buy games when they first come out. It seems companies are so hell bent on releasing games to get money with no concern whether or not they are playable. You can't tell me that the developers did not know about this issue with beta testing. I had this same problem with Assassins Creed and I didn't play it for a year because I was waiting for them to patch the problem. Until this happened I was enjoying playing the game but take that with a grain of salt because that is only about an hour of play time. My computer DOES meet the recommended requirements. I'll update if/when I hear back from tech support.			"

												OK, so I was going to give this game a good review. I had finished up to the ending of chapter two thinking that aside from some slight glitches the game was overall pretty solid. There was this small part of town I had to pass through on my way to the third chapter. I found my way into this back alley section where there was a bit of loot and was on my way back out when I noticed the the AI was now frozen in place instead of following their patrol routes. The issue was that there were now two guards staring at each other blackly, one staring down the alley I was to come from. After several failed attempts to get by them I finally just ran back to the gate that loaded this section of the map, alerting everyone in the process. Upon activation of said door, the game came up with a message that it was saving my game which was a little unusal since there is an autosave function it normally uses. Upon loading of the town map, the game somehow loaded me back into chapter one and saved over my game so I can't even go back to where I had gotten stuck.Maybe I only but well developed games or something but this is the first time I've run into a glitch like this. I do have a save from chapter two but only from mid chapter and I'm not sure I really even want to bother playing it over again. I enjoyed the game besides this issue but I'm probably just going to pass seeing as it could just happen again.			"

												I was really revved up for this game since I'm a fan of Dark Shadows but this was... really lackluster in comparison. Tech wise, the game was way too high def. I can max Skyrim (with mods turned on) on Ultra, Tomb Raider on High and ect. on my computer but I couldn't even MOVE with Thief even on NORMAL settings! Early on in the game I experienced glitches that kept getting worse throughout gameplay. Characters spinning around in a circle, models in the T position, characters stuck when on high alert mode.  There were also some whacked out audio levels.  Music was low, SFX mid and character voices higher but some character voices you would hear off in the distance (like during an angry mob crowd) then suddenly BOOMING VOICE RIGHT THERE of another mob character. Sometimes I couldn't even HEAR Garrett earlier when he talked!Gameplay, w ooow. I enjoyed the mechanics but it was too easy. I was playing on Master mode and everything was just mostly simple. I was expecting better responses from the NPCs but it mostly got a bit harder at the end but that was it.  The monsters too? I was disappointed in them. The final battle? Holy CRAP was I disappointed. That was honestly one of the easiest boss battles I'd ever fought and I was hella disappointed. Hella.  The second to last boss was actually HARDER than the final one.I really enjoy this franchise. I had a lot of fun sneaking around and thinking of ways of getting around but I was honestly expecting something better /especially/ since Square Enix, although published it, has their name on it and after seeing the trailers, screenshots and demos, I expected something awesome.  Really awesome.  But nah, it just became a rated B game, unfortunately. I only recommend if you're a fan of Thief and just want to see Garrett again (<3) or are a fan of stealth games. Give it a shot otherwise this is one to just buy on discount.			"

												A review from a newbie gamer (aka me):I loved this game till Chapter 5 where it screwed with my head in an Insane Asylum. I'm not a fan of horror games.  But (at least till Chapter 5) this game is really nice. The wonderful graphics, the stealth, strategy, looting and parkour are all something you'd want to come back to after a long day. And the story is interesting. Slightly weird, but interesting. Only because of the story I desperately tried to continue playing through Chapter 5 but.. no. Just no. Can't. Nope. The game developers did a good job though!			"

												Despite hate from older fans of the series, Thief 2014 is good game in its own right. Think Dishonored with a talking protagonist, less combat, and more stealing. Pros:++Smooth movement, rarely get hung-up and terrain is well defined.++Stealing is fun, as you must be quick and careful to succeed.+Interesting levels and enviroment, even if it is stereotypically gloomy.+Spooky asylum level would've been right at home in a horror game.+Rewards the completion of challenges based on different playstyles, similar to Mark of the Ninja.Mixed:~Main character lacks depth, he's just a guy who steals stuff with your average merc-style ""I like money"" mixed with the Batmanish ""I'm a lonely nocturnal guy who doesn't have very many friends."" Does have some good dialogue, however.~A great many similarities to Dishonored, including: special magic vision, an oppressive leader with full authority over the city guard, a disease killing all the citizens, rescuing the girl, a ♥♥♥♥♥house level, and the creepy old blind lady with special powers. Also,  betrayal ~Game is linear, which seems to make people poop their pants. If the ride is a good one, why complain? That being said, only some deviation is allowed beyond sidequests. Negative:--Story is lame and unimaginative, generic save-the-girl story but with even less story sprinkled in than other games. Magic occult spooky stuff and whatever.-Level design can be very confusing sometimes. I got stuck on the stupid staircase puzzle longer than i'd like to admit.Overall, if you can get it for $15 bucks or less, it's worth it. I'd give it a 7.5. It's enjoyable, has a good amount of content, and even has replay value.Rating: 7.5Value: ~$15 or less.			"

Solid stealth game with unfortunate flawsAt its core, Thief is a great and intense stealth game. Hiding behind corners, lurking in the shadows, stealing that shiny jewel and waiting for the perfect moment to vanish unseen works and feels great. Your tools (mainly a bow with different arrow types), your abilities and the environment work together sweetly and create a fluid and very enjoyable stealth experience. Also, replay value is high. I often found myself playing levels multiple times - trying out different paths, trying not to take out anybody, trying to complete all challenges and so on. ""The city"", the location the game is set in, offers a great atmosphere, with many dark alleys, suffering citizens and a sinister, depressive, somewhat steampunk-ish vibe to it. This is underlined by the great lighting effects, which make the graphics in the game really pleasing. The skill and upgrade system is rewarding - everything you steal (besides collector items) is instantly exchanged to money, that you can spend on all kinds of upgrades, tools and skills - which impact the game noticeably, like simple health upgrades or an amulet that deflects arrows.I would love to be able to continue the review in such a positive way, but unfortunately the great core gameplay is flawed by many annoyances and let downs.First and foremost there's the story - it is disappointing, told in mediocre cutscenes and dialogues and leaves a lot to be desired. Now that wouldn't be as much of a deal if it would simply stay in the background and do little more than give you a reason to hop from one (mostly excellent) mission to the next. But the scenario, the setting and the small story bits that are there leave you wanting to know more - and the story fails to deliver to that.Furthermore, the enemy AI isn't always up to the challenge - enemies sometimes get stuck in walls or run into invisible ones, see you through objects, or don't spot you at all, although you're right there. Still, this does not occur often enough for the AI to become a dealbreaker; tension is always high. The city, while having a great atmosphere, has little to offer. While main and side quests impress with a great level design, small puzzles and lots of loot, there's pretty much nothing to do in the streets of the city - no collectibles, no ""city events"" and exploration is restricted by buildings you often can't enter and short loading screens while moving from one city area to another. Additionally, the included action sequences often feel unneccessary and misplaced. All this leaves the impression of a game concept that is slightly unrefined and not fully thought through.In the end you are left with a game that suffers from many bad design decisions and a weak story, but the great and rewarding gameplay and the atmosphere manage to outweigh the flaws, making it still pretty fun to play.If you're a fan of stealth games, you should definitely give it a chance.   +   -    gameplay story   graphics and atmosphere bad open world implementation   level design and replay value enemy AI   skill/upgrade system action sequences -> 7/10 "

												I remember when i read first time from some website ""New Thief incoming!"" I just couldn't believe it, i was so happy for that, because i thought its good as older thiefs or even better !But when they released it... Lot of bad criticism. Didn't believe it, so i had to buy it. But yeah.. When i started to play it, it just didn't feel ""Thief"" anymore.. The gameplay too easy and you didn't have to do anything to ""neutralize"" guards, just go good spot and click once, and Garrett jump from roof and kill the target instantly..I really would like to give plus for this, because of THIEF... But i cant..♥♥♥♥♥♥man ;/ *SO Disappointed*			"

												A mediocre stealth game that I gave up on halfway through. The stealing of items is fun at the start, but gets repetitive quick. It gets tedious opening every drawer or cabinet in a house and the small rewards are not worth it.The game has a central city hub you can explore between missions, but there's so many loading screens that you'll give up on that after a couple of hours. Some loading screens are disguised by long animations (opening a window,...), often revealing a small 1 or 2 room apartment behind them. The graphics are good, but the game is mostly grey and brown wooden buildings. Some more variation and color would have been welcome.Sound has bigger problems. Voice lines repeat constantly, guards talk over each other and some guards say multiple lines at the same time. While walking around the city you'll overhear conversations between citizens, but it's always voices coming from a closed window or door. It feels very fake and doesn't make the city feel alive. The few civilians you do see just stand around doing nothing.The game isn't awful (and the story missions don't have most of these problems), but it wasn't interesting enough to make me put up with the constant loading screens and repetitive thieving.

												I'm old school Thief fan. Played T1/2/3 and i loved them all. One of best games ever made in my private ranking.So i was pretty xcited when they annouced Thief in 2014. And honestly - this is the worst Thief series game, and very avarage sneaking game.First bigest disappointment - they replaced Stephen Russell as voice actor. His voice acting was what made thief so unique. Next thing - they decided to abandon typical for thief series cutscenes. WHY?! I loved them, they were very climatic. Maybe it's  just stupid little thing, dunno. But try imagining next fallout game without its well known intro (war, war never changes). As for game difficulty, devs did absolutely great work making this game one of easiest i played lately. Not even close to original Thief.1. No loud floors (and moss arrows), somethies shards of glass but most of the time its not a problem to run whole level! yes, press shift and run, if too close to guars - you will get sound notification.2. New 'swoop' feature allows to exploit almost every guard, in any possible situation.  Absolutely no need of using water arrows now, just swoop and dim lights with you fingers.3. Level design - IMO too linear and too simple. Small amount of non-guard npcs make levels even poorer.4. Almost every guard i considered that might be an issue was scripted so when i approached he moved somwhere else for few seconds allowing me to quickly swoop behind him.Seriously? Whats next? Patrols that automaticly turn around when they get too close to you? 5. Focus - another game after Hitman and Tomb Raider that has this feature implemented. The game is very easy without it so i cant understand whats the logic behind it.6. Boring and repetitive city missions. Every single one takes about 1-2 minute to finish and offer no variety.7. Client jobs - max 10 minutes to finish, with maybe 2 levels really interesting and original.8. Guards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they will almost instanly forget anything they saw or heard after few seconds of inspecting.The controls:Master thief cannot jump. Joke of the year. He jumps only when he's close to rope or a gap. You get one key and game decides for you whether you want to jump or swoop or climb. This 'feature' is major set back, FPP with no 'maunal' jumping implemented. Like in first Doom games. Next Thief will have one key binded for everything.Overall: 5 out of 10 in my personal score incudling sentimental factor. Oh BTW, visually this game is really hot, audio is also pretty good, but the game lacks everything else.The only good thing about this game is how i really want to play old Thief(s) again.To Square EnixŁ You guys made excellent Deus Ex remake. What the hell went wrong here?			"

(This was in 2014-15, before dishonoured 2.)It was excellent, I loved going around nicking everything that was not tied down, whilst the guards did not even know I was there. It is a very linear game but you can redo levels. The AI was decent with its detection, and the graphics and playthrough good.Recommend to anyone who likes stealth games.(8/10)			"

												Even having never played any of the previous Thief games, I still found this game enormously frustrating, but by the time I really realizes how much it annoyed me, I’d invested enough time into it to see it through to the bitter end, and I have to say that I found the ending extremely dissatisfying.  In fact, if I were able to create a title for this review, “Dissatisfying” would be my choice.Where to start?  How about the sound design?  It’s horrendous, absolutely terrible.  NPC chatter overlaps, sometimes THE SAME EXACT EXCHANGE overlapping with itself.  Sound effects don’t sync with the animation, vocal tracks are often impossible to hear, and in the midst of fiery inferno, if you happen to stray a little too far to one corner or another, the sound effects just STOP.  Sometimes they don’t come back, either, even if you reload your save game.The writing is adequate at best, and the characters are hollow and one dimensional.  Even Garrett, who at first seems like an interesting character, eventually reveals himself to be about as shallow as a puddle and comes off as angst-ridden and brooding without any actual character development to explain WHY.  In fact, there’s almost no character development at all in this game.The gameplay itself isn’t terrible, although it gets repetitive quickly, and everything ends up feeling very samey.It’s not all bad, though.  The graphics are very pretty, and while that alone isn’t worth the price of admission, the game at least has that going for it.  But really, is that all we can expect from gaming companies these days?One bit I did enjoy was the haunted sanitarium.  The first part, anyway, where shadows would jump out at you and the game would play tricks on you.  That part of the game really had me interested, but it didn’t last long enough for my liking, before turning into “hide from the monsters”.Overall, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone other than people with the blandest tastes.  If you want to play a modern stealth game in a steampunky industrial age setting with a corrupt government and a city-wide plague, get Dishonored.  Much better game.And now, if you excuse me, I’m going to go play Thief 2, which I picked up today, and which I understand is much, much better, dated graphics notwidthstanding.			"

Posted: August 3, 2014
												I'm going to put this out there from the beginning: I adore the original Thief games, and the first two easily rank as two of my favorite games of all time. I find myself going back to them repeatedly over the years, starting from the easiest difficulty my first run when I was a kid, to beating it on expert multiple times. Each game had its own atmosphere, its own story, each fleshed out and gripping while retaining what made Thief, well Thief. You feel like Garrett, you feel like a Master Thief knowing that if you screw up and get seen, you're a dead man. That never changed between the games, a constant that grounded each game to eachother ""You Are Garrett, Master Thief"". Yet each game had a setting an atmosphere all its own, be it the mechanizations of the Woodsy Lord, or the unfeeling metal monstrosities of Father Karras. Even Thief Deadly Shadows, up until this point the weakest in the series, had scenes and levels that pulled me in and wouldn't let go Shalebridge Cradle in particular. With all of that I pre-ordered this game,  I could be Garrett again, I could be the Master Thief. I was wrong. This character isn't Garrett. Hes an idiotic wannabe ninja who apparently broke his legs repeatedly, hes clunky, can't jump, and his ""parkour"" feels even worse than Brinks, his voice actor change is the least of this remakes worries. On top of that is poorly made level design, and game mechanics that were changed specifically to limit your actions and make this game they tout as ""Multiple paths, find your own way"" feel almost as linear as Call of Duty. One of the finest examples of this limitation is the Rope Arrow, originally you could shoot this into any wooden surface granting great freedom in where you used it and how you used it to get around. Now you can only shoot it into pre-designed  areas littered throughout the area denoted by a wooden board wrapped with rope, limiting your movements to where the developers want you to go.To keep this review from going on for even longer, heres my conclusion. This game is uncreative, limiting, and above all lazy. Its like they didn't even try to make this a Thief game. Take this as a recommendation for the original 2 Thief games, and while weaker, the third. If you play those and want another game. Just go play Dishonoured as a full stealth character, its not quite the same but its a lot closer than this abomination.			"

												As a fan of the original series I have a little mixed feelings about this game. Actually a lot. Game has a beatiful visual adaptation with great and interesting atmosphere. I also really like the idea of Garrets interactions with the environment. But with it come the downsides. This interactions are very limiting for the gameplay.But then there are plain stupid things. For example the city. Although nicely looking it is GOD DAMNT EMPTY!!! You will get plenty of quests like ""steal this"", ""steal that"" but you wont encounter a single citizen. Like nobodys home, ever. Then there are the Guards (The Watch), looking like they got straight from Dishonored along with plenty other stuff (Granny Rags, Pleague, Evil Baron).Overall this game feels like Dishonored ripoff, Dishonored just had smoothier gameplay and better story.Wasted potencial is strong with this one.

												It was okay.  Took about 20 hours of gameplay to beat and I barely understood the plot that was happening throughout the game. As I pushed further into the game I became less interested in being stealthy since it wasn't as satisfying, so I just started hitting people in the head with an arrow, and not going too far out of my way for extra loot.  I enjoyed parts, however by the second to last chapter I found myself looking forward to completing the game and moving on to a new one.Eventually I did comple the game, and the ending left me confused without any sense of closure.  Reflecting on the plot and it's characters, I realize neither had a great deal of depth in the first place.			"

It has comparable features to the original Thief games but thats about it. Everything else was changed... and not for the better. It feels like they took the thief concept and gutted it... then plastered a shiny new shell on top and made it look new and shiny.

												TL;DR: All in all I'd say buy the game, if its on sale. I paid $15 for it and my 23 hours of play time was worth that. I plan on finishing out some of the extra side content and that will probably round out the value of the game for me. Disclaimer: I haven't played the previous (original) Thief games.ALSO MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. I wouldn't consider them spoilers, but if you're a purist I figured I'd warn you.This game was a few ups and downs for me. It started off pretty great. I was really enjoying the idea of being a master thief. Sneaking around and being able to find my way into different places on the map. As the game went on though you learn that you obtained special powers; that if you ""focus really hard"" things become clearer. This is were I had my first down. I was expecting this to just become a cop-out over the rest of the game. Giving you god-like abilities (a la Dishonored) in a situation where you seem to be just a normal guy we some practiced thieving abilities (unlike Dishonored which made the powers an integral mechanic of the game). For most of the game these powers, to my delight, did not make you god-like. You are fragile enough (without ""massive upgrades"") that if you don't at least attempt to stay hidden and sneak around, you WILL be punished. You certainly aren't a damage drinker like you would be in a Call of Duty game. This made for a fun play through with some good challenges in many areas. I must say though that if you're looking for the ""choose your own path"" approach this is where this game seems to falter again. There are clearly places in the game at which you are funneled into a specific path. Usually at these choke points if you were playing a Ghost playthrough you are going to have a stupidly difficult time trying to pass it, when a Predator, or an Opportunist, will pass it in a matter of seconds. It feels like it's an artificial difficulty spike. If each play-style is apparently weighted the same then don't make areas that are stupidly difficult for just one of them. This of course is just my opinion. Maybe I missed something in the surroundings that could have made it easier, and so my opinions may be unfounded.The last up and down came towards the end of the game. I was enjoying how the story was developing and how the levels were becoming longer, demanding a more thought out approach to each level. This all came to a head, though, when you reach the last story mission. Here you end up put in multiple situations in which the game is effectively linear. You have to reach ONE door, or ONE opening, to proceed (if there were more openings I must be blind because I spent forever on that last mission searching places). In a game that sold itself as you being able to choose how you get places this was a kick in the teeth. The last mission, the one where everything is supposed to come together, validate your experience, you're forced into a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all experience. It felt like everything I had done for the rest of the game didn't really matter. I lost any choice that I could have and that spoiled the times when I did have choice. It wasn't just the lack of choice that really spoiled the end for me, though.The ending of the game is one of the most abrupt and least fulfilling that I've ever encountered. There are no answers to anything you may be wondering throughout the game, it just ends. Well, not before they give you a plot convienience that allows them to market you another game in the future. It seems like they just gave up and sold the game, without spending time to wrap it up. Maybe its just me but it sucked.All in all I'd say buy the game, if its on sale. I paid $15 for it and my 23 hours of play time was worth that. I plan on finishing out some of the extra side content and that will probably round out the value of the game for me.			"

												Story: awful.  'We're all big fans of the original Thief games and so we wanted to....nah, just kidding.  None of us give a♥♥♥♥♥♥'Engine: awful.  Judders around while it loads in like a fat man in an earthquake.Design: awful.  All the quirky stuff from the originals has been removed: funky beasties, religious elements, magic/techno hybrids.  And 'Garrett' is apparently on his way to a S&M club.  For goths.  In stuff that looks like it takes 3 hours to put on.Assuming you can get past what a horrendous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation it is of the original games, its actually alright to play.  Mostly.  Swoop is an interesting addition, you are no longer entirely invisible at 6 inches, and you are still nicking stuff. Still suffers from stupid decisions (no fast travel, christ this gets old fast; REPEATEDLY TAP BUTTON FOR NO REASON AT ALL; missions of dementedly variable length; crappy side missions that take you to the other side of the city (see: fast travel) for worthless reward).Bonus negative points for 'Wow, Shalebridge Cradle was a good level, lets make it worse.'  'What we need is a really♥♥♥♥♥♥villain of the piece, who isn't remotely intimidating but is absolutely laughable in a bad way.'  'Pffff, a decent voice actor for the player character (and a decent scriptwriter) is overrated.'			"

												Sure the game looks nice and is very interesting, but you will shortly realise that the game is in fact very straightfoward and gets boring when the first main missions are done. Everything appart from the main campaign is what you ould call a game ''filler'', which means it's not entertaining. It's just there to stop people from saying the game is incomplete. Overall, I had a nice experience until the couple last missions. There is not even a multiplayer. Definitely an overhyped game in my opinion.			"

												Pretty great graphics, great 3D, completely uninspired nonsensical story, sloppy gameplay + AI. I wouldn't have paid 5$ for it if I would have been able to tried before I bought it. The audio in this game is also pathetic, at certain times the music is so loud that it completely obfuscated the main story narration, this is the worst audio integration I've ever seen in a video game.

												Thourghly disappointed in this game. I've loved every Thief game, and was highly anticipating this one.  First and foremost, the stealth mechanic is different in one very significant way which essentially ruined the whole game for me.  In the other Thief games when your detection gem was totaly dark there was no way anyone could detect you unless they walked right into you, which made it seem like Garret had a supernatural stealth ability. Not so here, if your gem is dark and your are in line of sight of a guard, he will see you, even from distance.  This in not the Garret I enjoyed playing before.  And why no Taffers?  Is Taffer tademarked or what? Come on Eidos!!!.  Finally can we lose the Taffin brothel missions?  I tolerated it in Dishonored, but this one was just gratuitous, which is ok if you are 13 years old I guess. Puhlease!!!			"

												I wouldn't spend any money on this if you were a fan of the old games. The Pagans and Hammerites of the old City are gone, and I almost feel like they just gutted everything that made the original series setting so unique. It's just a standard Victorian ero type place where the rich tend to screw over the poor and the poor all have the plague. Gameplay wise, there's just nothing new that I saw or at least noticed. It's also pretty linear, which does not serve it all that well. What? You wanted to *explore* WELL I'M SORRY BUT TOUCHING THAT SHELF JUST TRIGGERED AN IRREVERSIBLE EVENT. CAN'T GO BACK NOW. I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT, TAFFER! There are some fun moments, yeah, but... It's not Thief anymore. It's an okay game on its own, but it isn't a Thief game, if that makes sense.			"

												Thie4f thrusts you into the shoes of emo Garrett, a clone of witty Garrett 200 years or so after the original died in a Shalebridge Cradle-wannabe. You must use your stealth abilities and an unexplained mechanical eye to navigate through 8 linear chapters that tie together a reasonably interesting story that resembles swiss cheese with its numerous plot holes.If you liked previous Thief games, you will wish you could erase this taff from your memory.If you have never played a Thief game before, you'll probably enjoy this.4 taffers out of 10.

												Let me give you a sense of gameplay: there's a particular side mission where you have to get into a certain shop in order to begin. And the only way into that particular shop is through a window. And the only way to get to the window is across the balconies. Which are only accessible by a rope anchor. Which can only be shot to an anchor point over a brightly lit street patrolled by four guards (five if the one from Raker's Ditch is nearby).Up to this point, I had no complaints. After all, I bought the game for the challenge.So I get to the street, shoot the rope, and hit spacebar to climb it...except instead of grabbing the rope, the thief does his ""silent swoop"" maneuver - which being in a brightly lit spot catches the attention of every guard. Turns out rope anchors and slightly inclined streets are not friendly with one another. So I had to knock out all the guards, back up to the corner of the street, and take the rope at a run in order to grab it. Not exactly stealthy.Don't misunderstand me; the game had potential. And honestly, the real reason I stopped playing was that I suddenly remembered I don't like creepy stuff. (I didn't run out of the room or anything; I just don't enjoy it.) But even though I was willing to overlook what turned out to be an unending string of mechanical bugs that a little bit of investment in QA would have resolved (because I did buy the game, after all, and I'd like to get my money's worth), I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone else. It's just too broken.P.S. - I bought this game three months ago for 50% off. Now it's on sale for 66% off. I really should have seen that coming, and I'm sure a 75% off sale is just around the corner; so even if you ignore the rest of my review, at least don't make the same mistake I did. Hold on to your money until the better deal comes along.P.P.S. - I should also mention that my *brand-new computer* could barely run the game on the lowest possible graphics settings. The in-between cinematics ran at half normal framerate no matter what I did. Granted, the GPU is an Intel model, but COME ON.			"

												If you're a hardcore Thief-fan, this game is definitely not for you. I was more than a little disappointed with all the deviations this game makes from the original Thief-series. Already at the main menu, you can hear the music is more like that of an action movie, rather than the fearful noises and tunes found in Thief. The next thing you notice is that they're using a new voice actor, which is really a pity, but as you play you'll find that this new Garett does a real good job in mimicking the original Thief voice. However the language of the previous thief games is gone, replaced with a more modern and American linguistic. Next, the character of the City. The city atmosphere is completely different, more akin to a medieval city with christian chapels, rather than the conflict between hammerites and pagans. The city's secret order seems to be completely gone, replaced by an old blind lady in some ruins - a poor and cliché-like replacement. Finally, the levels. It seems each map is divided into sealed compartments. You only get one chance to loot each compartment, and each compartment can only be progressed from one entry, and left by one exit. What was once open maps, and an open city, is now more or less a straight path on rails (at least that's the feeling I got while playing). Still, for people who can accept some deviation, this game represents a good addition to the stealth game genre. Voice acting is good, cut scenes are well-made, and maps are very well designed. The game looks stunning, and there's definitely some fun to be had, which is why I can actually recommend playing this game.			"

												The short review is: This a very ""meh"" game.  There are not any major flaws, but lots and lots of little ones.  I bought it on sale and most of the time playing it was just killing time.  I actually had to push myself to finish it.The longer version:This isn't a theif game.  It make take place in the theif universe, but that is about the only relation to the other theif games.  I am sure this has been said many times in other reviews, so ignoring that, this game in it's own right is quite bland.Let me put it this way.  I sometimes play Hearthstone when I have some time to kill or I am a bit bored.  I am not really into Harthstone; It is just a game I play once in a while for a few games.    Many times while playing thief, after an hour or so, I was thinking about playing Hearthstone instead of being absorbed into this game.Some things that annoyed me were:The City:  You have to run around this place to go from mission to mission.  It get quite tedious fast.  At some point I just stopped doing side-missiosn because I just wanted to be done with the game and was so sick of crossing the city over and over.Most of the upgrades are geared toward combat.  More bow damage, more health, more black-jack damage.  Isn't this a Theif game?  Oh yeah...The constant chatter of the guards complaing about the same things no matter where they were.  IE: you are in a lost temple 100s of feet underground and guards are griping about the fact there are no sloop vendors nearby (what is sloop anyway?).  Or that they can smell the river from here. Or whatever random gripe they cycle through billions of times.The fact that garret must have a giant santa-clause bag to carry all the gold forks and ashtrays he is picking up.  In other theif game you did have the minor things you picked up, but a lot of it was high quality loot.  Like a gem or work of art.  Here is tuns of ""junk"".    Even when you do find something cool, it turns out to be a collectable, not something you can sell.  IE In one mission I went though a lot to reover some phat diamond. I was hoping to get a lot of gold, but nope... Its a collectable.  Nope, if you want gold, you better steal more forks or coin purses from bird's nests.Speaking of birds, what is the deal with all the caged birds and broken glass everwhere?  That was also just stupid.Oh, at one point the city is burning and all the NPC chatter is just normal stuff.  Nothing about the fact that the place is in flames, but no, how cold a guard is despite the fact he is 10 feet from an inferno...Anyway... Normally in stealth games I prefer to take the non-leathal approach.  However, but the end of this game, my contempt for it got so strong I just wanted to murder everyone.Oh and the ending?  Just bad... really, really bad.Anyway, save your money and buy something else, even if this game is on sale.  I paid $11 and the only thing it satisfied was my curosity about this game.  Could it have really been as bad as everyone says?  It turns out, yes it can.			"

												Thief has good graphics and above average mechanics. It can be challenging at times, as you have to be careful in making any noise that can attract attention to yourself. Especially, when you're trying to not kill or knockout any of the guards.  (Flashbangs, and bottle throwing are not bad for taking their attention off you.)The story is hard to grasp. You have to read the notes and eavesdrop in conversations to start piecing everything together. So, if you don't have the attention span for it, the story will be confusing. I thought it was great and well worth the effort. Although, Square Enix should next time leave it all out in the open and the notes should  be just ""extras,"" instead of being necessary to read.I hope that they don't give up on the series and make a sequal to Thief soon. Happy gaming.			"

												I recommend it if it`s a great sale.Where to start with Thief? It's very tempting to compare it to the good Thief game, the metal age, but that's just going to make me angry and disappointed. So let me talk about Thief as if I never heard of this franchise before.I played it on master difficulty and it was hard, but the wrong kind of hard. The detection system is unpredictable, sometimes I can walk behind a guard sometimes I can't, sometimes I can stand in front of a guard in the dark, sometimes I can't. Sometimes the guards arrange themselves into impossible configurations (impossible without being detected) because they have some dialogue scripted that doesn't trigger, because they are stuck on a wall or somethign like that. The level design is generally bad and filled with this kinds of problems.Now, these levels were made by talented designers, so what  the hell happened? I'm not sure but I have a theory. You see, level design of stealth games is the trickiest thing there is. Take a good working level and rotate one of the guards, now it's an impossible level. It's that finicky. In Thief they created this upgrade system that encompass everything, your equipment, your movements, stealth etc and that's a huge problem for the level designer. This worked on Deus Ex because DX is a game meant to be played in several different ways, so the level design doesn't have to be so tightly locked to a playstyle. You give the player options but you can be sure that it has other solutions. Upgrade system is a bit trendy right now so they blindly included it in Thief and it broke the game.City hub. It didn't work in Deadly Shadows, it didn't work here. The reason is very simple, stealth is 75% puzzle-like, there's no fun in solving the same puzzle again, making city hub/open world thing unfun for most of the time. It works on games without puzzle elements, like car games, action shooting etc. It's a bit trendy right now so they blindly included city hub/ open world in Thief and it broke the game.The story is all over the place. It's strange, there's a lot of details on the world itself but the story is broken.Yet another mediocre sequel to an excellent and classic game. I have no hopes anymore, Thief will be like Star Wars, where the bad stuff outweights the good stuff. I understand it's not entirely their (the devs) fault. Most of what made the original games special go against the current trends in game design, and it's hard to tell the person that is investing all the money that your game will have none of this open world silliness, upgrade system, RPG elements and all these things that seem to sell games nowadays, and that the graphics will not be up to par with the current generation because we have to compromise something in order to have larger maps. It's not an easy sales pitch and it's a lot of money we're talking about here! But, who knows, maybe Eidos goes crazy and decides to make a worthy sequel despite its risks, or sell the ip to someone who will, whatever comes first.			"

												Wow, such a empty, boring, mute and disgusting game this is. I'm still trying to finish it so my opinion will be edited after I'm done.EDIT: After a month of playing this horrible game I finally finished it, so I can finish my review too.I can personally tell, that only good thing in this game is that it has no sequel and it's creators won't make another Thief game for a long time.As other good side of this worse reboot of game franchise, it had these pros:+ Chapter 5 - Moira Asylum. It's wasn't like the game other chapters and had really decent horror game athmosphere. Decent but not good enaugh;+ Sound and music during chase scenes, also when guards are looking for you;+ Chase scenes altogether were good, nice music and visual effects, really good but it's not Tomb Rider good, because at some point you are thief, not a Indiana Jones;+ Main story line is very bad, but gives you good twists some times.+ AI is somewhat better than I expected, especially on Master Difficulty.Cons, where to begin:- It's not a Thief;- It's not an Assassins Creed;- It's not a Hitman;- It is a mutant son of past memories about this game series style and new generation stealth games style, more of their b**tard son.I'm sure this game had a lot of negative reviews and I don't want to add even more. My final score of this game is:4/10P.S. Side missions sucked, dogs and parrots p*ssed me off. Peace			"

												When I first knew about this reboot, I had never played the previous games (at the time), and based on the reviews of them and the features of the previews, I decided to pre-order the game, and I don't regret it. But it could have been much better. Below are the main pros and cons:Pros:- Great graphics and excellent art direction, with are very effective in giving a oppressive, glooming but beautiful settings. A fortunate detail is that is possible to see almost Garret's entire body, unlike other first-person games.- Easy, fluid and immersive playability. Though it should have a jump button, I rarely missed it when I was playing.- Solid stealth options: places to hide, shadows, distractions- Offers multiple approachs to pass through the levels, as well as lots of exploration.- Customization of difficulty, with several handicaps to increase substatianlly the challenge.- Great side-quests, more open-ended than main campaign. I particularly enjoyed a lot the bank heist mission.Cons- Story, characters, dialogues: easily (for me) the worst flaws of the game. For starters, it occurs in a completely different timeline from the classic games, many years after their events, so none of the original characters appear here, even Garrett, which here is someone else. The plot is so incomplete, with so many doubts, plot holes and questions unansewerd or dealt incoherently. Examples: the so-called Baron is often mentioned as someone very important for The City and so, but only appers TWICE during the whole game, in short appearances; the Thief-Taker General appears only in incovenient moments and is always misplaced; and Garrett himself is a shadow (pun intended) of his former self; plenty of times he is so sloppy during the campaign that makes arguable the ""Master Thief"" nickname. And the ending... WTF. So abrupted and frustrating, it's like they had run out of time (or/and ideas) and decided to just end there. If not for the several notes found in the levels to understand the lore it would be much worse. No wonder Rhianna Pratchett (yes, the same from the last Tomb Raider) refused (and still refuses) to talk about the game, except ""I hope some of you like it""; well Rhianna, I didn't, so f#¨% you and the other writers. Do not EVER return for a sequel.- Excess of linearity: Despite what I had said above as a pro, actually the freedom of approach is irregular though the levels. That is there are sections in a chapter which you have plenty of paths and things to explore, but in others the path is strictly linear. E.g.: chapter 4, the mansion section offers plenty of approaches to explore but past that is very linear so the map (which is mostly confusing) becomes unnecessary. Doesn't help either that on screen (and map) there's an icon pointing exaclty where you're supposed to go and how far is it. It kills most of the challenge!- Music: It is not bad itself, it's ok, but is mostly generic, the kind of could be in any thriller movie. Little of it is remarkable.- Difficulty: as good as it is to customize it, it feels more like an artificial way to increase the challenge. The AI itself is stupid and predictable, and waht makes frustrating to fight them is that Garrett only has a blackjack to fight them (no knives, daggers or swords!) and have to hit them a few times  to make them flinch so thay can be knocked out.As you can see, I detailed more the cons than the pros, so you may think my recommendation is incoherent. I felt that I had to elaborate more the cons to be better understood. But all in all, the gameplay itself is good, the levels are compelling to explore and there's lots of exploration. And at this time of my review the price is really attractive to purchase.I have already played the 3 previous games, and I completely understand why many fans hate this game. But I can't deny I mostly enjoyed playing this game (I woudn't have played Thief for almost 50 hours if I didn't, believe me). It is a good game. Although I must admit if I had played them before this reboot I would probably have liked less.I honeslty hope there's a sequel and if the development team regards all the feedback, and is more inspired with better writers, future games can be much better than this one.I give it 75/100.

												Pathetic attempt at modernizing a classic series. These younger developers haven't learned from the past, believing that QTE's and nice animations make for some fun gameplay. While the world in Thief is quite pretty, Dishonored seems to have really taken the mantle as what constitutes as the new stealth king. Thief lacks a jump button, the designers seem to think that being a master thief AND a free runner, the jump button isn't nessary. The entire world is contextural, you can only do what the small minded designers want you to do. Forget about using the rope arrow to explore the different options of getting into a building, there's only ONE place to use that. While the textures and lighting is nice, the world is too small and cramped, it seems that the City has shrunk.Why is it that the modern designers think that every game has to be like Assassin's Creed? or Call of Duty. If I wanted to play an Assassin's Creed game, I would, but these days publishers seem to think that everything should be like that. Lack of real good gameplay makes this seem like a glorified tech demo.Stay away from this unless you like dumbed down games and watching cutscenes which is basically every younger gamer out there and that makes me sad for the future of games.This reboot should have never happened and I want my money back on this turd.Ok, three hours into this and yes it's still quite simple and no real challenge. Remember that the designers couldn't make a GOOD game due to the console limitations. I still think that this game is not very good.Now I am 5 hours in, and while the only thing that I really like about this game is the movement, but the lack of a jump button, dedicated lean keys and just bad level design really make this game more suitable to the console player with its simplistic control scheme and general hand-holding, the game will play itself, and solve all the puzzles for you if the designers were allowed to. Hence, this game really lacks any imagination and freedom of movement that the previous games had, including a JUMP button. Thanks, Edios for ♥♥♥♥ing up another franchise.6 Hours in and while I like the way you move, it has a nice weight and smooth movement the lack of freedom in the levels make this a neutered piece of crap. Why am I still playing? i paid 10 bucks for this turd and I plan on finishing it. The level design so far is quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Small areas and lack of choice are what drags this down. I miss being able to stack and move crates, getting stuck on a box, unable to jump OR climb on shows that the designers don't know how to make good gameplay. Console players will feel right at home with this, the game will actually play it self. One long cutscene, this is what ""modern"" gameplay is, makes me sad :(12 hours in, and it's not getting any better. The lack of options in the levels make for some very restrictive gameplay. A level under a brothel was uneventful, the brothel itself didn't need the nudity and sex scenes. The amount of cutscenes are two much, obviously the designers don't know how to convey story info through a invisible cutscene. It's very jarring to have control yanked out from under you as a cutscene takes over, making you totally lose the inmersive world that the creators so painstakinly create, bad design choices reek throughout this POS of a game. The contextual gameplay makes for lots of mistakenly closed doors, or dousing of lights when all you really want to do is pick up a stupid piece of gold. The amount of animations for every little thing that Garret does is just to much after awhile, once again the control is yanked away and you lose the inmersivness again.While the visuals in the Brothel and underneath are quite pretty, the size of these levels are too small to really take advantage of Garret and his ""swoop"" ability, which has no reason to exsist other than to compete with Dishonored, same with the Focus ability. These make a simple game too simple. AI is nothing to get worked up about, it's dead brained and make the stealth kinda useless.17 hours in, I've been taking my time. What is it with the lack of a persistant world where you leave a side mission and come back and have to do the entire waste of time again? With the limitations of the PC, the first two games had thier issues but they made up for it in large levels and engrossing gameplay. Those games where qutie clever in level design, you really had to think about where you were and where were the guards where in relation to your goal. Their AI routines where persistant and they would hunt you down, in this game all you need to do is lose LOS and your clear. No real challenge or any sense of danger from being caught. I don't think any kid today could ever play the originals and complete them. How could they? with no sense of the past consoler's lose a vital part of what makes simple gameplay so compelling, this goes for the game's designers too. Thief lacks the respect to the originals, throwing on a shiny sheen and gimmicks that have no place in the world.Having played alot of PC games since 1995, I found that the further you get away from the triple A titles, the better in terms of originality, fun, and art and design the better. Once in awhile you get a good title, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, Deus Ex, (not HR, lousy boss battles) but these are far and few between. Its innovation that stems from the limitation of the tech that inspires different types of gameplay and level design, Thiefs designers are limited by their lack of being able to see the limits of the consoles and using that as an advantage. Instead adding gimmicks and cheap story telling rather than engaging the player to really take their time and just soak up the world. Focus, and swoop (such a stupid, uninspired name) make Thief qutie boring, they also force the player to rush forward instead of just stopping and take a look. I know a lot of players like this game, but the reasons they like it have no merit. A shiny coat and some flashy effects can't hide the designers lack of imagination. I actually hope that they all get♥♥♥♥♥cancer. I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to finish this as I don't know what the story is about.... unrest? plague? characters that are too lazy to fetch their own♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't know. I really really really want to like this game, I am huge Thief player but I can't get past these crates cause I can't climb on them or jump on them or even pick them up and move them.......Ok, 23 hours in, have I really been playing this for that long? I've been doing the Basso missions, and started on the so-called haunted insane asylum mission and really hate jump scares, their not scary and this level is boring. I thought that there would be a huge asylum to explore, secrets and other goodies to find but no. After the last level with the ""giant"" safe, I found that the inconsistant art, and almost useless arrow selection really don't make a difference. What can one arrow do that the others can't? nothing except cost more. The impossible architecture don't scale well, what's with the outside being huge and the inside being so small and cramped? Nothing makes sense. When I am in this game, I take my time to remove the guards to make exploring easier. After I leave an area I find that the guards are all now awake and I have to do it all over again, talk about padding up the gameplay. And the amount of loading screens it torture, why oh why can't consoles at least hold the entire level? I mean this ain't 2003 dark shadows era. Triple A gaming, in terms of tech haven't evolved much, You would think that with the power of the machines that this would not be a problem but covering it up with a fancy animation doesn't make it any better.

												TL;DR: Not a successor to the Thief-Franchise but (except for the story) a damn good stealth-game on its own.As you might imagine, I do not have much experience with the Thief franchise, due to me being of very young age. I wasn't even born when the first Thief was released. However, I do have experience with stealth-games in general, and I hope to bring you a detailed insight of Thief 2014 and answer your question if you should buy it or not.STORYThe Story begins with Garrett robbing a Safe for an expensive necklace. After he escapes the attic he found the safe in, he meets his friend Erin, who leads Garrett through a kind-of-tutorial-area. At the end of the mission, the two observe a group of people who look like priests or monks performing a ritual in front of something called the 'Primal Stone'. The Building Collapses, Erin falls down and dies, Garrett falls down, survives, but falls unconscious.A Year later, Garrett wakes up while two beggars try to smuggle his body into his hideout in the clocktower in the center of the city. The smuggling attempt fails, one beggar is killed, the other runs away and Garrett is on his own, with the claw he ""inherited"" from Erin. He later learns that the main antagonist is still alive, and that a plague-like disease, the ""Gloom"" is running about in the city.Garrett now works for several sides, his fence Basso, Orion, the leader of the resistance, and as a freelance to discover the secret behind his hallucinations of Erin in some kind of otherworld.HUBWORLD / THIEVERYIn the Hubworld you can take side-missions or go and heist houses at your own leisure. There's loot everywhere and some guards even carry little valuables on their belt, which you can either take by taking up their body after you killed / knocked them unconscious, or you can pickpocket the loot from them. There are also merchants who sell you various types of arrows, and quest-givers, who... well... give quests.MOVEMENTGarrett moves at a medium pace, and you can hold CTRL to walk over glass shards or through water quietly, or you can sprint by holding shift.While you cannot jump in place anymore, Spacebar has turned into one button for a little dash which you can use as a crouched sprint, and you can sprint with shift and hold spacebar to turn it into an automatic climbing button.COMBAT: BlackjackGarrett carries a bow and a blackjack, but not a sword anymore.Also, you can't equip the blackjack anymore, but swing it directly. Further, there's a dodge-button which helps you in combat. 3 Hits with the Blackjack while evading enemy hits will usually trigger an optional button to instantly knock out the guard. Without the Bow, you can NOT kill or civilians anymore.THE BOWThe Bow is your all-purpose-weapon. You can shoot regular arrows to snipe enemies, water arrows to extinguish light sources, gas arrows to knock out birds, dogs and other potential troublemakers, and blunt-headed arrows which you can carry in great amounts to trigger buttons from afar.One VERY big flaw for me is that you can shoot rope arrows only at pre-determined locations now, instead of wood in general. This eliminates the whole purpose of using a rope to climb unclimbable terrain. Now it's REQUIRED to reach certain locations, and the feeling of ""being smarter than the game"" which you had in the old Thief games is now gone.MISSION DESIGNThe side jobs are manifestations of the thief formula: go to x, steal y and, sometimes, bring it to z. For every side mission you receive a small amount of gold, sometimes a few hundred, sometimes the reward is a piece of loot that's worth 50 gold.One problem is the amount of side missions there are in the game. If you do them all, you will never face financial problems and be able to buy everything, at least below master difficulty. In the Master difficulty grade, arrows and gadgets are considerably harder to come by, and at some point you will have to decide what type of arrows you want.The Story Missions are horribly designed. Sometimes the game crosses Horror territory,WALKING THROUGH AN ASYLUM WITH NO ENEMIES AROUND AND PICKING RANDOM LOCKS TO TRIGGER STORY PROGRESS DOES NOT BELONG IN A STEALTH-GAME.Sometimes it throws you into a room with 4 or more enemies, aware of your presence, and with the objective set near an un-extinguishable lightsource, forcing you to kill or knock out everyone around.GRAPHICS, PERFORMANCEThe game runs buttery smooth on my Phenom II X4 965 BE and Radeon HD 7850, without AA and V-Sync. Shadows look great even on medium settings and the textures reach from okay to sexual intercourse for the eye.PERFORMANCE OPTIONSThe list is too extensive to describe in in detail here, but I will give you an example:Imagine the settings ""Graphic quality: Low/Medium/High""Thief's graphic settings are the opposite of that.Also: FOV goes up to 110°.GAMEPLAY SETTINGS / DIFFICULTY SETTINGSYou can create a custom game-mode with special limitations. There are many options, from ""you can't use broadhead and sawtooth arrows"" to ""if you die your savegame is deleted"". All of these options increase the score you get in the game, which is shared on a global leaderboard, if you choose so.Overall, Thief is a nice game. The thievery and movement feels right, and aside from some really ♥♥♥♥ed up main missions, it's a blast to play. I bought it in a bundle for 9€ and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game for 9€? Worth every penny.Thief 2014, Thief 4, Thief Reboot, Thief Remastered, Thief whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you'd like to call it, is dragged down by comparisons to the older Thief titles, which were better than this game. This does not mean that this game is bad, though.			"

												Bought this game when it first dropped. My personal biggest dissapointment in video game history. As a fan of the series I was jazzed and waited all night to play it, only to find myself bored and annoyed. It wasnt until months later that I realized I was playing a meta game. Eidos stole my money. Edit now a while later as to why it's so terrible. Bad controls, terrible story, no incentive to do anything.thief/10 don't want to get robbed again.			"

												Wow, such a empty, boring, mute and disgusting game this is. I'm still trying to finish it so my opinion will be edited after I'm done.EDIT: After a month of playing this horrible game I finally finished it, so I can finish my review too.I can personally tell, that only good thing in this game is that it has no sequel and it's creators won't make another Thief game for a long time.As other good side of this worse reboot of game franchise, it had these pros:+ Chapter 5 - Moira Asylum. It's wasn't like the game other chapters and had really decent horror game athmosphere. Decent but not good enaugh;+ Sound and music during chase scenes, also when guards are looking for you;+ Chase scenes altogether were good, nice music and visual effects, really good but it's not Tomb Rider good, because at some point you are thief, not a Indiana Jones;+ Main story line is very bad, but gives you good twists some times.+ AI is somewhat better than I expected, especially on Master Difficulty.Cons, where to begin:- It's not a Thief;- It's not an Assassins Creed;- It's not a Hitman;- It is a mutant son of past memories about this game series style and new generation stealth games style, more of their b**tard son.I'm sure this game had a lot of negative reviews and I don't want to add even more. My final score of this game is:4/10P.S. Side missions sucked, dogs and parrots p*ssed me off. Peace			"

												This game is difficult to write a review for. It ranges from brilliant to extremely obnoxious and in the end manages to be a flawed, okay game that really could have been great. It took me about 22 hours with quite a bit of exploring, not killing or knocking anyone out, and doing all of the side missions. If you rushed through the main story it would be MUCH shorter than that.First things first, the actual thieving is great. The missions are, for the most part, well designed, and they have a good variety. Attempting to steal as much loot as possible without being detected really does have its thrills. Swooping in, stealing something while a guard's back is turned, and swooping back to the shadows feels immensely rewarding. The stealth is well done, and there is a variety of tools and upgrades (if you choose to use them) at your disposal. Most of the levels have quite a few different paths you can take. The Bank Heist DLC / preorder bonus is also quite fun, but probably not worth 5 dollars.Many kudos to the game for the wide variety of difficulty options, graphic options, HUD options, etc. Pretty much every HUD item can be turned off, and you can adjust the difficulty and change various things (knockout/kills not allowed, no focus, no reticle for your bow, expensive resources, etc). There's even an iron man mode (die and it's over). Really, I can't give them enough props for this. Well Done.On to the bad. The City, or the 'open world' portion of the game, is tedious at best and absolutely annoying at worst. I feel like this was tacked on due to the popularity of open world games, and in the end it really suffers for it. The game would have been better off without the entire city. It's neat that there is random hidden loot everywhere, but trust me, by the end of the game you'll be really tired of running across the same strange paths, dodging the same guards walking the same paths, and hearing the same dialogue lines. If I have to hear about why that one guard doesn't reek of ♥♥♥♥ anymore... Oh, and if you decide to turn on 'expensive resources', get ready for side missions to be pretty obnoxious to do. Expensive resources makes rope arrows 450g, and you often need one to get to an uninteresting side mission that will net you 50-100g.Speaking of guards, the guard AI is, in a world, terrible. I can't hold this against them too much, as stealth games sort of thrive on terrible enemy AI (WHERE DID HE GO? ~5 seconds later~ IT WAS PROBABLY NOTHING), but I think it's worth mentioning.I didn't experience any crash to desktops or graphical problems, but the game does have a few audio bugs. Sometimes guards would say the same piece of dialogue twice in a row, on top of each other, so you'd hear it twice. Othertimes the audio would go out of sync during a cutscene, or other audio would be playing when it shouldn't have been. There was one mission where I couldn't hear Garrett's voice over the sounds of the game. Again, not serious, but worth noting.So overall, would I recommend this? Maybe-- To the right person. If you can slog through the city and the other undesirable parts, there really is some fun to be had. The story isn't fantastic, but the setting is interesting enough and the thieving is fun.And finally, this game really isn't anything like Dishonored. Really, it's not. Corvo is a highly trained magical assassin who specializes in murdering dudes as quickly as possible. Garrett is a thief. He steals things. He says, during the prologue, something like ""I don't just kill people."" People will want to compare the two because they're both first person stealth games, but they really are not similar games. I cannot stress this enough. Do not expect this to be like Dishonored.			"

												tl;dr Grab it for 5-10 bucks on sale if you want a below-average stealth game, else skip it.First of all: I haven't played the original Thief games, so I don't know what all you series fans did expect or are missing. Playing through the story missions (eight; nine if you count the prologue) took me about 9 1/2h on normal difficulty whereas I consider myself a solid stealth player. I couldn't really follow the story to be honest, I got a rough idea but the flat enactment and missing depth of the characters led to general disinterest. Which is sad as the atmosphere can get quite tense and the world as a whole is nicely set up.Stealth gameplay works okay, A.I. is bugged sometimes tho. Guards (I've only seen two or three different types during my playthrough btw) should recognize me when I touch them even on normal difficulty, eh? Close combat is rather clunky but handling one or two guards shouldn't pose a problem. Garretts bow is his all-in-one-gear: use it to kill guards, disctract guards, stun guards, blow up guards and also extinguish flames.You can buy more or less useful additional equipment from merchants which you can rarely find in The City. Inventory management is a pain though, you can't purchase arrows or healing items directly to the storage in your ""residence"" and are forced to pay a visit to the merchant every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time you need to restock. Incredibly annoying. Thief also offers a completly redundant skill system which has next-to-no impact on gameplay at all.Speaking about skill, Nixxes software showed their dedication to create great PC versions of games once more. Thief is very well optimized and ran with a constant 1080p60 on my i5 4570 & HD 7870 with everything except SSAO maxed out. The game can't be considered Crysis 4 or anything but offers great lightning and shadows which is quite essential to such a thiefy game in my opinion. You can really see how consoles held back the game in terms of textures since many of them - including commonly seen as close up like windows and doors - lack detail and could have used a higher resolution. Also, loading times occur too often. They are short still annoying. Whatever, the game looks good and more importantly runs pretty damn well. Also, Mantle and True Audio support are planned for you AMD users out there.All in all the game is alright - it lacks a solid story and good characters, but offers a nice stealth gameplay expierence in a very tense setting. I wouldn't pay full price for it (got it through an AMD silver code for about 10€) but feel free to grab it at a prince range from 5-10€ if you can live with the aforementioned problems.			"

												I'm honestly shocked I've spent so long playing this game -- perhaps I was trying to get my money's worth?Where to start:* Sound: is poor. Not just the effects themselves, which trend generically, but also the mix. It's impossible to echo-locate, everything's so loud. Guards sound like they're next to you when they're not. * Level Design: the hub world is broken into chunks by fat loading screens disguised by the repetitive jimmying of windows or squeezing past the same propped beam. Actual levels tend to lack the sand-box qualities of earlier titles, tending towards linear play. The game locks you into ridiculous set-pieces encounters at odds with the game's mechanics (a boss fight, timed action set-pieces) that look expensive and play cheaply. * Narrative: poor. Derivative nonsense, poorly rendered. Performances vary, but tend to be broad in a way that clashes with the self-important tone. Narrative grace notes pointlessly nasty, ending illogical, leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Masochists only.			"

												I know I only have two hours (As of writing this) but if you like the originals don't bother with this. There's some nice aspects of it, like the movment (Execpt for the Parkour bits), the spot on aptmosphere, and the visuals are nice. But the stealth mechanics aren't that great, the sound is wokny, the game isn't much of a challenge, and it's really linear.Some sounds you'd think guards would hear such as footsteps aren't heard, but things you think they wouldn't hear like messing up a lock pick they do hear, and apperently this is even loud enough to wake sleeping guards. Not only this, but occasionly it's impossible to hear people six feet away from you; you can hear the guy who is five feet away clearly, but can't hear a single thing the guy six feet away is. The game is also fairly easy even on the highest difficulty and with all of the help things off. The Parkour also really sucks, each time you go to do a manuver you snap to the object and lose all momentum..It's also rather contextual, and limiting.			"

Basso's jobs, and two clients who hire you for longer missions.Basso's jobs are basically very simple fetch quests, while the client jobs are proper side quests.. Too bad there's only about 6 of them.To sum it up: Spend your money on a better stealth game. "

												I came into this game wanting a good story, good stealth, and a feeling of RPG like elements. After playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution, I thought that maybe I could have the experience re-created in a different universe. Man was I wrong.        Let's start with the story. The story begins with you and an old-friend roaming a city, looking to steal a prize nearby. However, things go terribly wrong, and an accident happens in which case you wake up a long time later. I think a few months, but I may be wrong as I didn't really care enough to remember. You then try to find your friend, and that's the rest of the game. Trying to find your friend. Yeah, sure, they have the whole thing about the artifact and how you actually need to find that, but your friend is at the center of it all so in essence you really are just there to find her. I will give them props on one thing, though: Some of the characters in this game I really enjoyed spending a moment or two with, especially the villain.        Now time for some stealth and gameplay reviewing. Guys, if you're looking for a great stealth game, Deus Ex is the place to be. Don't even spend time looking at this game. The A.I. is not the best, the odds are massivley stacked against you on multiple parts, and the gameplay is not exemplary whatsoever. The player view constantly bobs and weaves around, sometimes making you feel nauseas. The mini-games become tedious as there are only two or three. In some sections, you are facing hyper-sensative monsters, and the stealth becomes necessary, but it's a shame that the mechanics of it really let you down.        Last, the RPG elements. You have multiple things you can upgrade and buy. The two main categories are equipment and skills. However, the skills are all pretty much useless except for the combat ones as they actually make the combat bearable. The equipment becomes fun, however. Buying a wire-cutter tool can lead you through paths you couldn't make it to before. There is also a screwdriver that allows you to go through vents and such. This leads to some interesting new ways to venture through a level, although the story missions are all pretty linear.        In conclusion, go for Deus Ex. Skip this game. Spare your sanity.			"

												Right, when it said ""explore the city"", I thought they actually meant it. It's more like a platformer with loading screens and tight hallways with a near useless minimap. It was designed for replay value - you complete a mission, miss 50% of the loot items cause you don't have the gear unlocks yet, and 3 missions later (or 1 cheat engine moment later) you have to go back and loot everything else you missed. And I mean the whole thing is about looting. I mean, yea it's called Thief, but♥♥♥♥♥♥I can play any MMO on earth and get my fill of looting. This was supposed to be special, atleast that's how I felt coming into it. And I really feel that it didn't deliver. I stopped playing at Chapter 3. Just can't devote my time to it, which is what it's truly hungry for.#MayContainSlightSpoilersAfterThisPointThe combinations of arrows are cool, but limited. Water arrows put out open-flames. The two arrows designed to do damage can't pierce the glass on closed-flame lamps, and that just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I can't even beat it with the mace that I a.) ridiculed another cinematic character for using, and b.) stole and used for myself on the premis that ""i can use it better"". Which also♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Just a bad opening scene if you ask me. Cool, sure. But the plot wasn't polished. Maybe end-game gets a crapload beter. But being locked down in the very first city to tiny hallways that lead to predetermined platform-like dead-ends, is just NOT what I thought I was paying for.So here's to another game in my library that I'll never play, and can't return for $ or credit cause steam works more on marketing than it does on quality content delivery. And this is the first review I've ever written on Steam, because it's the first (ok 2nd) game I've ever felt was so bad that I had to comment. Perhaps this game is better for someone of a different mindset and bias - but it was not my cup of tea.			"

												Before you read my review, know that I only got 75% through before ragequitting.This game is interesting and has many aspects that make it interesting, but ultimately, not worth the playthrough. First of all, I really enjoyed the visual aspects, how well it ""played"" (controls, etc.), and the overall aesthetics (visuals, sounds, environments, etc.). I thought the story and characters were interesting and piqued my interest initially. Furthermore, the city and it's elements caught my attention while I played. It's important to note that the motion capture or animation (not sure which) used in this game did a great job in capturing how people move and I think is very realistic.That all being said, the game left a tremendous amount to be desired. Initially and as I progressed, the story failed to engage me. So his lady-friend is dead, why do I care? He doesn't answer to anyone as he is a thief and nothing more: why is he so selfish? Why are there thieves and no other real criminals? So much of this seems 2-dimensional, so to speak. The gameplay also made me upset. While this ""master thief"" is very good at stealing and can slink through the shadows with his cool gadgets, climbing abilities, and impressive stealth, why does the combat aspect of this game fail so miserably? He can swipe cups, jewels, letter openers (I'm going off the top of my head) but the sword on the ground in front of you isn't available despite the guard that is clearly about to kill you? There is no easy way to defend yourself?The controls occasionally fail to impress as well. Even remapping key bindings does only so much, especially as it seems like your only option is to run away. Furthermore his ""powers"" and upgrades take a lot to unlock and still only make so much of the game more playable and barely so at that. Honestly I think anything out of the Assassin's Creed or Splinter Cell lineup would be better than this. I've thought about reinstalling it but on second thought, I have better things to do.			"

												Well, before I start, I would just like to announce, I REALLY wish this game was good, because it had so much potential, but it failed in every way it could succeed greatly. The game in general is not very well optimized for PC. I play it on high with my GTX 770 graphics card and my i5 quad core processor. Yeah I get good framerates but I feel like it should require a lot less. I remember having trouble running this on medium with my previous 1GB card, and it looks good but, should not be as performance hungry as it is.The controlling of the character when playing has a very ""blocky"" feel, I would say. It feels like the game does everything for you, and there's animations for everything you do that just seems to drag out; opening doors, pickpocketing, locking picking, doing knockouts, and I feel a lot of it doesn't play very good, or atleast on keyboard and mouse.The enemy AI are pretty horrible, and make not much sense. If you're standing and walking around in a shadow, even though you'd be harder to see, you could still be obviously visible, but god forbid if you do one little subtle thing like stand on a shard of glass or leave a door open that wasn't open before, they'll notice that of course! Takedowns could've also been promising, but if you try to take someone down and the enemy is less that 40 feet away from you, then they'll hear you, try to fight you, and you'll die, becaaaaaaaaaaaaaauseeee... combat is also terrible! You have the option to strike, and the option to dodge, Both are quite useless, and you'll only really win a fight one on one, but that won't happen of course because everyone will be alerted!The features and your equipment could also be promising, but so could everything else in this game. You can have things like arrows you fire that can pull you up on to beams and get you on rooftops, which would've been a nice feature if they gave you more of them to get onto, and if you could actually find the trader that sells all the useful equipment. There is also some other things like water arrows that put out fires, which is alright but, doesn't fix everything else that's wrong with the game.I find the story very lame, dull, drab, and other words describing generally painfully plain and boring. I'm on chapter 5 currently, and I've found there are 8 chapters, and these chapters are going by rather quickly. I would've thought with less content would mean more quality in that which it has, but apparently not.Overall I find the game to be a bad rip off of Dishonored some how. It feels a lot like Dishonored in certain ways yet this game is executed so badly I hate to say the words ""it's like Dishonored"", which is definitely in my top 5 games I've ever played. Of course this game has features of it's own too, and I think I would've liked them, but like I keep saying, this game is just, a huge waste of potential which makes me actually angry that it had to go to waste. I suppose the best one word to describe this game with is; disappointment.			"

												Love the voice acting and dialogue.  I've found myself actually laughing at quite a few of the conversations I've eavesdropped on. Eavesdropping can also alert the player to potential loot locations. The designers implemented great animations for Garret for when he opens a chest, picks a lock, searches for a hidden switch, or extinguishes a flame further adding to the game immersion. **The plot has been interesting so far** and Thief has wonderful graphics.Now The Cons:1. The light meter in Thief is a piece of junk. I can't tell you how many times I would hear my ""thief-sense"" warning me that someone was about to see me even though I am completely shrouded in darkness. I've dropped bodies into shadowed areas only to have them instantly discoveredin the patrolling guard's peripheral vision.There were even instances of Garret visually appearing to be in shadow but my light meter would say I was totally exposed and vice versa. I extinguished a candle right next to me that didn't seem to give off any light2. Your dash ability is also crap. It's context based and shares the same command as climb.So my first attempt at being sneaky I inched around a crate, waited for my moment,and watched in horror as Garret climbed on top of the crate and into the light rather than dashing.A similar experience trying to climb a rope I just hung for myself. I had to dance around the AOE of the rope until I found the sweet spot and the game allowed me to climb it.3. The same can be said for Garret's drop down ability. I swear some ledges require it and some don't. This inconsistency combined with the idiotic descision to not have a ledge hang just adds to the frustration. First I'm forced to climb up a ledge all the way because of the lack of ledge hang. Next I can hear a guard is going to spot me, so naturally I try to back up which would cause me to just fall off the ledge down to the ground below and out of sight. My back hits a wall because of that stupid drop down key and I'm spotted. This was probably from a height of 3 feet and not like up on the cat walks 20+ feet in the air.4. Guard patrol routes will randomly break. I snuck passed 2 guards while the first was doing his patrol route. Entered a dead end alley and started looting. When I came back he was just standing there and did not resume his behavior no matter how long I waited. Yes I could and did use a bottle, but when you're trying to do the level without raising any suspicions it's frustrating to get to a moment like this when you're forced to break your rule because the game decided to break.5. I don't understand the purpose of civilians. They completely ignore you so long as you're not killing people, and that's fine. But I've had them investigate thrown bottles, relight braziers, and worst of all report dead or unconcious guards. That last one makes zero sense. When you start the game and it is made abundently clear the guards are all corrupt,  vicious, greedy, thugs who bullyand kill the lesser folk and totally get away with it.Why would one of these poor abused people report a dead guard? They'd be just as likely to get blamed for it and executed.6. Your map is terrible. All those loot locations you overhear are completely worthless because nothing is labelled on the map.Terrible soundYou will hear conversations and have no idea where they're coming from.Sounds will overlap each other making incomprehensible noise. NPC characters will sometimes repeat the same three lines of dialogue every 15 seconds in a given area.At the Siren's Rest Tavern there are two women talking and one of them soundedlike she was delivering her lines under water.The rewards don't match player investments In Thief there are story missions and side missions. Unfortuantely the amount of effort required for you to get from point A to point B is out of sync with the rewards you get once you reach your destination.While on a side mission I found myself doing my usual burglary. Opening chests, drawers, picking safes and it just struck me. I was bored. Painfully, painfully bored. I didn't feel like a ""Master Thief"" I felt like a kleptomaniac. Picking up ANY item of value to recoup my losses from purchasing equipment. Ink pots? Pens? Letter openers? Who thought this would be fun?You buy arrows to gain access to secret areas with more loot, but the amount you get for that loot is such a pitance, you'd be better of just ignoring exploration all together. I spent 50 -75 gold for a rope arrow on Master Thief (don't know the exact amount) only to find a brooch in a bird's nest worth 10G.Final ThoughtsLove the skill and patience that's required to play stealth games. The problem is for a stealth game to be good it requires tight controls, consistent game mechanics, and inputs that work 100% of the time and that's not Thief.  Pick it up on sale for $10 or less, but I wouldn't pay any more than that.Don't buy it.**Update on Plot -- Contains Spoilers **Aaand now I'm in some ruined catacombs and there aremole people or some kind of monster? Wtf?Utilizing cheap scare tactics to tryand wake me up from the coma that the last 18 hours of gameplay put me in.Amazing.			"

Some of the most intriquing places and wauw - what backdrops!But what's the point of this pretty ""open"" world, when you still have to follow very specific points to get anywhere? Why does volume on voices increase when people talk of where they hide stuff? Why is my detect-stuff skill maxed out after 30 mins of gametime? Why does loading screen encourage me to listen to conversations that repeat every 4 seconds due to short monologues?I so wanted to like this title. But hanging at the end of a rope, at BEGINNING OF CHAPTER TWO, unable to drop to the very, very solid ground 2 feet below ... and it kindda feels like Garrett fell victim to what has destroyed almost all titles from my early gaming days: Todays stupid kids have to be able to play it as well, so we put up these safety barriers.That, or the worlds steampunked master goth-thief suffers from vertigo and fear of heights. He needs lessons from Captain Kenway, methinks. My screenshot-button went crazy though, so props to designers and a nutsack kick to the engineers.... I MEAN, COME ON: Smash button lotsa times to jig window open once it glitters on your screen. What a shame. And here is Erins butt-shot, 20 seconds in. You want that ho-ho, you crazy little cracker! You're just too young to know why, but sure made you motivated, huh? Now, navigate the city. Yes, Garretts blood did not flow to brain either, it seems. Die - or follow the neatly set CORRECT path, sucker.Will not try liking this again and it is so annoying having to agree with critics, as I fully support all this rebooting and shining up of classics. But we won't be giving you points for trying, developers. This is just silly, but fortunately I'm richer for the worthy €10 lesson.			"

Posted: December 1, 2014
												Ok. Here is the difficult choice. I want to like this game - I really do. ""Thief"" series are wonderful and a huge name in the history of gaming. But this particular game lets them down - massively. Let's be honest - it's not a complete failure, but it just seems so... clumsy in everything it tries to achieve. Let's have a look at some key factors, which spoil the gaming experience:*Repetitiveness - the game is extremely repetitive. Whoever wrote the scripting for guards' spawning, patrol-routes and AI deserves to have his hands broken (so he would not write scripts for some time at least). Every time I switch between the maps or areas, I know EXACTLY when and where the guard or civilian will come out from. Ok - I just loaded into new map and the guard will stroll out of the alley to my right in about 5 seconds... 4... 3... 2... 1... ah - there he is. Every bloody time.Repetitiveness doesn't stop on that. You have to constantly sneak through the city. And I mean CONSTANTLY. I realise that ""thief"" is a stealth game. I wouldn't mind (in fact - I would love) to see more side quests, where you have to sneak around new areas, doing new things. But going back and forth through the same streets of the same maps, avoiding the same guards, on same patrol routes and listening to the same dialogues over and over - it's just too much. At first I played the game as it meant to be played - stealthily. Now - I'm just running about, knocking out and killing guards like mad - just to avoid sneaking for next 5 minutes (they respawn) and to make them shut up for a while. *Open World... not - the game pretends to be a good exploration game with variety of ways to achieve your target. It fails on that. If you look at game mechanics - its just well-disguised ""corridor-runner"" game. Yes - there are roofs and balconies and all that, BUT - there's usually only one way to reach any particular destination. It is not like ""assasin's creed"" games, where if you want to access some roof, you have lots of options on how to achieve it - use the ladder, climb the wall, jump from another roof or use some other means to get there. Thief can not do that - it is only one correct way to get there and that is the way you HAVE to use. *Clumsyness - just about everything feels slow and clumsy. Once again - it is not ""assasin's creed"" or ""tomb raider"", where your protagonist feels agile and smooth. No - our beloved thief stumbles across the city like a drunk down a flight of stairs. Everything you do feels like struggle. *Empty City - apart from annoying guards who go around their poorly scripted patrol routes, several civies who also stroll about the city without any obvious reason and homeless drunks, which serve no purpose at all, the city is empty. Nobody on the roofs, nobody in apartments that you steal from, nobody to talk to, nobody to listen to, nobody with any jobs and side-quests to give you. It just feels like city does not care about you and very soon this feeling becomes mutual - you stop caring about the city and the game as a whole. *No fast travel - there are so many beautiful games, with gorgeously crafted worlds, where exploring is actually fun. Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout series, Far Cry 3 and so on. Those games make it fun to just walk around the world, yet they all have fast travel option. Going aroun the city in ""Thief"" is f*****g daunting and it has not got any means of fast travel. That's right - suffer, you b***h. That is to name only a few major downfalls. There's plenty more where those came from, but I think you've got the idea.There are also a few good points about the game, like dark and gloomy atmosphere, collectable pieces of loot, some interesting (although fairly simple) puzzles along the way, good selection of tools (mainly different arrows, but no real necessity to use them most of the time) and so on. But all these good things are getting hopelesly outplayed by all the downfalls of the game. Verdict - if you're hardcore fan of thief series, wait for a sale - the BIG one. If not - save your money or buy one of TES games and join thieves guild - much more fun.			"

												I was trying Master Difficulty with No Damage and Slow moves... I'm sooo tired of the 4 chapter. I quite, I finish with this game forever. I know, I know, it is my fault becuase I tried this difficult way but... is so frustrating to try not to suffocate in that chapter.The biggest problem of this game are the controls. I don't know but... it is posible that the PC version is just a console port? I don't know why, but sometimes space key doesn't work. A clever idea (I'm trying to be ironic) is how the character interacts with the valves (I unninstall the game because of it).If you like frustrating games this is your game. If you like to have fun with games... run!			"

												8/10 perhaps. I try to keep this short really. Main things that I didn't like:- Dickensian world (what happened to the medievalish world of the first games? The change was totally uncalled for)- Garrett (am I watching a soap opera? he probably spends all his money in eyeliner too...)That being said, I really did like the game. Not as good as Thief 2, but perhaps better than Thief 3. Thief 4 is a good stealth game and considering how big a change the world of Thief has encountered, going from a medieval(ish) steampunk world to a Victorian world, I have to say that it didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would. I don't often play games through many times, but I did play Thief 4 more than once just because it's a nice game. And THAT frighteing moment in Chapter 5 deserves special applause :)I noticed that the game was rated like 6/10 here in Steam and I'm surprised. To me it was totally enjoyable. I think that they didn't use the original voice actor for Garrett though and that's a shame! But all in all a good game.			"

												Its the first Thief I played and im really disappointed. First, the player cannot jump unless promoted to by the game, you have detective vision, you know, like in Batman series. This technique has been copied and pasted numerous times and it completely detracts from the Thief experience. The AI is idiotic and highly unaware. I do realize that this is a stealth game but it is poorly done when you are forced to do it. You can only attack with your blackjack, you cannot parry, but you can dodge. This close combat is highly repetitive especially in later levels. Finally, graphics are the only strong point of the game, it isn't ugly and in fact it is atmospheric. The textures are decent and the particle effects bring this world to life. Generally there is a good contrast between the light and dark areas of the game. Anyway, I have come to a point, that I will now wait for scores as to whether or not to buy a game, instead of buying a game and watching my hard earned cash go to waste, oh well, live and learn. 5/10			"

I can't really recommend this to anyone. It's like a less-good Dishonored, not that Dishonored was particularly good.There's supposed to be a plot, but it escapes me. I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I don't care about any of the characters. I don't know what Garett's motivations are. It's clear that the story was an afterthought.Really, really, really, painfully linear. Even when you're ""exploring"" the city hub, there's only really one way to get to the loot; one way that funnels you from one area to the next, usually through a window connecting one part of the city with the other. The map is pretty much useless for finding your way around. The missions don't provide much choice either. It usually boils down to going through a heavily guarded door, or finding *the* stealthy route.Everything you do is a context-sensitive event animation. Picking up a piece of loot: That's a 2 second animation. Opening a window: That's about 20 seconds of animation and QTE.It's garbage. Avoid.			"

												Wow. This game was made by the same people who made Deus Ex: Human Revolution? Or at least some of them?!This does just about everything wrong. But chief among all is the level design. You thought they couldn't possibly make an open world environment worse than the one in Deadly Shadows? Well, prepare to have your mind blown. This takes the cake as one of the worst environments I have ever played in- and they expect you to run through it, like 20 times if you want to do any side content.The missions themselves are not all that bad. But most of them are linear as hell. Comparing this to Dishonored.. well, don't do it. I could go on and on about the forced escape sequence after almost EVERY level, the stupid first person stealing animation that takes way too long. The way you have to look through every drawer of a cupboard (well, you don't HAVE to). This game feels like it was designed by 3 completely different teams and then at the end, somebody just took all their half finished work and threw it together.What a waste of everybody's time. Hey, at least the graphics are pretty, eh?			"

												The game can be customized for players used to the Thief games, so all the annoying highlights and hints can be turned off - BESIDES THE WHITE FLASH AND SHROUD!! It's so damn annoying I wouldn't buy it. It will give you seizures. Everytime you step into the light it is like you threw a flash bomb. I'd wait until the developers fixed that horrible mistake and add an option to turn that off!			"

												What should I do with Thief? It does some insane mistakes but underneath it all you can see moments of brilliance. The studio just didn’t have a clue as to what to do with Thief. They just ♥♥♥♥ed it up so bad. It is mind-boggling how game designers would come up with ideas that just ruin the whole gameplay and even after testing they just run with it. The good? The game looks fantastic and the atmosphere is really there. In the settings menu you can turn the whole HUD off. And I did. I can’t even imagine how weak the game would’ve been with all that, quite frankly, unnecessary♥♥♥♥♥♥taking up the screen real estate. You can also customize you difficulty. And I did! I made it a lot harder that what the master level alone was. And it was still pretty easy. I turned focus off because that has no reason to be in a Thief game. I turned no damage on and it made the game more fun even though some fall damage spots broke the flow a bit unnecessarily. I also tried turning on chapter saves only and that was the worst decision I did with this game so I immediately went back and turned that back off. I’ll tell you why in a moment. One of the good things was also this huge mansion level that just made me enjoy the game like I was back playing Thief 2. It was fun and how the whole game should have been.Then the bad. The game should have been Garrett turning mansions upside down but it barely does that. The game has some seriously weak insta-kill spots that just ruin the game even if you aren’t playing with chapter saves only option on. The controls are also so god awful that you just cannot master them. The game just doesn’t do what you expect it to do and a lot of it has to do with the fact that the game developers bound several actions to single keys. With PC there’s no excuse to that and it made playing the game a joke. I lost count the times I tried to dash quickly into the shadows only to find out that Garrett had climbed up on a wooden crate exposing himself to all the guards around. I can’t even imagine the times I tried to open a drawer and Garrett either picked up something from the desk, blew some candles off, or worst (and most frequent) of all crouched behind the desk peeking around its corner. The dialogue in the game was god awful. The plot was a joke. The characters were horrible and dull. Everything in the game felt like it was written by a 12-year-old. The journal menu was a design disaster. How can you ♥♥♥♥ all this up? Oh and the music broke the atmosphere up in the worst way possible playing some ridiculous rock music over the scripted action sequences. Like the hud, I had to turn the music off and I DIDN’T MISS IT. The last chapters were boring as hell just navigating through some caverns and the game designers felt the need to do multiple sequences where if you didn’t immediately know what to do you just died. This review is turning into a novella. Also, what’s the deal with all the “Press X to proceed” climbing sections and gateways? They’re not challenging so why were they there?So, what’s the verdict? I don’t know what kind of idiots made the decisions behind this game but they clearly didn’t have any clue as to what they were working on. And surprisingly enough a couple of the levels were actually really fun. I enjoyed Garrett talking to himself and hiding in the shadows watching the guards doing their thing. I loved the mansion level and the way you could just roam it all around trying to find all the secret nuggets of gold. The game was infuriatingly badly designed but when it was good it was REALLY good. If the game was just 8 levels of mansions and castles to loot I could’ve forgiven everything else in a heart beat. Still, I have to say it felt like a Thief game from time to time.			"

												So, another FPS stealth game that relies purely on stealth, with no superpowers or weapons(the weapons are more like tools in this game), sounds right up my alley!  I said count me in.  Oh what a mistake...First off, let's talk about the biggest and arguably dumbest design decision I could think of, the controls.  For starters, you cannot free jump.  Let me reiterate again, you cannot freely jump.  What kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥brain at Square Enix thought this was a good idea?  Let's just take one of the basic mechanics of all FPS games and exclude it.  It makes Garret feel and play like an utter gimp.  What kind of a thief can't jump on his own?  So how does he actually get around?  Well, the game dicatates where you can jump.  As in only certain platforms or boxes can be climbed.  Only specified platforms can be crossed or leaped across.  It makes traversing the already clausterphobic levels frustrating beyond belief.  Too many times have I thought I could jump across the roof top only to jump straight down into the street, right in front of a guard and get killed.  Only too many times have I have been cornered, and the obvious route is blocked off by arbritrary obstacles like a pile of boxes or debris that any other game would simply allow myself to climb or jump over, but in this case since the object is not specified, I can't do anything with it.  This doesn't apply to just platforms either.  This also applies to climbing roofs and walls.  You have a tool called the claw, which allows you to climb high walls.  But again, only designated walls which are few and far between.  This also applies to leaning around corners.  A normal game typically used Q and E to lean left and right retrospectively.  But no, this game you have to go up to a corner, and press E and Garrett will grab the corner and peak around.  Why couldn't they just assign different keys?  Too many times have I wanted to grab an object on top of a box or table, press E and wind up peeking around the edge.  My second biggest problem is the level design.  It's so cramped and maze like.  The open city of the previous entries is gone, replaced with narrow, winding streets cut up into small areas with too many loading areas  that take away any immersion this game had.  There are multiple smaller routes that can be explored, each with different loot than be stolen.  It's routine design when it comes to these type of games to allow replayability.  Some routes require certain tools to be explored.  However, there's no real reward to all the risk to going near guards because of the next biggest issue...The combat.  Now, combat has always taken a backseat in the Thief games because it's main emphasis is on stealth and avoiding being seen in the first place.  I wouldn't mind this, but because your jumping and movement is so castrated, combat is almost always inevitable at some point because you either slip up or because not on purpose you jump down instead of jumping across a roof.  You get cornered and can't run away because of arbirtrary game rules.  So running away isn't always an option.  Garret is armed with a bow and a tool called a black jack which is used for striking.  The bow is a typical bow, equips different arrow types and the whole shebang.  However, the black jack is a worthless piece of garbage.  First off,  you press R to swing by default.  Yes, freaking R.  Left click equips your bow and V is for dodge.  So, take yourself throw a scenario where combat is involved.  You have to press V to dodge, and R to strike.  By default, this is extremely awkward, the black jack does minimal damage and your bow is too clumsy to be used in close quarters.  Remember in Dishonored when in combat, parrying and striking with your sword felt smooth and responsive?  Well, take all of that and throw it out the window in this game.The AI for the most part is passable for a stealth game, if they get alerted they will search around corners and shine their torches into shadows.  They have their routes and can be distracted with blunt arrows, throwable objects and snuck up behind and knocked out.  It's your typical stealth game AI, nothing too remarkable and nothing too terrible.  However a big flaw I notice is if you are in combat in the middle of the street with a guard, the civilians fail to react in any way shape or form.  They just continue standing in their awkward, repetitive idle stances.  It takes away the immersion, and reminds you again that you are playing a video game.  This doesn't happen 100% of the time, but it happens enough where I had to make note of it.On the other hand, the graphics are quite nice.  Especially the lighting effects.  The dreary gloomy feel of the franchise is as present as ever.  Garrett has full awareness, and looking down shows his legs and hands so he feels more than just a floating camera with arms.  On the other hand the animations are stiff, awkward and flat.  Garrett has a little animation for everything including opening draws, grabbing loot, picking locks, turning the dials on a safe, pressing buttons, opening doors and more.  I can appreciate this, as it makes me feel more in the shows of the protagonist.  But, this comes at a draw back.  You cannot quickly rifle threw draws or cabinets, as Garrett has to straighten out, look down and open every single door and draw.  This little times it takes to watch the animations add up, and more than once have I been stuck opening a window or draw and caught by a patrolling guard.  So you really have to make sure the coast is clear before sifting through every draw and dresser in a room.  So trying to be a quick, cunning thief is harder than it has to be.  Unlike Corvo who could pop easily in and out of sight to grab a key, Garrett has to go through an animation which takes away your control for a second. The sound on the other hand is busted.  The voice acting is atrocious, with lines awkwardly and poorly delivered.  Dialogue contains many strange pauses in the conversations and combined with lip synching issues, makes cutscenes cringeworthy.  At least cutscenes are rendered in games instead of FMVs though, minus one or two.  NPCs constantly repeat the same few lines over and over, leading to immersion breaking design.Another big issue with the audio is the depth of sound is all sorts of wonky.  For example, if you are standing on the roof top and two guards are talking on the street three stories below, the voices will be loud enough as if they were right next to you.  This is a constant issue I notice throughout the game, and while it's a small quirk, it leads to moments where I would have the volume up and all of a sudden two voices will be blaring through my speakers even though there's no NPCs near me.  However, the audio is not all bad, as sound plays a big factor in being stealthy.  Walk faster, louder footsteps.  The typical stealth sound routine is all in place but to great detail.  Walking across broken glass renders your footsteps very loud, same with walking in water and such.  The game gets a few things right.  Garretts sprint and swoop moves are very welcomed.  The levels are littered with beautiful little details like hidden rooms, hidden safes, traps and alternate routes, which makes exploring every nook and cranny and must.  Paying attention to surroundings is a must, as broken glass, traps, puddles of water and creaky wood planks are almost everywhere, so speed running is ill advised.The game also contains a fair of customization, such as upgrading your abilities and gear.  Also included is a load of gameplay options, like optional warnings, object highlighting, difficulty settings and how much information you want on your HUD.All in all, too many clueless design decisions hinder what could have been an enjoyable stealth game.  This is not a thief game at heart, so don't let the name fool you.  2/5 stars, and that's being generous.			"

												Recommended BUT Only Just.What to say about this game, I had little or no expectations of this game, like so many classic PC franchises, I knew that it wouldn't be what I wanted it to be. Armed with this I started playing the game with an open mind and I have to say that the core of the game is good, it would be amazing if it wasn't for the broken and very annoying sound. The voice acting and the ambiance are good it is just the conversations between NPCs is poorly applied. Picture the scene, you are in a new part of Town looking around, avoiding the guards. You see a nice dark and cosy area to hide and observe guard movements and as soon as you arrive in the dark spot you hear a very loud conversation directly behind you, you panic and roll into the vision of the guards, grrrrrrrrrr. You reload after getting a kicking by the Guards, go to the same spot and try and find who was talking and you cannot see them anywhere the reason being they are 2 floors up and on the other side of the building, very misleading in a game where you should need to hear where your threats are. After the first hour of gameplay you give up using your ears and just go on visual clues.The graphics are very good, I can max out all setting on my rig and it shows the time the Devs took getting the lighting just right, the game engine is very good and the controls are simple, all this adds up to a very fluid and immersive world where you can make the game as challenging as you wish.If it wasn't for Garrett and the name of the game you wouldn't know that it was a ""Thief"" franchise. There's no Pagans, Keepers, Hammerites or Glyphs. The story is very, very bland and as for the ending.......lol, It's like the Devs realised what a turkey of a story they had and just stopped. No explanations to the Primal or anything.The so called open world really is an annoyance. This game needs well thought out, fixed, maps not a join the dots that the open world becomes. The chapter missions are however the Town that you can run around in serves no purpose to the story and really does feel like it's padding to make the games seem bigger than it is. As for padding, there is a stupid and pointless part of the game, the Clock Tower. You finish a chapter and get teleported to the Clock Tower, where a screen informs you that you have new loot to admire. After you click confirm, you are free to move about in your base of operations, LOL. Basically right in front of you is your stash, I didn't need to put a single item in my stash all through the game, just past your stash is a display cases where you can look at your special loot if you are that tiny fraction of gamers who gives a s**t about that sort of thing. After that you go up stairs where there is nothing apart from the exit to the building. Completely pointless, it ends up, Finish chapter-load screen-click confirm-run for 10secs-load screen-back in the Town heading for the next chapter.All that said I did enjoy my 62+ hours in the game,6/10 this goes to show that a great game engine cannot make up for poor application and a poor storyEdit: Nov 2016 Just to say that i replayed throught the game and it's the same as when i posted above, The sound really is broken. I'm using 7.1			"

												In short, the story is missing three key ingredients:  The Keepers, the Hammers, and the Pagans.  This is an unforgivable sin, and this is why The Master Builder hath smitten thee!This is a good game when you play it deciding to forget the first three games, but if you're a veteran there's a bunch of things that are difficult to stomach.  Stealth isn't absolutely necessary.  What?  Isn't this supposed to be Thief, stealth pioneer?  I love the city, and the story isn't bad.  But not far into it, I realized that I seemed to be playing Batman.  That made it feel like a bit of a rip off.I suppose that if you’re going to do a Thief Reboot, the best way would be to start over and redo “The Dark Project” better than it has ever been done before.  There were elements of the original game that I did not like, for example the terrible character design, anything having to do with burricks, the miscarriage that was the lost city, and how it always dumped the player off in a menu screen following the successful completion of a mission.  It would be neat to start over with Garrett as a boy in the streets of the current city and do a little background on how he went from Keeper Acolyte to Thief.  I know Garrett now, and I don’t believe he simply did it out of greed.But I don’t think it ever needs to be a first-person-shooter.  Garrett, in addition to being a thief, is also an adventurer, an investigator, and an explorer.  Build him a City that allows him to be creative in his approach to getting his ill-gotten gains and discover his forbidden intel.And as for Erin, I think old Garrett is about due for a love interest, and this was a good try.  I sincerely hope that Eidos and Square-Enix doesn’t give up on the title, but I also hope they all have the humility to learn from their mistakes.			"

Paying attention to surroundings is a must, as broken glass, traps, puddles of water and creaky wood planks are almost everywhere, so speed running is ill advised.The game also contains a fair of customization, such as upgrading your abilities and gear.  Also included is a load of gameplay options, like optional warnings, object highlighting, difficulty settings and how much information you want on your HUD.All in all, too many clueless design decisions hinder what could have been an enjoyable stealth game.  This is not a thief game at heart, so don't let the name fool you.  2/5 stars, and that's being generous.			"

												There are so many context controls... I don't mind some and they can help improve gameplay but these limit you and your ability to explore and really feel freedom in moving around. Its also not fun dealing with the delays or the timing necessary with the plethora of timed context controls in navigation.			"

												Doesnt have wide scenario, or world understanding. So this game is simple. I barely liked dishonored. And this game is worst then dishonored. If you have bored teenage emotionality in games. I dont recommend you this game. At least not at full price. If it drops 5 bucks then i recommend you to buy it. Otherwise this game doesnt deserve this price.-No Multiplayer theres just challange mode which is not interesting more than story (at least co-op would be fine)-Theres no interesting story. Most situations you can predict what happens next.-Open world style could be more improvised.-Missing collectibles would rewarded with outfits etc. (But theres nothing like that) Except perfectionist compulsionist gamers. Probably nobody want the collect whole collectibles. And theres no fun at this.-Some story chapters would be more creative (especially asylum chapter but they just made it simple)+Good graphics+Gameplay is good you can choose kill or subdue them.+You can always find humanist path if you dont wish to kill them. (I mean its not impossible.. even casual gamers can finish game without killing somebody,sometimes when you proggress game later chapters will be harder but not hardcore harder.)+Story is not so boring.. You will courious about what is that? why is that happened etc?			"

												Rather than making a solid game in the style of the old Thief titles, I feel like the developers, at some point along the way, looked at Dishonored and said ""this sold well - our game should be more like that.""But forgoing the dishonored comparison, the sound is somewhat broken (enemies miles away sound right next to you, and you can't hear the ones ten feet away) which kills a lot of the stealthy tension. Forced, linear, 3rd person climbing sections break immersion. Forced, linear escape sections don't make sense when you've been running a 100% ghost run all the way along.A the rest of it either doesn't make sense, feels too constricted, or is somehow... off in ways that are hard to define unless you play the game directly after just having played the older Thief games. In trying to throw a lot of ""modern"" mechanics and graphics into the pot, they neglected the thing that made the old games great - the level design.Oh well. Here's hoping another devloper will pick up Thief 2, 2?			"

												Well, fellow taffers!​I played all thiefs, so T1, T2:TMA and T3:DS. I'm still a big fan of the first three installments. Although these three are quite dated, they are all still one of the best games of the genre and out there. Especially T1 and T2 ate an *insane* amount of hours of my life.Because I do like stealth games a lot, I've played DISHONORED this year until T4 dropped to a reasonable price on Steam. Then I started T4 and went from ""How it's done"" to ""What a crap"". And now comes a list why I didn't even finish T4 and why I think it's not a good game.The Good:========- Graphics and presentation. While I never judge a game by its graphics, I did like the great, dark and gritty graphics.- The lockpicking and integration for searching hidden switches behind picture frames and book shelves. Well done!- The architecture and steampunkish flair. There is absolutely nothing to dislike about mixing magic with torches, swords and machines.- Although heard very seldon, the ambient music is beast sometimes (when caught, for example)!- While this game is QTE-invested (see next points), the character movement is very vivid. You'll always see Garrett's hands and actions, be it while lockpicking, jumping, walking, crouching, opening a window, looting, grabing a coin or breaking a safe open.- The climbing works flawlessly. It's the moments were you have to climb a gutter to get to the roof. This is were the camera changes and you're in third-person-view. I did like this very much, because the climbing is made very fail-proof and easy. Also, the camera *never* gets visually blocked by a wall or something like this. Some other games / developers could really learn from this.- The Takedown-QTEs and animations worked every single time and were very satisfying to execute / watch.The Bad, The Worse and The Ugly:===========================- The acting and enactment in the cutscenes is just plain AWFUL and probably the worst you will ever see in any game. Garrett acts like an idiot. Every time when he's being adressed he acts with an embarressing silence or a dull look on his face, which degrades him to a kind of a mentally reta--ed person who doesn't know what to say. Sometimes you just wish you could punch him in the face. Really hard. With a gauntlet made out of adamantium. They tried to make him like a cool person who has everything under control, but they failed miserably. Therefore, I couldn't identify myself with Garrett and I coulnd't care less about him or his boring story. Or the whole evolving of the story.- I didn't like the puzzling at all. I'm here to steal, loot and knock people out, not to do some boring puzzling. What am playing as, a Riddler or a Master Thief? I understand many people like puzzling and finding clues, but they should have at least make it as a voluntary thing (for finding secrets) and not mandatory.- The quick-time-events (QTE) are well done, but overdone. While I do not mind at all having QTE in a game, in THIEF4 you're feeling like you're not playing, but being played. I do leave most of the loot in its place because I'm tired of seeing the same opening-the-drawer-and-taking-random-stuff-QTE over and over again. Maybe I miss the uncomplicated *ring-ring-ring* from T1 and T2 when I'm looting.- Every loot you find is placed exactly in the middle of a drawer, a cabinet or a chest, as if the City is inhabitated by people with a massive OCD. And in what places people loose their wallet, DEAR GOD LOOK DOWN.- The QTE define the whole game. Like I said before, you don't feel free at all or in what you do, it's like your constantly on a rail. When you climb a rope you can only be released from it when a platform allows you to and you can only jump when the game allows you to. While this is good sometimes (failjumping not possible), you're getting bored after a few hours, since it feels like you're mum is always with you and helps you with everything and denies you everything else. Meaning you can only jump / climb when the game wants you to, you're very restricted to where you can go. (You can't even fall down a narrow bar or a cliff or a balcony, which is good I guess.)- ""Combat"". I completed some levels in Predator mode and killed nearly everyone. I'm fine when I'm firing arrows out of the dark and instantly killing a not-aware-enemy, but in a close fight against a guard is way too easy. It's like it doesn't even matter. Even WHEN it does matter, the combat is horrible. After a few hits your enemy just cowers like unconscious NPC in SKYRIM, waiting to be killed.- You have to pay some extra money for being able to carry more arrows and stuff with you. Greedy evil developers, you won't make some friends with that greedy mentality. Why not making a good game instead of such a garbage? It's an insult for every gamer. What comes next, paying extra to be able to use a save slot or having a HUD?- Freeroaming? Nope. You can enter some houses in the City, but you always have to open a window, which kinda loads a new level and is isolated. While you can explore the whole city, the different sections / segments are always blocked by some crates or stuff that has been put there for only this reasons. You can trigger another QTE which will move Garrett through that pile of wooden crates to the next section. That's not the idea of a city, folks.- Your ""home"" is the clocktower. Garrett hoards his collection of collectibles there. I was looking forward to explore it after seeing it in the first mission. But the clocktower is just a tiny boring level itself with nothing but your stolen collections to see. When you leave/enter the Clocktower via the only window, it asks you if you want to load a new chapter / the City or enter the Clocktower, so no exploring or fun here. AGAIN.- You can't jump. This is sometimes a good idea and not a problem, but you can't even jump over traps.- I absolutely hated those flashback-psycho-levels where you're in some kind of limbus / dreamworld. Can we maybe JUST have some cool levels where I actually can be a MASTER THIEF and steal things? Like from a well guarded museum, bank or something? Why do they always have to include some boring psycho-bull? And of course they had to include some gollum-like creatures. Because we all LOVED those strange aliencreatures from T1, right?- Customers have to pay extra for a bank heist mission. Are you serious? The only thing that could've made T4 interesting is not incluced.- You can buy arrows and other stuff from merchants.If I'm not mistaken, then I'm a Thief, oh, pardon, a MASTER Thief, why the heck to I have to pay for stuff?- You have to have some tools like a wrench (for opening vents) or a razor tool (for cutting picturesout of the frame) for a ridiculous high amount of gold.Pardon me? I'm a thief, I steal necklases and rings that are worth a s---load of money but I have to unlock / buy a razor or a wrench, which can be a) stolen from everywhere or b) bought for a nickel? Get outta here, this game got more bull by the minute.- You also can buy (BUY, like in ""actually spending gold"") a warm undershirt, which increases your health.Well, I don't know what to say anymore.I did not finish the game after starting Mission 7/8. Also, I don't know if they just ran out of ideas or if they are drunk in general, but this game is just plain horrible and a waste of money. This franchise and idea has (had?) so much potential, but it's completely wasted by some failures which really don't have to be. Do not buy when it costs more than 5 to 10 bucks.			"

												The amount of hours is how long i could stomach playing this game masquerading around as a game i once knew as Thief.  Not only is the horrible stealth system, a very integral part of the series, atrociously done, the overall game-play is just flat out bad.  After realizing that this game is really a game meant to be played on an ice rink, with it's inexplicable use of press space bar to shadow dodge and win, the game fails to capture any redeeming qualities of the series.It is such a waste too since the game itself looks great, how Garret places his hands on walls etc, is very well done and can immerse you in the character, but unfortunately when the large chunk of your game is a stealth game, and that mechanic is incredibly broken, you can only enjoy the little things so long before you give up.  I really wish i had not pre-ordered the game, if this game were under 10$ i'd say it is worth a try, but anything above you're better off with something that will actually be entertaining.Take the recommendation as you will, but overall a disappointed fan of the game, for someone new to the series it may be a great / fun little game to play around with.  To any fan of the Thief series, know that this game lacks the spirit and soul of it's successors.			"

												What is this? I tried to like it, I really did. This game spits in the face of the old games. I just can't believe that someone could ruin a franchise like this. The storyline is terrible and contrived. The character development is just a cut above ""See Spot Run"", you feel funneled and everything is crazy linear. The lack of a jump action is so incredibly limiting, the old games in the series allowed full exploration via the ability to jump and rope arrows that could attach to any material soft enough for the arrow to sink in which was very abundant. Instead you can look forward to using your rope arrows in predesignated spots so that you are more easily funneled through the Stanley Para... I mean Thief game... I can't stress enough how the sense of player agency just does not exist in this game. Everything is all quicktime, quicktime in disguise, and you feel like you're stuck on a crappy rail ride in an even crappier ""amusement"" park. Do yourself a favor and completely avoid this title.

												Recommended BUT Only Just.What to say about this game, I had little or no expectations of this game, like so many classic PC franchises, I knew that it wouldn't be what I wanted it to be. Armed with this I started playing the game with an open mind and I have to say that the core of the game is good, it would be amazing if it wasn't for the broken and very annoying sound. The voice acting and the ambiance are good it is just the conversations between NPCs is poorly applied. Picture the scene, you are in a new part of Town looking around, avoiding the guards. You see a nice dark and cosy area to hide and observe guard movements and as soon as you arrive in the dark spot you hear a very loud conversation directly behind you, you panic and roll into the vision of the guards, grrrrrrrrrr. You reload after getting a kicking by the Guards, go to the same spot and try and find who was talking and you cannot see them anywhere the reason being they are 2 floors up and on the other side of the building, very misleading in a game where you should need to hear where your threats are. After the first hour of gameplay you give up using your ears and just go on visual clues.The graphics are very good, I can max out all setting on my rig and it shows the time the Devs took getting the lighting just right, the game engine is very good and the controls are simple, all this adds up to a very fluid and immersive world where you can make the game as challenging as you wish.If it wasn't for Garrett and the name of the game you wouldn't know that it was a ""Thief"" franchise. There's no Pagans, Keepers, Hammerites or Glyphs. The story is very, very bland and as for the ending.......lol, It's like the Devs realised what a turkey of a story they had and just stopped. No explanations to the Primal or anything.The so called open world really is an annoyance. This game needs well thought out, fixed, maps not a join the dots that the open world becomes. The chapter missions are however the Town that you can run around in serves no purpose to the story and really does feel like it's padding to make the games seem bigger than it is. As for padding, there is a stupid and pointless part of the game, the Clock Tower. You finish a chapter and get teleported to the Clock Tower, where a screen informs you that you have new loot to admire. After you click confirm, you are free to move about in your base of operations, LOL. Basically right in front of you is your stash, I didn't need to put a single item in my stash all through the game, just past your stash is a display cases where you can look at your special loot if you are that tiny fraction of gamers who gives a s**t about that sort of thing. After that you go up stairs where there is nothing apart from the exit to the building. Completely pointless, it ends up, Finish chapter-load screen-click confirm-run for 10secs-load screen-back in the Town heading for the next chapter.All that said I did enjoy my 62+ hours in the game,6/10 this goes to show that a great game engine cannot make up for poor application and a poor storyEdit: Nov 2016 Just to say that i replayed throught the game and it's the same as when i posted above, The sound really is broken. I'm using 7.1			"

												In short, the story is missing three key ingredients:  The Keepers, the Hammers, and the Pagans.  This is an unforgivable sin, and this is why The Master Builder hath smitten thee!This is a good game when you play it deciding to forget the first three games, but if you're a veteran there's a bunch of things that are difficult to stomach.  Stealth isn't absolutely necessary.  What?  Isn't this supposed to be Thief, stealth pioneer?  I love the city, and the story isn't bad.  But not far into it, I realized that I seemed to be playing Batman.  That made it feel like a bit of a rip off.I suppose that if you’re going to do a Thief Reboot, the best way would be to start over and redo “The Dark Project” better than it has ever been done before.  There were elements of the original game that I did not like, for example the terrible character design, anything having to do with burricks, the miscarriage that was the lost city, and how it always dumped the player off in a menu screen following the successful completion of a mission.  It would be neat to start over with Garrett as a boy in the streets of the current city and do a little background on how he went from Keeper Acolyte to Thief.  I know Garrett now, and I don’t believe he simply did it out of greed.But I don’t think it ever needs to be a first-person-shooter.  Garrett, in addition to being a thief, is also an adventurer, an investigator, and an explorer.  Build him a City that allows him to be creative in his approach to getting his ill-gotten gains and discover his forbidden intel.And as for Erin, I think old Garrett is about due for a love interest, and this was a good try.  I sincerely hope that Eidos and Square-Enix doesn’t give up on the title, but I also hope they all have the humility to learn from their mistakes.			"

												This reboot of Thief is an ""alright"" game in itself, but if you are a fan of the previous games, this pretty much rips out most of the lore of Keepers, Hammerites and Pagans etc. All gone apart from small references like when you enter an old church in one of the chapters which bears the Hammerite symbol.Game mechanics are flawed and some things are just plain stupid. Prime example thats really obvious from the first hour of playing; if I jimmy (break open) a window to nick a house which requires quick-time event button mashing, I should not have to do it again when leaving! Master Thief my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Getting around the city is quite clunky and sluggish in terms of animation; although I do like the immersive first person view (you can see your body when you look down etc) you are given where Garrett physically reaches out into the 3D space and picks up the item. Hard to explain in mere text but you feel truly like you are nicking something rather than ""*boop* you've stolen a candle!"".Sound aesthetic can vary from well done to ""why the hell can I hear conversations being held indoors three blocks away as if they were standing in front of me?"" or ""Okay, if I hear that 'sloop' conversation one more time I'll bludgeon that guy to death"". Voice acting also ranges from good to downright woeful with Garrett somewhere in the middle of that. For some reason certain cutscenes are too low, in others some characters are too loud while others are so feint you can't hear them etc. What a mess.Performance wise, the game frequently stutters since the latest patch in order to stream in textures ""better"". Visual aesthetic is spot on though I'll give them that. Dark and gloomy and infested with vermin; who are not necessarily rats but of mankind too. Plague is rife, beggars line the streets, hangings are amidst and generally this is where you see a lot of effort has been made to make it authentic. What a pity that the gameplay is just lacking in every department. I'm pretty crap at reviews but take it as a someone whos played the originals; its a dissapointing ""No"" from me.			"

												The thief series have long been my favorite game series of all time. Thief - The Dark Project was a masterpiece with a wonderful engrossing story to it, that starts small but then drags you into an epic conclusion.Thief - The Metal Age deals with the aftereffects of the first game. It can be played standalone, but it is the perfect continuation of the first game, and this too drags you into an epic story.Thief - Deadly Shadows is a bit different than the first two games, but I loved it. It brings all the games together, making a full circle. Kind of Zen/taoism touch to it all, how the balance shifts due to your actions through the games.Sadly... the fourth game, this one, is a letdown. I haven't played through it yet, I admit, the story might be as good as the other games. I don't know yet.But then there's the reason I haven't played through it yet... and that's the controls for starters. It's made for consoles. you have few buttons to press, and those few buttons are supposed to do everything the keyboard did in the earlier games. If you for an example want to crouch behind some crates, your game might decide that you want to climb up on them instead. the same button is used for everything. Needless to say, if you want to hide, standing on top of well lit crates is a bad idea. I could live with that, but then there are annoying bugs aswell. I play the game as a thief not an assassin. There's a bug that requires you to kill people to move on. I hope it's a bug, because you're in a vent. someone passes below you, and you get the option to kill them. if you don't, they move on, and you can't get down from there. Ever. There are more gamebreaking bugs I've found aswell, but i've ranted enough. I want to love this game, but I can't.			"

Giving the player the ability to do what they want ? What foolishness ! <-- thought process in the dev team)			"

												In a word: Disappointed. I didn't come from the classic thief games but I do enjoy the modern day stealth games. This is technically as advertised but it just doesn't have a good feel. You are artificially blocked from doing some things -- like climbing and you can't jump (which is freakin' weird in a modern FPS game). A point where it looks like you should be able to climb, you simply can't. Furthermore (and the bigger problem) is the further you get in the game, the bugger it gets. For example, the game just crashed on me but prior to that, I was trying to access a note from the menu but every attempt to open the note failed. it's almost like the down arrow was being held down. (It's not my keyboard as I have no problem now that I'm back in windows.) Prior to this rather large bug, I saw visual glitches, which I excused as I really, really wanted to like this game. I've been trying to convince myself for the past 2 days. But I can't. It's fine but I can't recommend it. Pick up dishonored or Spinter cell instead.. This is worth a shot if you really love those other games but wait for a sale if you can.			"

												I liked the prologue, the streets were alive, the introduction of the story gave me goosbumps, and the shining loot made the stealing feel fullfilling. What I disliked was, after the intro, all you get are dead streets, no factions, limited ease of movement around the city, dumb guards, and anything you do apart from the main quest feels like work.  The game just doesn't seem to have life, only a flicker of it on the main quests.If you are a fan of the franchise, you WILL be dissapointed, only stick to the main quests for any hope of getting through the whole game without feeling lost inside.  If you are not a fan of the franchise, just don't pay more than £10 for it.In conclusion, this is not a good game (being generous), the next Thief will need have something new for any hope of the continuation of the franchise.  Then again, if the Assaisns Creed can do it, so can Thief.			"

												While Thief 1 & 2 are prime examples of outstanding late-90's game design, Thi4f may very well be one of the genres, and certainly the series, darkest and most stupid moments. Eidos Montreal did so many mistakes in this game, both fans of the predecessors as well as new gamers are absolutely right to shun it.Why do I have to QTE so many windows and wooden bars, which look all the same? Why can't I jump, save, hit and act how and when I want to? Why must Garrett, Basso and all the other beloved characters of the franchise be either idiots or absent? Where are Garrett's trusty Sword and Blackjack? When did Looking Glass' grim and authentic world get replaced by some generic, soulless medieval-steampunk hodgepodge? Why are the story, dialogues and documents so shallow-brained? Why is the sound engine so bad? Why does the game look so medicore? Why are the Levels so small, linear and uninspired? And why does a master thief wear makeup?I can only recommend this game at a low price to witness the pure underachievement Eidos created here. Looking Glass' and Ion Storms games were certainly not perfect and they left a lot of room for improvements, but this one is simply an insult. I'd rather play ""Shipping... and Receiving"" for a full 20 hours than 20 minutes of this crap. Still I'm going to finish the game, because I love the series so much and somewhere deep inside, there lies the nucleus of a good stealth game. But it barely shines through.I really hope someone makes a remake of T2 in the Dark Mod.			"

Dull stealth action+ great graphics (provided you have high-performing machine)+ initial missions are fun+ challenging hoarding of loot and plentiful collectibles+ guards have several level of alertness- sound is broken (overheard dialogues play with default volume no matter how far are you from the people who speak; all surfaces you step onto sound the same)- shadowplay is broken (you are either hidden or exposed, but even when hidden guards sometimes notice you, sometimes not - there is no transparent mechanic in this)- usually there is only one way to complete any objective- boring characters and absolutely ridiculous antagonist- uninteresting story (I've completed 4 out of 8 game mission and I certainly didn't feel ""hooked"")- motifs stolen from Dishonored (plagued city, revolution, magical queen of beggars aka ""Granny Rags"") and other too obvious references (kindly compare the ruins in third mission with the library in The Name of the Rose[www.imdb.com])MAIN CON: The City itself. At first it's certainly great to look at, until you find out it's irrational, non-functional maze of corridors, which only pretends sandbox. There are no fast travel points, so you have to wander through there and back again, just to end up in the same dead ends, dealing with the same guards on the same places. Map is unclear, nearly useless. Rooftops are inaccessible and there is no other way to make your strolls quicker. I don't mind relatively frequent loading screens, yet I DO mind annoying QTEs when opening windows or squeezing through crates. The City is generally empty - the ""mob"" observing the hanging consists of two or three people; chambers and tenements you sneak into are always abandoned. Several citizens walk back and forth on short simple paths like models on catwalk and mumble one sentence or short dialogue again and again. On the other hand, some places are so heavily guarded it makes random walks more challenging than completing some of the missions. Side-questing would be fun, but since you spend more time getting to the starting point than actually completing the mission, it feels like a disappointing waste of time.			"

												Such promise.  Such horrific execution.  In the end, i want those 16 hours of my life back.It's a shame too, because a lot of hard work went into making this game, but the direction behind the execution is abysmally lacking.  Great graphics, interesting storyline...painfully repetitive and uninspired gameplay mechanics.  Horrible ending.  WTF happened? i still don't know.  It's extremely linear, but yet at the same time there's a frustrating lack of direction provided by the game in certain areas and you end up going around in circles until you go google a solution...only to find out you're not the only one who thought it was broken.

												1- GENERAL Thief is a stealth action game that I've bought in a sale when I was playing Dishonored. I thought it was alike... well, it is, but is not as good as it could be. As the title suggests the game is based in stealing stuff, but we do it with no purpose. We are not Robin Hood, we just steal... maybe that's the purpose, but I think all this theft could have a meaning. It has not. The game goes in Victorian London, now ruled by a tyrant for some reason. After the opening scene we spend most of our gameplay trying to explained what happened then and after that. Not much of a plot, but it seems all the story is kinda weak. The voice acting and character building was not very good also.  2- GAMEPLAY But the game is about stealing and stealth, and in that aspect it's great. We are often confronted with hard sections where it seems impossible to go through without being noticed by the guards. So most of the times I just knock them or put an arrow on their heads. The game is very difficult, and even on normal it was clearly hard for me to go through. Despite that, the AI is bad, with some bugs that I've learn to exploit. That does not ruin the fun. The game is not open world though, and we have a lot of loading screens between sections. That takes some of the immersion, since some of those could take up to 10 seconds on my laptop.  The controls are just frustrating, since we never know how to do something. Sometimes we are able to do an action just jumping, others we have to press a determined button... The graphics are good, and I have no problems running the game in medium setup, that helps a lot. The score mechanism gives the game some replay ability, but I warn that I do not know how can someone go through the game unnoticed. Well, maybe I'm just bad.   3- CONCLUSION I've enjoyed the game, but I've never have that feeling of immersion. I've quit before the ending also. The problem was that I was always comparing the game to dishonored, and he always lost. If you are able to ignore the bad story and the loading screens you will have a rather good stealth game where you will love to steal everything. But I've noticed the €29.99 price tag, and even knowing that the game is on sale a lot of times, it's annoying that the producers keep it at so high prices, it's just unreal and that's the reason I thumbed it down.

												Worthy notes to mention:- I bought the Master edition for £4.50 off the Square Enix Store.- Because of my useless internet speed, it took roughly 2 days to download.- I haven't played the previous thief games. Though now I think I will as I can't play this...- This issue doesn't just effect me, other people have had it too, amoungst many others.Thief is a dark, stealth/action game where you play as a thief known as Garrett. From the small portion that I played, the game features some unique thieving mechanics that may also work well for the rest of the game (I wouldn't know unfortunately). The game's visuals are very pleasing and I'm glad to say that the steam store's screenshots are pretty accurate.Unfortunately though, there is a downside... Otherwise this review wouldn't be a ""not recommended"" review would it? Yes, Thief (4) is riddled with issues. A quick trip to the community Hub would have told me that this game was a gamble to purchase... Well, now I don't like gambling. You see, I started thief up and was met by the menu screen. Great! I thought, all seems well. Apparently not. The game (at least for me) features a horrible jagged/laggy/stuttering bug when V-sync is enabled, causing any movement with WASD+Mouse to result in a CCTV-esque movement to everything. Disabling V-sync does reduce the issue, but it causes my GTX660ti to heat up to a concerning level.In the end, I didn't spend much time playing thief, though I would have liked to.. I've been searching google, steam, and throughout the bowels of the internet to get the issue resolved. No dice.(I tried Nvidia Inspector, messing with the ThiefEngine and BaseEngine files, Sweet FX, Nvidia Control Panel, even in-game settings (Textures low etc)... Nothing worked. It was either no-vsync or preserve my GPU... I chose the GPU). If the issue gets resolved and I can eventually play the game properly, I'd happily update the review. But for now, I just can't play it with it's current v-sync issue.**Feedback / Suggestions welcome. I don't hate this game, I'm just unhappy that I bought a game which I cannot play; I just cannot enjoy it when the movement/looking around is so jarring and uncomfortable to watch.			"

												I have never played that blunt and boring game in my life (and finished it). Pros:-	Dark gloomy atmosphere-	Hideout + some of the locations are really creepy-       Graphics is okayCons:-	Dull combat system-	Opening all these windows is so frustrating-	Uninteresting plot-	Boring enemies (except for the invisible monsters in hospital)-	“On trails” all the time. Only one way to go and no choice!-	Stupid last fight-	Almost no dialogues-	50% of the time I hoped the game will end soon-	Never-ending night… seriously no daytime in the game's world WTF?-	Tedious protagonist -	Sneak system is... so bad...-	I can’t believe I played 150 hours… That is over a week of my life nobody is giving me back…Conclusion:All in all... AVOID!My rating: 2/10			"

												    The problem with naming a game after a beloved series is that it will inevitably be compared to that series' best version. It happened with DMC: Devil May Cry, and it happened here.     On it's own this game isn't that bad. It's biggest problem is that it feels like it was made on a factory line with a checklist. Standard love interest, check. Standard villain, check. Standard gameplay, check. Standard weapons and gear, check. Nothing in this game really makes it stand out from the crowd. In Thief 2 you had huge sprawling levels you could get lost in with tons of secrets to find if you were observant and clever enough.     One thing that I really noticed was that rope arrows in this game only worked at very specific points. If you fired a rope arrow anywhere else it would just be a waste of time and arrows. In Thief 2 you could fire one of those suckers anywhere and climb up even if it led nowhere. It encouraged exploring outside the linear hallways and streets. TL:DR version. Not the worst game, but there are better stealth games out there.			"

												This game left me with the same feeling that I had when I needed to quietly fart at a meeting but ended up pushing a wee bit too hard and ended up keiching my pants... Just before having to host my presentation in front of senior management.That's how bad this game felt to me.... I so wanted to love it, I tried so hard to like it, but in the end I was left feeling crapped on, as though Thief was a giant Eagle that had pooped on my just cleaned new Car.Graphics, sounds, and music are good in this game. The Map can be interesting but.....Everything else is half arsed. The controls are a bit off, the story feels unloved, as well as unfinished, and the game lacks atmosphere. There is so much potential in this game but it feels lifeless and unloved...  like my ambitions.With a bit more effort from Eidos Montreal, this game could have been a classic, good enough to rival the original Thief games but instead it feels like they cut corners and rushed this game out 6 to 12 months early.I'd only recommend this game to you if you are a uber fan of the Thief series,who is curious about this game but please, buy it when its on sale and heavily discounted.

												This game was pretty crap IMO.  I was expecting it to be all about stealth and the fighting being an afterthought.  Instead, the guards were totally oblivious, even as they turned while I was pickpocketing them and still didn't seem to see me.  This just got boring, with the very repetitive task of following where the invisible walls guide me and looking for the rare places I could use the claw to actually get up.  Overall this was a good example of what not to do, and felt like something crapped out to make a buck off of the franchise name.			"

												I'll get this out of the way now: I have not played any of the previous games in the series. My opinion on Thief comes from Thief and Thief alone.While having potential, Thief lacks what most stealth games do: an element of stealth.The stealth aspect is virtually non-existant. Enemies will not notice you so long as you are crouched, swooping, walking, or otherwise in the shadows. Nevermind the fact that they're mere inches from your face in an ominous alleyway. When their guard is down, they are completely oblivious. When their guard should otherwise be up, they are still completely oblivious. It is entirely possible to crouch by a group of guards in plain sight with little to no reaction beyond a ""What was that?""Too often are there instances where the game provides little to no ingenuity. While each map supposedly has ""multiple paths"" for the player to take, the paths are few and far between, with little to no deviation from a linear trajectory. The maps are set up to allow you to find your own way to get from point A to point B, but after starting your path, it's simply a matter of holding down a few keys until you arrive at your destination.On top of all else, the controls are needlessly bizzare. Let us assume you wish to hop down from a rope you're climbing. One would expect the jump key while looking downward would do so, or perhaps the crouch key. One would be wrong. Instead it's required to bind seperate keys to all of these commands. Instead of grouping together contextual keys in a sensible fashion, Thief takes the approach of ""4 keys for 1 action"", leaving you scrambling for the correct key when another should do the same thing. Each additional bind is purely contextual, rendering the alternative bindings useless save for specific situations, and indicating that Thief missed the simple concept of one key being able to do multiple actions in order to allow the player to respond more quickly. To top off the controls, Thief's handling of input commands is lackluster. It often requires multiple key presses before any one action is actually completed. So expect to fall to your death a couple dozen times before Garrett finally decides to hop that 2-foot gap in front of him.All in all, while Thief seems appealing, it utterly lacks in any and all expected components.

												The original Thief is, possibly, my most favorite game in all the hundreds of games I've played. To be able to immerse yourself so wholly in the experience that you can literally spend the entire day in a single level, sneaking about and accomplishing the mission so perfectly that you are seen only when the pathing of enemies makes it 100% impossible, that you never have to swing your weapon save to possibly knock out a guard or two by necessity. If nothing else, the core divide I feel is that the original Thief felt like I was actually taking things in logical places from some jerks. This game feels as hollow and forced as smalltalk with a stranger on the street waiting in line for the bus.Loot is obvious, and placed everywhere without sentiment for retaining the 4th wall - as if they all agreed that if Mario can place floating coins you jump at and feel gratified then so can we!I feel as sneaky as a rusty shopping cart, and get the sense that the character is as much a Thief as an uninformed constituent is a Voter. Achieving the action with ease, is not the same as achieving the action with sprezzatura.			"

												Thief (2014) is a ""reboot"" of the Thief franchise...& maybe could be considered a true-blue sequel to Thief: Deadly Shadows (Thief: DS). Thief (2014) feels like a sequel to Thief: DS, since this game takes place (again) in a somewhat open-world called The City for ""The Master Thief"" Garrett (the player) to explore + b/c this feels much more modern than the previous game. Also, some references also seem like a continuation to Thief: DS. Just like Thief: DS, there are main missions + side missions for him to take on, as well - which are often excellent, with numerous stealthy ways + directions to choose, in a mission (especially main ones). Also, Garrett can also just explore The City to enter people's houses + shops to rob them!Garrett meets up with an old friend named Erin, for whom he was a mentor to. She has been greedy, trying to find a certain object, which could make her ultra-powerful + ultra-rich. Erin disappears after an incident + Garrett awakens quite a while later. A disease called The Gloom is spreading + an over-powerful figure has taken The City by storm, imposing his will on this now poverty-stricked + disease-ridden City. This part sounds very similar to another [excellent] stealth game Dishonored (in which that game took a lot of cues from the older Thief games). There is also a resistance building-up against this person, as well - which again, sounds right out of Dishonored's book. Garrett begins taking jobs again to make money + to gain information on Erin's where-abouts.There's an interesting dynamic that goes on b/t Garrett + Erin, which I wish was further explored here. Garrett usually knocks people out, steals stuff & moves along. Of course, the player can also play deadly, if they actually feel like it & choose to do so (or not). Meanwhile, Erin's turned into the complete opposite of Garrett - willing to kill to get what she wants, without hesitation. Early on, this stuff is excellent. I do wish this was emphasized + explored a bit more, though.I do wish certain story elements + characters were explored quite a bit further here + a bit more fleshed-out; & that certain events went a different direction - instead of sometimes taking the predictable or under-developered route. This stuff is seems to be one of the few weaknesses I've seen to find with this game.Eidos Montreal has tried like hell to make this game appeal to both the hardcore, old-school Thief fans + for the modern gamer. Besides your typical difficulty levels that games usually allow the gamer to select, players can impose a Custom Difficulty Mode. Here, the gamer can decide what features they can turn off. A lot of these features that can be disabled (or left enabled) - they are the features modernizing the game. These can range from Disabling One-Hit Takedowns, Game Fails When You Are Seen, Disable Focus Mode, Disabling Shimmering Objects & numerous other things. Personally, on my first run-through - I played on Thief difficulty mode. More games should take this excellent approach of allowing such a deep customization of your difficulty + settings - which flat-out embarrasses most games that basically only have a few difficulty modes.Like Hitman: Absolution, there is a new X-Ray mode (which is similar to the Batman: Arkham games) called Focus Mode. Garrett can basically see through walls + see enemies. It goes further than that, also. Garrett can even slow-down time, be faster in this mode, do lethal blows & even see important objects be highlighted even more so than normal. A lot of this depends also on your difficulty settings + what skills you upgrade. Depending on what you turn on + off, the game scores the difficulty setting. You're scored in-game, also.The more Garrett does in the game-world, the more money he can make so he can buy Equipment from merchants & even can purchase Focus Points from a certain someone. Also, Focus Points can even be found in the game-world. This is how Garrett upgrades his skills. Skills can range from making Garrett faster; see more hidden objects in the game-world (& on the map); make him lockpick faster; be more deadly in Focus Mode; his attacks do more damage; upgrade the amount of equipment he can carry; & numerous other things. Garrett no longer carries a sword - for his main weapon. Garrett only has his blackjack, which by default can make the game played quite a bit more stealthy (as long as you don't level-up down a more action-orientated approach). Getting into fights (especially early on) is not really the best idea, until you've followed Garrett's skills down a certain path. Garrett has his usual assortment of arrows for his bow: regular arrows to hit enemies with; rope arrows so he can climb ropes + reach certain areas; fire arrows to burn objects + enemies; water arrows to put out fires; explosive arrows - to name a few arrows. Also, Garrett has a claw + can climb certain walls w/ it. While a great majority of the game is in 1st-person perspective for the camera + you're seeing through his eyes, when Garrett is platforming on pipes & rappelling down some objects (like Lara Croft would in the Tomb Raider games or Nilin in Remember Me), the game switches to a 3rd-person perspective.Thief (2014) gets the feel of being ""The Master Thief"" better than any other game I've seen. Besides the big things the Thief games always got right, there's also now a lot of subtle + little things that are emphasized big-time here. A new cover system has been added, as well - in which Garrett can glance, lean + look around objects. Garrett can switch from cover-to-cover. A bit similar to Blink Mode from Dishonored, Garrett can perform a ""Swoop"" move that moves him very quickly & hard-to-see for a moment - but, its range is very limited. While here you can't move very far + in that supernatural way like Dishonored allowed with Blink Mode - Garrett's ""Swoop"" seems like a way to speed-up the gameplay here a bit, making it a bit faster + more action-orientated.That's not everything on subtlties, either! When putting his hands around paintings, we see Garrett's hands close-up, moving around to try + find the switch to find hidden objects. The same goes for bookshelves, as well - when Garrett's looking for a book that actually might pull a switch to reveal a hidden area. We see Garrett react to objects he finds in the game-world, that might be worth a lot of money. We see (mostly) from the 1st-person perspective, with Garrett opening drawers to cabinets, dressers & other things - moving quick + fast like a Thief would. Garrett has a home-base, in which he stores all of the important things + trophies that he's found, stolen + taken. Not only that - you can look at your stats in-game + even store equipment there, also.Nixxes has done a good job with making the PC version look technically excellent - which seems like the norm for them, after seeing many of their recent ports for Square Enix + Eidos (Hitman: Absolution, Tomb Raider 2013, Sleeping Dogs, etc). Though, performance was all erratic on DX11 w/ most things on Normal on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) on its own - ranging from 40 frames to 60 frames per sec at any moment. Locking it down to a 40 frames maximum with EVGA Precision X certainly solved this issue.If you really liked Thief: DS w/ the direction that game took with gameplay + modernizing the series (when it did), then I'm pretty much preaching to the choir here - play Thief 2014; it does this even more so than Thief: DS. If you weren't happy w/ the direction Thief: DS took [especially when compared to the previous 2 Thief games (Thief: The Dark Project / Gold + Thief II: The Metal Age)] - it's still possible the game might be for the old-school Thief fan b/c of its new Custom Difficulty Mode. After 31 hours w/ my 1st playthrough - Thief (2014) was really good, even despite its few flaws that just rob it from reaching greatness.Grade = B+.			"

												I really liked the old Thief games. I wasn't a huge fan, but I really enjoyed them. I was so stoked when this game came out, but I was very quickly disappointed. I think the old games were so good because they were a fresh style of gameplay in their time. This game felt like Wal-mart's ""Great Value"" brand Reduced sodium Saltine crackers taste....BLAND.The biggest sin this game commited was its storytelling. Cliche's galore! The ending was so.....bad. It felt like they wanted to keep it open for a sequel, but they made Garrett look like such a fool. There were shopkeepers to sell arrows and such in the most unusual locations. You never had to worry about conserving ammunition before an important event because. BAM, out of nowhere, a guy offering items for all your ""nefarious needs."" Which brings me to my next big sin. The voice acting. Zero emotion, zero talent. I got so sick of hearing the same back and forth banter that never changed or had variation throughout the whole game. I would think that at least Garrett would have a good voice actor, but it sounded like the guy the voiced Garrett did it while lying down on his couch.The AI was horrendous. They would see you kill a fellow guard in cold blood, and once you hid for about 1 minute, they would say, ""whoever it was, he's gone now,"" and go back to their exact same patrol route. No more guards would be summoned, nothing. They either knew exactly where you were, or had no idea. There was no searching around until they found you. For the first 3 chapters, if a torch was extinguished by a water arrow, they reacted to it. After that, they must have had a memo go around the Pony Express for the guards, that ordered them to stop reacting to that nonsense.Lastly, the level design. It was probably one of the most linear games since Contra for the NES (Contra was an epic game...this, was not). You usually had ONE path you could take to get somewhere. If there were two choices, it was either, stealth path, or fight guards path. There were more doors and windows you couldnt go in, than words spoken in the game. You could only climb in very particular places. SO, SO.....SOOO BAD!!! This game is DREAFUL!!! For the love of Pete~~! Don't spend money on this game!! Pity.			"

												I write this review on the basis that I was extremely excited for the release of this game considering it's the first Thief game I will play. A lot of talk over the internet from fans of the series suggested that from trailers and gameplay shown before the release of this game, it was considered things like not living up to the original Thief games and that this game will flop. I tried my best through my play of this game to advert my thinking of the game in such a way but by the end of it all I have to agree with what everyone is saying about this game. I wanted something good out of this game, the first big ""next gen"" game to be released and it did flop, so badly that by the end, I just wanted Thief to finish so I could never play it again.The game has bad design choices in many aspects from the forced animations ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to the repetive sequences such as knocking out a guard or going through a small crack inbetween areas. The story was lackluster, voice acting sub par. Music was fair in certain cases but it gets really annoying when I'm somewhat in the mood of the setting and suddenly a ""clash"" everytime I take down someone. Graphics was the only redeeming factor about this game but even then, it still ran like♥♥♥♥♥♥in some cases. Loading times weren't an issue as a few people had mentioned.AI is stupid as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t sometimes with their ability to never miss and persistent idiocy to search forever but instantly give up.In the end, this game was a massive disappointment and I'd rather finish Dishonored 3 times over and enjoy myself than play this game again. I truely hope there ISN'T a sequel to this game because if they did make one, I'd have to triple check, no, a million check to make sure the game isn't♥♥♥♥♥♥TL:DR 6/10 playable but♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Thief(2014) has tried to renovate its 2 parts: action and stealth adventure.But, This new thief didn't know it already had enough, unique charms as one of the greatest stealth game,and so they look like trying to follow common details of contents n systems to meet normal demands in game market.However, the result what they chose is absolutely fail.Action, which ensured hardcore but beautiful experiences, change too casual, and light.You can dominate guards with a lot of methods very easily. rediculously, although thief is 'stealth robbing action', it's more efficient and easy that you kill or knockout all guards first before you start robbing.and also, freakery map structure, one-way directing system, collectible with no rewards etc made the contents of adventure too sttufy, boring.You must see 3~5 loading window if you wanna visit to buy resources and upgrade your abilities.half of playtime will be wasted to move where you wanna go and need to go.Moreover, this game can't motivate why players need to finish sidequests, and search hidden spot for more rewards.Contrastly that you need to spend much time and efforts to do that, the rewards is not fair and not much helpful.Even if how many, or how diligently you've played, you can't change anything in game story line. Thief had 'unique action' and 'renovated adventure' contents, but Thief(2014) sacrificed thier own competitiveness to archive many two-bit contents.			"

												Thief, where do i start with this ?seeing the trailers of this game made me a little bit excited but at the same time i was skeptical since i haven't played any of the other Thief games, but then i found a great deal of this game on Gamecards website and i decided to take my chances and buy it.The game starts with you, Garret, the master thief, in a house full of loot and a drunk man laying on bed, u sneak around and you steal any shiny stuff, at the begining of this game i didn't think it will be that exciting to try and find each and every collectable, but as soon as Chapter 2 started, i fell in love with this game.The atmosphere this game creates is unlike any other, and the sound of your heartbeats pounding as a guard approaches is one of the amazing things about this game, it's the perfection of sound effects that gets you in the game and makes you wanna play more.I haven't finished the game yet, but the missions i played were awesome, stealth games just got a new reboot for me with this game, and what i really like is that the games rewards you based on your play style, wether you were a predator, a ghost or an oppurtunist, your rewards will be based on that, and you will get more if you were a ghost, which really motivates you to play the game the way you should, as a GHOST!At the end of the day, each game has its pros and cons, and the cons of this game were:- You have to make your way inside any home by opening a window, which is a silly way to make loading screens- Enemy AI can be stupid at times, detecting you from a distance and sometimes they don't see you even if you become very close to them- Some tools were useless, as some arrows require more than 3 shots to kill a targetBut afterall, i'm really enjoying the game and will soon finish it, and hope you try it as well :)Recommended, 9 OUT OF 10 "

												Graphics 6/10Gameplay 3/10Replay value 3/10Sound 2/10This game was designed for console.This will probaly turn into a rant!The lockpicking system seems to be just using the d-pad to find the spot, Which is kinda difficult on a mouse setup and no visual clues or audible ones either apart from a sphere brightening.The audio 3d positioning is one of the worst I've heard. Stood 3 feet from a ticking clock, moved another foot  and the sound faded to nothing.Might seem like nothing to some people but it destroys the immersion.The original game had audio so finely tuned you didn't need to see the guards, just hear them to know exactly where they were.The graphics, while nice, are nothing to write home about.Kinda has a comic look to things, is washed out and has no real depth.The field of view feels claustraphobic and going above the normal changes things to a fisheye lens view.Opening (jimmying) windows is another console driven gimmic designed to instill intrepidation and realism into the act, but alas, fails and only annoys when you realise that you have to do it over and over again even from withing the room you just burgled.How many people need to jimmy their own windows from the inside?Th inability to not use your tools unless in the proper place is also a detriment to this game.Take a rope arrow and try it on a wooden structure you think you may climb and NO.Predefined rope attachment areas only and also no retrieval of the rope arrow.Even the original game allowed you to do that. I remember going through a 40ft room swinging from rope arrow to rope arrow all while using just 2 arrows.The AI in the game is stupid.Two guards in a room, I open a door in plain sight and fade away again""who opened that""  ""ahh twas nothing""yes, nothing happened to pick the lock and open the door.People on the street don't seem to see you, except guards because they are looking for me? With the exception of the way I am dressed I could be anybody. I haven't killed in their sight or done anything wrong.The game is almost impossible to play if you turn all the console type features off and try to play like the original game.Without focus mode you may see traps, but sometimes not all traps are equal. some may reset your progress. others may release poison or darts or set off alarms. without focus they all look the same.The lack of a sword or a knife to defend youself, should you get discovered is also missing.Yout can dodge and use a billyjack but then you also have to press a different key to finish them off, else they get back up and kill you.Consoles are killing the pc gaming scene by diluting original games into a series of button mashing mini games and QTE's.I'm done with console reboots of orginal pc games.SOD the lot of em			"

Why does Chapter 5 exist?First Thief game I've ever played and it was a huge let down. This game is riddled with bad AI, bugs, and overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design. If you have any sense of what they call Gamer's Intuition, this game is a damn breeze, and a boring one at that.It did have it's good moments, though! Like when I found out how cathartic it is to smack civilians upside the head with my beating stick.SPOILER ALERTAlso, Chapter 5 bears mentioning. What the actual ♥♥♥♥ was that? This bad stealth game all of a sudden took on the visage of a horror game, like Outlast. The sad part? That was the first piece of solid game design I'd seen! It was so good for what it shouldn't have been. If Thief had been a horror game, this review would be positive, and I would have loved it. Sure, the horror was weak, and predictable, but they established atmosphere, and that's what they lack in most AAA horror games nowadays.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game, but I just can't do it. There are plenty of other games out that are far more engaging than Thief. And while I'm not on the ""the original Thief games r the BEST!"" bandwagon, those games were simply much more fun to play. I still had fun with the new Thief - the game tries hard to be engaging. Stealth is required the minute Garrett steps out of his hideout, interacting with the environment is key to success, and there are multiple ways to accomplish a given task. Sounds good, right? Except the actual game-play of Thief - thieving and strategizing - happens the same way too many times for the game to carry my interest through to the end (I did get there eventually on my third attempt). The story could have been engaging, but characters are under-developed (some only appear in cut-scenes), show up for no reason, and are blessed with campy B-movie dialogue. The cutscene at the end of the game, while complete, made me think there might have been more to the story, but it was trimmed or cut. Who knows. The mechanics of the game work well, but as before, there's little variation: put out fires to create shadows, throw a bottle to distract guards, and swoop to the objective. What should have been a thrilling exploration of an open world Steampunk city is instead reduced to a grind-fest for loot in a lot of close alleys. Some of the level designs are great - the house with the moving walls was one of my favorites - but the novelty passed quickly once I realized that most loot would be acquired (yet again) by rifling through the desks and closets for pens, ashtrays, golden saucers, scroll holders...In a sense, Thief really is Kleptomania Simulator. You scamper around the City, stealing random sh*t. But to me, Thief should be about “the job,” not about stealing random sh*t. There are three kinds of jobs in Thief: Main (story) jobs, client jobs that an NPC will provide, and Basso's side jobs. Story jobs advance the story; yes, there's theft along the way, but even with the massive amount of loot in the Baron's mansion, thieving still feels like an afterthought because there's literally no reason to do it. Client jobs have a minor story of their own, but there are only two clients (each provides three missions). Jobs from Basso are side-quests that give some gold and a notice on screen that it's completed. Even though they're acquired from different sources, they all have a similar feel and execution. Thief has great graphics and fun mechanics - the archery is especially good - but these positives are betrayed by a very average use just about all other game elements. The setting needed to be opened up. The music creates tension without being memorable. Enemies only come in three varieties. The enemies' AI all behaves the same (extremely predictable). And boss battles - what a joke they are! Grab Thief on sale if it interests you, and hope you finish it before your patience is exhausted and you start just killing all the guards so you can loot in peace. On challenge mode: There are three maps (one of which is DLC): the Asylum, the Baron's mansion, and the House of Blossoms (all excerpted from the main game). Collect loot before the time runs out. Every time you gather loot, the count-down resets. It's an arcade-y addition that might help refine your thieving technique (there are enemies present), but with only three maps it's little more than a distraction. And if you don't purchase The Forgotten DLC (the Asylum map), there are actually only two maps...On the Master Thief edition:The Master Thief edition is b*llsh*t. You get: the Opportunist Booster Pack, a digital comic book, and the digital soundtrack. The Opportunist booster Pack contains items that can be acquired in-game, you just get them at the start. To get the comic book, you have to take the code provided and enter it into an external website. To get the soundtrack, you have to enter the code you receive into a different external website. BUT THE SOUNDTRACK IS NOT COMPLETE. I only received 10 tracks of the soundtrack this way. The full album on Amazon is 20 tracks. A straight-up cheat, plain and simple. Don't get the Master Thief edition.On DLC:Of the DLC, the Booster packs are not pay-to-win, but they are pay-for-an-advantage. The Bank Heist is fun if short. If feels like a left-over level for content that was cut from the game. It's fun, but the value of the loot is disappointing, and it can be beaten in 30-60 minutes. If Challenge mode is something you enjoyed, the The Forsaken challenge map is worth the price - on sale at 80% off, of course.			"

												They could have put a lot more effort into this game: The movement and animations are well done, but general gameplay and storyline I felt was an overall flop and there is not much to keep you interested after a hour or two. The missions are highly repetitive, the skill-tree rather pointless and the combat system restrictive (although I understand it is not intended to be played that way).I am also confused as to why they choose to role the game out on the unreal engine instead of going with the engine that Eidos-Montréal  had created for the new Deus-Ex which personally I thought would have been the more logical platform.

												Against all odds, the game is actually a lot of fun!I am a hardcore classic Thief fan, having played the original two games to death, including tons of fan missions. I had sub-zero expectaitons and was growing increasingly horrified by the reboot with each new trailer and gameplay video. Having now played a reasonable amount of the game, I can say that despite all the complaints oldschool Thief fans have, it's actually a solid experience that feels satisfying and thiefy at its core.Despite the lack of Hammerites / Mechanists / Stephen Russell / etc, the game provides enough tweaks to turn it into an experience very close to the originals. Even if story missions are smaller, the city hub is a lot of fun to explore and loot. You can strip the on-screen feedback to just the light gem and explore using your brains and your senses, which is actually what Thief is all about.I hated and laughed at this game before I played it. However, at the end of the day all that matters is whether you have fun with your purchase and I am actually having a lot of fun with this reboot.			"

												A reboot of a well-loved series is always a gamble. Even if developers manage to completely recreate everything right about the original games, you're still never going to recapture that nostalgia. I feel for fans of the original games who are disappointed with the reboot, I really do. As a Silent Hill fan, I know what it's like to see a series you love change in ways you hoped it never would.  But as I've never played the original Thief games, I can only base my review on this one, and despite a lot of problems such as the muddled story, linear missions, and inability to climb absolutely everywhere due to contextual climbing and jumping, I found this game wildly fun. In the end, my biggest complaint is that there just isn't any more. The story could be explored so much better with a slower-moving pace and more, less hectic missions that let the narrative slowly unfold through small details rather than bombastic action sequences. At any rate, despite it's flaws, this game made it to my ultimate top 10, and as such, I feel as though I owe it at least a thumbs up.  "

												If you want a first person assassins creed, here you go, you will aimlessly wander around having to spend multiple seconds of hesitation as a thief to make your next move. Every ledge you approach, you have to peer down and consider if the jump is to far, thus moments after, activate this decision with a clever cutscene, that takes up more time, the idea of a first person experience in a thief mind is nice, but do you have to repeat every action with such repetitive motion. Yes, I get it, I'm stealing, but can it just be stolen and not see my hand motioning to grab something every time? When I grab my Burger at McDonalds, I don't grab it, look at my hands, assess the value, and take a new life revelation to figure out what I have become. I take the damn sandwich, I eat it, move on, why is Garret spending so much time with all this unworldly concerns when he starts telling us how he use to steal to live, live to steal, but things changed? Yes, get a job you bum. TL:DR poor rendition of the series, very glitchy, console gamers will enjoy it, no sense of motive of why you are who you are.

												So, the new Thief game has come and a lot of people have a lot of oppinions on it. Personally, the old Thief games are some of my all time favourites and I gladly place Thief 1 & 2 at some point in my Top 10 list of best games ever. I am also a big fan of the more recent Dishonored game, really hoping for a sequel there, and I hold it as the true spiritual successor to the old Thief games. So how does this new, actual THIEF Thief game hold up?I am glad to say that I enjoyed it! When judges on it's own merrits, it is a very enjoyable experience with some great gameplay throughout. The story is a bit simplistic, especially when compared to the old games stories, but there are a lot of layers to the story and the universe that you really have to dig for to get a glimpse of. For example, there is a very interesting theory circulating that this Thief game actually takes place in the same universe as the old games, only set about 800 or so years into the future, with this games Garret being a sort of reincarnation of the old games Garret. There is a theme about the cyclical nature of time in the game, and there's a side-quest in particular that discusses the idea of all parts of time existing at the same time all the time (sorry if it sounds a bit confusing from my explanation), but it would make sense that this story could be a continuation as well as a reboot at the same time.The best part of the game is clearly the gameplay, and stealing things really takes the main stage, as is appropriate. There is almost always something to steal in any part of the environment, and sometimes you happen upon special loot that is especially valuable. A lot of it is also hidden or contained in special places where you actively need to find the loot or figure out how to unlock it in some very intricate ways, which gives a thorough player a great sense of rewarding the dedicated playstyle. The addition of the ""swooping"" mechanic to Garrets moveset is also really enjoyable, and it works as a sort of counter to the ""Blink"" ability that was the absolute best part of the stealth system in Dishonored.It is very interesting to observe the evolution of the first person stealth genre visible here, as the original Thief games so strongly influenced the development of Dishonored, where they borrowed elements very hevily and used them to an extremely good extent, whereupon the developers here for the new Thief game were very heavily inspired by the style and development of Dishonored in turn. A great example is the three-part introduction to the world of the game that both Dishonored used (Tales from Dunwall) as well as Thief (Stories from The City).There are some aspects that detract from the overall experience of Thief, however. There are a couple of times when bugs can ruin the immersion, however they were fairly infrequent and none of them were really game-breaking. The worst one I ran into was durring a chapter where you ride in an evelvator and at the end of the ride have to climb out through a hatch in the top of the elevator. Upon trying to climb up, Garret got caught in a hanging-animation from the hatch and refused to climb up. After trying to climb, and then letting go and trying again, I was finally able to get on top of the elevator on my third or fourth try, so the problem solved itself after all. Problems like this, however, are rather frustrating to run into, even if they never ruin the experience completely.The navigation system can also be somewhat frustrating at times, due mainly to the fact that there is no real ""jump"" button in the game. The player can only perform a leap of some kind at certain points, like near an edge to jump accross to another platform. At times this jump can behave unexpectedly, however, and sometimes even gets the player killed. An example is any situation where you need to jump to a hanging rope, where you need to be perfectly aligned with the rope and do the exact kind of jump the game asks you for. If you don't, Garret won't aim for the rope and can sometimes instead just jump of the platform and throw himself to his death. This happened a couple of times durring my playthrough and it got very frustrating at some points.Overall, however, I would possitively recommend this game to everyone. If you're an old Thief player, or if you enjoyed Dishonored, you will be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of this game if you are able to judge the game based on it's own merrits rather than only comparing it to how great the originals were. Even though I absolutely love the old games, as I said, I was able to accept the changes the developers had made to the mechanics and I ended up enjoying the new Thief game a whole lot. And if you're a gamer that hasn't yet experienced this type of game, I would also recommend it, as it is a pretty nice introduction to stealth mechanics with a very well designed game. However, for these types of people I would probably also suggest that you give at least Dishonored a try before hand, as it is the most well designed stealth game of the modern era. While I would also suggest the old Thief games, they can be very challenging to a newer player, but if you are brave enough (both figurativelly and litterally), you should definitely give them a try as well, you won't regrett it!As a final touch, I have to compliment Thief on being a ridiculously well ported/optimised game with some amazing graphical options on all fronts. Running the game at max settings is also a true treat for the senses as the world is strictly beautifull to behold both visually as well as through it's audio. Finally, I have to say I really enjoyed the new voice actor for Garret. While not as amazing as the originals Stephen Russell, the new voice actor manages to capture the feeling of Garrets personality and his internal monologues really well. At times, his delivery made it feel like I was playing the old games again, which is a really nice thing indeed.			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. Using the darkness, assassinations, creatures, puzzles... I have never played any version of the Thief before this one. But this one is surely an intense satisfaction. And what I am going to the is to play the others. If you are planning to buy these game, do it, you won't regret. Square Enix makes great optimizations for PC graphics. As they did in Tomb Raider, this one was another succesfully optimized game with a great story line.			"

												I really shouldn't actually have grounds to post a review here, based on the fact that I've not even completed the first level. However the reason I'm typing here is to express my frustration; the reason I haven't played further wasn't my choice. It turns out that no matter what I do to this game, no matter how bad I make it look, the frames per second I manage to attain make the game unplayable. So all I really want to say is don't buy it unless you have a dedicated gaming PC. Because only sadness ensues otherwise.			"

												Warning: flaming review.Stupid scenario that features a mix of teen emo & blatant emptiness, the more you advance, the less you like it. Absent or lame characters, world feels bare & empty. Garret is too silent compared to previous games & unable to jump (maybe he's now too old for that haha). Another bad thing: you will often see Garett's face, which shouldn't be. Tiny & boring levels and no pleasure from exploring/discovering: everything is painted/scratched for you to see the possible routes, only blind players would miss them... Level layout is really bad. Gated gameplay: go THERE, do THAT, etc. Annoying Scripted sequences that you'll have to restart several times. Knocking people is bad, M'okay? So forget about the previous games where it was the hype thing to do lol. To top it all it's rather ugly, with no colors and oddly enough no mirrors (maybe it's my settings though). The AI is ridiculous. A lot seem like stolen from Dishonored: the guards' uniforms, the illness thing and a lot of the decor stuff.In conclusion: I cannot believe what I'm going to say but the average Thief 3 is waaaaay better than this! So huh?! How come? I tried to love the game, you can see that I have put a lot of hours in it & I still have some stuff to do in it but playing more than an hour at the time is too ***ing boring. Best Thief to Worst Thief, IMO: 2, 1, 3, 4.			"

												As a die hard fan of Thief series, I refuse to perceive this latest remake as bad. We've been waiting 10 years for another Thief game, and although this is not the direct continuation of trilogy it is still a very good game.You can adjust the difficulty level to your liking. Don't like focus? Turn it off. As in other Thief games, you are not forced to kill anyone, you can either sneak past them or knock them out. Some loot can be tricky to find, some are in plain sight but are still out of your reach until you pull the right trigger. Though this is a remake, it's has nice touch about the original Thief's past: Hammerites cathedral, references to Trickster, cog shaped loot (hint toward the Mechanists), Keeper's Library - it is all sentimental in this new instalment. Very nice music and graphics, steam punk, dark feel about the story. The story though might be one weaker side of this game. It's not as full and reach as it was in previous trilogy games. Nevertheless I like the game and hopefully we will see Garrett again. Or his apprentice from the end of the trilogy.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It is visually gorgeous, has a good story with documents and conversations which add depth, offers a range of play styles and routes through levels, and has a wide variety of collectables for those who enjoy hunting them out. I would definitely recommend it.However for OCD completionists like me there are a couple of issues which will drive you insane. [Spoilers] One of the levels has a challenge which cannot be obtained due to bugs, the statistics on challenges are bugged, several of the levels are glitchy and require counter intuitive actions or even exploits to get pure ghost along with 100% loot (one appears completely impossible), the city appears to be missing 2 loot items (I may have missed them, but given one of the smuggler's maps caches is missing I think not).

Posted: April 1, 2014
												Is the game any good?Short answer - Yes it is.BUT, the game is plagued by a long history of expectations from previous really good games in this series, and also by troubled development, which makes it much more complicated to talk about. A lot of reviews gave this game a low score, and even though I do understand that point of view partially, I also think it is unfair most of the time. Why? Well, more on that later.So what is good about it?It has very good stealth-mechanics. It has fantastic options for customizing your experience. It looks really great. Movement is smooth. It feels great to sneak, run, jump, and swoop. Good atmosphere in general. Hub-world is quite large and filled with many secrets. Many, really great side-missions. Great voice acting overall. What is not so good about it?Story feels unfinished and does not make much sense - it is also really cheesy and out of place. Audio is badly optimized at times. Frequent loading-screens in hub-world break immersion. You need quite a powerful machine to run it well. WEIRD April 1st bug, making it possible to complete the game, because of looping the chapter you are currently at. Bypassed by changing your date on the computer, but WHY???Control:Mouse and keyboard is the better experience - and it is excellent . Some controllers have fun rumble feedback, but it is not entirely worth it. So, why are some reviews unfair?Because of nostalgia: Some people have spent so much time into the older games, and they had such a good time playing those games, that they expect exactly the same experience again in later installments.Reboot-hate (stuck in the past)You simply can't repeat  an experience - it is not the same game - It is not the same you. The feeling we remember when we played a game the first time is mostly a nostalgic memory, that is probably a little warped from reality. And with that somewhat warped memory we search for the same feeling in the new game, which we never get - hence we become upset.I see so many reviewers critiquing the game from this angle, and so the critique is not objective in my mind. Instead of objectiviley looking at the game, everything gets judged as bad, because it does not fit the past. and many seemed to have decided in advance to hate the game no matter what it did. Another reason it is judged badly is partially because the game should be played slowly (I think) - Rushing through the game in order to write a quick review, and I think the essence of the game is mostly lost. Do we really want the game to be the same as the older ones?I would be really disappointed if they made Thief the same game as before with just better graphics, which I feel a lot of people are asking for. If that is what you want, I say go play the old games instead. I'm serious. Those games exist here on steam and GoG, they are still great (and MUCH cheaper), and they have tons of mods, updates, and fan made missions that make these games highly enjoyable.Devs. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.And, how do you create a game that is both enjoyable for someone who has hundreds of hours invested, and for someone totally new to the series?  It would, for example, not be commercially viable to create a game just for the SMALL devote thief-community. It is also interesting that most players who are not familiar with the older games really like this new Thief.Is this game a true thief-game?You hide in the shadows. You can sneak, you can explore, both vertically and horizontally, you have all the interesting arrows and gadgets. The game-mechanics are really good. There is lock-picking (best in the series). The AI chatter is better than ever, even though buggy at times. The atmosphere is very tense, dark and scary. You are weak and vulnerable. There is lots of loot and hidden areas - The game is quite long and re-playable. There is aspects of the supernatural, and the world is kind of steam-punk-medieval.  Sound design is really well made (a part from the bugs), and an integral part of the game. So, yes, it is absolutely a thief-game.Problems?Yes, there are quite a few. The most noticeable one is sound in general. Sure, at times the sound is really great, but it just does not seem to be mixed right. Sometimes you don't hear what you should hear, because something else is too loud. Sometimes you hear NPCs that are not in the same room as you, still as loud as they were right next to you. On occasion the music cuts out which makes you wonder if someone saw you, or something happened. The guards seem to get stuck sometimes, but there is always a way to get around them if you have your wits around. But then there is also the occasional issue of some NPCs being completely frozen, or ""glitching out"". None of the problems are game-breaking, a part of the April 1st bug that truly was a mystery. (You were kept in a loop and could not exit the current mission, when you reloaded a save you always started from the beginning.)What I don't like:Oh the story... In a way, it seems like they put some real effort into it, and the voice-acting and cut-scenes are nice. But, it also does not seem to head anywhere - Some cut-scenes just did not feel like they fit the situation you were in previously or after.  You get the sensation the story was quickly put together before the deadline, using various ideas all mixed together. You don't care for anyone really. Also, the occasional 3rd person wall climbing, even though not a problem at all, it just doesn't fit in the game - there is no point for this mechanic either. Also, I wished there could have been a little more space for ""inventing your own path"". All options on how to finish a task or path, were pretty obvious (to me). For example, you can't just use a rope arrow where you like, only at specific places. Frequent loading screens does break immersion - It becomes mostly apparent when you are trying to reach a specific location. The loading-screen times are not awful, and not too frequent, but I was hoping that it would be a little better, considering that was Deadly Shadow's biggest flaw, and I'm a little surprised it's needed with today's hardware - Aren't there ways to load stuff in the background as you progress? At least there are no loading screens during missions anymore (as in Deadly Shadows).Verdict:I say that Thief is a very good game despite its problems. The stealth mechanics, atmosphere and immersion are all fantastic, and the fact that you can highly customize your experience is just icing on the cake. Hopefully patches will come soon to correct the flaws, but the story and direction can't be patched, and it is unfortunately a real mess. But the main mechanics: thieving and sneaking is actually really well done, and the levels are atmospheric and fun, sometimes truly great. The side-missions are really worth your time as well. Then you can of course compete with your friends in terms of how fast you can complete a level, how much loot, knockdowns, ghosting etc. All this clearly makes the game very much worth it.If the other thief-games did not exist, if we did not compare with our sometimes questionable nostalgia, more would probably see this game as a really good and unique experience. But some people just decided to hate this game no matter what it is - haters are gonna hate I guess.I have played all thief games extensively (including fan missions), and I still like this game a lot. In fact, while playing Thief, I kind of forgot my other duties at times; I could not wait to get back in the world.			"

												This game took away everything from the original Thief games that makes it unique and a challenge.Having a hard time navigating Victorian London? Good thing Garrett has a GPS-like minimap and objective markers everywhere.Wanna jump over this pesky table and climb those boxes over there to avoid guards? Nope. Jumping and climbing only work in context sensitive areas.Ledge too high to climb and don't feel like walking to find stairs? Too bad! Rope arrows are now 500% more context sensitive!Looking for a gripping story? Go fish.Devs said in an interview """"we want you to play as a thief, but we don't want to force you to play as a thief."" Quick reminder in case you forgot the series' title - THIEF. Garrett now has expert assassin/combat skills.Good thing we can see his hands moving, though, don't know how we ever survived without some visual feedback to remind us what we just did.disappointment/10			"

												- Cliche, terribly written dialogue. - Boring, cardboard characters.- Awful narrative.- Terrible combat system. - Buggy AI pathing.- Awful mini-map and map system.- inversed y-axis mouse doesn't save (I need to set this every single time I boot up).I presumed I wouldn't be lost in the plot not having previously played the other Thief games, but the plot and the characters were given no history or introduction and the narrative is so spartan I have zero sense of sympathy for the main characters and the vague antagonist. I have felt completely dissociated from the plot since the game began. The cut-scenes often have awkward inexplicable pauses that scream for revision. The actions are mundane. The dialogue is trite and doused in cliches. There's no sense of urgency to continue stealing stuff - I don't even understand what's going on most of the time.Having played nearly ten hours I'm ready to give up. This game feels like a chore to play. Having had no expectations coming into this game, it's hard to be disappointed. I just wish they'd picked up a better script-writer. And...you know...made the game mechanics fun to play or something...Avoid this one "

It'd be better if he was a more silent protagonist who spoke few words or spoke full sentences only to certain characters in a space where there aren't any enemies. I feel like he could've been developed better instead of this rogue guy who makes snarky comments as he steals stuff. Overall it's okay 7/10.

												As a fan of the series I was very worried by the early footage of this game and felt pretty sure they were going to ruin the series.  Fortunately they do seem to have corrected a lot of issues such that I feel I can recommend the game, but it's definitely worth noting there are problems.Short SummaryFor those who want a brief summary, here's the short version first.  The game lacks polish, the level design isn't always up to par, dialogue gets repetitive at times and the story is just annoying and thoroughly awful.  It feels like 30 different people all want to tell their story and you get an incoherent noise where you can pick up some ideas from different stories.  That said, the game is still at its heart a Thief game.  If you want a traditional stealth game you can definitely find it here, especially with the remarkable amount of customisation available, and the actual gameplay itself is sufficient that I would recommend looking past the problems.ReviewSo this Thief game is a series reboot which means that there is no story you're missing if you're new to the series.  There are some nods to older fans but nothing particularly relevant.  There is a central hub city where routes through open up as you advance through the main missions and there is a reasonable amount of exploration and side missions to be found.  The missions, and bigger side quests, all take place in separate levels you access by finding them around the city.The design of the mission areas is hit and miss, with some fairly competent design let down by other areas clearly influenced by the earlier path the game was taking and, frustratingly, late in the game there are boss fights which is never a good thing in a stealth game.  Given they don't break character by forcing an actual altercation it isn't as terrible as it could have been, they all the same feel frustratingly out of place and should at least be a consequence of gameplay rather than something you just have to live with.Another, more significant addition to the game is focus mode.  With this you can look around your world to highlight loot, hidden buttons or things you can use.  It can also be upgraded to provide a lot of additional upgrades in pickpocketing and lock picking, combat and stealth mechanics.  Whilst I welcome the mechanic being available to help people through the game and make it less frustrating, if you're really in to stealth games you're going to find it makes things a bit easy as the game goes on, especially as you can use it when your focus meter is empty whenever you want to get a lingering highlight of the important things in the world. Fortunately it can be disabled, but only when you're selecting starting difficulty settings.Customisation is really the strongest part of the game and really sets a standard I'd like to see in more games.  First the PC port of this game has a great options menu with everything you could really want.  The options continue though in the difficulty of the game, with 3 base difficulties but also custom options you can use to tailor the game to what you want.  A few examples include disabling focus mode, no kills or knockouts, no alerts allowed and many more up to even Iron Man where failing or dying means you have to start from the beginning of the game.  The game continues though, with every single element of the HUD being able to be turned off (including loot glint and lock pick help) or being given a timed fade away for things like health bars.  You really can set this game up how you want it and it's remarkable in that sense.Several other aspects of the game are done very well; the character feels like they're really in the world, with the use of limbs and the way the character interacts with things giving a real sense of there really being a person there.  You can learn quite a bit about the world by eavesdropping, spying on people and some reasonably well written documents and it feels reasonably organic.  The swoop feature (where you quietly dash forward) also feels really good to use and actually adds rather well to some tense stealth sections.The AI in the game is sometimes quite good, noticing things on their patrol route have been opened and being reasonably consistent in its detection of you or otherwise.  Other times though it will bug out, will get stuck on doors, not notice really obvious things, or notice really unobvious things such as you, through a wall, one floor down, in the shadows.  It's usually alright but sometimes feels a bit under-polished, which is a phrase that would describe a lot of the game quite well unfortunately.The world sometimes feels a bit lifeless, people have set paths with very limited dialogue options that repeat annoyingly often - you will sometimes hear 3 or 4 guards in a row repeat the exact same thing.  Some rather useful information is hidden in loading screens, such as pressing X to let go of ropes, which leads to perfectly functioning aspects of the game feeling annoying.  Sometimes your character will drop off ledges; sometimes you need to use the drop button.  Sometimes you can leave vents; sometimes you will need to try repeatedly.  Sometimes you will loot the draw with a context sensitive button; sometimes it'll move away and look around a corner with the same context sensitive button.  These kinds of things give the game the feeling of just not quite being finished.Finally, the biggest problem with the game is the story, it damages the game.  For one thing it starts pretty bad and just gets worse every single time there is some major advancement in it.  It's so focussed on someone it's very difficult to care about that it is annoying to experience, and to make things worse because you're driven by it you're not so much going to places to steal from them, you're stealing from them on the way through.  As a result of this approach you spend a lot more time stealing cutlery than planning a big heist.  The bank heist DLC comes the closest to this ideal and really shows the potential the game really did have when unencumbered by the mess that is the story.I appreciate this review sounds quite negative; indeed there is a lot to be negative about.  It is the weakest game in the series, but with its great customisation options you can still find a Thief game in it.  It is, at its heart, a rather competent stealth game and if you're a fan of the genre you will definitely get something out of it.  You do need to look past its rough edges though.			"

												Now I'll start off with saying I have a bias towards square enix games so I might rate this slightly higher than others, but I do believe this is a decent game. Play as Garrett, the master thief who lifts everything that isn't bolted down, but then unbolts said object and takes it. This game was the first game that ever had me play stealth in first-person which makes it more tense, but also fun. I enjoyed playing through the levels and the stealth mechanics are actually quite great making sure to hide bodies and shut cabinets and cases. I have enjoyed it so far but it of course is not without it's faults. A couple being the hub world is a terrible mess of loading screens and confusing pathways and the bow which seems like an item of paramount importance really doesn't seem to be (while playing I only ever found myself using the water arrows). The story and voice acting is rather plain, but not entirely bad and I would recommend this game only during times of steam sales where I feel the value vs. price is a bit better. 7/10			"

												While my feelings are mixed with this game I will hesitantly give it a thumbs up.  There's a lot of bad but the game is worth a look just because it is a new thief game.  don't buy it unless it's on sale and save it for a rainy day.  5/10pros;Current gen thief game.Graphics are shiny.Guards etc very much like normal thief game.Secrets and collectables.Most of the game will support different play styles.cons;Focus system really draws away from the original thief.Dat space tap, same thing.Dat ending and last boss fight... really?Where's my anytime jump for making really loud noises for free?City travel is a real pita, and it all looks the same; it is easy to get lost and hard to remember.DLC: all the thief games came with a bank robbing mission right into the storyline, this one didn't because they knew you'd buy it as a dlc.Birds and Dogs.One path areas, I don’t need a developer holding my hand, or funneling me into a storyline scripted encounter.Unlike previous thief games interface you cannot have both a weapon and a secondary ""equipped"" at the ready.No skill required one button knockouts.Memory leak, client needs restarting every 3 hours on PC or your game starts chugging.Awkward story, with new/changed lore that tries so hard but just ends up missing the point.Missing our favorite hammer wielding hammerites and Tree Hugging pagan factions.Not the original voice actor from the previous thief games.  Some dialogue is made and added later to the original making some very awkward moments most notably right at the start when talking to his apprentice.			"

												Thief has good stealth going for it, but the game suffers from a lack of ambition, placing far too much importance on the tiresome looting in the vain hope that this will be enough to propel you forwards.It's good in places, but it never quite lives up to its potential.An overall letdown.

												Opening Desk Drawers: The Game, 4/10Stealth is somewhat decent; I enjoyed actually being able to use the shadows to my advantage. But the AI tends to spot you sometimes even when you are completely hidden. Visually the game looks pretty nice. It's a tad bit too dark at times (depending on the environment, of course). Combat system is terrible, which almost forces you to sneak and stay out of sight, regardless of  your playstyle. When in combat, you can only melee and duck. Which not only is boring, but feels clunky. I found myself loading a previous save whenever I was spotted to avoid altercations. The story is very, very forgetable. There were a few times where I had no idea what was actually going on. Maybe it was just boring to me and didn't catch my interest. Voice acting was the worst/funniest I've ever experienced. It's overly exaggerated and forced and the poor writing was not in the actors favor. In conclusion, I only paid 7 dolars for the game, so I can't complain too much. I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your Steam monies.			"

												Thief is a dystopian stealth game where you play as Garrett a Master Thief by his and many other's rights. However, while it may sound good as a tagline (or maybe it doesn't) it's not as good as I thought it'd be. I got an email from Steam telling me that it was on sale for 66% off I believe and I love Steam sales so I paid about $12 for it and it's about as worth that much to me.Maybe a little harsh? You would think the same if you were like me and played it yourself. The main problems I have with the game are how the map is very difficult to follow and I found myself getting lost in the Stonemarket area while trying to complete some extra jobs for clients. I also felt that the UI/HUD was a little poorly done, I'm not quite sure what it was about it I didn't like so I can't offer a better review on that aspect. I looked briefly, before the purchase, at other reviews and saw that it didn't get really good reviews and I should've known better before I decided to buy it, but I wanted to still give it a shot anyways, to try and be more fair and give the makers of the game the benefit of the doubt. But never again.I'd not suggest anyone play this game until the rebooted Thief gets a reboot itself.			"

												Well before i get into bashing on the game: i loved the whole series, as in up till deadly shadows, i like sneaking games, and i give major props for ignating in me the hype for the Thief series. Now on with the review. The game graphics look good, the feel of the world is there and is satisfying enough. The story has legs and feet up till a point. The constant mini loadings (we dont have loadings in our game hurr durr) or ""loading events, tap e"" are a bother, I tried to figure out where the game crashed for me, and i think it was at *spoilers ahead* opening the last safe in the game, the vital for the story one (without giving too much away) - it was straight up bugged and i had to look on the web for a solution, and i came back to the game (had a falling off due to the story not delievering the pase) much much later. It's one of those games that you go back into and feel that it was a waste of money. Especially if it's a triple a title.Pros:+ Graphics+ SoundCons:- Story is good but really slow- In my eyes not worth the full price			"

												Now I'll start off with saying I have a bias towards square enix games so I might rate this slightly higher than others, but I do believe this is a decent game. Play as Garrett, the master thief who lifts everything that isn't bolted down, but then unbolts said object and takes it. This game was the first game that ever had me play stealth in first-person which makes it more tense, but also fun. I enjoyed playing through the levels and the stealth mechanics are actually quite great making sure to hide bodies and shut cabinets and cases. I have enjoyed it so far but it of course is not without it's faults. A couple being the hub world is a terrible mess of loading screens and confusing pathways and the bow which seems like an item of paramount importance really doesn't seem to be (while playing I only ever found myself using the water arrows). The story and voice acting is rather plain, but not entirely bad and I would recommend this game only during times of steam sales where I feel the value vs. price is a bit better. 7/10			"

I'm just going to push one button and watch all fight (yeah I am talking about AC)'' you should buy this game. And about that bad reviews some of them right some of them just reviewed by old heads who can't enjoy new games. Yeah guys try to play NEW  game. I love old Thief games too but really it's not bad at all. +Atmosphere and lightnings are realy good+Good voice acting+You can make your own difficulty+It's stealth based-You can't jump-AI isn't the best-Meh not that story rich7/10			"

												Seriously what the *****.Bought the game and the first thought, okay this game might be worth the money. (NO)This will happen in the game: you´ll run around in a carton, so no you can´t run around as in Assassins Creed (sometimes you have to look for 30 minutes to find a passage and the surrounding area is limited like ****), and later you´ll do exactly the same thing all the time until you come to a ♥♥♥♥♥ house, stops and smile, and then proceeds with the worthless story.So the only good thing about this game is that the graphics are good.29,99€ for a wretched bad copy of Dishonored and Assassins Creed. 2.5/10 (Buy a CS: GO knife instead)			"

												I think, had I not played AC 4 before I played Thief I would have enjoyed Thief a lot more. However, the game felt clunky and constrainted compared to the free running aspect of AC4. I was frequently frustrated by the fact that I could only climb certain places, and several levels felt like you were on rails, sure you had a choice of which set of rails you started on, but once you found the stealth route vs the predator route, there was little variety. I'm not sure why the present the option of Predator vs Ghost Vs Opportunist, I played through several chapters without being spotted and/or knocking someone out, only to be told I was a Predator.The ""Focus"" points might as well not be in the game, although I suppose they may make it easier if you decided to go the combat route, but the game is called Thief, not Fighter. I will say that the Assylum level was awesome and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Overall the game felt like it was building up to something awesome, only to be let down in the end. Its worth a play through, but I wish I hadn't paid full price for it. Wait for it to come down, then pick it up, I guess.			"

												So I got this game over the Summer Sale with high expectations.... only to be let down. Alright let me get this clear, Thief is NOT a bad game. Yes I do not recommend it but I can't trash on it either. Thief is an alright but there are a lot of things which really prevent it from being a good game. First of all is game feel. I've played a lot of stealth based games in my time so I would like to think that I know what makes a good stealth game. This game right of the bat does not have that feel which it should aim to have. A big problem for me is that the game feels too slow and clunky most of the time. It gives me a hard time believing that I'm a master thief when all of my movements are slow and incoherent. Thieves should be quick and nimble and I feel that Garrett, in this game, is not. I really wanted to give this game a try and I tried to like it but it's mechanics and controls really prevent me from doing so. Secondly the game lags quite a lot for me. My PC is not a high end PC which can run the newest Crysis with max graphics but I can confidently say that it can run a lot of games on their highest settings. Yet for some reason I get a stable 24 fps when I run Thief, even in the lower settings. Maybe it's something on my end but then again maybe it's not. Want a good stealth game? Play Dishonored. Maybe even play some of the older games in the Thief franchise, which I have not played myself but I've heard that they're fantastic. Reading the other reviews here on Steam makes me feel that my arguments are valid given that a few of my complaints were addressed by other consumers as well. However as with any review I can't guarantee that my experience with the game will be the same as yours. If I didn't convince you to not buy the game then go ahead and buy it, you might have a blast playing it. Then again you might not. I tried to compliment the game somewhere in this review but the only thing I could think of were the different types of arrows they had in the game.			"

												Through most of the game I was wishing it was a bit more like Dishonored. Not that I would want something like the ""blink"" ability from Dishonored in this game but a little more freedom wouldn't go amiss. Too often did I find myself confined to the floor because an otherwise perfectly climbable crate had a wicker basket or some other easily moveable object on it. While Dishonored lets you climb almost anything that's wide enough to stand on in Thief you can rarely climb anything that's not clearly marked for the purpose.Thief is not a power fantasy like Dishonored, and it doesn't need to be, but it would benefit from being less restricted. Too often will you run up to a wall or object that looks perfectly scalable only to find that the jump button does nothing at all meaning that beating the game will be much more a matter of trial and error than planning and executing.That said the game is not terrible but it's not as good as it should have been given it's setting and production values. If you don't already have Dishonored get that instead and wait for the price to drop on this one.			"

												Overall I think it's an okay game. What I liked:-Interesting features (blowing out candles, environment obstacles such as making noise from going through water too fast or stepping on broken glass, finding locks behind picture frames, etc.)-Charts of what type of player you are in the game (ghost, opportunist, predator) and stats (collectables, knockouts, etc.)What I disliked:-Unobservant AI (you could stand directly in front of enemies and they won't see you most of the time)-Linear missions (there was only one path to complete missions and work your way through the levels)I prefer Dishonored over this game as I found Dishonored was more open, had better AI, and was fun to play. I did play Dishonored first and am new to the Thief games.In the end I would not recommend this game.			"

												Thief Deadly Shadows was one of my favorite games and this was a big let down for bringing the series back. The game is extremely repetative, the voice acting is sub-par and the story hasn't really been that interesting (just finished Chapter 6). It's enjoyable when you first start the game and the graphics are very well done. But when you've snooped through the same drawers and cabinets, heard the same NPC voices complaing about sloop over and over again, and pushed the same plank of wood out of the way in another back ally for the 100th time, the joy fades fast. Pick it up when it's cheap if you can't resist another steath game. I'd highly recommend Dishonored instead if you're looking for something to fill that need now, though.			"

												NOTE: I've added this whole review to my blog which also includes a few bonus images. Check it here: http://opbroadcast.com/?p=144There are quite a few top negative responses to Thief, so for the benefit of my friends I thought I should drop some of my own thoughts. I'll preface though: If you're someone who's looking for Thief 4, or a true continuation of the decade-old series, you've come to the wrong place. Even so, I still enjoyed my time with Thief and I'd gladly recommend it if you're a fan of first person stealth-action games. Graphics and Style:The promotional screenshots for this game are terrible. Just look above and what do you see? Boring monochromatic vistas set in a pseudo-English, steampunk town. Even the gameplay footage above isn't that great. However, once you're in-game, the atmospheric quality is sold incredibly well. This is a dead city, filled with dust and decay. High contrast shadows draw attention to the light sources to create an incredible noir-like environment, and each location has enough unique architecture to keep you interested in exploring the space. Story:This certainly is the weakest part of Thief. The characters are laughably bad and the voice acting is delivered awkwardly (especially Garret's want-a-be noir quips). Square Enix (mostly from the Edios run studios) has always had a bizarre cast of characters.  (See Hitman's latex nuns, Dues Ex's painfully racist informant, etc.) Accents change on the fly, modern curses are thrown around like a modern rap artist, and the in-game notes are poorly written and unfocused. There are some good points though, in regards to the atmospheric storytelling. Walking through the hub town you'll hear muffled stories through the walls, some simply giving depth to the backstory of the city, while others can potentially provide you with hints on finding hidden loot throughout the world. Gameplay:The meat. The real reason you should be thinking about buying this game. I could talk about all the systems, annoyances and enjoyments, and everything else that made up the 20 or so hours I invested into this game. Many of these things you've probably already heard about elsewhere and have been written on extensively and far better than I could have, so I'll summarize first:Thief was fun.It's clear this is a game from the same studio as Dues Ex Human Revolution. Even though it's a separate team, you can't work in the same room as someone without borrowing a few of their ideas. It's also likely the development was influenced by Dishonored, as the game borrows quite a bit from its systems. (Ironic, as Dishonored was also inspired by the classic thief series.) While Dishonored was more of assassination sandbox where the game gives you a few tools, a loose objective, and tells you to have fun, Thief is directed. There's still some alternate paths and open exploration (especially in the hub city), but most of the primary missions give you a series of spaces to navigate through and it's up to you how stealthy or murderous you decide to be. This is especially prevalent in the side-quest missions, which mostly involve one self-contained zone giving you more power to plan your assault, rob your target, and attempt to make it back out in one piece. Oh, and I'll touch on movement for a moment, seeing as the lack of a ""jump"" key is a heated contention. When you start, it definitely feels weird not being able to jump up on things. However, the game features a surprisingly robust contextual movement system (it's a good thing they haven't invented fingerprinting yet as Garret touches damn near anything he gets close to), so you get used to the flow of movement rather quickly. There was only a few times I had trouble with jumping and most of them involved me trying to get somewhere I probably shouldn't have been anyways. ""Swooping"" between shadows and cover is tremendously fun though, and while I wish it didn't come with the lack of a jump key, I hope more games include it as a potential action. In Conclusion:Thief is not a fantastic game, and it certainly doesn't live up to the name it's given. But in the moments, and throughout the 20 or so hours I spent with it, I found fun even when it's issues and strange design choices emerged. I even enjoyed it enough to complete most (if not all) of the game's side-quests and collection opportunities, which is more then what I can say about the last dozen or so games I've picked up. Thief is in no way a terrible game. It could have been better, and perhaps with a future installment it might just be. For now though, it's decent, and I'd recommend it.			"

Thief just ends up geting stale after running back and forth through sections of town and through load screens over and over and over again just to find yourself doing the same thing in a place that looks the same as most every other place you've been. There's a couple levels that break up the monotony but they're too far and too few between. It's a shame, seeing as how I was a huge fan of the first two games.

												Brief version.- Upsides: Awesome atmosphere, good narrative style, nicely written sidemission, somewhat satisfying main plot.- Downsides in a word: Gameplay. It isn't too bad, but it's so clearly flawed that it sometimes ruins the upsides.- Evaluation: 6/10.Longer version:I played Thief's games a long time ago, and this pseudo-reboot/follow-up/whatever-it-is isn't anything close to the originals. Honestly, just the drop from 90+ metacritic score to 70 says something about a very wide gap, and that gap is real (and even bigger than 20 points out of 100).So why the hell do I recommend this game? Because it's still a decent game, and it provides for good entertainment. It is a 6/10 game coming from a 9/10 and 10/10 series, so if you played the previous Thief's titles be warned: you'll be disappointed, mainly by gameplay mechanics. I'll start with the bad to end with the ok.What is wrong about gameplay?- Sounds: you can hear YOUR footsteps even when you stay still and turn around (wtf!) but you can't hear a GUARD's footsteps if he's around a corner more than 2/3 meters away. Bad. Plus, into the houses you just hear very loud random footsteps/conversations from the other floors of the building (which you can't access). This this could be very cool if played right, but it becomes annoying since it's too frequent, and the people in the city seems like a bunch of sleep-walkers.- Random dialogues: while missions and main plot dialogues are satisfying to my taste, you keep overhearing like 6-7 exchanges over and over again while you roam the city, all from the same voices. Are those guys following you? Also, there is a chance that you overhear something useful, pointing you at thieving objectives like sub-sub-plots: cool... except it happened only 2 times in the whole game... meh...- Stealth is often awkward, mainly for two reasons: sight and sound (again). Sight - you are hidden in the shadows or you are not. In the first event, guards may also walk close to you - too close - they then look your way and they... don't detect you. What? Not very realistic, not in a *realistic* stealth game. In the second event they may see you just right and from afar: it's ok, but isn't there any middle-ground? - Sound - surfaces almost do not matter unless it's glass: you crouch if you want to move silently or you stand to move faster, except on carpets where you can move faster and still be silent: that was so cool when pace of movent and sound were so important, in previous Thief's installments, but now they introduced the swoop: if you want to move fast then just stay crouched and *swoop* around. Noise/speed trade-off doesn't exist anymore.- Swoop: sounds cool to me, and it really makes you feel a shadowy thief with great skill, but it's just too much prone to abuse. You want to go around faster? Swoop. You want to reach the back of a guard without alerting him when you WOULD alert him if you walked? Swoop. It's so abusable that it seems like a cheat rather than the cool tool it is supposed to be.- Footprints: they made you leave footprints in a 2002 game (if I remember the year right), now in 2014 you randomly walk into oil, pools of blood and such and do not leave any trail, not even for a few steps. Are you kidding me? That was very disappointing.AI is ok. Despite the many critics to that, I find the AI consistent enough, if you purge its behaviour from the effects of what's above. Only thing is: you are in a house with only 3 guards, you knock out the patrolling one: good. Wouldn't the other two notice he's missing, after a while? If so the game *realism* would have been so improved... but whatever.Let's get to the upsides!- Voice acting: some hardcore fans make themselves disgusted by the voice acting because it's different from how it was before. Why? Get over it, dudes, this one is good and well done.- Story: it's not a story of overwhelmingly epic proportions, but it's very good and entertainig. Moreover it's very well-balanced between thieving, discovering things (you won't understand half of what's happening unless you search for the documents and read them), supernatural activity, crowd madness when they revolt... a good story, well written too.- Atmosphere: awesome and very well designed, could only be better with less random-dialogues (see above) and more dialogues giving some insights on the city life. But grafically it's very good.- Overall feeling: if you are able to get over the downsides, Thief leaves a lasting feeling of... playing a dark gothic, almost satisfying stealth game, and that's why I recommend it.- Interface design: people complains a lot about it, and I wonder why. Focus makes the game like 100 times easier? Map indicators disturbs you and prevent you from feeling the exploration/orientation stuff you want? Frigging DISABLE it. I played with everything disabled and I like it, but there are many players too used to mmorpg (lost without map indicators) and some players who play to have a good time without having to pay too much attention (they are welcome to use focus). Who care? Let people play the game the way they want. Customizable difficulty/helpers are a BIG upside to this game IMO.Last thing worth mentioning, not related to the game but to its development. Many of the flaws above were highlighted during early beta stages by fans screaming in anguish. Why didn't the developers listen to the often good advise? Did they WANT to make a mediocre game? That I cannot understand but it isn't a reason to hate the game, rather to despise the developers' hybris.			"

												I'd love to say that this game is great. Sadly, it's a spotty stealth-em-up with where the story, mechanics and sound design often feel unfinished. There's fun to be had in here, but not at the current AAA price. The world is poorly-realised, derivative and strangely empty. If you want a good current-gen stealth game, try Dishonored instead.

												I've been a huge fan of the Thief series from the beginning, and while this new entry started well, for some reason my attention just wasn't held. The game is gorgeous but controls are extremely touchy with computer inputs, highly recommend a gamepad of some sort. For the current price ($15-30 depending on sales) I'd recommend it, but for full price at release I feel as though I strongly overpaid.  I'll list this as recommended because the game is enjoyable, but not heavily so.  The best I can say is that it wasn't terrible.			"

												Brief version.- Upsides: Awesome atmosphere, good narrative style, nicely written sidemission, somewhat satisfying main plot.- Downsides in a word: Gameplay. It isn't too bad, but it's so clearly flawed that it sometimes ruins the upsides.- Evaluation: 6/10.Longer version:I played Thief's games a long time ago, and this pseudo-reboot/follow-up/whatever-it-is isn't anything close to the originals. Honestly, just the drop from 90+ metacritic score to 70 says something about a very wide gap, and that gap is real (and even bigger than 20 points out of 100).So why the hell do I recommend this game? Because it's still a decent game, and it provides for good entertainment. It is a 6/10 game coming from a 9/10 and 10/10 series, so if you played the previous Thief's titles be warned: you'll be disappointed, mainly by gameplay mechanics.

												I recommend this game to all the people that liked the ""Assassins Creed"" games. Most people say it's like that game but in first person which it is but, they focus more on the stealth aspect. You run around trying to rob as much stuff as you can, stay in the shadows to stay out of sight. Combat in the game is quite difficult till you get the hang of it so do your best to avoid being seen. You can sneak up on unsuspecting guards and take them down silently, you can also perfrom this if the guard is below you. The game may lag a little and takes a while to load up but it's all worth it. You use the gold you get by robbing things to buy equipment such as diffrent types of arrows that assist you in diffrent ways. There is also a power you have called focus, the default keys is ""F"". It helps you navigate your way through the level but, it does run out you can restore this by using a flower called poppy. So Foucs is almost like ""Eagle Vision"" from the ""Assassins Creed"" Games. If you do manage to pick up a copy of this game I hope you enjoy it.			"

												Felt like a ripoff of Assassin's Creed. I was a big fan of the original Thief and had high hopes for this new rendition but I barely got through the first two chapters. Controls are clunky, environments are bland, and I spent way too much time crawling in windows only to find a dead-end room with one silver spoon to loot. Save yourself the trouble - play one of the originals or try a different game. Not recommended.			"

												Disappointing on many levels, especially the game world itself which is terribly linear. There is hardly any life in the ""city"", the graphics are okay but not brilliant, in particular textures look nasty up close. I am glad i only paid £7.00 for the game as I would probably have not recommended it at its full price.So I only recommend it if you pay the same price, any more expensive and I would not recommend it.

												+ Garrett is no longer an insufferable, arrogant twatwaffle as he was in the original series.+ Even though the levels are little more than ""point A to point B"" navigation, there's at least some variety in how you get from point A to point B. Not as good as Deus Ex, not as bad as Call of Duty.+ Customizable difficulty to recapture the feel of previous Thief games.+ The insane asylum is extremely creepy, continuing the tradition of atmospheric scares from Thief: The Dark Project's Return to the Cathedral and Thief: Deadly Shadows' Robbing the Cradle missions.- Every cultural thing you loved about the original Thief series is gone or lampshaded. There's a single conversation between two guards about the word ""taffer"", and Chapter 7 has you exploring the ruins of an old cathedral where the symbols bears striking similarity to the Hammerite and Mechanist symbols. That's it.- Rope arrows are more like puzzle mechanics than actual rope arrows from the original series. They cost 600 gold apiece (at Master difficulty), can only be fired at specific hanging posts, and cannot be collected again once fired.- There's no dedicated jump button. The spacebar will allow you to swoop (think: stealth roll in Skyrim), mantle up ledges, and climb ladders and ropes, but there is no jump button. Case in point: One of the final Basso side jobs has you breaking into an aparment. Said apartment has a window out on a ledge that is two feet away from the ledge you are currently on, and would be an easy task to get to IF THE GAME HAD A JUMP BUTTON. Instead, the mission forces you to go around to the side and waste 600 gold on a rope arrow to get in.- Boss battles.- BLOODY SCREEN SO REAL when your health is low.- The windows. There are a few windows that you can open, and when you start the opening animation you are either A) given a quicktime event where you mash E for no apparent reason, or B) don't have to do a quicktime event since it's a level transition. The problem is, the game never tells you which one is which until it's too late, the minimap and map have no level transition markers. And you cant just exit out of the quicktime event, you need to go through the entire motion of the animation.- Placement of the guards means that you are going to have to exploit dumb AI and game mechanics if you want to get a Ghost rating. Similarly, it is virtually impossible to play it Lytha style (no detections, no evidence, no knockouts, you were never there).In short, save your money and just buy Dishonored. It's a much better Thief game than Thief. Alternatively, go buy the original Thief trilogy from GOG.			"

												It was okay, I had kind of a good time, honestly I really don't know how I feel about it, the stealth was pretty good, gadgets were fun, the speciel powers seemed out of place, but what stealth game wouldn't have see through walls vision now a days, it honestly felt more like I was playing a first person medevil Batman game, but batman was willing to kill people with arrows on top of beating them senseless. You never have to kill, but I didn't really feel a penelty or a point, to killing or not killing respectivly. I paid way too much at launch for as little fun as I had with it, but if you get it on a deal it's not bad. Aparently though for a reboot of the old series it's a travasty, I wouldn't know I never played them, and despite any roots in older popular stealth games, I would likely say it was average for a stealth game, not even on par with Dishonored. Admitedly Dishonored had actual spells, while this has one spell that lets you do stuff better while it's active, basically you have one buff spell that you have to upgrade a crazy amount to have it be more useful than just tapping the button once in awhile to see where guards are. Over all it's bland not a lot of story, it's kind of a neat story mind you, but it seems to have more far reaching implications than this game alone so it kind of never takes off beyond ""Garret, save girl to make amends."", like they intended it to have a sequal at some point about another character that was I assume supposed to be cooler than Garret, which if this is the baseline for cool they intended to set then I hope they try to go leaps and bounds beyond Garret if they make a sequal. I can't say I liked it, but I didn't hate it, kind of like Call of Duty games, if you play them they are pretty fun for a while, but they never really feel satisfying to look back on, like it was all some pointless ride. Also it has an open world, and linear missions that take place in a closed world, like Super Mario 64 did, only instead of jumping in paintings you just open a door and a loading screen happens, then you do the one mission and complete all the side objectives in the closed off area and never need to come back to it ever again, unless you want to farm for money which is kind of pointless beyond the few non lethal upgrades you can get, you never need to explicitly kill anybody if you sneak well enough or quick save like a mad man, but even if you are caught you can outrun most guards and move to places they can't fallow, then they forget they saw you after a while, which is SOP so I'm no complaining really. All in all it didn't wow me enough to warnt the sixty dollars I paid for it, maybe for twenty, but personally I would have only paid five if I'd known I'd not have a minimum of as much fun as I did with Dishonored. And just to be clear in case some one reading thinks I have a hard on for Dishonored, I'd like to point out that few games have been first person stealth focused in the past several years, in fact it's bsically just those two, so comparisons were bound to be made, Dishonored was the assassination simulator where killing had concequence, and Theif was the Sticky Fingered Batman simulator where you could kill anyone if you really really wanted to and not have it bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I was trying to decide if I should recommend or not recommend this game. It's a mixed bag. As you should know this is a reboot of the Thief series. It is by no means as good as the original 3 Thief games. Good, now that that's out of the way we can move on.This game is extremley linear but the City exploring is the most fun you will have out of this game. The missions are okay but they aren't anything special. The story is pretty damn bad as well. One of the reasons the original Thief games are praised for is the story. Just don't go into this game hoping for a good well thought out story.The gameplay is decent most of the time. Now my one of my main concers as a fan of the Thief series is Garrett's voice. If you play the other Thief games you will see what I mean. This game will probably frustrate fans more than it will people who aren't because they took away the interesting lore. Sure there is one level in the game that has one faction of the original games but that's about it.So if you really want to play this, go ahead. If you aren't sure, then don't play it. If any thing you should play Thief The Dark Project, Thief 2 The Metal Age, and Thief Deadly Shadows. So if you want to get into the Thief series, DO NOT play this game.			"

												I've only got a few words in my vocabulary to describe Thief, which concists of: underdevelopped, boring, anticlimatic and dull. But I could look past these things as I am (now was) an enthusiast of the thief franchise. But then discovering master thief Garret wearing a corset just flipped the table.This latest installment to the franchise is done on the same formula they used in the previous Thiefs, which is out-dated!The good:- the Asylum mission (I really had to think hard about what I enjoyed about this game.)The bad:-Montonous sword fighting, and there's probably someone going: ""yeah, but it is a steatlh game!"" and to you I say, If they're               going to put sword fighting in the game, make it exciting, but what we get is a formulated, block, slash, block slash deal.-Dull characters, at the end of it, you really don't care about anyone.-Loading times between levels and a really unhelpful map.-Everything else.Conclusion:This game sucks. Do not buy it even if it goes for $0.99, because you wouldn't be able to get back the time you play/wait this game.			"

												The game itself is alright, the chapters are really good, but the city which you must traverse between the chapters are horrible.Alot of loadingscreens and a ""tumble or jump""-button that rarely jumps when you want it to, makes this game a not so smooth playthrough. The story is nice and I enjoyed it quite much from time to time(while playing chapters). I think it was worth the 10euro I payed for it, but I would never recommend it on fullprice.I would also not set it that high on the ""to do""-list,  there are alot better games out there.Overall: A worthy buy on sale if you are out of things to play, just don't expect it to be of Tomb Raider quality.

												Disappointing on many levels, especially the game world itself which is terribly linear. There is hardly any life in the ""city"", the graphics are okay but not brilliant, in particular textures look nasty up close. I am glad i only paid £7.00 for the game as I would probably have not recommended it at its full price.So I only recommend it if you pay the same price, any more expensive and I would not recommend it.

												It was okay, I had kind of a good time, honestly I really don't know how I feel about it, the stealth was pretty good, gadgets were fun, the speciel powers seemed out of place, but what stealth game wouldn't have see through walls vision now a days, it honestly felt more like I was playing a first person medevil Batman game, but batman was willing to kill people with arrows on top of beating them senseless. You never have to kill, but I didn't really feel a penelty or a point, to killing or not killing respectivly. I paid way too much at launch for as little fun as I had with it, but if you get it on a deal it's not bad. Aparently though for a reboot of the old series it's a travasty, I wouldn't know I never played them, and despite any roots in older popular stealth games, I would likely say it was average for a stealth game, not even on par with Dishonored. Admitedly Dishonored had actual spells, while this has one spell that lets you do stuff better while it's active, basically you have one buff spell that you have to upgrade a crazy amount to have it be more useful than just tapping the button once in awhile to see where guards are. Over all it's bland not a lot of story, it's kind of a neat story mind you, but it seems to have more far reaching implications than this game alone so it kind of never takes off beyond ""Garret, save girl to make amends."", like they intended it to have a sequal at some point about another character that was I assume supposed to be cooler than Garret, which if this is the baseline for cool they intended to set then I hope they try to go leaps and bounds beyond Garret if they make a sequal. I can't say I liked it, but I didn't hate it, kind of like Call of Duty games, if you play them they are pretty fun for a while, but they never really feel satisfying to look back on, like it was all some pointless ride. Also it has an open world, and linear missions that take place in a closed world, like Super Mario 64 did, only instead of jumping in paintings you just open a door and a loading screen happens, then you do the one mission and complete all the side objectives in the closed off area and never need to come back to it ever again, unless you want to farm for money which is kind of pointless beyond the few non lethal upgrades you can get, you never need to explicitly kill anybody if you sneak well enough or quick save like a mad man, but even if you are caught you can outrun most guards and move to places they can't fallow, then they forget they saw you after a while, which is SOP so I'm no complaining really. All in all it didn't wow me enough to warnt the sixty dollars I paid for it, maybe for twenty, but personally I would have only paid five if I'd known I'd not have a minimum of as much fun as I did with Dishonored. And just to be clear in case some one reading thinks I have a hard on for Dishonored, I'd like to point out that few games have been first person stealth focused in the past several years, in fact it's bsically just those two, so comparisons were bound to be made, Dishonored was the assassination simulator where killing had concequence, and Theif was the Sticky Fingered Batman simulator where you could kill anyone if you really really wanted to and not have it bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥			"

Controls are clunky, environments are bland, and I spent way too much time crawling in windows only to find a dead-end room with one silver spoon to loot. Save yourself the trouble - play one of the originals or try a different game. Not recommended.			"

Artificial intelligence bots primitive, algorithm their behavior is not natural. As a result, no one of my friends did not finish this game, and just threw when she tired of the monotony of their stupid, including me. I feel like saying : Bring back the money!Это худшая игра из серии thief. Видно, что на нее потрачено огромное количество труда и денег, но в результате получилось унылое, серое♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥с крайне глупым управлением клавиатуры, когда герой вместо действия,которое ты хочешь, делает совершенно другой.Однообразно и скука, вот, что создано в качестве атмосферы. Искуственный интеллект ботов приметивен, алгоритм их поведения не естественнен. В результате, никто из моих друзей не стал заканчивать эту игру, а просто бросил, когда она надоела своим глупым однообразием, включая меня. Так и хочется сказать: Верните деньги!			"

												A middling stealth game. Graphics and scenaries are wonderfull, but need a powerfull hardware to run fine. The sound is horrible, establish distances and directions is impossible. The Mechanics and backgrounds are copies of other titles, specially Dishonored. Maps are really big, with a lot of dark places and with good transitions to one another, but main ones are lineal. Many obstacles are stupid: can not jump over a box or barrel with a little sack or basket over it. Special items are unimaginative and few, collectables are simply useless. Player can carry just one object for distract foes, but other means neither works well. Fighting is dispensable because movements are slow and clumsy, knock out by surprise is noisy even against a asleep target, only can make from backwards and carry the body is more slowly and striking yet. Bow deselects itself without warning. Lighting effects are good, but torchs require an arrow to turn them off, lamps are untouchables, and visual capacities of foes vary a lot; the ones of animals are exagerated. Only the times of freedom to prowl in obscure places are memorable.			"

												This game is BAD, BAD, BAD.1-Awful interface- clunky. There are multiple keys for sneaking... yet no keys to jump?2-Level design is ultra-linear; even the HUB is linear! No fast travel and it gets really boring. 3- Bad design ideas make exploration a chore. 'Rewards' rarely worth the cost of the materials you had to use to get there. ""Hidden traps"" are just a gimmick requiring you to repeatedly turn on Assassin's creed style ""Eagle Vision"" ripoff, and simply walking around them. Boring.4- Stealth mechanics horribly simplistic, overly-easy, unrealistic and unfun. Guess what happens when you walk past the guards and your shadow passes over them? Nothing. The Devs forgot to program it in.5- Gimmicky 'player punishing' gameplay (not challenging- just makes you wait and wastes time)Sometimes you follow the map, break into a house (takes ages- and then a loading screen)- to realize my entrance was surrounded by traps and I was then expected to backtrack out of the window (another loading screen) and take a back entrance (another loading screen) to just walk in.Uninstalled it. Regretted my purchase. Tried to get a refund but was refused DO NOT BUY. If you like this kind of game- buy ""Dishonoured"", or Assassin's Creed (either Black Flag or Rogue). They're actually fun and well designed. Avoid this game at all costs!			"

												The struggle to enjoy this game. As a long time Thief fan this just does not feel like Theif at all and even as a stealth game its not really that good either. From the boring level design to the audio engine which pales in comparison to Thief: Deadly Shadows, and the inconsistant A.I. its just a shame to see one of my favourite franchises hit this kind of low. The story is like something out of a childs book and isnt very interesting and it doesnt do a good job of making you feel as if you are somewhere you are not meant to be unlike earlier Thief games, in this you just feel like an everyday petty thief. Though I have only played 4 hours of it so far I just cant bring myself to play in long stretches unlike the previous games were they had me glued to my screen. As of now its a no but if it gets any better the further it goes in then I will change my review.			"

												You'll get bored after a while of playing this game. There's not really any excitement through out the game, nor a good story in my opinion. Square Enix succeded to fulfill the genre ""Stealth"", but by the title ""Thief""..not as much. As I said, there aren't much excitement, and when you (for example) pickpocket a guard or perhaps steal an item from someone else you won't feel ANYTHING (which you usually do when you steal something because you know it's illegal). Square Enix somehow made stealing boring/ dull which was a huge mistake, because stealing is pretty much what a thief does. (Did, almost, immediately regret paying 59.99 Euros the same day I bought it).This could very well have been a great game, but still...I admire the graphics and partially the parkour & animations ;) *4.6/10*			"

												Wow, I really wanted to like this game, but it is a bad mess. The navigation around the city is confusing and not at all fun, you can just as well run around like a lunatic, alarming all the guard, and just run up to the door to the next level, after the next level  has loaded you are no longer followed =/ talk about breaking immersion. Further more, the combat controlls are not that great either, the only redeeming bit this game has, is it has a lot of atmosphere and somewhat cool graphics and sounds.You can replay all the chapters to get more loot, and thats about as much replayabilty you get. I just could not get myself to finish this game, there are 8 chapters and I stopped playing when I reached chapter 5.			"

												I played some of the original Thief game prior to playing this one. At first I disliked the old one, (the graphics and weird keybinds put me off) but I came to really like it. This game isn't the same. The stealth is meh, I haven't figured out how to fight since I don't have a sword, at least not yet; I just mash the melee button and hit them with a blackjack until they die. The freerunning in actually pretty smooth. A bit too simple, but smooth. Except you rarely get to do more than a few seconds of it at a time due to the cramped level design and constant cutscenes. Really though. I swear this thing is half cutscenes, for a story I don't care about. Just let me steal in peace!			"

												This game, sigh. Where to start?Let's start with the good. The graphics are really good and atmospheric and, well...That's about all that's good with this game. The rest is average or terrible.The gameplay leaves tons to be desired and I'm not saying that in comparison to the old games but just as a game, it's not very good. I have played all the previous thief games and this one is definetily the worst but if I have to compare, I'd say that it's the most like thief 3 (deadly shadows). I say that because the whole game has a hub world so to say and from there you travel around to different levels in the game, just like thief 3. The greatest problem for me with this game is that I don't have the feeling of control that I'm used to. You can't jump and alot of times you feel locked to the enviroment as if you were on rails. Especially in many parts in ""the city"" which is the hub world. The other problems with the gameplay are numerous.Questionable level desgins, meaningless and lame side quests, lack of freedom with tools but let's talk about the other possible selling point of the game: the story.It's bad, with no likeable characters (especially Erin). Erin gets lost early in the game before we get to know her at all. The only thoughts you get before she dissapears is that she's a whining and annoying ♥♥♥♥♥. After that, the game expects you to care for the character since the whole game is basicelly about saving her. So from the start, I disliked the story but it gets worse. The game doesn't know what it wants to be. Supposedly it's a reeboot but many elements are left such as Garrets robot eye and the character Basso yet nothing else in the story connects. It makes up a bunch of questions and plot elements are presented that are never anwsered. A mayor plot point is revelead in one point and then no one ever mentions it again. The story is a joke, a complete mess.So what is there left if the gameplay is average at best and the story blows? The anwser is, there is none.The game is simply not worth buying and playing. The only time I could recommend this is if you catch it on the cheap in a sale but otherwise, stay away.			"

												After Dishonored (if you like the stealth genre but havent played Dishonored yet grab that one, as its one of the best game of the generation) I was really excited for Thief, the next stealth game set in a dark desperate steampunk like environment, but I was very wrong with my high ecpectations. The only thing this game excells in is the very nice graphic, all other thins are bad to medicore. So here is my breakdown:(+)Very nice looking graphics(+) good stealth engine with a nice but somewhat narrow selection of gadgets (mainly different arrow types)(-) Very limited freedom which imo is a natural expectation against a stealth game, maps are almoast entirelly linear.(-)Very very bad mimimap of the city hub which absolutelly does not aid you in getting where you want, its frustrating searching the right path to the actual quest location(-)Very very bad secondary quest design where actually the main difficulty is to get to the quest site and not the sloving of the (mainly very trivial side quests) this is largely due to the useles minimap(-)The selection of sounds and banter and chats of NPS is substandard(-)No real background story of main character and the city(-)Story is somewhat weak..(-)The gameplay revolves around thieving thins which gets dull after a while because mainly you steal pottery, forks, scissors,  small liqour flasks and the like useless junk...Althogether a quite frustrating game..J.

												I personally regret buying this game.  I was truly expecting so much more and I was left disappointed.  I watched some videos of game play and foolishly decided too quickly that this game was something incredible.  That was my mistake, and I'm simply writing a review to hopefully prevent someone else from making the same mistake.The storyline had promise, but it was very poorly put together and very difficult to follow.  This continues until the very end of the game and you're left feeling as though nothing was resolved.  By the end of the game the only thing accomplished is stopping Orion from turning everyone into monsters and saving Erin. ‘Nothing’ in the city changes. Gloom is still running rampant, people are still dying, the city is still corrupt and now it has no leaders...The side missions are a catastrophe.  They are bland and unrewarding.  You simply enter the location steal an object and your mission is complete.  There is never anyone inside the house to challenge your sneaking skills or anything at all.  You don't even have to deliver the object after you've stolen it.    You simply get a tiny description on the mission and that's it. The full map and mini map are extremely lacking with barely any detail put into them whatsoever.  Certain areas of the city are mission locked and the areas that you can explore never change. It's a very boring and bland place to explore.  All of the accessible ‘houses’ are rundown and every room looks practically the same. Really, you don’t get to explore houses as 90% of the house is always off limits and no one is ever inside either.  I also hate how you can't fast travel.  That is extremely annoying, especially when everything about the 'free roaming area' of the city is repetitive.The population of the city consists of possibly at most four generic AI faces.  There are never any events in the city other than the occasional hanging which consists of a crowd between three and four people.  The city doesn’t feel real at all.  Gossip between AI’s never change either even if you’ve stolen the loot they’re discussing they just keep looping forever.  They even follow the same path after the events of chapter six when their city is on fire burning around them! They don’t react AT ALL.There are so many features that could have been implemented into this game that would make it incredible.  But, aside from stunning visuals of the game it really has nothing else to offer.			"

												I haven't had the chance to play the older Thief games just yet, but I was greatly impressed by this reboot's mechanics, graphics, etc. I was once so immersed in the game during a chapter centering around the Asylum that my cat jumped on me and I screamed. :D As far as games go, I think people generally downvote this one because they've played the older games and are unimpressed by the newest addition to the series, even if it's a reboot - for someone coming into the series belatedly and playing this one first, the story was very interesting and the attention to detail for stealth missions and the chase scene over rooftops kind of threw in a little extra thrill for me. Overall, I thought it was great, but other people might not. Still happy with my purchase.			"

												I was severely underwhelmed by the entire game, I don't know if it was the bland sounding voice actors or just the monotone pace of the game, or the fact that one of the few cool moments of the game was 90% on rails cutscene.The game's graphics look nice enough, but the... 'psychedelic' moments in the game feel overdone and trying to hard to copy games that do it better. I still only have half an idea of what the hell I did in the game, and what stuff meant lol. Buy Dishonored instead, it does better at being a thief game than this.			"

												I played some of the original Thief game prior to playing this one. At first I disliked the old one, (the graphics and weird keybinds put me off) but I came to really like it. This game isn't the same. The stealth is meh, I haven't figured out how to fight since I don't have a sword, at least not yet; I just mash the melee button and hit them with a blackjack until they die. The freerunning in actually pretty smooth. A bit too simple, but smooth. Except you rarely get to do more than a few seconds of it at a time due to the cramped level design and constant cutscenes. Really though. I swear this thing is half cutscenes, for a story I don't care about. Just let me steal in peace!			"

												Well this was lame.. I had soooo high expectations on this game, i mean the trailer was so awsome, guess i was wrong..In the beginning it was cool but later on, same stuff over and over again, nothing new, you litterly just doing the same thing over and over again through the whole game. The story, i mean wtf, in the beginning it was totally ok but then not even half-through the game it began to be lame.As for the gameplay it also seemed totally okay after i changed everything since they obviously can't make normal and easy controls, but then again, later on it was so boring, a few things to do and lots of bugs.The whole game map was a complete failure, it disappeared every time you go to ""loading site"" or load/quickload a save.Also there is no telling where to get into to other zones, you have to like climb into a window that looks like a normal house just to get there, very hard to find and incredibly stupied structure for a map to begin with.Lots of bugs and no logic and bad game-structure. I can't believe some people actually paid 50€ for this, it isn't even worth the price it has now. 12€ (the price i bought it) was okay price for this game. 4/10.			"

												Its one of those games you play, and its fun, but you spend the entire game trying to follow/figure out what is going on with the plot. Then, once you come to the end scene credits you find yourself asking, ""what just happened?"". Kind of like Talladega NIghts, you watch the entire movie waiting for Will Ferrell to wake up from a dream, waiting for the real movie to start, next thing you know it's over.

												I own every game of the Thief-series, I loved the first 3 and would put Thief 1 and 2 in my all time favorites list. But Thief 4 was such a horrible dissapointment that I felt the need to write a review for the first time, and warn others. If you have any love for the old Thief games I suggest you avoid this like the plague. The game felt as if they had removed everything that I liked about the series with surgical precision. The game reminded me of Call of Duty way too often in it's casual, linear and clichéd way. Dishonored and Amnesia: dark descent gave me more ""nostalgic thief feeling"" than this game did. I miss the freedom to explore, I miss the little details that made the game-world come alive for me in the old games, I don't like the cutscenes and I don't like the way Garret's character changed (or should I say ""was removed"", because what's left of him is so generic and lame that the old and the new Garret have little more in common than their name). I even preferred the sounddesign and ambiance in the old games. It just felt more real and the musical action cues in Thief 4 seem so out of place. When I take down an enemy with the blackjack I don't need to hear the music freak out every... single... time.... It breaks immersion more than it helps in my opinion.I have been playing the old Thief 1 when I got too frustrated with the newest installment of the series and I have to say I just have more fun with it. The gameplay is way better and more rewarding in my opinion. All the added mechanics in Thief 4 just make it feel more artificial and contrived to me. Never did I have the feeling of being in a world that I could explore or that any of my decisions mattered. Also Thief 1 on the easiest setting is in my opinion for the most part harder than Thief 4 on hardest setting. One bossfight in Thief 4 was incredibly unfair and hard though, to the point where it felt like a bad joke. I don't judge Thief 1 and 2 just from nostalgic memory, I still play such games to this day. I just picked up where I left my second playthrough of Thief 1 and I played Thief 2 again just a few years ago. I give the game credit though for coming up with what I think might be the most cliché and cheezy bad guy character that I have ever seen. From the name, to his appearance and dialogue this is pure B-Movie trash and I said out loud ""are you kidding me?"" multiple times throughout the game. If you have not played Dishonored yet you should buy that. It really is better in every conceivable way! If you liked the old Thief games, chances are you will hate this one as much as I do. I don't know whom I could recommend this to. I wouldn't even play it only for the stories sake, because it's just as bad as everything else.Unlike other old franchises like Tomb Raider and Deus Ex that recently got very decent new titles added to their legacy, this one should have better stayed in the shadows...TL;DRwow, such b*llsh*t, very disappoint!P.S.: It says I played for ~17 hours, that's thankfully not the case. The game was more like 12-13 hours including retries, the other time I had alt-tabbed and it kept tracking.			"

												Extremely buggy - dumbed-down game. The sound can be very disorientating with voices 'jumping' through walls and sounding like the NPC is next to you. Terrible. Jumping is contextual - you can't jump wherever you want. Takes away from the Thief feel and loses immersion.I'm only halfway through and not sure whether to bother completing it.Think I'm going to go back to Skyrim instead; which is what Thief should have been aimg to be as good as...Very disappointed in Thief.Was expecting much better considering it's from Eidos Montreal - I just hope they keep the Thief development team away from the next Deus Ex game - we don't want any of them ruining that!They might have sold a lot of copies but that just means that theirs sales pitch was good, or that lots of people wanted to give it a chance - it does not mean that the actual product is any good.It isn't.

												I think the devs know they ♥♥♥♥ed up. But this still sold like hotcakes so I wonder if they'll be smart enough to make a better sequel closer akin to the orginals, or make another ♥♥♥♥ up for a cash grab?Hopefully they'll listen to the fans instead of acting like modish idiots. ""This isn't 1998 anymore"" was one of the arguments these childish devs used when criticized for their choices in how the game was made.Guess what? I didn't play the Thief games untill May-June 2010 and I loved them to death, you're gonna tell me because it isn't the late 90's that I wouldn't, or many others wouldn't enjoy a game with classic game mechanics?Still despite all this crap, I still enjoyed the game, it was fun to play. Only on Custom Master with everything checked except disabled manual/quick saves (that's just not fun) to make the game more enjoyable.			"

												Go buy Thief 2. Or, if you want graphics, Thief 3. Thief 4 is basically a copy of Thief 3, only narrower and scripted;Below I'll show an example of what I mean, but besides that:Buggy game -- guard can suddenly spin around;Constantly repeated dialogue - and only ONE - which is annoying as hell;HORRIBLE sound balance, use headphones because even simple 2.0 sound system will be furiously unbalanced;Character development down the drain; I'm not comparing this game with old Thief  games right now, even by its own merit this is Dishonored meets Batman but with less style and scope;Stealing does not feel satisfying _at all_ _WHATSOEVER_. Constant points of no return within small levels and constant loading screens; THe game couldn't be more restrictive on how you do things.And now for the level design comparing:SPOILERS (!!!!!)For instance, in the asylum level in Thief 3 suspens was rising. First there was noone there but eerie atmosphere and possibility of guards caused you to sneak; Then, sudden ghost of a girl creeped you out, but she was friendly. And then step by step asylum became a horror-fest in the end denying you the way out itself; It was HORRIFYING.Now Asylum in Thief 4: Scripted crows fly out. Door opens by itself and then slams shut. A jump scare from a woman who's supposed to be dead; She tells you you sholdn't be here when she pointed towards this place earlier;SUBTLETY.In conclusion: go buy thief 3; or wait until this game is -75%or just pirate it! it is a Thief game after all ;)			"

												There are many problems with the game but let me starte with what i hated about it. How it couldn't run on a computer that was above the required graphics card level so all of the textures and graphic and resolution were turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥mode. There were also many other things that i found strange for a game that i paid about $60 for as in some of the cut scenes at the end had no sound and the judgment at the end of missions was always wrong especially at the end, only one 'thing' died and it was a creature who died by a fire that was pre lit. The first boss encounter was nearly impossible to sneak by but i defeated him by using a stupid method that suprisingly worked, by knocking him out with the gas arrows then pelting him with the explosive ones (He could take more of them than i could, and he took them to the face while i took the flames from it hitting me from the side and even then two of those would kill me). Some of the mechanics were good like the stealth mostly and the looting but if i tried to cancel going through a window i couldn't, i had to finnish going through the window and then go back through. So basicly tell me when the patches actually work and the developers actually do something and then i will consider re-installing the game again.			"

This sequal to the cult classic takes the stealth element and throws it out the window, allowing you to go through every level guns blazing regardless of difficulty. There is no atmosphere, no character, and most of the time I rooted for the villan simply because he had a funny moustache. If you want the true Thief feel, play Dishonoured.			"

												This game would have been a solid 6.5/10 had it come out under it's own label. As a completely independant game with the freedom to create new ideas it may have even been a good game. However you cannot escape the inalienable fact that this is a sequel to Thief: The Dark Project and the subsequent games, therefore it should be a continuation of the story in the same narrative universe. This game fails to make use of the source material in any meaningful way. It is almost like the development team were given just the name Thief as the title, Garret as the protagonist and Basso as the fence and told to make a game about stealing stuff in early industrial revolution generic grey steampunk city. Maybe they didn't get usage rights for anything else, because thats what it feels like. Garrets character is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised from the word go. Gone is the aloof, cynical, selfish, anti-hero that only acts on other people behalf when it suits him, when there is no other option, or for revenge. Instead we are given a flat boring character that essentially denounces all of Garrets traits that the first game made us painstakingly aware of. All within the tutorial. What ever happened to 'I only work alone'. Adding to that the Keepers taught Garret to be invisible in a crowd in order to document history, but not interfere. Garret corrupted the teachings by using them  to be a stealthy thief. But in this game everyone seems to know who you are, even the 'Thief-Take General' (*rolls eyes). If the original Garret was in this situation, he would have just left. Why take unessisary risks.The original games were setup as an unrestricted world puzzle where you felt that your own ingenuity, quick(slow) action and sensory feedback  allowed you to complete missions with a smug sense of statisfaction. This game is an pre-determined obstacle course for the player, complete with '90's sidescroller loot-that is impossible to get untill you know how-and has no earthly reason for being there'. There are points in the game where you try and not follow the pre-determined path because it is too risky, only to find it is the only way. Usually leading to a forced action cut scene where.... YOU GET CAUGHT.... In a game called... Thief. This doesn't just happen once, but all the time, followed by hell being raised as you try to scramble and escape along a new pre-determined path. I know that game designers need to up the ante, but this is just cliche at this point.All in all this game would have been great as a prequel. Garret having freshly left the Keepers in order to persue a life of burglary of the wealthy and undeserving for his own gain. Working with people he initially trusts, who then betray him or die on the job. Hell... they could have even kept the main story elements intact. Maybe then we could have seen where Garrets dark personality came from in the first game and why he is behaving like such a noob in this one. But unfortunatly the games story line is irrevocably terrible.Ultimatly game play and graphics are slightly above average. The inability to even try pay lip service to the original brings it down to a 4/10. Don't bother. Go play the originals. If you can't stand bad graphics get the story arc of Youtube.What is with the obsession with The Claw!! Seriously I had Jim Carrey in my head every time they said it.Edit: A note for Steven Gallagher. Head Narrative Director. Garret is not against killing 'without thought or good reason', he's not a conscientious assasin. Garret's rationale is that killing is messy, noisy and gets you caught. Again, would have been fine under it's own brand. The game probably would not have tanked.			"

												Забагованная до ужаса: рассинхрон речи с анимацией, постоянные фризы. Графика на вышке то очень не очень, боюсь представить что там на минималке, лица и мимка не многим лучше Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004). Даже пререндер и тот страшненький.Сюжет скучен, высосан из пальца. Персонажи не запоминаются, нет у них ни характера, ни личности, ни мотивации.Геймплей прикольный первую первую пару часов. Уровни - пара параллельных коридоров и ответвление с бомжом-торговцем. Учитывая, что у Гаррета есть gps, а стражей обдурить проще простого (а можно просто у них за спиной пройти в тесном коридоре), прохождение - изи-бризи. Ghost стелс местами слишком замороченный, а Opportunist всегда слишком простой. В 3 их 8 уровнях мне не получилось получить Ghost исключительно из-за забагованный стражей, которые стояли на месте и теребели свой меч/арбалет, а не патрулировали местность, как им и положено.Ассортимент оружия такой не нужен вообще, из него используется веревочная, водная, да тупая стрела. Апгрейды вообще бессмысленные. К середине игры забиваешь на исследование уровней и собирание лута, т.к. тратить награбленное не на что.Короче, первые полтора часа думаешь ""о, круто"". Потом все эти одинковые сценки с окнами и баррикадами приедаются (особенно, учитывая, что они тормозят), все ловушки и головоломки решаются с помощью глаза. И оказывается, что это все, что есть в игре, больше ничего не будет, тебе еще 8 часов делать все то же самое, один в один.Ну и да, улицы пустые, на повешенье приходит 2 человека.			"

How it couldn't run on a computer that was above the required graphics card level so all of the textures and graphic and resolution were turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥mode. There were also many other things that i found strange for a game that i paid about $60 for as in some of the cut scenes at the end had no sound and the judgment at the end of missions was always wrong especially at the end, only one 'thing' died and it was a creature who died by a fire that was pre lit. The first boss encounter was nearly impossible to sneak by but i defeated him by using a stupid method that suprisingly worked, by knocking him out with the gas arrows then pelting him with the explosive ones (He could take more of them than i could, and he took them to the face while i took the flames from it hitting me from the side and even then two of those would kill me). Some of the mechanics were good like the stealth mostly and the looting but if i tried to cancel going through a window i couldn't, i had to finnish going through the window and then go back through. So basicly tell me when the patches actually work and the developers actually do something and then i will consider re-installing the game again.			"

												This is a disgrace to be called Thief. Maybe I had too high expectations because of the great universe of the old Thief games. Where are the Pagans, Mages, the Machinists, Hammerites? If this a reboot, why is Garrett's eye glass/metal?Bad PC port, bad optimalisation, staggering gameplay, constant loading screens (not so nextgen, isn't it?) It's 5.1 surround, but the sound system is completly f**d up: one step forward and can hear a conversations at full volume, one step backwards and cannot hear a thing. This is also an issue with footsteps, so it's pretty hard to be a master thief. Also, play it on master difficulty, if you want anything that is one bit close to the old (and good) gameplay.All in all: Dishonored is a better Thief game then this...			"

												What's yours, is mine... Not a bad game, just does nothing to expand on the original gameplay layed out from Thief 1 and 2. Nice atmosphere, gameplay, graphics and animations. I dont know why people bash this game so much honestly. Sure it's not like the old Thief games, but in it's own right, this game is pretty good.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but this game warrants one:  UGH!Do you like navigating the same nonsensical maze over and over again, evading the same guards again and again?  Then this game is for you!  You have that to look forward to after you get the game to actually run smoothly for you anyway.I've spent a number of hours with this game so far... and it's managed to boil the worst moments of the original series down into core gameplay.  I'm actually amazed.  I'm constantly frustrated by core mechanics... it's trying to be un-fun.			"

												The take sassy loveable garret from the last two installment and turn him into batman, and not in a good way. This sequal to the cult classic takes the stealth element and throws it out the window, allowing you to go through every level guns blazing regardless of difficulty. There is no atmosphere, no character, and most of the time I rooted for the villan simply because he had a funny moustache. If you want the true Thief feel, play Dishonoured.			"

												This was my first Thief game, honestly, and so this review will be only about this game and none of the others in the series that came before it. It was pretty terrible. Graphics were great, but storyline was absolute trash. There are some good levels, but it's lacking in something... more. Again, storyline was terrible. It kinda ruined the good parts for me, really.			"

												This game would have been a solid 6.5/10 had it come out under it's own label. As a completely independant game with the freedom to create new ideas it may have even been a good game. However you cannot escape the inalienable fact that this is a sequel to Thief: The Dark Project and the subsequent games, therefore it should be a continuation of the story in the same narrative universe. This game fails to make use of the source material in any meaningful way. It is almost like the development team were given just the name Thief as the title, Garret as the protagonist and Basso as the fence and told to make a game about stealing stuff in early industrial revolution generic grey steampunk city. Maybe they didn't get usage rights for anything else, because thats what it feels like. Garrets character is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised from the word go. Gone is the aloof, cynical, selfish, anti-hero that only acts on other people behalf when it suits him, when there is no other option, or for revenge. Instead we are given a flat boring character that essentially denounces all of Garrets traits that the first game made us painstakingly aware of. All within the tutorial. What ever happened to 'I only work alone'. Adding to that the Keepers taught Garret to be invisible in a crowd in order to document history, but not interfere. Garret corrupted the teachings by using them  to be a stealthy thief. But in this game everyone seems to know who you are, even the 'Thief-Take General' (*rolls eyes). If the original Garret was in this situation, he would have just left. Why take unessisary risks.The original games were setup as an unrestricted world puzzle where you felt that your own ingenuity, quick(slow) action and sensory feedback  allowed you to complete missions with a smug sense of statisfaction. This game is an pre-determined obstacle course for the player, complete with '90's sidescroller loot-that is impossible to get untill you know how-and has no earthly reason for being there'. There are points in the game where you try and not follow the pre-determined path because it is too risky, only to find it is the only way. Usually leading to a forced action cut scene where.... YOU GET CAUGHT.... In a game called... Thief. This doesn't just happen once, but all the time, followed by hell being raised as you try to scramble and escape along a new pre-determined path. I know that game designers need to up the ante, but this is just cliche at this point.All in all this game would have been great as a prequel. Garret having freshly left the Keepers in order to persue a life of burglary of the wealthy and undeserving for his own gain. Working with people he initially trusts, who then betray him or die on the job. Hell... they could have even kept the main story elements intact. Maybe then we could have seen where Garrets dark personality came from in the first game and why he is behaving like such a noob in this one. But unfortunatly the games story line is irrevocably terrible.Ultimatly game play and graphics are slightly above average. The inability to even try pay lip service to the original brings it down to a 4/10. Don't bother. Go play the originals. If you can't stand bad graphics get the story arc of Youtube.What is with the obsession with The Claw!! Seriously I had Jim Carrey in my head every time they said it.Edit: A note for Steven Gallagher. Head Narrative Director. Garret is not against killing 'without thought or good reason', he's not a conscientious assasin. Garret's rationale is that killing is messy, noisy and gets you caught. Again, would have been fine under it's own brand. The game probably would not have tanked.			"

												So, I just finished Thief, in about 39 hours, or so Steam claims. So anyway, I wanna throw out my thoughts on the game.First of all, I am a fan of the old thief games. They were the first stealth games I'd ever played and it was just great going around stealing things and not killing anyone for a change. I will be making comparisons with the old games, but keep in mind my memory might be hazy and blinded by nostalgia.Overall, I was neither deeply impressed nor disappointed in this reboot. It was alirght.The Writing: The overall story just wasn't very interesting to me. It has some plot twists, but they seem borrowed from Thief: The Dark Project in some way. I think the original Thief series had much better writing, from Garret's backstory, to the setting - the three factions Garret has to deal with, manipulating the fate of the world in various ways and Garret always getting into trouble with them, getting mixed up in some crazy plot. The whole steampunk technology versus supernatural elements the original series has going is just really awesome.While both the original series and the reboot's stories might be simplified to ""A loner's journey through a society where powerful factions struggle for power"", the new Thief just wasn't that interesting to me as the older games. I guess it's a matter of details.That's not to say that there weren't some cool aspects to the writing/story. I did enjoy the mysterious gloomy atmosphere. There are also some spooky elements which I enjoyed. I did enjoy Garret himself as a character too.The Gameplay:I found the new lockpicking mechanic enjoyable. There's plenty of exploration and loot to find, lots of documents to read too which is really cool if you enjoy hunting around for backstory (in fact, some of the details you find in writing are a lot cooler than the main story itself). The sneaking is also solid. The guards react properly to distractions, not just going towards where you threw something but also searching around and even coming after you if they saw where the projectile came from. They alert other guards too if they are too startled and then it gets really tough to escape if you're anywhere near them. They also relight fires if they see them go out, so you can't just water arrow everything and have an easy time sneakingi around.However, there are some unwelcomed changes and additions...First of all, the rope arrow - where before you could fire it into wooden surfaces, now you can only use it on predetermined spots. One might think that in both cases you're still only using the rope arrow where the developer intended. However, there's just no denning that the old rope arrow mechanics offered more freedom. Thus you feelt like the path you made through levels was your own, you could feel proud of your solutions. Now, instead of crafting your path through the level, it feels more like you're just oppening different kind of doors all the time. You want to get into a room and you start looking at your options: I can picklock the door, or disable some trapping mechanism so I can get through the window, or use the wrench to open the basement grating, or if I have a rope arrow I can unlock the path through the second story window. I'm not saying that navigating the levels isn't fun, but it just feels like these are all toggle switches. You do this to open your path. Yay. How exciting. After a while it just becomes routine.Then there's a couple of silly action sequences. I don't want to run around on rooftops being chased by what have you. I want to sneak around all the time and never get spotted. That's why I'm playing a Thief game and not Mirror's Edge. (Although even I have to admit, there is one action sequence which looked cool the first time I saw it - but that's about it. It still felt out of place in a Thief game.)There are some stupid QTE mechanics too, though thankfuly not many. When oppening windows for some reason you have to mash the Use key. And when passing through narrow corridors you also have to mash the Use key. Why? What's the point of this? It doesn't make the game any more exciting, it doesn't add any level of challenge, it's just annoying. Even more annoying, there are sections where Window opening and Narrow corridor crawling are used to load new areas, and in these sections you don't have to mash the Use key - why couldn't they let you not mash the Use key in all the other times?!...While there are plenty of annoying things about the gameplay, luckily exploring around for loot, picking locks and avoding guards was entertaining enough for me.Other stuff:While I didn't play much of the challenge modes yet, I must say I do enjoy them a lot. In fact, they might be more enjoyable than the rest of the game.Also, the custom difficulty options are really cool. It's really cool that they let you customize your experience like that. I played on a custom Master dificulty with penalties for killing or alerting anyone, and also with focus abilities disabled because I wanted to play a thief not some magic eyes wizzard.Annoying Bugs I encountered:The sound sometimes buggered out, people ending up saying the same linie twice at the same time. (Edit: I mean, an NPC would literally say the same thing ""with two voices"" with a 1-2 second delay in between the two.)Quicksaving seemed to bug out guard patrol routes sometimes.In addition, the game sometimes started dropping frames like crazy, going down from my average of 40-60 fps to what felt like under 10 - just stuttering all the time until I restarted it. This seemed to happen in the hub world after loading too many new areas or something.Conclusions:So yea, overall I don't think it's anywhere near as good a game as the original thief games were in their time. Although, as I said, nostalgia might be clouding my memories. All things considered, while I did focus here more on the negative aspects of the game, it was still a solid experience for me - it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be, but not as disappointing as I feared it might be either.If you haven't played a Thief game before but enjoy stealth, you might enjoy it. If you played the old Thief games, well, you might not think as much of it as a newcomer, but if you keep an open mind you might still find it enjoyable like I did.So I guess I would recommend it, preferably at a discount. Unless the full price isn't that big of a deal for you.			"

												If you are, as myself, a fan of the original thief games (1&2) you will be somewhat dissapointed by the reboot.No open-ended levels in the story. While the city and the miniquests are nice, the story quests are pretty much one path possible, with silly cutscene-like moments added for cinematic effect.All in all solid gameplay, but the story is a let down and the design is just... wrong.

												When I wasn't following the generic save the world story line I found little to do within the ten or so streets I could explore until I was forced to listen as a brick explained the inner workings of clay to me. When that brick finished I was puzzled to find myself forced into some kind of side quest which funny enough involved walls made of clay. With my new instructions I began following the linear road to a door upon which I found a small object on a table. I grabbed it, handed it back to the fine chap of a brick. I did that about another nine times, got bored and played Dying Light with a few friends.10/10 would listen to horrible voice acting while playing an obnoxiously linear game designed by Eidos which in turn is owned by Square Enix. Oh wait didn't Square Enix recently try a horrible pre-order system the likes of which EA shed tears of pure joy and jerked off furiously to the idea of extorting money from idiots who pre-order games?Remember kids before buying games like these, please become a donor incase you suffer an aneurysm and suffocate in a pool of mountain dew.

												Oh boy its remake time again. Remakes are always a dangerous thing I guess. Very often a remake is trying to be something completly new and so it is too far away from the original. On the other hand, if a remake does nothing new it does raise the question why you should make a remake if you did change nothing?This review is probably not very positive and some people will probably say something like: Hey you just had wrong expectations!While I will say something about the whole expectations thing later, let us just look at the plain facts.Let us start with the most obvious thing, how does thief look? Well it does look pretty well if you ask me. Well of course it is not the most colorful game, but hey it is a about sneaking in a dark city with steampunk elements. Thief is actually pretty good at this task. The city does look nice and so I can clearly say that thief is a good looking game.However trouble is easy to find, or in that case easy to hear. The sound of the game is pretty much underwhelming in all aspects. While the voice actors are okay (not great and not terrible) I do miss the old voice actor of garret. However there is more trouble ahead. The entire soundscape is underwhelming and is often schockingly silent. The attempt at a dynamic music system ranges between annoying and broken and I have to say it has been a long time since I actually actively hated the ingame music of a game.Well sound and graphics are obviously not everything so what about the gameplay and the story? Sadly those two departments show the biggest flaws. Gameplay is pretty linear and often not very interesting, of course there are some alternative routes here or there but they are neither elegant or interesting. While you can roam around the city and do some sidemissions you always feel how limited your routes and by that your options are. It does not help that the enemy AI is pretty stupid and that the guards are awful at their job. So gameplay wise the game is pretty linear and not really challenging. Of course you can raise the difficult in the settings and customize a lot of things, but that does no really make the gameplay itself more interesting and fun.The story of Thief is also sadly pretty boring and dull. Beside that it is full of logic holes. I dont expect a story to make 100% sense and of course there are things in a story that happen because the story must go somewhere. However a a story most have its own logic and if things stop making sense inside that logic, then you have problems getting engaged in a fictional story. So much about a look about what I would call the facts. Thief is not a terrible game, I think games with a big budget can hardly be completly terrible, but just having a big budget mean you produce a ace game. Thief is far from being a ace game. I spoke about expectations earlier and this game wants to be a thief game. The problem is that in nearly no aspect it is one. It may sound a bit extreme but this game could have been released under a completly different title and some people would only call it a part time rip off of the original thief.Can I recommend this game? Well not really. This game claim to be something that is is not and beside that it is only a average game.			"

Mediocre game with a nostalgic titleFirstly, I'd like to say that I am no hardcore fan of the series, although I truly enjoyed Thief 3, despite its flaws. This iteration in the series is much more polished in terms of visuals (textures, models, especially animations), but far inferior story- and gameplay-wise and has a few bugs - not game-breaking, but still noticeable (I'll elaborate below). The game itself is really linear (apart from the mission hub), which stands in striking contrast to the previous games. The main character isn't memorable. Non-guard NPCs are basically placeholders - after they say their lines they walk around in silence, acknowledging Garrett's presence just by looking at him (take his appearance into account). If you block their path they simply try to walk through you with obviously poor results. To enter most interiors or to get through to another area, you have to mash the 'use' button repeatedly, to let the game load the data I suppose. Why, though? The repeated animation is useless and annoying. To me, this would be of no importance, if the core gameplay met the expectations. I played on Master difficulty (hardest) with additional crutches to enjoy the game better, but the guards were still broken. The key part of a stealth game is broken. That's unacceptable. Let me develop this topic:Guards' flaws:1. Most game-breaking bug: they stop following their normal patrol routes. I simply don't know how, but I've read that saving/loading may cause this. If the guard has a pause on his patrol route, he may somehow refuse to resume his patrol. I've noticed that many times, sometimes it helped me, but mostly it annoyed me, cause I tried to play ghost and be unnoticed at all times, even avoiding taking them down with the blackjack. That would be possible if they had their scripts/AI written well. Sometimes saving/loading again fixed this issue, but not always. This should not happen in such a big-budget game.2. Blind as hell until they acknowledge you, then they are perfect at seeing you from thrice the distance, from which you'd be unnoticed had they been not alarmed, even if looking straight at you.3. 5-second memory - if you get caught, they will go after you, but once you disappear from their sight for a couple seconds, they stand in one place, looking around or go back to their patrol routes, being mildly alarmed. After some time, they simply forget any threat was around there. Hiding in a one-entrance room was never that easy.4. Fighting - I know it's a stealth game, but bear with me - if you get into a fight with a single guard armed with a sword (not a crossbow), it's stupidly easy to avoid every hit he aims at you. The time-window to press the dodge key is so big that anyone is able to avoid each and every attack with just a single click of a button. After each attack the guard recovers his strength for a second or two and attacks again. It's so pointless. In a stealth game it should be very hard to survive a fight.5. Sleeping guards are a joke - they wake up from a bad step in glass or a failed lockpicking try (sure, I suppose Garrett makes such noise when he misses a pin), but ignore a fight two metres away, even with the other guard shouting. What?!6. Some guards are looking at loot to steal on their patrol routes, yet refuse to acknowledge the fact that at some point in time it has been stolen and they are looking at an empty counter. Come on, really?Given that the game is meant to be a reboot, a fresh start of the series, a step in the right direction, a demo of what's to come, I am afraid that's the last Thief for me. Pretty graphics on the outside, but the insides are far below expectations of a modern stealth game. Fools' gold. And this game came out AFTER Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Dishonored...			"

												I never played the original Thief games so I felt like this was a decent entry to the series. Overall, I enjoyed the game quite a lot. I thought the mechanics were good, thieving abilities were satisfying, and it was challenging enough to require some thought but not so much that it became a chore. I worked to actively complete achievements and discover all the bits I could, and just got the DLC so I'll give it a re-install to play through that too.It doesn't seem like it would be highly replayable, but I wasn't expecting it to be.

												I have tried to 'get into' this game, but I just can't. There doesn't really seem to be anything in it that's particularly engaging.On the stealth aspect, it's OK. You sneak about, avoiding enemies. You can distract them. Oh, and remember to collect random candle holders, you are a thief after all. The story seems Ok. Thje graphics look ok, but seem to be locked to a low framerate. Overall the game just seems okay, there's not really that much that stands out. And from this, nothing that really makes me want to keep playing it.			"

												Just one of those games where you get lost and explore around. When you take your time and see what's there, you always find something interesting. Even the random conversations were interesting to listen. Some were funny, and some were focused on the story, which made me feel more attached to the story. It's hard to explain, and here's so much more to say... But I ain't gonna make a huge review about it. Just, play the god damn game already!			"

												Very disappointing ""reboot"".   The game is very banal and dull, and doesn't even have a tiny bit of the atmosphere and immersion that made the originals so wonderful.What's good:- Fantastic visuals and animations.- Barely okay gameplayWhat's bad:-- All the supernatural elements have been completely gutted from the universe, leaving it as bland and dull as any other generic medieval type atmosphere.- Can't jump where you want.  Only can jump at specific handholding points- Too much ""gameplay cutscenes""   For example when you knock out a guard, you are locked into a 5 second first person cutcsene of him gently lowering the guard to the ground while his allies pound into you.   I understand this type of silliness is a child of the consolitis mindset and it makes sense that this game was made for consoles. - Idiotic story that made no sense at all in any way.  The story fails you pull you in, interest you, or even give you any sort of compulsion to follow it.   Compared to the horrific compelling work of art that was in the original two games this is complete garbage.  I even read wikis on what it was all about and I'm still scratching my head going ""Huh? This is stupid.""   I uninstaleld the game after the second last plot mission.  The story was so dull I couldn't be bothered playing through the finale, I just watched the ending on youtube and it was as stupid and illogical as I knew it would turn out to be.- Too much ""drawer simulator"" going on.  Rather than having all the loot sitting around the real world, much of it is inside drawers that you have to open and close [again those lovely minicutscenes that once you start you're stuck til it's over]- AI is worthless. It's either godlike oversensitive, or completely and totally unaware of your obvious presence. No Balance.Didn't feel like Thief.  Isn't Thief.   Felt like the whole game was phoned in and thrown together.			"

												Thief is what I'd call a good game that was squandered by bad decisions. I, personally, found myself enjoying most of the game, but even then, I could see where it went right and where it went wrong. The relative non-linearity of the levels that encourages exploration: Good. The immersiveness of your character with simple things such as hands and feet, putting you into the shoes of Garrett: Good (great, for an immersion nut like myself). The phenominal graphics that breath life to what you would assume is a horribly dark and dank and dirty place with nothing else to offer: Good. But then you have the ""bad"" side of things. You have the port issues, with stuttery FPS in the hub areas. You have the inability to jump (for whatever reason), resulting in awkward moments, falls, and deaths that could rival those found in Assassin's Creed. You have the simplification of mechanics, a prime example of which being the rope arrow. What was once a creative way to both open up a level is now little more than a scripted event, or something that might as well be. And here's my biggest gripe: the fact that the player's actions can directly go against Garrett as a character. And in the most ridiculous sense, too. Early on in the game (and I suppose this is a spoiler, so...) Garrett and Erin — his trusty sidekick — have themselves a little game of ""I bet I can steal more!"" and shortly after they meet up again, Erin scoffs at his take. Garrett, the Master Thief himself, then replies ""It's not about how much you steal, but what you steal"" and she adds, ""and how you steal it."" And that's perfectly fine; a thrillseeker thief archetype who steals things of worth? That's kinda neat! ""But hold on a second, I was just stealing forks and knives to sell for a pitiful one gold coin..."" Yeah, kinda absurd, if you ask me. It's like Niko in GTA4 mourning about how he had to kill in the war, then gunning everyone down between missions. Garrett boasts about how it doesn't matter if you go around scrounging up tiny mathoms no one wants, then goes around doing exactly that. This is a problem not only because it goes against the narrative, but it devalues Garrett as a character. He's no longer the professional stealing to survive like he was in the old games, nor is he a thief stealing to both survive and because he has some thrill for the rush of it all. He's just a kleptomaniac, out to rob all of ""The City"" of their common household utensils. What an♥♥♥♥♥ right? Easy fix to this would be to just make it so that you can rob people of their knives, forks, and spoons. There are plenty of actual trinkets, medals, busts, and collectables to pick up — stash a few more of those into the wardrobes, drawers, and cupboards, and we've got a nice and easy compromise... Unless Eidos was trying to make their ""Master Thief"" a kleptomaniac. :|Anyway, I'm bad at ending essays and anything utilizing one or more paragraphs, so... tl;dr Thief was a fun time, though it's hindered by quite a few issues that, while relatively small, are very apparent in the game and level design. The biggest of which (in my opinion) being a problem in the narrative... Which most might not even give a damn about. I still recommend it, though. I like the new voice actor better than the old one (don't kill me, pls), the graphics are stellar, the immersion is stellar, and if you can look through some of its issues and past the fog of nostalgia, it's not a bad game at all.In terms of a score (for ease of use), we could say it's an 8/10 who slipped, fell, and landed on the 6.5/10 step.I'm eager to see what they do with the second game, when they inevitably release a second one.

												I'm not gonna make some long post of pros and cons, nobody really cares. I will say this thought, it's horrible and it will NEVER stand the test of time, 10 years time Thief 1/2 will still be a good game to play through if bored.Instead of trying to revive one of the best game series, they milked out as much money from old fans as possible and ran off.

												Sometimes it's best to stick to what the fans love about the originality of a game. The new Thief is a clear example of this and as a big fan of the Thief series.. it saddens me to say although the graphics are awesome the gameplay itself it confusing, buggy, crappy storyline and very unoriginal. It is complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Waste of my money and a regrettable buy. I eagerly awaited this game and I would've preferred they stuck to the original storyline and cast.Complete waste of time, maybe I may be nice and try to give it another shot but I much prefer a remastered version of the originals than this crap.+1 Disappointed loyal fan. Make a better Thief.			"

												I can't run this game in Normal graphics setting smoothly, which I could run Skyrim and TERA Online in Ultra graphics with a Display of 1680x1050 with atleast 60fps.  This game the max fps I can run it at is 15fps if even that much on normal setting.  I have dumbed my graphics down to very low and even my display setting just to accomodate this game and it was very disappointing.  I'm thinking there is a memory leak somewhere in the game or it just has not been optimized yet.  Also, I dunno if anyone else had a problem with this, but I couldn't drop of a rope when I was looking down and hitting space bar.  It's really crazy.  Probably some bugs scattered all around.  I would suggest this game if someone has a lot of money to burn on a super graphically enhanced computer similar to xbox one or something to that extent, I dunno.  It's disappointing to me that I should be able to run this smoothly and was proven wrong.  Buyers beware.			"

												The newest Thief game can be compared to a reboot/remake of a beloved Hollywood franchise. It's nowhere near as good as the originals, but it's not terrible, and it's updated.I've played Thief for roughly 7 hours, the city sucks to travel through and the map is completely horrible and there is never a clear direction. Thief shines when you're in a mission through a building or house, and stealing things under someones nose is really rewarding. Outsmarting guards never gets old either. So if you're a fan of stealth games, than Thief is a no brainer. But if you're fairly new to the genre, play Dishonored as it is a much more polished, fun, rewarding and realized experience. In my opinion Dishonored did Thief better than the new Thief did.I hope there is some kind of fast travel option implemented into Thief, because if I have to traverse through that map every time I need to get somewhere far away I'm simply going to stop playing, it's that bad.

												Eidos Montreal had all the experience they needed for developing Thief through the making of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Although the new Thief was a bit harder to create since the last game of the series was released in 2004 and they had to keep the new game's atmosphere as close to the older ones as possible.Starting with the story it's not what you will remember after you have finished Thief. You will be expecting most of the plot twists and towards the end the story seems a bit far fetched. The City is divided in different areas or districts. The problem is that those districts are divided into smaller areas as well so there are frequent loading screens. Also the city offers an illusion of an open-world environment but the truth is that you can't go everywhere you want to. But even in a smaller area there are many paths you can follow to your destination whether it is on the rooftops or the roads.The biggest problem of the game is it's AI. It may be easy for enemies to spot you but it is really easy to escape and hide. Just hiding in some shadows or climbing on a roof does the trick. Also their reactions to noises, torches of fires going off or when finding bodies are really bad. They may look around for a while and then go on with their patrols as if nothing happened.Leaving the games problems behind, the stealth mechanisms are really great. Garrett has a lot of tools and his trusted bow at his disposal which he can use to avoid his enemies or dispose of them. The City is filled with loot to steal and a lot of them (especially unique loot and collectibles) are really hard to find so that offers a good challenge. You will have to find safe combinations, secret passages behind bookcases and items hidden behind paintings. Sneaking around the city and searching every corner and every house for loot is really fun.If it's hard for you to find loot you can use the Focus ability which highlights objects you can take or use and enemies. The thing is that Focus makes the game a lot easier so try to avoid using it as much as you can. Garret's abilities can be upgraded by buying (or findind) Focus points and you can also buy new tools or equipment upgrades from merchants around the city. The game's graphics are great. Especially the character's faces which are really epxressive. The animations are smooth. As for the music, it gets a little annoying at times. For example when you are trying to sneak around somewhere and you hear music pounding in your ears. The voice-acting is good as well with Garrett's voice standing out.If the bad AI is not a really big problem for you then Thief can give you a really great time. There are a lot of secrets to discover and finding them using Thief's stealth mechanincs is a real pleasure.75%			"

												(At the time that this review is released, I will have NOT beaten Thief yet. I may change my feelings/opinions on it as I progress the game)Thief is a good game for any of you stealth gaming enthusiasts.Although it's story is NOT very interactive, and you don't get the same sort of emotion you would get if you played any games such as, The Walking Dead by Telltale, it is still an overall good game.In a graphic perspective, the game itself is very nice when it comes down to details, shadows, and lighting, but other than that the gameplay feels at points either too jumpy, or too slow paced. At some areas it feels like you have no idea what is going on, and you just want to 'beat' the chapter.As of playing this game, I can't help but feel the way I did when I first tried to get into the game, 'Dishonored'. I kept feeling like I couldn't comprehend what was happening no matter how much the story progressed, and in the end I just got tired of it and had to stop playing it. Thief feels relatively similar to Dishonored's gameplay, but are not nearly the same in a matter of combat, or storyline. The stealth in Thief, which is what is made out to be it's ""core gameplay mechanic"", works very well if you try to play as a thief who must hide in the shadows and stay hidden. This can make the game feel VERY slow after a while, and eventually I gave up on hiding, as it proved useless when no guards where around. In the aftermath of all that, this game does have some pretty bad AI. The AI which ussually consists of guards or at some points, just average townspeople, which seem to have a pretty mental way of thinking. If you throw a bottle directly at them, they either start getting confused, or walk in the complete opposite direction of where the sound percieved of the bottle smashing was heard. You may be thinking at this point, why am I not stating any real positive outlooks on Thief? Well, that is simply because their isn't many. Like I stated either this game more or less a lighting showcase with some stealth and parkour.After defeating the first Chapter/Tutorial stage, you seem to notice a severe lack of things you could steal. At this point, it's more or less a parkour simulator with a few confusing stories and characters that I just don't seem to get attached to, or relate to at all. In fact, as of playing this game the only emotion I have felt is anger towards the AI for somehow not being able to spot you less than 2 inches away, while standing INFRONT of them... If your one of those people who want to look for a cool game that has action, ""parkour"" or stunts, and an interactive story, than this game is not for you. However, if you are looking for a linear game that focuses on one main topic and task, than this game is for you.Overall, I would say this game would get 6.5. Although I put a some-what negative look on Thief, this game could be fun for anyone who may have enjoyed games such as, Dishonored and Metal Gear Solid, and I would recommend it to any new-commers to stealthy gaming industry. However, if you are a fan of the original Thief series, and not this decently okay reboot, then I suggest not getting this game. Although I have never played any of the original Thief games, I have heard from many fans of them that this game misses out on some of the key elements used in the original games, which leads many original fans to dislike the way this games story and gameplay was delievered. Well that is it for my review of the game Thief, I hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you were wondering whether or not you wanetd to purchase this game I hope I helped you in making that decision.--Kv321 (Part of the E3D Network) "

												This review is in progress and will be publicly uploaded when Ive finished. Finished review below.I can't play the game - after trying and trying I had to give up due to the non-mappable controls and my physical limitatrions. It seems a good game, so I'm going to give it a recommended. But my original review still stands. Its a console port, and it shows. If you (like me) absolutely need mappable controls for whatever reason, you won't like this - and I cant recommend it in that case.DEVS- MAKE THE CONTROLLER MAPPABLE. THIS IS NOT A FREAKING CONSOLE._______________________________________________________________________________Note: I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as hell whenever a dev (especially an AAA dev) is too lazy to include controller mapping in their PC games. Ive posted and wrote about this many times before. I hate to have to beat the dead horse again, but - TO ALL DEVS: For people with limited use of some of their fingers or hand(s) mappable controllers can be the difference between being able to enjoy a game and walking away in frustration. Thats the reason why a lot of people with physical issues play PC instead of consoles, the extreme customizability of inputs. For you to not take the extra time to make the controller maps customizable is just stupid. Now I have to go spend time screwing with JoytoKey/all the other key-to-controller progs and that never works as well as native controller support and is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not going to let it influence my review because for most people its a minor issue, but if you are like me and need the customizability of a fully mappable controller, you might take this into consideration.

												The game has gotten a lot of flak I feel it doesn't deserve. If you go in expecting something like Thief : The Dark Project or The Metal Age, you'll be dissapointed. If you go in with an open mind though, you may be surprised. The story is a mess and the audio bugs (STILL unpatched) are annoying, but the actual stealth gameplay is top notch, and you WANT to stealth everything. As a game about thieving, it succeeds quite well.			"

												Depending on how you like to play, Thief is either a quick sprint to the finish that will test your reflexes and make you think on your feet or a grueling marathon that will require all your powers of deduction, observation, and a walkthrough or two to complete. Grabbing all the achievements in Thief took me about 47 hours total over the course of a few playthroughs, even with help finding the seven secret areas I overlooked.Taking on the role of the eponymous main character you'll have to make your way through the city you call home, old forgotten ruins beneath it, a mental institution on the other side of the river, and even your own mind. Parts of Thief play like something directly out of a horror game and manage to do it better than most games that make horror their focus. Speaking of Garrett, the man's got a great sense of humor. His zippy one-liners never disappoint.The art direction in Thief is drab, but appropriate. The game is set in an authoritarian citystate on the verge of societal collapse. The colors of any given scene are gray and brown, with a bit of blue and white thrown in for lighting. Interspersed with the dull scenery are carefully placed spots of shadow that you'll need to take advantage of if you want to remain unseen and/or not die, and thousands of shinies you'll need to collect if you want to complete the game.One final note on appearances: I've never liked the ""steampunk"" aesthetic, so watching the grungy patchwork technology in some parts of the game fall to pieces the way it would in the real world brought me no small amount of secret vindictive pleasure.While each chapter is fairly linear there are usually multiple ways of progressing and different ways of approaching each situation. Very rarely does the main game restrict your options- if you want to muscle your way past the guards and take what you're after by force, you usually can if you're good enough with your blackjack. Just don't try that with the Freaks in the lower levels of the old city; it won't end well. You can also replay each chapter to try something different by revisiting the chapter's starting location. You will need to memorize them or look them up, though, they're not marked on your map.I was a little disappointed that there were only two boss fights in the game. I know not every chapter of a game should have a final encounter, but only two? There's so much you can do with stealth games like this one to build entertaining showdowns so Thief loses a few points here by my reckoning. A word of caution about the final boss... on the hardest difficulty possible (custom settings only, I think) the final boss is a game of breakneck hide-and-seek where being found means you die. Instantly. I'm never doing that again and if achievements are your cup of tea I wish you luck. Hint: move clockwise.Flaws notwithstanding, Thief would make a great Christmas gift- nothing says ""holiday spirit"" like breaking into other people's homes, taking their things, and dispensing wanton vandalism and violence along the way. Deck the halls.			"

												Not the best in the series (not that it actually IS in the series), plot much worse than previous games, demanding engine and no undead! However, the stealing abilities are well designed, very difficult sneaking in many situations - demands quick thinking, some good missions (the psychiatric hospital for instance). Even as a fan of the series I was dissapointed - but overall game is fun and not boring even after long sessions. Still, I recommend to wait for a sale.			"

												It's okay.I haven't played the originals so as a newcomer I enjoyed it for what it is. It's quite atmospheric and has cool moments.The stealth is pretty basic and simple, nothing to go crazy about. The story also isn't great, the characters aren't well written and fairly forgettable. The Thief-Taker general had potential but never really got much character development.Has technical problems such as well known audio problems. The framerate drops sharply during cutscenes too, thankfully I didn't get any drops during gameplay but still, it breaks the immersion.Overall, pick it up on sale if you're a fan of atmospheric games. Don't have huge expectations and you'll enjoy it.			"

												I personally found this game brilliant. I'd recommend it to most people, because of the variety of methods of going about the game. It doesn't matter if you're a sneaky thief who doesn't even knock anyone out, who is never even known to be there. Or if you're the more violent thief who kills everything in sight and is feared by the contending factions.Gameplay - 8/10 Well, this can be a bit of a controversial subject, I thought the story was fairly good (about a 6/10) but the other gameplay (I.E sidemissions) also offer a chance for a different type of fun). Graphics - 8/10 The graphics are pretty good. sometimes you get a slight drop in frame rate (I did, but all the settings were set to absolute max, and I'm playing on a laptop.Sound - 7/10 The sound is pretty good, better in combat scenarios, however you have a good ambiance created through everything combined, which results in a decent atmosphere to coincide with the game play.Overall - 7.5/10. I enjoyed this game, there are several options to make the game harder, including in mission challenges and other fun things. Should take about 13 hours to complete everything on medium difficulty, and 15 on the hardest. Recommended. 10/10 would steal everything from a person and then knock them out again.			"

												Thief, a stealth based composed of multiple settings and scenes that conflict in the point of interest for the player. Thief's time is set to be in both medieval / modern century with electricity and fire with alot of sword play. This game will keep you on your toes most of the time and has an interest in horror. Characters and AI: You are Garret, the master thief, king of rats. Master of stealth and loves to steal things. Yet you have a heart for the city in which you live in, making your actions duable in the sence that you are the good guy.Eren: A young woman who partners up with Garret and ♥♥♥♥s everything up in the begining.AI: The AI are ok and someare scary, never the less they have a specific pattern in which they move and can't seem to see♥♥♥♥♥♥in the dark unless they are really close.The game is very detailed to the biggest of buildings to the finest crack in a piece of wood. It looks beautiful. But it's always dark. This game also likes to jump around in the story, linking things from the past to the future, which is really cool and all, but lacks interest and a sence of excitement. Only a few scenes in the game were actually really good, but other than that it's a very slow game. After a few missions, instead of sneaking passed the gaurd, you start to kill them in glorious fashions, reducing the amount of time, but killing the experience and atmousphere. Combat and movement: The moevment is fine the there are issues with the combat and climbing. When it comes to seriously climbing stough, the character can't seem to do what you want him to do even though the objective is right infront of you. It's frustrating. And the combat sucks, whenever you dodge, you get hit, making it even more frustrating. So for those who want to play this game, make sure you have a good computer! This game will lag alot if you don't and get ready to take things slow, don't rush them.			"

												I would recommend this game, but only to those who did not play the previous games in the series.First I will discuss the pros of this game.  This game is mostly about sneaking carefully from place to place, stealing everything of value you can lay your hands on, and this game does a good job of ramping up the tension when you risk detection.  The sense of atmosphere this game creates is strong, but very different from its predecessors.  For those more accustomed to action games, there are a few more active scenes in which you must make a hasty escape, but fighting is usually not an option.  The game has an almost movie-like style to it, although this is very common in commercially produced games.  There are plenty of unique, collectible treasures to gather, which you can keep and admire after returning to your hideout, and a lot of secrets to find.  The focus ability is useful, not only enhancing your abilities for a time, but also making it easier to navigate and spot important objects, such as traps, switches and ropes.Now we come to the cons.  For fans of the previous games, Thief is likely to be something of a disapointment.  Many of the fantasy elements of the game have been removed.  Hammerites and Pagans are nowhere to be seen, although some signs of their former presence can be seen here and there.  Elemental crystals are no longer used on Garret's arrows and have been replaced with mechanical or alchemical alternatives.  Rope arrows can now only be used in very specific locations, as they can no longer lodge in the scenery.  Even the word ""taffer"" has fallen out of common use among the city people, replaced with more familiar swear words.  Although this is probably meant to give the game a more mature style, it actually has the opposite effect and makes the characters seem somewhat juvenile.The cinematic style of the game, as I have already noted, is very similar to most other modern games and doesn't really seem to fit.  The hand-drawn animations of the previous games are gone.  Even the upgrade system is somewhat generic and seems like a half-hearted attempt to imitate other games.  The storyline is also very different in style to the previous games.  While not exactly bad, it often attempts to depict Garret as vulnerable and insecure, as if to draw attention to his softer side.  Although some may find this intriguing, I thought it seemed somewhat contrived.  The game's ending is abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends, giving the impression that the final cinematic was abandoned half-finished.All in all, this is a decent stealth game in its own right, but for fans of the previous instalments, like myself, Thief marks the death of the series and the beginning of a long line of dull, generic, mass-produced sequels.  If you love stealth games, treasure hunting and a strong dark atmosphere, this game is for you.  However, if you liked the previous games, avoid it.  Unless you are prepared for the drastic change in style, this game will leave you feeling empty and unfulfilled.			"

												Not a great game. It gives you the illusion of ""open world"" but it couldn't be more of a lie. There is basically one way to get through each level. It feels much to rigid to be fun. Thanks for getting another Thief game out there, but the developers should have put a little more time into the gameplay.			"

												This is a flawed gem of a game, but in my own opinion one with more positives than negatives.Tight controls, detailed environments, and atmosphere you could cut with a knife, sadly held back by a rather weak story.It also sadly but understandably, buckles a bit under the shear weight of the legacy it is trying to uphold, but as a fan of the old series I enjoyed this one. Ones experience aside with the old Thief series, this is one of those real 'love it, or hate it' type deals, and although I recommend this game for any fans of stealth, I would still argue you to if possible, try the game first before investing in your own copy.I personally found it interesting and neat in a way that reinforces that Garath (the main character) is actually a physical presence in the world... but for the record I’ve heard a lot of people that find the frequent, if short, animations were he opens and picks up things, to be utterly infuriating. Just to name one example on the ‘love, hate’ thing.In short, I would recommend this for stealth fans, and fans of the Thief series; the later if with the caveat and warning of the game being quite different from the rest of the series.For all others: For good or ill, this really feels like a larceny simulator with a fantasy twist. If that sounds interesting to you, you might enjoy it, but Gareth is very, very weak, and even a single guard may kill you if you are unprepared.Unlike this studious previous outing, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, combat is usually not an equal option unless you are really good at it, or spend a lot of money, time and upgrades on making it so; something that will eat up resources that could have been much better spent elsewhere.So if you have some patience this can be a very rewarding game you will lose dozen if not hundreds of hours to... but gamers aimed more at the action side of things need not apply.

												(At the time that this review is released, I will have NOT beaten Thief yet. I may change my feelings/opinions on it as I progress the game)Thief is a good game for any of you stealth gaming enthusiasts.Although it's story is NOT very interactive, and you don't get the same sort of emotion you would get if you played any games such as, The Walking Dead by Telltale, it is still an overall good game.In a graphic perspective, the game itself is very nice when it comes down to details, shadows, and lighting, but other than that the gameplay feels at points either too jumpy, or too slow paced. At some areas it feels like you have no idea what is going on, and you just want to 'beat' the chapter.As of playing this game, I can't help but feel the way I did when I first tried to get into the game, 'Dishonored'. I kept feeling like I couldn't comprehend what was happening no matter how much the story progressed, and in the end I just got tired of it and had to stop playing it. Thief feels relatively similar to Dishonored's gameplay, but are not nearly the same in a matter of combat, or storyline. The stealth in Thief, which is what is made out to be it's ""core gameplay mechanic"", works very well if you try to play as a thief who must hide in the shadows and stay hidden. This can make the game feel VERY slow after a while, and eventually I gave up on hiding, as it proved useless when no guards where around. In the aftermath of all that, this game does have some pretty bad AI. The AI which ussually consists of guards or at some points, just average townspeople, which seem to have a pretty mental way of thinking. If you throw a bottle directly at them, they either start getting confused, or walk in the complete opposite direction of where the sound percieved of the bottle smashing was heard. You may be thinking at this point, why am I not stating any real positive outlooks on Thief? Well, that is simply because their isn't many. Like I stated either this game more or less a lighting showcase with some stealth and parkour.After defeating the first Chapter/Tutorial stage, you seem to notice a severe lack of things you could steal. At this point, it's more or less a parkour simulator with a few confusing stories and characters that I just don't seem to get attached to, or relate to at all. In fact, as of playing this game the only emotion I have felt is anger towards the AI for somehow not being able to spot you less than 2 inches away, while standing INFRONT of them... If your one of those people who want to look for a cool game that has action, ""parkour"" or stunts, and an interactive story, than this game is not for you. However, if you are looking for a linear game that focuses on one main topic and task, than this game is for you.Overall, I would say this game would get 6.5. Although I put a some-what negative look on Thief, this game could be fun for anyone who may have enjoyed games such as, Dishonored and Metal Gear Solid, and I would recommend it to any new-commers to stealthy gaming industry. However, if you are a fan of the original Thief series, and not this decently okay reboot, then I suggest not getting this game. Although I have never played any of the original Thief games, I have heard from many fans of them that this game misses out on some of the key elements used in the original games, which leads many original fans to dislike the way this games story and gameplay was delievered. Well that is it for my review of the game Thief, I hope you enjoyed reading this, and if you were wondering whether or not you wanetd to purchase this game I hope I helped you in making that decision.--Kv321 (Part of the E3D Network) "

												I had heard some things about this game before I got it. I heard some good things and some bad things, but the majority of the things I heard made this game sound more mediocre and disappointing than anything. Many people played this game expecting to get the original Thief game, which caused disappointment for them. I haven't gotten around to playing the original Thief games, so I can't make the comparison, but I wouldn't say that this game is bad. In fact, I actually found it to be quite good. Sure it has it's issues, but I definitely got my money's worth considering I bought it on sale for just over $10, put in 50+ hours and felt thoroughly entertained throughout the game.Story:The game begins as you take on the role of Garrett, a thief-for-hire as he is in pursuit of the Primal Stone, a gem that his contact Basso has asked of him to acquire. Garrett is joined by Erin, his young and naïve apprentice. Garrett and Erin are on their way to Baron Northcrest's manor in hopes of stealing the stone. When they arrive on the roof of the manor and gaze through the rooftop window, they see Baron Northcrest performing some sort of ritual with the stone. Feeling uneasy, Garrett calls off the job. Erin objects and a brief altercation ensues before Erin falls through the glass window and into the ritual. As Garrett jumps through the roof in an attempt to save her, a part of the building collapses onto him and knocks him unconscious. Garrett awakens one year later to find the city is plagued by The Gloom, a plague that causes it's victims to hear voices and kill themselves. Garrett himself has started to have visions of Erin and learns that she may still be alive. Garrett is now in pursuit of finding her. Meanwhile, Orion, one of Garrett's new clients is leading a rebellion against the Baron and Garrett is stuck in the middle of it all.Gameplay:The gameplay can be really addictive and immersive. It's so fun hiding, sneaking around and collecting loot. You can spend your loot on upgrades for Garrett's abilities and weapons. The game is fairly big. At times, I felt overwhelmed at how much there was to explore as I'm a completionist and want to get as much out of the game as possible and explore every corner of every map. I would describe this game as pseudo-open-world. The game is centered around The City, which is divided into different districts. You can roam The City as you please if you're not in the middle of a chapter. You'll come across a loading screen when you go from one district to another. In order to progress through the story, you'll have to complete the main story chapters. The story chapters are a bit more linear. Each main story chapter is found in different parts of The City and will be replayable once you complete them by revisiting their respective areas. I guess you could compare this game's open-worldness to Super Mario 64. In Super Mario 64, you could roam throughout the castle and access each level by jumping through the paintings. This is kind of like that, except The City is much larger and has more to do. On top of the main story, there are side missions to do and different collectibles to find, which are displayed in Garrett's hideout for you to admire when you're not in the middle of a chapter. There are three different playstyles in the game – Ghost, Opportunist and Predator. You can play the game trying to remain completely undetected and unseen under the ghost playstyle, use the environment to distract enemies and get what you need under the opportunist playstyle or knockout anyone in your way under the predator playstyle. There are various thieving challenges to complete depending on which playstyle you choose. The Negatives:I've come across a couple of glitches in this game. I've noticed the AI spinning in circles at high speeds or just standing there without moving to the point where you could literally walk through them as if they didn't even exist. I've also noticed points in the game where Garrett would get stuck in a corner and I'd have to reload my most recent save so I could continue playing. This could be frustrating at times and made me glad that I saved the game as often as I did. Granted, these glitches weren't incredibly frequent, but they did happen on more than one occasion. Also, Garrett doesn't have the strongest character. The stoic voice acting is fitting, yet makes him come across as rather dull. I didn't think it was bad, but I just thought he could have used a bit more charm. There are some people that complain about the story. I wouldn't call it bad, but it wasn't anything groundbreaking either. It was decent and was enough to keep my interest. My problem was the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll just say that it left me with the same feeling of confusion that Bioshock Infinite's ending did. Perhaps some people like that sort of thing, but I wasn't a huge fan of it or the confusion it left me with. I mentioned the game's size earlier and how overwhelming it felt at times. I meant that in a good way. However, the downside to that is the map navigation. Navigating the map in the linear chapter missions were fine, but navigating The City could be very confusing if you didn't remember how to get from one district to another. As much as I love freeroaming The City, it  can feel very clunky and easy to get lost in even if you're using the map.Conclusion:Overall, if you like stealth games, I'd recommend picking this one up when it's on sale. While there are people like me who enjoy the game, there are many who don't. I think it depends on each person individually and what it is they expect from the game. If you haven't played a Thief game before or if you're able to put your personal bias for the older games in the series aside and treat this as it's own entity, I think you'll find it has a lot of content to offer for the sale price to keep you busy and entertained.

In short: 7/10 - Recommended to patient, stealth-obsessed gamers not looking for a great story.For a good challenge, turn off all UI and hints, make use of the great custom difficulty settings (no weapons, no KOs allowed, no damage allowed, etc.), and play non-lethal ghost style.  This makes for a much more immersive and intense experience.  Move slowly; allow yourself some time to learn to navigate the city.  The map is not extremely helpful (seemingly an intentional choice), and those short on patience may quickly become frustrated attempting to find side missions, in particular.Level design is not brilliant, but it is not 100% linear, either.  Contrary to the beliefs of those who rushed through, there are multiple paths to most objectives, but those paths may take a bit of exploration to discover.  That said, the game would certainly benefit from a more open, expansive touch, as being met with repeated denial upon attempted door, window, and ledge traversal is not exactly fun.  ""Uh oh!  That guard may spot me.  Better scurry up this ledge...nope, game designers didn't want me to scurry up that ledge.  Loading quicksave...""  Also, loading screens when crawling through windows?  Let's nix that from the next game, please.Dialogue mixing is terrible.  The localization of voices is so poor it seems unfinished (voices through a wall often sound like they're six inches from your ear), and vocal levels are all over the place (dialogue buried to the point of unintelligibility during some cut scenes).  Also, the extreme repetition of guard dialogue is inexcusable for a AAA game.  Pure laziness.  I laughed really hard when the Golden Joysticks Awards nominated Thief for Best Audio.  Anyhow, all other aspects of audio fare much better.  General atmosphere is certainly strong and enjoyable in its dark ambience.Stealth mechanics are good, and sneaking around, distracting guards with bottles, navigating around noise-prone caged birds and dogs, creating shadow with water arrows, finding and disabling traps, and pick-pocketing are among the simple joys Thief presents.  The game truly shines when theft is the sole focus (this isn't always the case).  Do not skip the side missions, as they offer some of the best thieving and stealth opportunities.  AI is fair and as relaxed or challenging as the difficulty selected.  Failure always feels like your own fault rather than, ""How'd that guard just see through a wall?!""  That said, you are underpowered against guards as an incentive to remain stealthy.The story is something to skip through on subsequent replays.  As the supernatural stuff creeps in, you may find yourself saying, ""But...I just want to be a thief and sneak around and steal things.""  Or not.  This certainly depends on your expectations, or lack there-of, from a game titled ""Thief"".  With that said, the Outlast-style level, out-of-left-field and non-Thief as it may be, is genuinely creepy.Replay value is high, particularly for obsessive completionists and speed-run attemptees.  The game does make this unnecessarily difficult in that each mission must be found in the city in order to replay, and none of these are marked on the map, so those short on time may spend the entirety of that time searching.  This may be a fun extra challenge for those with lots of time, patience, and practice navigating the city, but the additional option to quickly select and replay levels would certainly be welcome.Comparison time...many compare Thief to Dishonored.  Both are basically first person stealth.  Dishonored is clearly the better game as far as level design and story.  But for me, Thief is stronger in the shadow/darkness department, and I actually much prefer sneaking and being stealthy in Thief.  Though I opt to play Dishonored non-lethal, no KOs, and without ""blink"", I almost feel like the game would be more fun if played the opposite way.  How about Styx: Master of Shadows?  It's a fantastic hardcore stealth game with insane level design (but lower visual production values), and a clear winner as long as third person floats your boat.  If I found a game with the dark atmosphere of Thief, the art direction of Dishonored, and the level design of Styx, I wouldn't play anything else.			"

												First impression: Not total garbage. I'm surprised! You and I both expected me to flat-out dislike this game because I'm a long-time fan of the franchise, didn't we? But it really is not total crap.As far as I'm concerned, all references to ""classic Thief"" elements such as the Hammerite symbol, the Keeper statuette, Garrett's mechanical eye, guards mentioning the word ""taffer, etc., they are all just nods and easter eggs paying homage to the original trilogy. There's some clumsy attempts to dovetail the rebooted universe with the old but it's too nonsensical to take seriously. And why use the name Basso for new-Garrett's fence? Why not use Cutty? Old-Basso was just a boxman (expert lockpicker).The city hub makes a return in Thief 4. I know some people who didn't mind it in Thief 3, but I know *nobody* who LIKED it. Its reuse here only served to pad gameplay time with tedious walking back and forth. Thief 2's ""Life Of the Party"" mission had Garrett traversing the city rooftops from his home all the way to Angelwatch. In that single mission alone, the world-building achieved by the things you witness and the conversations you overhear on the way to the actual mission area gave that Thief-universe more heart and soul than this entire game did for its own universe. I'll never forget the pejorative 'taffer' or the battle between the guards of Lady van Vernon's house and Master Willey's castle. A few weeks from now all I'll remember about Thief 4 is ""sloop"" and ""Garrett, I'm slipping!""Analogy time: This game is about as classic Thief as the movie ""World War Z"" was a faithful adaptation of the book, i.e. not even a little bit. Now, now, this is a reboot, sure, sure. I'm already accounting for that and I'm still making this statement! The thing they've created here does not inherit enough Thief-y essence to rightfully call itself a reimagination of the original intellectual property. This game and that movie should have no right to affiliate themselves with those respective IPs. The only reason they have each done so is because their creators did not have faith in their products to stand alone on their own merits.			"

												Beautiful, this game is just beautiful, the PC Port is fonominal, the lighting effects were better then real life. This may be the only game other then octodad where i have practically fell in love with the storyline. The cutscenes were really nicely done, props to the voice actors, their voices were just so realistic and it really managed to get you into the story. You really feel like your inside of the game, stealing, hiding from guards, knocking random people out with aerial takedowns. This is my favourite game to ever be released on the steam store. Also I only had it since last night (9th March) and I already played more then 12 and a half hours. You can tell i like this game.The only negative I have is the texutre of windows, they look a bit, how you would say, smudgy and it kind of looks like something you would make in nursery.Other then that brilliant game! 9.5/10			"

												I never played the original Thief (even though I own it) so this review is about this version alone.The + recomemndation is based on buying this on sale for under $15.Is it fun? Mostly. I can get bored doing stealth so at least headshots are an option when you get frustrated. Mostly I found myself doing a mixture of the three techniques to get through the game. The story is fine but I didn't find myself caring about any of the characters.+ Pretty nice looking.+ Quite a few ways to complete levels.+ Missions are fairly well designed.+ Weapons are interesting (if a bit limited).- Loading levels is slow even on SSD- Stuttering framerates when levels first open.- Stealing very tedious and generally pointless (Master Thief opening draws for ink bottles??)- Silly how AI can't see you half the time in the shadows.- Too hard to get some of the acheivements.- Monster levels are annoying.- It's in England - so why are all the main v/o characters American?

												Thief mixes really excellent gameplay with really terrible story telling, and in that sense it's pretty classic. The whole story feels very cobbled together, and none of it comes together very well, however it's a blast to play through for die hard stealth fans. The world is wonderfully put together with a large variety of environment puzzles to sneak through. There are many approaches to almost every situation. There are a few points in the game where you get bottlenecked into a single solution and they feel pretty glaring when you reach them because of how large the variety of options is almost everywhere else, but these moments are few and far between and many players may not even notice them.Over all, Thief is a solid entry into the series if you value gameplay over story telling. However if you feel that the characterization and story telling of the series to date has been your primary motivation for playing, then you may want to give this one a pass.			"

												This is a very very pretty game. The story is pretty good too, and the puzzles in the mission are pretty fun. The sneaking and trying not to be seen is challenging at times and the gameplay is very smooth and fun. Overall a great game.			"

												As i played through the game i had to constantly remind myself ""dont worry, it will get better, it was worth 50 dollars"" and it never did. There was to much customization for to little gameplay. I could be expecting to much and i probably would have had a better experience if i hadent played dishonored first but after all this is a stealth game and it will eventually be compared to dishonored. The only reason i continued was for the story line which didnt even make all that much sense, i thought this was going to be more like games prior to this but i didnt seem like it was.			"

												This game wanted to be Thief. Its developers wanted it to be Thief. I wanted it to be Thief. Unfortunately, it is not Thief. It is a game that wishes it could hang out with Thief's friends. To those that loved the original game it is not like the original in all the wrong ways, except in the thieving. If you want something more modern that is closer to Thief then play Dishonored otherwise, just play the original ThiefThe good about the game is that the stealing is fun and challenging. The building designs are pretty.The meh about the game is the story. It is truly meh. It didn't really make me want to finish the main story or learn any of the lore that was created for this new game.The bad was first and foremost Garrett. He was a dumb character and looked really stupid when he had his mask pulled down to the edge of his chin. Who does that? In the game it made him look like he had extra chins. I don't mind that they wanted to make him different than the original Garrett, but at least make him interesting. He could have been any character and it wouldn't have changed the story at all.The other bad is that because the story was meh I didn't care about any of the characters that I was supposed to. They could have all died and I would have just looted the corpes and moved on. And that is what I feel they should do with this title.			"

												The city is beyond beautiful but it felt empty and was frustrating to navigate. Its largely dark and rainy atmosphere made it strangely relaxing. Garret's movement (running, sneaking, swooping, vaulting) felt perfectly polished. Bow shots and takedowns felt great; melee combat was just ok...I missed having a blade. The main story was a bit of a mess in my opinion, it seemed to have a lot of holes, left a lot of unanswered questions, and generally was just hard to follow... the writing however I thought was rather good, almost movie-like... only fragmented. The main missions were interesting enough but generally linear, simple, and scripted; a notably different feeling experience from the previous Thief games. Basso's jobs were unfortunately forgettable, very often you'd be tasked to break into someones house to steal something only to arrive there and find no resistance at all; this attributed to the lifeless feeling of the city. Client jobs on the other hand were much more interesting, but the questgivers themselves were often inconveniently located and required the player to constantly backtrack through the labyrinth-like city. Backtracking to the Queen of Beggars and the main merchants similarly felt unnecessarily frustrating. The item and focus upgrade systems I think were commendable ideas but they ultimately felt inconsequential and left my itch for progression unscratched. I missed the Hammerites, Pagans, and Keepers... as The Watch, while cool, didn't feel justly elaborated upon. In truth I had fun with the game, I was impressed with its masterfully polished controls and gorgeous graphics, but the overall gameplay, pace, and story missed their marks and left it forgettable.

												The first thief games were great so I don't know what happened to this one. The story and dialogue was not very good. It had the potential to be a good game, but it ended up very poor. If you want a game similar to this that is actually good, I would try Dishonored.			"

												Being an old-school Thief fan, I was ecstatic to get my hands on this game. I wasn't the biggest fan of Deadly Shadows because of the third-person change so I'm glad they kept it first-person and I really like Garrett's modelling. Very cool. The whole game is very 'Thief-esque' which I'm glad to see and I love the amount of things you can steal, since I'm a human magpie. The graphics are beautiful, the city is dark but when you go inside, there's lots of colour and character in each place you visit. The story is fine, I enjoyed playing it out but the ending felt a little quick and anti-climactic, mostly the last scenes. There are only a few problems that I found with the game, and unfortunately some affect the game quite drastically - especially if you're playing the second time around to get every shiny you missed. Firstly, the mapping system is quite badly done, there's no names at all for any of the areas which is highly frustrating and would have probably made the fact that to get to most areas, you have to jump through people's windows and go through loading screens each time, a LOT less frustrating. It would be nice to know WHERE you are going. They probably would have been better off keeping a similar mapping system to the old Thief, they had labels and also showed you which parts of the level you've been to and which is undiscovered. Another problem is that to replay chapters, you have to find the place where you began that chapter - impossible since there's no labelling and quite a lot of chapters! Also, a minor issue really, but I would have really loved the word 'taffer' to make it back into Thief and maybe make the NPCs say a wider range of lines, they seem to be repeating the same ones over and over and it gets really frustrating. Despite the flaws, it's defintely a must-play, if you keep in mind that a lot of things are different. Including the lack of dagger/sword and a prompted blackjack instead of real-time. I'm not saying they affect the game much, they're just different. THe first-time playthrough is very interesting and I was engrossed in it for days, I enjoyed it that much. I just wouldn't replay it, even though I wanted to, because the mapping system made it a lot less fun than it could have been. As you can tell, I'm writing a mixed review here, which is sad for me since I am a huge fan of the Thief games.			"

												First, an important point: I only recommend buying this game if it's cheap.Once I disabled SSAA from the start-up graphics menu, the game actually became playable on my stupidly high-spec computer and oversized widescreen monitor. I don't understand why a computer that is above and beyond the recommended specs is unable to run this game out-of-the-box. Anyhoo.Once the game got working properly, the graphics are very pretty. I feel that the facial animations were a bit messed up, particularly in cutscenes, but besides that, the game looked nice.The sound mechanics of the game are STUFFED UP. Someone might be two floors below you, with masses of stone separating you from them, yet you hear them like they're right next to you.You're in a silent room. You peep through a keyhole, and you can see a couple people talking. Suddenly, you can hear their voices blaring at you, even though you backed away from the keyhole and (closed) door. Same goes for peeping through a hole in a thick stone wall. At first you can't hear a thing, then after you establish their presence, it's as though they're shouting in the same room with you.Trying to listen in on a conversation? You get close enough to hear a couple of people having a conversation. Except, one of the two people drop out to a barely audible murmur. But the person they're speaking to has their voice blaring as though speaking through a loudspeaker. This problem lead me to enable subtitles, just so I could read what they were saying. But do this, and you will be constantly bombarded with repetitious ""background chatter"" in the city. There were, like, 3 dialogue strings on repeat.The story is abysmal. There are other reviews that go into detail plenty well enough that I won't repeat the problems here.But, if you want a game that isn't a standard shooter, that has some creepy moments, pretty graphics, and lots of random loot to steal, give this game a go IF it's on special.

												This game is definitely very interactive. You can go down three paths: Ghost, Predator, and Opportunists. These are all very different in there own way and you can probably tell which one has and what things you must do to go down that path. You can explore the city and quickly take out guards from behind or arrow shoot them in the face with, one of my favorites, the sawtooth arrow. (Sorry if the name is scrooed up) This game is definitely good for the money and is a great reover the orginal series of this game.

												Well, I haven't played any Thief game before, but I've played Dishonoured. While Dishonoured has got this steampunk atmosphere and you've got 20 ways to behead anyone, I find Thief quite pleasant game. I know there are many reviews claiming ""this is the worst stealth game known to man since forever"", but it depends on what you mean as ""stealth"", if you consider stealth to move around killing people in 20,000 ways, this is not your game, indeed. But if you rather fancy a slow paced game, with a great atmosphere and brilliant reproduction of the City of London, watching an OLED 42"" telly at 23Hz with a glass of wine, this is your game, to be yours for the small fortune of $4.99... your glass of wine is dearer, indeed. And no, this is not ""the worst stealth game known to man"", not even at that price... 9/10 "

												I haven't played the other titles of this franchise game so i went into this with an open mind.  Honestly, i tried to like it.  I really did.  This game seriously is ""go from point A to point B"" on a grossly obvious linear path.  Whats the point of sneaking around if i can't even kill anyone? Maybe i havent got that far yet but, dang...i dont feel like a bad*** thief with supposed super-powers.  I feel this is a rip-off of Dishonored without all the coolness that embodies dishonored. However artistically speaking, this game is pretty gorgeous.  There are upgrades that make your useless abilities slightly better yet not enough where you would actually use them differently.  You can seriously run through this game bashing people in the face with your club and probably don't need to buy a single upgrade.  Im severely disappointed and won't be playing anymore of this.. :-(			"

												PC speccs:EVGA GTX 980 TI SCi7 4790k 4 Ghz Corsair 16gb 1600 Mhz Vengeance.I remember first time playing thief back in early 1990-2000, and falled in love with this game.But is this a game for us veterans or is it for new players?I would say ""It's for both"" and you will figure it out why i think so.Im very happy to say that Thief rebot is a good game.Is it worth a purchase? Yes , If you wanna know more about the game read the following review!First of all , im a veteran of old thief games finished them all on hardestDid finish this on hardest on ps4and now its time to play it on pc In this review i cover the mechanics and suchI will not disscuss the story in this game because its really not worth it. Introduction	For a start this a really good rebot ,Probly the best Thief could ever get , i remember when i was gonna play this and my throat just went berzerk with a throat abscess. So i never got around to play it on pc until now start of 2016 when there is nothing to play on steamSo you start out in a mission to basicly steal items thats really all that thief is and thats why i love thiefthe feeling of ""I was in this XX and stole this XX from these ppl who had atlest 30 guards in the area and they didnt notice me at all.Thats why i just freaking love thief.Gonna point out some Pros and Cons  Pros  The AI is perfect in my opinion (Do not play on hardest if you want releastic guards) Good World/Open world-kind of  Stealth system is perfect! The Difficulty system is really well made Charactars are intressting Main missions have really nice ""Map design"" Side Missions Unique loot Collectible Npc discussion Three different path of gameplay (will talk about it later on in this review) Shadows (You can use shadows to locate where the npc are not many ppl use it) Focus System Clean UI  Lots of looting Shadow Gem (Shwoing when you guards can spot you or not) Upgradable gear (Will talk about this later on)  Lamp Switches (both good and bad depends on you as a person) Arrow Technics (will talk about this later on) Charactars are intressting  Cons  The Voice actors are awefull (Sometimes the voice acting plays twice on npc's not sure why) to small main mission maps   Combat is just awfull Story is awfull Small Size of mission  Map (In my opinion) Bad Hardest Diffuclty ""Sightings by guards""  Difficulty SystemOkay here is why Thief appeal to both veteran players and new players.It makes you make you'r own difficulty, if you wanna remove focus system go on do it.If you wanna have iron man mod go on do it.Its so good well made!CharactarsOkay i will not cover all Characters just cuz it could be spoiler to you!I will only cover the start Characters you find at the start of the game. Garrett The Master Thief Erin City Watch aka Guards Citizens Basso  Barron Voice Actors - Really that awfull?Erin = In my opinion i feelt that her voice actor wasn't ""Commited"" to the role and as a result it didnt go home for me, There is so much i could write about when it comes to thief but i wanna keep it short.Garrett The Master Thief= Im so sad about his new voice actor but still he does a fine jobThe old game had the best voice actor for Garrett the master thief.the new one does the job fine but thats all, some cutscenes are just ""ehm...okay i guess""City Watch = God damn i love those voice actors , some of these city watch are doing the job really really well and as a result i end up listing to the disscusions.Citizens = I am suprised that they managed to get some decent voice actors for this role , i mean its not a requirement to have good voice actors for some random npc that just walk around, maybe talk to some other npc, they make the role really really wellBasso: Im not sure yet what my opinion is yet on this charactar , all i can say is ""He's fine i guess""Barron: This man, this charactar really make the role very very well, Really like it!In some missions where he screams it feelt like he meant it!Some more information: Sometimes when you run around in the city from mission to mission , you maybe find some npc in houses talking about YOU! this made me just smile!thats a plus on my side!

												Pros:Big city to exploreLots of side jobsTons and tons of crap to stealSwoop is fun, lets you pull off riskier actionsGood musicNew types or arrows and upgrades are funBank heist is awesomeCons:Not a fan of the story, needs to be thiefier.Guards are laughably dumb on easy/normal. On master they're better.Guards give up the search too fast.Water arrows aren't that useful anymoreRope arrows are pretty much useless - dont restrict them to only one surface guysLockpicking and picture frame mechacnics too generic, needs difficultyLack of free jumpingFun game if you are an old fan of the series like me. you might gripe about a few things that have changed but overall enjoyable once you turn off the HUD crap and crank up the difficulty. Master mode in this game is like...easy in the original. Would be nice to see the hammerites and pagans make a return in an expansion or something, The graven are just the city watch with a different name. Ive seen a few people say the Asylum is actually scary. Go play the Cradle in deadly shadows.Vets of the series - buy itNewbies - wait for sale "

												I would recommend this game, but only to those who did not play the previous games in the series.First I will discuss the pros of this game.  This game is mostly about sneaking carefully from place to place, stealing everything of value you can lay your hands on, and this game does a good job of ramping up the tension when you risk detection.  The sense of atmosphere this game creates is strong, but very different from its predecessors.  For those more accustomed to action games, there are a few more active scenes in which you must make a hasty escape, but fighting is usually not an option.  The game has an almost movie-like style to it, although this is very common in commercially produced games.  There are plenty of unique, collectible treasures to gather, which you can keep and admire after returning to your hideout, and a lot of secrets to find.  The focus ability is useful, not only enhancing your abilities for a time, but also making it easier to navigate and spot important objects, such as traps, switches and ropes.Now we come to the cons.  For fans of the previous games, Thief is likely to be something of a disapointment.  Many of the fantasy elements of the game have been removed.  Hammerites and Pagans are nowhere to be seen, although some signs of their former presence can be seen here and there.  Elemental crystals are no longer used on Garret's arrows and have been replaced with mechanical or alchemical alternatives.  Rope arrows can now only be used in very specific locations, as they can no longer lodge in the scenery.  Even the word ""taffer"" has fallen out of common use among the city people, replaced with more familiar swear words.  Although this is probably meant to give the game a more mature style, it actually has the opposite effect and makes the characters seem somewhat juvenile.The cinematic style of the game, as I have already noted, is very similar to most other modern games and doesn't really seem to fit.  The hand-drawn animations of the previous games are gone.  Even the upgrade system is somewhat generic and seems like a half-hearted attempt to imitate other games.  The storyline is also very different in style to the previous games.  While not exactly bad, it often attempts to depict Garret as vulnerable and insecure, as if to draw attention to his softer side.  Although some may find this intriguing, I thought it seemed somewhat contrived.  The game's ending is abrupt and leaves a lot of loose ends, giving the impression that the final cinematic was abandoned half-finished.All in all, this is a decent stealth game in its own right, but for fans of the previous instalments, like myself, Thief marks the death of the series and the beginning of a long line of dull, generic, mass-produced sequels.  If you love stealth games, treasure hunting and a strong dark atmosphere, this game is for you.  However, if you liked the previous games, avoid it.  Unless you are prepared for the drastic change in style, this game will leave you feeling empty and unfulfilled.			"

												I personally found this game brilliant. I'd recommend it to most people, because of the variety of methods of going about the game. It doesn't matter if you're a sneaky thief who doesn't even knock anyone out, who is never even known to be there. Or if you're the more violent thief who kills everything in sight and is feared by the contending factions.Gameplay - 8/10 Well, this can be a bit of a controversial subject, I thought the story was fairly good (about a 6/10) but the other gameplay (I.E sidemissions) also offer a chance for a different type of fun). Graphics - 8/10 The graphics are pretty good. sometimes you get a slight drop in frame rate (I did, but all the settings were set to absolute max, and I'm playing on a laptop.Sound - 7/10 The sound is pretty good, better in combat scenarios, however you have a good ambiance created through everything combined, which results in a decent atmosphere to coincide with the game play.Overall - 7.5/10. I enjoyed this game, there are several options to make the game harder, including in mission challenges and other fun things. Should take about 13 hours to complete everything on medium difficulty, and 15 on the hardest. Recommended. 10/10 would steal everything from a person and then knock them out again.			"

												Thief is both one of the best stealth games I've ever played and a game I couldn't wait get rid of.+ Cool Lore: Interesting universe. A sort of alternative dark medieval world with some intriguing magic and beings.+ Lighting manipulation: Light fires or put out torches with flame and water arrows.+ Arrow types: On top of fire and water, use stun arrows, poison gas arrows, or just the normal lethal arrows.+ Smooth moves: Sneak, slide, climb, crawl. Nice parkour-ish skills, fluid movement.+ Feel like a real thief: Pickpocket people, rob small houses or big mansions, run on rooftops, hide in closets.+ No mad rampages: Fighting a single dude face to face is very hard. This is a true stealth game. Sneak or die.- Crap story: Weak protagonist, weak mcguffin, weak side-characters, weak villain.- The ending: The game just ends.- Repetitive: Sneak into place, rob place, return to quest giver, get another job, repeat until story advances, repeat again.- Small, linear hub-world: You always end up running up and down the same few streets getting to and from NPCs and objectives.Without a nice story to keep you going through the repetitive gameplay, it almost falls short of decency, but actually ends up being a pretty good stealth game. Some of the best sneaking around in a game ever... Just beware of the asylum level, you might be led to think you accidentally switched to playing Outlast.Simolius - July 2015			"

												All I can say about this game that is almost perfect!! why almost? the map: all good until you have to load for another part of the city. and the map of the city is quite too small. combat (melee): the melee combat is going through hell, its boring and the mechanism is just poor, and if you fight against 2 enemy or plus you are saying to yourself ""okay, load last save"". If you are a master thief I think you can stand better against guards.texts: its really upset when the AI are saying over and over the same things,talk: I think its can be really cool if you could talk to people and ask for rumors and make a good realationships with them.side quests: If you ask me, the side quests can be much more inetresting if you could take them from citizens too, poor guy that need a statue, lady with a sick infant that need a medical treatment, even bribes guards can make the game way more interesting, just add large amount of side quests and even if you have ended the main plot, you can continue to play for a long time.Now for the good thingsStealth: that mechanism really good!. I just can't find a bad thing about itThe main plot: I can tell you that the main plot are just perfect. its really puts you in the game. Its interesting, its complicated, its scary, and its just perfectcombat (range): The amount of arrows are really enough for you to make a good plan to get your way in, or make an escape, The characters: the characters are just well built, they are interesing and their text are goodstealing, really good, only one thing about it, you can't open all the drawers and the cabinet you want.lockpicking: really good, again you can't picklock all the doorsField of view: One of the most good things about that game its the field of view. You can see evreything and one thing that buys me every time that at last I can see my legs!Graphics: The graphics are really good. Its helps you to get in to the game.So, the game is really almost perfect, and its get you into the game (not many games can do that!).I really recommend that game for players who want to be that Master thief, stealth, stealing, graphics, and a a really good story line, makes that game almost perfect.  from 1 to 10 Ill give that game a 7.5			"

												Thief is a reboot of the classic FPS stealth game series ""Thief"".The medieval/steampunk setting is immersive, thanks to a great shadow usage, skilful design and gloomy colors.The main story is quite short and ""unsalted"" but always great in places and background happenings. The severely intricated city, which is the mission hub, is the soul of the game.Optional client jobs, secondary missions and break-ins are the way to actually feel the thief essence: this is a game to be explored, as every corner can hide a lever or a secret passage, and information gathering is crucial.Game mechanics are not perfectly refined as in Dishonored, and the sound (which is of good quality) is affected by some bugs, but the sense of realism and immersion in the atmosphere of Thief is deep and catching.88/100For a more faithful stealth gaming experience I suggest to switch on the no-kill and no-detection modes, as the game provides unlimited quicksaves.

												I really wanted to like this game, having enjoyed previous Thief titles, but sadly it wasn't to be. Although the game looks great and does play quite well, I never really felt like I was the Master Thief, fleet of foot and all but invisible amongst the shadows. No, for the most part I felt clumsy and lacking the dexterity necessary to remain undetected; ledges and boxes that I'm sure had been reachable and climbable in previous areas, suddenly seemed to become impossible obstacles, for one of such talent, and running, climbing, traversing the rooftops and skulking in shadows never seemed to flow as smoothly as intended.Bothersome game mechanics can often be overlooked for the sake of a good storyline but sadly Thief let me down in this area too. From the intriguing, via the confusing, to the ridiculous, I have been left thinking ""I'm still not sure if I even know what just happened there"".So, why the recommendation? Well, Thief isn't a bad game, and for a fair, low coinage can potentially provide good value hours of distraction for many, even enjoyment for some, just not for me. "

												I heard a lot about the new thief before buying it but thought I should make up my own mind and played it myself.I played about 10 hours to beat the games main storyline including a few sightseeing trips and sidequest. So 50 bucks for 10 hours is not really worth it for me.Why did I recommend it? Scroll down to the bold text. :D-Spoilers up ahead-I like the thief franchise but I would not really put it under that name. Playing the first few chapters you get the feeling this might become an okay game but around the third chapter you kind of start giving up on it. Specially when Zombie/Falmer/Weeper guys start appearing with a super lame and poor explanation of how they came to be.It was really confusing for me since it feld like they didn't quite know what type of game they wanted it to be. Sometimes I felt like it wanted to be a stealth type game then it felt like it wanted to be pure action..suddenly it tries to be a really weird horror game with mentioned above Falmer type creatures that might have been taken from Skyrim. I do know that people who developed Dishonored also worked with Thief before and I don't know if the storylines from both games were created simultaneously but I got to be honest..Thief has Gloom and Dishonored had the rat plagueThief has Freaks and Dishonored had the WeepersThief has the Blind Begger Queen and Dishonored had Granny RagsThief had Erin taken away but guiding you through the world Dishonored had the Empress and later the heartThief takes you to the Primal World in Dishonored you were taken into the VoidThief has the Thief Taker General and Dishonored had Slackjaw - both resembling Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York.Its not always entirely the same in the way they act of function but it is quite close.I have to say I played Dishonored for hours and hours and I could continue doing so but with Thief that is not the case.The chapters were fast, linear and the guards had a really bad AI.Non the less it was an okay game just not worth that amount of money. So I will give it recommendation if you:- Get it when its on sale - and don't expect a game that feels like one of the Thief ones. If you don't expect that and you only pay..let's say 20 bucks.. it's a game you can enjoy for a little bit while you have a few hours time(edit: did some formatting)			"

												Slightly above average OK. The story was more ""fantasy"" than I thought it to be and felt a bit weird in the end (asylum horror, wtf hey?!?). In the beginning of the game I tried to stealth the missions but in the end I just knocked out/killed everything, maybe not so Thief'y.  I dont get to aggro about the simplified stealth system like many do (its a game after all) but the surroundings/levels could be more different in style. Nice gfx although. The sound and speech was OK but sometimes not in level (either too low or too high). Some highs; flight over alduin(sic?) bridge, flight from the architect tower, boss fight with the general and some lows; opening windows (omg annoying!), most side missions (you get so many coins anyway you dont feel the need to compete them)  7/10			"

												This was a tough one for me. As a long running fan of the Thief series I was very excited for this game, and it left me feeling a little mixed. The game seems to take place several years after Deadly Shadows and while that isn't a bad thing, they seem to use it as an excuse to discard a LOT of the Thief series staples...pagans, keepers, hammerites only got the subtlest of nods, nobody uses Taffer anymore, though it is mentioned oddly, elemental crystals are gone for seemingly no reason and Garret isn't quite the cynical anti-hero he originally was; he openly elects to be the hero this time around which is stupid; all to save his new spunky girl sidekick!....it actually hurt me to type that. The plot is ehhh.. at best and they forgot Garret's mechanical eye. Just as weird they went about bringing up a lot of other things..Basso from Thief 2 returns, they even recall his marriage, you actually stumble into Keeper ruins once or twice they even give a nod to insane widow Moira in the form of a chapter Moira's Asylym. In short from a Lore standpoint, they wrecked this game in the most puzzling of manners.Gameplay is another issue however. Disregarding the mauled lore, the game is actually a lot of fun to play. The levels are of good size, not nearly as sprawling as classic Thief levels but certainly a dramatic improvement over Deadly Shadows small spaces, with multiple points of entry and progression such as the game demands. The downside is this game actually features points of no return; which is baffling. A game that is heavily about exploration actually has points where you can't backtrack from....really at a loss for words there other the quick-save is your friend. The City itself is open to exploration again like in Deadly Shadows, but unlike Deadly Shadows it's actually awesome! The City is large, gloomy, tightly-knit with a plethora of doors and windows you can break into, rooftops to explore, and all sorts of hidden nooks and crannies. Inbetween chapters you can pick up simple thief missions that take you around the city to find and steal various trinkets as well as whole, albeit small, individual chapters in the form of client jobs. A nice touch as well is you're able to go back and replay any chapter you just played without needing to load an old save to do so in case you want to try again or missed some loot. They did this aspect at least very well.In the end if you're new to the Thief series and looking to try your hand at stealth games, I imagine you'll find this one a lot of fun. If you're a Thief veteran you'll be very disappointed in the butchering of the lore, almost as if they basically said they don't care, but you'll still find a lot of enjoyment in the gameplay despite it's few hiccups in that regard. It's fun but it's no Metal Age.			"

												If you're a thief fan, you probably already own this game. If you're new to the FPS(tealth) or played a different game in such genre you should play this game too. Just don't compare any other games with this. Here is my forum post about the game ;""...At last, after 29,5 hours of play, i also have managed to finish this awesome game. As a hardcore fan of Thief series, i wanted to share my opinions/experiences about the game shortly. Brief info; i've played all of the series (Thief, Thief Gold, Thief II, Thief 2x-unofficial, lots of fan made missions, Thief 3) in ""expert"" mode and i always play as a ""ghost"".This time i set the dificulty settings to ""master"" and enabled all customs dificulty settings except the save game limitation and iron man. So I didn't use any ""focus"" ability therefor i dont know about them ""yet"". And i will not promote the game, it doesn't need it anyway, i just want to point somethings to - maybe- make this game even more awesome.Pros;Ambience is excellent, most of the times it felt the exact same as the other thief games.Gameplay is excellent, i found this even more controll-able than the other thief games. BUT leaning without ""peek""ing would be more useful.AI is very good, really liked the ""birds/dogs"" addition and npc's reaction to open doors/chests etc. although i'd say excellent as well but there's a flaw mentioned below.Story is almost very good. i really wanted to see some connection between Thief (4) and the older ones (this is a personal choice ofcourse) (but we saw hammerite cathedral right?) Until the end (no, even after we finished) we don't exactly know what has happened to Erin or what has happened to us on that ""The Drop"" night that made us ""sleep"" for a year? And for god's sake did we rescue her or not!? Side quests and little details about almost anything like notes, speeches completely awesome. Scary moments in Chapter 5 were superb!! (i knew someone would look back to us thru that key hole)Cons;After we took an arrow, we play rest of the game ""bandaged"". On my laptop; there s always a string hanging and sometimes it strecthes to somewhere infinitive on my screen (though this is reported) and this adds even more scary-ness to the game sometimes.As a ghost player, some side missions and last 2 chapters are impossible to play as ghost. Because of the custom dificulty settings i've made, i couldn't finish 1 Basso mission (had to ignore the mission). And i could finish the last 2 chapter as ""oportunist"". It would be more awesome if there was another ways to play as ghost.With ""Slow movement speed"" custom difficulty enabled; the mission where we escape Baron's tower became ridiculous. Restarted that ""event"" like 20 times maybe.. If you ""sprint"" then dogs will catch; had to ""swoop"" whole the way which makes you pull out of the mood and then you will be exhausted after 3rd swoop so will be shot by invisible something. I'm really not sure how did i finish that event. RNG i guess.Some speeches of npc's can be heard from some distance. It's normal but some others' , you can hear from anywhere in the map with exact same volume if you were near the npc. Think of a repeatedly said sentece!! Made me hate some maps!Flaw in the AI; 3 times (these are when i felt that i had to; but i wonder if i could do even more) i took something infront of an npc and that one didn't be alarmed because line of sight blocked by glass, vase or something insignificant. Even in the last chapter i did this (stripped a painting from the wall) when stealth crystall bursting light!Swoop/Peek; Sometimes, when i want to get close to -lets say a crate- with swoop and then i peek; birds dont be alarmed.. no problem. When i stop ""peeking"" birds start to sing... normally they should be alarmed when i swoop if i'm in line of sight though.. weird..as a result, i want to thank the team. i've doubts before but after waiting for YEARS for another part of the series, this one hit the spot imo...""

I will be playing through it again for a 2nd time it was fun enough its worth a 2nd playthrough			"

												I've always been a huge Thief fan. It was the first heavy 3D game my brother and I actually saved money to buy a new video card for. It's no surprise that when a new reboot to the original series came out, I had to have it. I was pretty surprised as just how stealth heavy this game really was. With that said, if you don't enjoy slow sneaking, then don't bother with Thief. My playthrough was done with no HUD and almost all the difficulty multipliers. The game features 8 chapters in all with multiple side missions you can accept in between the story levels. The games hub world is compartmentalized into large areas of the aptly name, City. Guards patrol the streets which can hamper travelling from one side to another. The game rewards those that take things slow and study their surroundings. There are plenty of ways to reach the rooftops and rope arrow ""anchor points"" to reach open windows. The game excels when it presents some pretty difficult puzzles blocking the way to hidden loot. I found myself stumped a few times only to find that hidden switch or read a note with clues. Just trying to reach some areas in The City can be a puzzle in itself. The hub world feels like it recieved a lot of love in designing hours and hours of areas to pillage. The audio in this game seems like it was completely undone. NPCs will sometimes trigger audio loops saying the same thing over and over. Had I not had the difficulty cranked up, I would've put an arrow into every annoying NPC that was rambling about coffee or being cold. Some NPCs will also stop in the tracks, seemingly forgetting their programmed walking path. I also found the AI to be a bit unpredictable. Sometimes they would freak the hell out over an unlit torch and other times they were more concerned with how they could smell the river. Birds andd guard dogs will also alert enemies of your presence. The game didn't convey this but if a crow or dog is alerted, then you are considered detected even though you were able to slip away unseen. Overall the guards dont seem to be an improvement over the original series. They'll chase you for a while and then give up. Garrett isn't an exceptional fighter as he only has a blackjack (blunt weapon) to fight with. Unlike the original where he had a sword and later a dagger. The main story line is an overall disappointment. The first half of the game explains very little and it seems like you're solving a full blown mystery. This isn't at all a bad thing. A lot of the original game's story is absorbed simply through gameplay with the cutscenes just setting up the next heist. There were multiple times in the first half of the story where I thought there may be an introduction to the Hammerites, Pagans, or even the zombies of the original series. The story is mostly grounded in reality and goes into a really strange mysticism  route toward the end. It makes the last act of the game so incredibly disappointing that I wish I had stopped playing it at that point. Besides that, many of the levels feel like true, modern successors to the original series. In terms of sneaking and thieving, this game does a lot of things right. Its just a shame the storytelling was lackluster along with a few rough edges in audio design.			"

												The game was a bit difficult because the combat system is not ment for you to run around shooting people with arrows. I believe that multiple systems should of be incorporated so that those who enjoy runing into groups of enemys could of used sepparate mehods to survive, but the storyline was fantastic.			"

												As a new player to the Thief series I have fully enjoyed every moment of playing this game.There is something oddly satisfying about sneaking into places unseen and stealing all you can, and the game offers plenty of extra side quests to scratch that itchI feel some reviews have been slightly unfair towards this game but as somebody who hasen't played the others in the series I won't see things other fans will. You will need a good graphics card to get the full experience of the environment, but overall if you love stealth games you can't really go wrong here.			"

												Worth the time for a discounted price.... 7.5/10If you are into stealth games, Thief might be the game for you.  However, do not be confused in thinking that this game is similar to other popular stealth titles like Splinter Cell, Dishonored, or Hitman.  Thief is a game for stealth purists, that is, the only truly gratifying way to play this game is to remain invisible for the entire time.  Otherwise, Thief is a rather bland experience.While Thief presents a fairly solid all-around stealth title, there are a few things that I would like to point out that contributed to me rating it as low as I did.  There are two major categories for these gripes.  First, are the problems with the storyline and characters.  If you are looking for a Tom Clancy storyline, an epic struggle of good and evil, or a heartpounding journey into darkness for the main character, you are going to be sad you ever bought this game.  Plain and simple, the story sucks balls.  It is extremely bland and underdeveloped.  In contrast to titles like Dishonored which had a very deep and compelling storyline, Thief comes off like corn flakes without milk-- just stale, boring, and hard to swallow.  Add in the terrible voice acting and this feels more and more like one of those Japanese titles that was voiced over poorly and never quite communitcated the storyline that the devs wanted it to deliver.  Still, depsite not caring about the story at all, the game can be quite enjoyable which speaks to the level of difficulty involved in stealing as much loot as possible while remaining completely hidden.The second major flaw is concerning basic game mechanics.  There are several issues here that really ruin the fluidity of the game and cause the player to undergo unnecessarily frustrating moments trying to get the game to do what it should do.  First, the mapping system sucks.  As a quasi-open world title, it is important to have the ability to quickly get the player where they want to be.  Good luck with that.  Each sublevel is designed like a maze with almost no help (other than an objective marker) to guide you.  The map has symbols on it, but there are no legends telling you what each symbol means.  Also, you can have a popup map in the corner of the screen, but it only shows the local area and is relatively useless when trying to traverse from one sub-level to another.  This can mean spending tons of time simply trying to figure out where the hell to go to get to where you need to be.  Annoying.  This game desperately needs a Dishonored type system where an arrow appears and points you in the right direction and allows the player to keep their bearings.  Hopefully this is something they patch in later.Another flawed mechanic, is the way in which some of the windows, doors, and secret passages operate.  Activating some of these doors will instantly push you through them and then close the door behind you in a mini cutscene-like experience.  This can be very frustrating when trying to dodge soldiers looking for you as if you enter the wrong area you are essentially locked out of retreating right away.  Windows and sewer grates often close behind you immidiately after you enter them, which at the very least makes it extremely annoying to go back and forth. Lastly, whenever you pick up special items, there is a mini-cutscene where you cannot move your character.  This is extremely annoying when you are trying to grab an item in a room where enemies are present as you have to account for an extra 4-5 seconds after you retrieve the item because you just stand there looking at it like a schmuck after you pick it up.  All in all, this is a good game but I shouldn't have paid full price for it.  Pick it up for $25 and it will be a good buy if you like stealth.  If not, stay far away.			"

												You know that dark days are ahead when Stephen Russell, the original voice actor for Garrett, is not voicing him in this game, but that is only one of the many problems the reboot to my favorite game series of all time has.I have been a die hard Thief fan for 15 years now. Looking Glass created the most amazing game that never really took off, but had developed a huge cult following. The first two were masterpieces. Sneak, infiltrate in numerous ways, hide, blackjack, steal loot, hide bodies, fight the undead, watch your step, you name it. Reading what goes on during the day in each place that had things to read made it feel like you were immersed in the world. No other game has EVER left me hungry and literally shaking in excitement for more.Thief 3 was a bit of a step down, but it wrapped things up in quite a decent and surprising way. Warren Spector supervised it and many from the Looking Glass staff came to create it. Alas, it wasn't the same as the first two, but it had a charm to it...minus the load zones of course.Then comes in the Thief reboot....where to begin...although graphically decent and polished in the skills of surprise, combat, ingenuity in gadgets, a progression system to help improve yourself as a thief, and a decent city to explore, it cannot make up for the severe woes that plague this game. The plot is fairly decent, as is the voice acting (outside of the lack of Stephen Russell) and the atmosphere is there, dark, foggy, gritty at points, you get the idea. The lockpicking is pretty cool and they added finding switches and levers in bookcases and behind paintings. So, the game actually makes you feel more like a professional. Back to my previous comment about the woes, with all the positives I have said so far, you'd think it was the Thief game we fans were waiting for. The woes, which can be summed up in one word: Scripted.The whole game feels like a forced script. Where the originals had many ways to tackle entering, solving, exploring an area, and completing a mission, this game feels like it runs on a linear rail. You'd be lucky sometimes to find more than one path to finish a mission where the others let you go at it and figure it out on your own. I felt like I was being forced to go on one path alone and then get done with it. Sure, it branches off to different rooms sometimes, but not many. Loot is so easy to snag and the AI is easy to fool. The game seems to just want you to get into conflicts to save yourself from the bordeom. In the originals, knowing whether or not a guard is going to catch you was thrilling, in this, getting caught is so easily unavoidable that it's childs play. Even turning off the assistance the game gives you like the notice eyes for the guards and civilians still can't make up for the lack of challenge this game presents. The explorative factors are gone and replaced with one path, a scripted sequence which could be a cutscene to a daring escape Assassins Creed style, and then stupid simple puzzles or platform jumps that are so predictable. This game could have been a masterpiece, but I get the feeling Eidos M catered to the classic ""simplicity"" I see with many games nowadays, much like how Diablo 3 was severely watered down (and still is, but recent patches and the expansion at least have made it enjoyable) with the removal of the skill tree replaced with simply combining different spells, that sort of thing. Overall, Thief is a slightly above fair game. It's creativity, atmosphere, and progression system is heavily overshadowed by a one path, one solution, do it or don't play sort of feeling that haunts you chapter to chapter. Had this game had the same level design of the first ones, this could have been a highly anticipated reboot that I could have said was better than Thief 3. Thief 3 is still better than this game and it's shocking to say that considering you can do so much more in the reboot, but Thief 3 had more to explore and more ways to tackle things despite being as claustraphobic as it was at points. Newcomers, give it a shot I suppose, but play Thief 1 or 2 for true experiences. Thief fans like me, get ready for a big disappointment.6 out of 10			"

												I have only started playing, so my review will be updated when finish the game. I never played previous Thief games, but even if some fans of the series felt disappointed with this installation, I believe the review must be about the game itself, and not its heritage. After all, it's a reboot. So far I'm enjoying it; it doesn't blow my mind, but it doesn't annoy me. It's against murder, which is nice, and even if thieving is immoral, well, frankly it feels much less criminal than those endless cash registers in Bioshock. The graphics are well made, character movements do not cause dizziness, it's a well made game. Worth getting with a discount, for sure. I'll write more when I finish it.Update: I'm still playing the game, now after a GPU upgrade it became evident that it is much more enjoyable with a higher frame rate. However, two flaws are also evident: controls and sound bugs. During a chase scene I had a considerable difficulty getting hero to run and jump when needed. The sound system is buggy - phrases are either not heard, or heard too loud, or cut off, etc. But on balance, the game is enjoyable and different enough to be a memorable experience. I still recommend it.			"

												As someone who's never played the old Thief games, this viewpoint is coming from a fresh start to the game. I enjoy stealth action games, and have played several of them, and in terms of gameplay/stealth mechanics, this game isn't exactly spectacular, but it's acceptable. I enjoyed this game more because of the mood/setting (dark/gothic), as well as the story and characters. The game - including all side quests and the Bank Heist DLC mission - took me about 20 hours. So if you're looking for a decent stealth game to play and you have the cash to buy this on sale ($15), it's not a bad idea. But don't place your expectations too high. On a side note, the Asylum chapter midway through the game is a lot like a jumpy horror movie - beware. Not something I expected in a game in this genre.			"

												I'm really enjoying Thief - I still have 2 Chapters and a handful of side missions to go.Deadly Shadows and Dishonored are 2 of my all time favourite games; there have been a lot of comparison between Thief and those 2 games, saying that Thief falls short. But if you simply take this game for what it is, then it's still a highly enjoyable game.The stealth game play is great; the city has a fantastic feel to it, you can customize your options more than in any other game I've played. There's masses to explore skulking around the city doing side missions, scouring every inch to find little nooks and crannies you'd previously overlooked, different ways to traverse an area, and eavesdrop on conversations for hints and clues.The main story is slightly lacking in originality, and there are inconsistencies with the AI (sometimes they'll notice an opened chest, sometimes they won't etc.). But I'm thoroughly enjoying the game. Like I said, take it for what it is and it's a whole load of fun.But if budget is an issue, I'd hold out until it's on offer.			"

The gameplay is very interactive and everything flows pretty smoothly.Also I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty, because I played on the 'normal' difficulty and it was way to easy.			"

												There is a good game in here. You can find it when you are sneaking around and using your gadgets just likee the old theif games. There is enough side missions to keep you entertained and the playthrough is a long one if you go the completionist route. I know this game went through a pretty heavy redesign at one point and I can't help but feel that a lot of the exposition was cut out in favor of streamlining the game to fit the mass market. This is a huge mistake on square enixs part. The world and story of the theif games are the true standouts in this game world and to see huge parts of the story streamlined just to sell is big oversight. What was in the book? Why wasn't Orions motivations explored more. There are tons of great questions but those are the only two I can think of that don't really give away any plot. It's a shame in a game this good that this game went the easy narrative route and really left out the philosphical war going on for control of the city. That was the true star of the show and it feels like it was just thrown out the window.Oh yeah. The menu system sucks. Terrible. Horrible. I still recommend picking it up on a steam sale just so you can have a little fun and see what could have been.			"

												There is another review on here that states, ""If you didn't play the original games then you likely will enjoy the game for what it is."" I think that very well may be the case. I've just finished my first playthrough, and though it took me a little bit to get into it (I replayed Chapter 1 once I got a handle on the mechanics) I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I've never played the other entries in the Thief series, so I had no point of reference there. Rather, I was coming off of stealth-heavy games like DX:HR and Dishonored. Though the mechanics and options for getting around feel more restricted in Thief than in those two games, I felt that the immersion made up for it, and once I got the hang of things, gameplay was fluid and pretty intuitive.I really like the game, but for those who are fans of the previous games, I suggest reading the reviews that make comparisons there.

												Thief is a reboot of the classic FPS stealth game series ""Thief"".The medieval/steampunk setting is immersive, thanks to a great shadow usage, skilful design and gloomy colors.The main story is quite short and ""unsalted"" but always great in places and background happenings. The severely intricated city, which is the mission hub, is the soul of the game.Optional client jobs, secondary missions and break-ins are the way to actually feel the thief essence: this is a game to be explored, as every corner can hide a lever or a secret passage, and information gathering is crucial.Game mechanics are not perfectly refined as in Dishonored, and the sound (which is of good quality) is affected by some bugs, but the sense of realism and immersion in the atmosphere of Thief is deep and catching.88/100For a more faithful stealth gaming experience I suggest to switch on the no-kill and no-detection modes, as the game provides unlimited quicksaves.

												Given what I've played thus far, Thief is a game right up my alley. I jumped into this game on the hardest difficulty available, and am loving it. The emphasis on stealth and trickery as opposed to brute force is a delight not often experienced in modern gaming. This is a game I'd like to see further delved into, as there is tons of potential. While I am aware that it is a remake, I still hope for the addition of traps, misdirection (besides throwing a bottle) and subterfuge. Adding cinematic stealth kills (or takedowns) would've been nice as well. The enemies aren't cheap or stupid like in most stealth games, forcing you to perform recon and planning around the situation. And believe me, planning is imperative, as you are not an indestructible force of death. Getting surrounded is usually a one-way trip to the reload screen. The Focus mechanic doesn't wreck the game by making it stupidly easy and performs well enough to make it a useful tool as opposed to either a liability or a dependancy.All in all, a great experience for stealth game fans, both new and old. There are a few things I would chage with the platforming (Sometimes your character will happily jump to his doom, but refuse to step over a two inch ledge). Other than that, this game is a stellar example of the ingenuity that was so common before modern gaming.			"

												This game is good to a degree. But for some reason I get random FPS drops, and this makes the game hard to play. Along with parts of the storyline and massive bugs. But I do like some of the Ideas from Theif. Like focusing on the diffrent arrow types for your bow. That you had to be sneaky evasive and couldn't go full rambo like you can im MGS(which I love by the way). But this game just feels rushed. They couldn't do what they need to do becuase Squaresoft rushed em. But this game is worth $15 bucks or even $20 bucks but just not $30-$60.			"

												This game definitely dosen't deserve all the negative press it's getting. Yes, it has flaws. Yes, it differs in many ways from the original games. However, it still offers an amazing stealth experience in a victorian setting, and it has great optimization for PC. A must-buy, especially when it's on sale.			"

												I am writing this review after playing through what the entire game has to offer ( Main missions, Side Missions, Client jobs and Challenge maps).This is my first Thief game and as a first-timer to this series, I would like to say that I found the game pretty enjoyable. However like most games, it has pros as well as cons. Allow me to summarise the pros and cons of this game.PROS:+ Beautiful Visuals on high graphical settings+ Fun to Steal valuables and random items+ Free-roaming around The City's ""Open world""+ Able to break into people houses throughout The CIty+ Many optional content such as side missions, client jobs and challenge maps+ A Suprisingly Scary Mission+ Great voice acting by Garrett the main characterCONS:- Confusing and horrible Map Design- Only Three kind of enemy types (Sword guy, archer guy and monster)- Limited character models, hence most NPC look like the same person- The small cast of Characters in this game are boring and you would most likely not care about them- Boring plot and storyIf I have to rate this game, I'll give it a 6/10 which is a decently average game.The best aspect of this game would be the stealing! Somehow, stealing stuff in this game gave me enjoyment.The worst aspect of the game would be the map design which is really bad. I got lost several time in the open world city as the map was too basic and has nothing much on it to guide you around.Overall, the game is still pretty fun to play despite it's flaws. I would recommend you guys to try out this game when it is on sale!			"

												Thief is a very solid stealth game, dripping with atmosphere.You are Garrett, the master thief and immediately from the beginning of the game you can be as invisible as a ghost for your adversaries. Stealth is the key to all of your actions, as you are a very weak combatant when exposed. The game focuses on what a thief does, stealing items of worth for his own gain. So if you like looting and looking for loot, especially the well hidden sort, Thief offers plenty of this.The main story is supported by nicely animated cutscenes and very good voice acting, even in the german version. Like Deus Ex this is clearly one of Square Enix' strengths. Levels are well designed and you usually have more than two ways to deal with obstacles.My only real problem with the actual gameplay is that you don't have many options to deal with actual enemies. Garrett has a form of ""magic"" which is called focus, but it is barely any more than passive buffs which enhance your abilities, like slowing the time or extending shadows. In most cases you are limited to a hide and seek gameplay with the options of distracting, killing or knocking out enemies but nothing more. Dishonored, for comparison, offers a wide variety of ""magic"" abilities and tools to help you overcome your foes.That said, what Thief does, it does it pretty well and it's a nice looker on top.I had some performance issues with strange loading stutters, but apart from that it runs well on my old machine even on very high settings. So I guess even older machines can play it well, if you tune the options a bit.Grab this game if you like the atmosphere, which it really practically radiates, if you like stealth gameplay and stealing stuff.

												My feelings towards the new Thief are complicated. I'm probably going to post an unpopular opinion.And that opinion is: Thief 2014, on its own, is a good game.I'm saying 'on its own', because if you bought it expecting to relive the memories of Thief games of old, you'll be sorely disappointed. Exploration, while interesting, doesn't offer nearly as much choices as the classic games. Levels are not as sprawling and intricately designed. The ambient music is just a shadow of Eric Brosius' masterpieces. No Stephen Russell. Also, you can't jump non-contextually. You can only shoot rope arrows at designated spots. Which sucks.However, please hear me here: you need to look at Thief 2014 as a game completely of its own. It is a reboot, after all, not a sequel. (Even though it's filled to the brim with nice shout-outs to the classics + I'm pretty sure it is actually set in the same continuity). And the truth is, when seen without the prism of its predecessors, it's a very decent game. Graphics are very good and pleasingly gritty - even though they take a while to load - and The City feels deliciously grimdarky. And I actually liked the new Garrett very much; he's just as witty and darkly humorous as the Garrett we knew. Plus, let's not forget what the main source of fun in Thief has always been: stealing! This game managed to appease my inner cleptomaniac completely; looting feels fun and satisfying.So, all in all, give Thief 2014 a shot, especially if you haven't played the classic ones (maybe you'll come to appreciate them afterwards). Think of it as Dishonored without Blink. It's a very fun bit of obsessive-compulsive stealing that should keep you occupied until we get a new, better stealth game. Until then, I give Thief a solid 7/10.PS. By the way, if you feel that this game has been 'dumbed down' and made 'too easy' in comparison to the classic Thief... There is an option to play with a completely custom difficulty setting. You can make the game literally harder than hard. Like, Super Meat Thief level hard.			"

												-not near the original still entertaining steampunk thieving simulator 7/10-As I already read several (bad) reviews before buying at a large discount I could keep my disappointment in check. Yes it's not really a successor to the original and acclaimed thief series.The product is a console-player-streamlined dishonored-like without superpowers. Movement is restricted: jumping/climbing only where possible and also rope arrows can't be fired in any wood but assigned places (to not make it too difficult for kids). You can't place crates to create shortcuts, reach ledges or hide. You can't throw stuff to distract only the bottles designed for that purpose. Gareth the cynical thief we loved becomes Gareth the emo dude with a mean GF but it's not that bad as I made it sound. (in fact in reviews the Erin character was usually reviled - she casually murders a guard in the beginning - but I think given her history and everything the character works and as you discover in the game the guards are a bunch of fascists anyway)Now why the recommendation? On it's own without the mighty thief series as comparison the game is a quiet good simulation of sneaking, stealing stuff and parcour. Aside from game design, bugs and handling problems the game shows AAA production values. For 10 bucks it's good entertainment. For all the reasons outlined Dishonored feels like a much better production and was dubbed the spiritual thief successor (has Trickster, more steampunk and style) but Corvo is an overpowered killing machine who always has several ways to easily dispatch stuff while Gareth remains a fragile dude who has to strike from the shadows and he's a much better sneak at it. It's a different approach and also very satisfying to play.Approaching the last mission now and the game hits the sweet spot between being the badass takedown sneaker and the close combat wimp. You'll have a lot of exciting moments where you escape detection by a hair.It's fun to nail an arrow through a guard's eye from the shadows.Good lot of content with large main missions and several smaller 15 minute side missions.Bunch of rare collectables and secret treasure hidden in every corner.Other unsorted impressions and rantsAtmosphere is dark and gothic. I like the visual style and the game characters actually. Voice-acting ranges from poor to good. New Gareth is not old Gareth of legend but an ok dude for a hero. Mission 5 is the thief-obligatory horror mission.While the story is usual an excuse to steal stuff and go see places it's especially illogical and obscure here and the ending is just dumb and unrewarding. There are no hammerites or pagans anymore. Ambient conversations are projected on your position without any speaker existing - making it appear like you hear ghost voices in your head as noises and conversations from guards are correctly coming from their position.Oh and often you're supposed to mash some button like to pry a  window. Completely useless feature in a game - should be patched out from ANY game (Batman games come to mind). Ruins your gear so you buy another overpriced controller.Clumsy ""context sensitive controls"" - you probably lean on a chest more often than loot it or fumble with controls while avoiding guards in pursuit.

But evrything started going downhill from there+,/,-(positive, neutral, negative)+Setting+Puzzles+Graphics/You can allways tell if there is loot in drawers, because thief hand will raise nearer to drawer when it has loot, so that raises questions why do i even control the other drawers when the tief allready knows where the loot is,-Freeworld(so hard to navigate, and i played on master so to get one place to another took too much time)-Sometimes my saved game backtracked littlebit, that was very fustratingIn conclusion i want to reccomend this game anyway, because it gives you stealth based gameplay instead of shoot first think later gameplay. if you arent very patient dont take the master difficult,Rating; I Should have stayed in the shadows "

Of course it has your issues, like it is somehow repetitive and the environments are very alike. It tired of exploring and collecting so much gold in any corner, opening or unlocking lockers, closets etc. At some points it seems the game loses its theme, but beyond all of that, it is a good stealth game, well developed with a good gameplay. I identify myself with the Garrett's lonely and dark style. I also recommend for those who likes Dishonored style, and finally I could skip the ending credits! 8.5/10			"

I got it in sale for like 5 or 10 dollars, I don't remember, but I would have given the 20 they offer it up for now on consoles just so I could sell it back later to someone. It's a pretty good game, but I don't think it would be a keeper for me. 7/10			"

I am disappointed. After years of following the development of this game, I found the story to be predictable and the dumbed down stealth aspect boring. There are some great maps, and some great moments that keep me occasionally playing, but there are also moments I literally facepalm... I miss the old days.With that said. This game is definitely worth it when it is on sale. If it's not... I'd wait.			"

												I've been excited for this game for I don't know how long, but I was a bit disappointed when I first played it. The AI is wonky and the levels are not as open as promised. A perfect example is the moment I had to jump out of an air vent with a guard walking underneath it - I figured I waited a while until he was gone. However, when he was gone, I wasn't able to jump out of the air vent. After minutes of trying everything I figured out that you have to perform a takedown on the guard (which triggers a cutscene) to advance. Perfectly sums up how linear this game can be - performing takedowns is definitely NOT the first thing I think about in a stealth game.However, the atmosphere is grim, and the possibilities to set yourself a challenge before you start the game are endless - there are more than enough options to make the challenge satisfying for the most hardcore Thief fans. Furthermore, the sneaking system is praiseworthy. Where Dishonored allows you to defend yourself with weapons and supernatural powers, Thief basically forces you to stay in the shadows - if you are detected, the only solution you actually have is making a run for it.Thief is a good reboot, but not a worthy one. Eidos Montreal could have done so much better, especially on the gameplay and dialogues, but really excelled on creating a City that gives you the shivers. The difficulty settings are clearly a nod to the fact that Thief is a cult classic and has a fanbase of hardcore stealth fans, but is has also been made accessible for new players who want to be introduced into this wonderful series. Hopefully Eidos Montreal will learn from their mistakes when they decide to make a sequel, and make a game that gives us back the Thief series as we know it. "

												So here's the issue with Thief. (Or as some people call it, Thief 4)If you treat the game as a faithful sequel to the original three games, you are going to disappointed. If you treat the game as a new reboot, you're going to like it. The game itself plays between a mixture of Thief 3 and Dishonoured. (Which isn't really a bad combination, though this game is quite linear)The graphics, animations and audio are great, which does a great deal for immersion. Not to mention the voice acting is pretty good.Bad points: The story writing is poor, and it is not as slow paced/tactical as the previous games in the series.Does this mean the game is bad? No way, it's actually pretty good. A bit buggy, but it's a solid game in its own right. Should you buy it? Yes,  but make sure you buy it cheap. It's always on offer because of the mixed reception it's getting.			"

												I decided to ignore the ""It's nothing like the classic thief"" comments, and take the game for what it is.And what it is, is a mediocre, if not downright terrible stealth game.First of all, the game is very linear. The game is designed in a way that even if it looks like there are 3 different paths to take, there's only one that really works.The sound design is absolutely abismal. People who are far away will sound like they're right next to you, even if they're in a whole other room. This leads to a lot of frustrating instances, where your cover is blown by enemies you thought where much further away. Not to mention it basically ruins any attempt for the game to establish the dark atmosphere it's going for.The combat is really stupid too. You basically press R, then hold Q when it tells you to. It really only gets difficult when you're fighting groups of 3 or more. At that point you might as well restart the checkpoint, because they will mob you. You could just kill them with your arrows, but since arrows are the only items that let you interact with the environment, you'll waste your most valuable tool for getting through the mission.I really wanted to like this game. The graphics are amazing, the animation is spot on, and the controls are tight.But the game is just about ruined by the lazy design.  "

												This game has had alot of potentional that could have made it a 10/10 triple AAA game, however due to obvious short development time or lack of resources, the game suffers from technical stuff that stop the game from being an AAA title, the good stuff about the game is the customizable difficulty and how you can play this game the difficulty you want, you can have it as a breeze or harder than dark souls, all upto you. Gameplay wise the gameplay is pretty good, I enjoy pickpocketing and killing guards from shadows, the graphics are really great, some of the best cloth physics i have ever seen(dat curtain) and the storyline is a bit interesting, not wow tho.Now the bad things, The game is really glitchy and has a ton and I mean a TON of audio bugs! repeated audio bugs over and over again is just...annoying. The AI can get abit troublesome sometimes, and I hate the fact that when you enter a house to rob, you don't have to sneak lol, you can open all the chests/cabinets and just steal and no one knows because THERE ARE NO NPCS! and last the enemy designs are just so bad, THERE ARE ONLY 2 TYPES OF SOLDIERS IN THE GAME ! A swordbro and crossbro, that's it. How would I rate this on a scale of 1-10? a  7-7.5/10. It's worth buying, but not at full price. Buy it when it's like 20 or 25 dollars, because it has replay value and alot of sidequests which is cool.			"

												I enjoyed this game. I knew about most of it's faults beforehand, so I think that actually helped me to look past them and enjoy the rest of the game. There some annoying problems with this game. I will lay the ones I found most notable out here before I get to the good stuff. 1. There are annoyingly long scripted animations for doing very common things: opening windows, knocking out guards, stealing loot, opening doors/wardrobes/cabinets, opening grates. This is the biggest problem of them all, in my opinion. It kind of disrupts the flow of the game, breaks the immersion. You get used to it after a while, and then it's ok.2. The city map is split up by multiple loading screens (this is a joke, they should have been able to fit it all on one map without any load times, it's not that big).3. It could be pretty difficult to get to certain areas of the map at times, but you get there after some snooping around and observations. Many people point out the lack of a fast-travel system. This should have been included, but you can get by fine without one once you get used to the layout of different areas.4. (Only important to fans of the Thief Franchise) There are loads of differences to the previous Thief games. In essence, this should be called something else as the gameplay mechanics are seriously lacking compared to the previous games.I enjoyed this game for multiple reasons:1. The side-quests were varied and helped scratch the completionist itch I have.2. The environments are very atmospheric (there is however a very small colour palette and it's really depressing/dreary. Many people will not like this, but I thought it was fine)3. There is a variety of ways to complete each mission and travel through the map.4. It was an excellent immersive experience at times.5. Many different tools and arrow types making the gameplay more diverse (again, not as good as the previous Thief games, but for a newbie it would be fine)6. Good pacing. The game progressed along nicely.Look, I'll be honest, I could list many more smaller faults. It's a shame it was so different from the previous games which had excellent lore, better characters, interesting factions, more dynamic game mechanics. If you are new to the franchise, then these things don't matter, and you can enjoy the game more. However, if you are a fan of the series, then you'll have to accept all these caveats and treat the game differently. It's so different to the previous titles that you should probably treat it as a completely unrelated game. You'll have a chance of enjoying it then.			"

												An excellent stealth game, true to the spirit of the original and at the same time much more modern. Very polished gameplay and a clever difficulty level make Thief a game no stealth fan should miss. The plot and the setting aren't always inspired, but the quality of the content greatly makes up for it.			"

												Way too costly for what it is. It's more like a mini game from Skyrim with really good graphics. The gameplay is repetitive, the story doesn't make up for it, and there's really not even an incentive to continue. You're better off buying Skyrim and just role playing as a thief. It would be basically the same gameplay, only you'd actually have other stuff to do as well.			"

												Alas this is just not the thief I remember playing.I hate to be a dog of nostalgia but while this game looks amazing it falls short with a silly awkward story and over all clunky mechanics. The advanced motions to hide and peek around corners is kind of lame when the bad guys never look that hard in the first place. Its like playing hide and go seek by yourself. And the loot...man this guy will grab anything that aint nailed down. Less of a seasoned thief and more like an extreme kleptomaniac! Bottom line, if you want a stealth game get splinter cell Hitman absolution or play skyrim as a rogue but whatever you do dont waste money on this one.			"

												This is a difficult review to write...Thief 3 being the only previous title of the series that I have played to completion, I find the latest lacking...It runs well enough once you get over the bugs that are still in and whilst the controls obviously originated for controllers not keyboards it is at times fun but I can't find it in me to properly recommend the game for the following reasons;1. quick time animations - immersion breaking at every opportunity2. looting - the hand grabbing is annoying, repetitive and the same sequence repeated over and over with no variation3. It doesn't feel like a Thief game. Remove it's past history and it would make an acceptable game, nothing more.4. it feels clunky when playing5. Poor story6. Bugs - particularly with sound			"

												I dont post many reviews on games, but wanted to warn people. This game is horrible. Graphics and details are awsome, but when it comes to gameplay it sucks! When sneaking around as long as your in a shadow you cant be seen. You can be pretty much be right next to a guy and he wont know it. A.I. are as dumb as they come. To make it seem half way realistic I had to adjust the brightness so it was very dark. That way it seems like you cant really be seen in the shadows. Even with the horrible reviews I gave it a chance. Got this game for 16$ and want my money back! Hopefully I can make it through to the end so I dont feel like I totally got ripped.....			"

Thief: Deadly Shadows was so good for its time that everyone understood - no matter what next Thief would be, it will be constantly compared with predecessor. To be successful, it is vital for it not to look bad in comparison.Designers bore that in mind. Almost every aspect of game has evolved.Gameplay has been balanced, and now you cannot grab things instantly and without moving. Light gem mechanic was simplified, now containing only three distinct states (at first I was quite dissatisfied with this, though, as I saw later, it did not harm gameplay complexity). Imbalanced wall-flattening was removed, replaced by fixed location hiding places - empty closets. Focus feature introduction made gameplay more smooth, it is almost impossible to get stuck now (and, because Focus resource is quite limited, it was achieved without significant complexity loss). Ghost-Opportunist-Predator rankings is great and encourages rich non-linear gameplay. Combat is more dynamic and now, with proper player skill, Garrett poses real threat in one-on-one combat.Art is just great. Models, textures, sounds - everything is beyond expectations. I do not value these things much, so cannot tell deep detail, but even I can see work well done.Still, as you can see, I do not recommend this game. In evaluating Thief I, like many others, compare it to Deadly Shadows. But from my point of view, Thief loses the match with a huge score gap. This is because the things I liked in Deadly Shadows the most were the atmosphere, the story and characters who acted in it.In Thief, there is only one lively character for the whole game. It could be fine with a thieving game if it was protagonist. But no, it is a fence, Basso. To add insult to injury, Basso does practically nothing in whole storyline. Beside some quest-giving in beginning of game, his only appearance is in chapter four, where Garret has to rescue him from prison (a princess in tower could be there instead of Basso with no impact on the narrative). With no bright characters there is no bright story.Atmosphere is ruined. Introducing collectible sets is the most dubious thing, it turns Garret from cold-blooded and cold-minded thief into some short-sighted kleptomaniac, who stashes valuables worth thousands of coins in dirty destroyed clock tower for some unknown reasons.Remember brilliant mission in Shalebridge Cradle? Compare atmosphere in Cradle and in Moira Asylum. Compare mission narratives. Double facepalm is not enough to describe a feeling when you see a crude fake copied from masterpiece. This mission just should not have been added to the story. It looks worthless for those who played Deadly Shadows and loved it.All strong ideologies in the City are dead and this is explicitly shown to us: Keeper Library and Hammer Cathedral are abandoned and there is no trace of their inhabitants. Designers burned with desire to destroy the City as player remembers it, and this desire provoked blunders. Abandoned buildings look like they were abandoned for centuries, not for decades, with no rational explanation for that scope of destruction. The City is dead and agonizing, with no purpose to exist, which impacts on playing experience in form of question 'Why should I care and try to save it?' In urge to destroy, nothing was proposed in return. Designers performed just like Orion's revolutionaries - they kill all guards, set city on fire and then... nothing. It just stays burning forever, until you finally close Thief to never run it again.Greatest forces you encounter are just some power-hungry feudal lords. Remember how exciting was first mission in Deadly Shadows, in Rutherford Castle, reading about all of those intrigues they were plotting against each other? And how worthless they all started to look when Keepers, Hammers and Pagans stepped on the stage? On day four or five you would not even remember that there are some 'Great Families' and that they mean anything in the City.Nothing like that anymore. You just stick to all those nobles' dirty underwear. No big ideas. Only realpolitik, only hardcore.Having read all above, you should understand why the story is primitive and predictable (and quite secondary too - revolution line looks like another crude fake copied from masterpiece - this time Dishonored).Thief is another unfortunate example of a game that was created with huge budget and effort of specialists, but without aim to be a piece of art. It is good for killing time, but there is nothing truly beautiful in it. Just business.Do not have any illusions - it will not 'unfold in the end' like Bioshock Infinite. It will just fade away, leaving only one word afterwards.Disappointment.			"

												( played on master difficulty) This game makes me very sad, not because it isn't beautiful which it is, it truly is beautiful, not because the gameplay isn't solid it is it truly is. The city and story or great and the city tells most of it as a proper Thief game should, so why do I not recommend this game? because it isn't optimized at all, my graphics card which is pretty good chugs like bloody Steam boat willie, I'm running with every thing on low and only textures on medium and it can take a solid minute per area to get the game to load properly so there's no lag. The map design is horrendous it's extremly confusing and once you hit the second area and more of the map you feel completely upside down, as the map isnt clear at all and the quests don't tell you how to get around.The economy jips you at every corner, you'll get something like 40 gold from a room and the rope arrow to get up there costed 75 gold coins, the whole wire cutters, grate opener and painting cutter thing is complete bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean what? Garrett I know you're a master Thief and we took out the proposed skill tree and Quick Time Events because the fan base was going to gut us but yea you don't have all the tools a Thief needs, also remember your mechanic eye? nope now you got a ♥♥♥♥ing magic one. Where was it in the first game? who cares! the magic eye skill tree is completely stupid, and after a while just removes any challenge from the game. the actual campaign maps are fun, they really are but the majority of side missions suck♥♥♥♥♥ really hard. you no longer get free control of where your arrows go most of the time, you can only use rope arrows where the game says to use them and many other forms of control that you are used to having in Thief games is completely taken away from you, Garretts fun dialog is still there, the guards are still as story driving as the acutal story ( which is a great thing btw) but damn this game is not only a let down, it just pisses you off for how alien it is compared to the source material, where it had freedom, this gives you bird seed paths all towards the same ending.Ps. where thief 2 had large open maps where you could do anything with and then leave, these maps have very few ways of getting in, and are very structured. don't let it fool you, there is a set path and it has like 2 branches that's it. some parts have no branches it's just a set path.This game is just crap, if you don't mind some older graphics, but want the best game I've ever played in every category ever and really awesome creepy as all ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥religious robots check out Thief 2, the metal age.

												Despite the unwillingness to play this game again, I would recommend it. The game itself was interesting, playable, I just had fun. I really enjoyed sneaking. BUT I didn't like the storyline. It was good from time to time, but  mutants?really?????? Whole asylum chapter was perfect until mutants appeared! And it really spoiled the last chapter for me :(   It didn't fit into the story at all. I also didn't like that much map of the city. Most of the time I was just searching for ANY way to get to a spot, I don't see how there would be multiple ways to some spots. I was lost often.To sum up: I will play this game again because it was pretty good.			"

Giant sprawling complex levels made Thief I/II incredibly fun, now they are tiny rail roads where you can probably close your eyes, hold W, and clear a few missions.3.

												I was so excited when this game was first announced, but that excitement dwindled when it was eventually released to a cacophony of damning reviews. Regardless, I figured it would be worth the tenner I paid in the sale.It wasn't.This game, despite an obviously huge amount of effort on the developer's part, is unplayably awful. The AI is the worst I have ever seen in a stealth game. The guards don't see you even when they're staring straight at you as long as you're somewhere a bit dark. The controls are abominable, and clearly designed for consoles. The world is about as open as Microsoft Train Simulator and the 'swooping' animation every time you pick something up is unnecessarily nauseating.I've played this for a full hour and a half and I'm not sure I can stand any more.

Posted: June 22, 2014
												I've played the first three Thief games, plus multiple fan missions through the Dark Circle, and I know the lore of the world in which the game takes place very well. Square and Eidos-Montreal did a good job, but not enough to bypass the originality, artistic beauty and emotional investment you can experience by playing Dishonored and its DLC (which I highly recommend) or the first three Thief games (the first two really, with the third as a neat tidy-up of the series).  That doesn't mean that this Thief is bad however; it is very good at times, but it's not a $60 game. It's a $30 game at best. Some observations. #1. The game is a graphics hog for no reason, leading to lots of texture popping. #2. Unfinished artwork/bad artwork: Unreadable posters; and a painter's house had house painting brushes that looked like they came from  modern hardware store. It was like a programmer cut and pasted in an ad image.#3. Uninspiring dialogue and cut-scene lipsyncing and audio drop problems. #4. A story that stmbles at times, but does manage to build nicely only to fall apart in the very last quicktime scene as being almost as non-sensical as the end of ME3. #5. NPC character models look alike and act lifeless via repetitive and non-varied animations. However, the dialogue heard through walls and windows is very good, interesting and life like.#6. The Queen of Beggars is a discount version of Granny Rags from Dishonored.#7. Basso is perfectly rendered, written and voice acted. He's exactly as I pictured him --better even. But even he seems slightly derivitive of the bus driver/gun dealer from Borderlands.#8. Sadly, Garrett is now a trout-shouldered French emo goth. He just doesn't look good. Also, he is now a man with two different colored eyes... and that's all for that. No reference to his mechanical eye. But on a positive note, the programmers at least kept him looking consistent throughout the game unlike in T3.#9. The villain thief catcher general is that butcher dude from Gangs of New York; he even wields a cleaver during one scene.#10. The City is beautifully depressing, but I find it difficult to believe that a religion as well-established as the Hammerites would simply just disappear in a decade. Economically and politically they are simply too strong to just be gone. The same goes for the Pagans.#11. A big plus for Garrett mentioning the Trickster at one point and evidence of the Hammerites having once existed is evident in the game at times. Even the influence of the Mechanists is stil evident. However, it also seems as though the lead writer and the other writers couldn't make up their minds. Thief lore is used as stage props that no one seems to know or understand well enough to use them effectively. #12. Garret's equipment gets a plus and a minus. The rope arrow is back, but now it can only be used in certain areas. The gas arrow doesn't knock people out anymore. Likewise, there's no sap. But... the claw is a great new addition. Creating a new item and having it fit so well into the lore of the game is a big plus, so good job there.Overall I'd say buy this game on sale. It is good. And if you do, some advice: Accept all of Basso's extra missions when he offers them so you won't have to keep going back to him, and then do them at your liesure throughout the game.			"

Posted: March 16, 2014
												I recently finished this game on the hardest difficulty with all side content complete. Here are my thoughts:What I Liked:-The customizeable difficulty was a really cool idea and I enjoyed shooting for the 700 point challenge. Basically the game lets you pick a base difficulty and then set a ton of modifiers worth varying levels of points. My settings forced a game over if I was seen or touched anyone and I enjoyed having the option to do that.-The game is completely ghostable and it doesn't rely on abusing AI patterns or using glitches. Careful observation and exploration allow for some really useful alternate approaches similar to Dishonored. I was able to able to ghost (despite what the broken post-mission rating said) every single main mission and every single sidequest in the game on the hardest difficulty so props to the devs for allowing for that.-The swoop mechanic is a joy to use. It is incredibly handy for crossing those small gaps between the darkness when you can't take out the light or ducking back into a corner after swiping some loot while a guard's back was turned. The animation and sound effect give it this nice agile feel and it's hard not to feel like a pro thief every time you use it.-I really liked that the best loot was tied to exploration-based puzzles. It was fun picking through documents to find clues for vault codes or searching for ways to disable traps. The sidequests really take advantage of this and some of the later ones feel quite clever.-Thiefing in general was fun. Pickpocketing has a nice feel to it. It's risky, but not overly hard. Picking locks is simple, but trying to do it before a patrol returns can be quite tense. The animation for cutting paintings out of their frames is superb.-The full body-awareness is nice. I love all the intricate first-person animation (though a couple get old fast) and seeing your legs is always a plus.-The devs didn't skimp on content either. The game took me roughly 20 hours to see all the content. The Client side missions are definitely worth checking out as they take place in areas separate from the hub and are pretty involved, taking anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.What I Accepted:-The AI is consistent and reads pretty well from the player standpoint which I think is the most important aspect of designing AI for stealth games. They aren't terribly clever, but they do feel like a threat.-The art is solid. The visual variety is a bit lacking, but the style they went for works well with the theme and the character design is pleasant. Dishonored definitely takes the cake here, but Thief isn't without it's merits.-The non-stealth segments are a bit goofy, but they make up a miniscule percentage of the game. The bridge sequence was actually pretty cool as a visual setpiece and it wasn't as jarring as the previous one had been.-The third-person platforming stuff could have been used a lot more than it was. There were only 3-4 actual implementations of it and most of them were just there as the only way to reach a new area. I wish they had used this system to add more verticality to levels.What I Disliked:-The blatant streaming-in-the-new-area animations were really annoying. There are 2-3 of them that get used for the whole game and I would honestly have preferred a loadscreen if we have to compensate for ♥♥♥♥♥ier platforms. By the end of the game you never want to pry open another window for the rest of your life.-The story execution is pretty terrible. The plot is poorly explained and important characters will show up like twice over the course of the 15-20 hour game. When I reached the end I was completely lost on why they even bothered. It's ridiculous and nonsensical.-The sidequest organization in the city gets really old by the end due to the lack of fast travel. I would probably recommend just letting everything sit till the point of no return and then do it all then because if you do them as they become available you will be crossing the city back and forth twenty or so times. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing old when you are ghosting the game and are creeping past the same guards for the tenth time.-The game has a very stitched-together feel and the troubled development is obvious when playing. There are a couple segments that you can tell the guys who were trying to save the game couldn't do anything about short of completely redoing them, which wasn't an option after 5+ years of pre-existing dev time. It's a bummer.-The pre-order bonus is one of the best missions in the game. It's a really well-fleshed out side mission where you rob a bank that has multiple levels of security. It was really fun and it bothered me that most of the people playing the game down the road probably won't be playing it.Conclusion:If you hold the first two games sacred, don't bother with this entry. This game is not for you and you will be wasting your time and money. No one is asking for you to do community service and torture yourself with it. If you liked Dishonored a lot though, Thief 2014 might be worth checking out at the 15$ or less price range and you can pretend it's a spin-off from that series, because let's be honest, that is what the game feels like.

												I do recommend this game by the thinnest of margins. For one, it has none Guard interaction we saw in the other Thief games that we all found so endearing. No Taffer talk or anything. WTF happened to Benny? Benny was funny and gave the game much needed humor.  All we get with this game is a lot of 'Sloop' and 'Polly Adler' talk. ""Oh my back aches,"" ""I think I'm coming down with something,"" ""I hope I don't catch the gloom..."" Holy crap, gimme a break! I have a good machine but I rarely have had as many glitches with game like this. Crash crash and crash again. I shoot a rope arrow, the rope uncoils - crash! Or while moving, the games freezes then crash! I'll exit a building, the game chuggs along like molassas in winter and slowly warms up to semi-normal speed and maybe or maybe I'll get a crash. Some of the cut-scenes went into fast forward mode like an old VHS tape; but yet the voices didn't. And other times, Garret would talk over himself. I'd get two script lines running at the same time. Or some NPC's would spout the same lines in near unison. In other words, this game has lots-o-bugs. Never saw this with Deus Ex: HR. It was evident that the team that gave this game a reboot had never played any of the other Thief games. If they had, this game would've been much much better. If when you buy this game, buy it on sale.			"

												The atmosphere and visuals were the most positive aspects of this game.  Level design was shotty at times, some mechanics are straight up poor, much of the play is repetitive, several bugs generally involved with the AI but also with movement.  Performance was good until the in-game cut scenes when it would go to♥♥♥♥♥♥  The story is weak as it falls flat around the explaination, the villians are bland, and the end is incredibly unstatisfying.  I played through on a custom master with 700+ in restrictions and the levels were designed in such a way that trial and error (constant quicksaves) was essentially the only way to play due to some poor level design choices.I'm a fan of the series, and this just doesn't make the cut.

												The graphics and mood of the game are great, but the gameplay is disappointing.  It's probably not fair to compare Thief to its other contemporary franchises, but it must be done; call it comparing oranges to tangerines if you like.  Thief feels like it’s two years behind what the Assassin's Creed (AC) franchise has innovated.  Thief lacks the immersion and vast scale of the AC maps and its story isn’t memorable.  Thief forces the player to follow limited and specific paths when working missions, so it can be frustrating being denied the freedom to try different ways of completing missions.I’ve enjoyed the Thief franchise, but I won’t lose any sleep if this is the end of it.

												This game had a lot of potential but it lacked a lot of little things that would had made it much more enjoyable. First of all is the issue of it lagging, I've read it does that no matter the PC or even console. It gets really annoying. Having to sneak back and forth through the city gets very tedious and annoyed me to the point of not finishing the game. The stealth isn't that great and the combat is horrible, basically if you're seen by more than one guard, you're dead. It was a lot of fun for the first 5 hours, very Assassin's Creed style feel but with a setting in the industrial revolution era UK. Unfortuantly it was just not good enough to want to finish. I would not recommend it, unless you can get over that stuff and pick it up for every cheap.			"

												I enojyed this game, but I can't really compare it to the wonderful original games of Thief. It has a very different feel, and is more comparable to a medevial Deus Ex: human Revolution than previous Thief title. The story is sloppy and has little explaination.Over all, 6/10. I would wait for this title to hit the $15 range before suggesting anyone buy it.			"

												completionist's/perfectionist's nightmare. uninteresting/unfulfilling story. terrible voice acting and characters. unnecessary supernatural enemies. the way the maps are split up an connected with no fast travel and lots of loading is frustrating. was so bored with the game play that i rushed through it just to witness the story and ultimately wish i had just stopped playing. cannot recommend for thief fans or newbies. probly not hardcore enough for fans, monotonous for everyone else.

												The main character is flat and is trying way to hard to be shady and mysterious and ""the lone wolf"".The ending ruins all the hours of fun you've had. The game is like the planning and preperations for a party a year in advance, and the ending is like the day of the party. You're so excited about how it's gonna be, but when the party is supposed to start, nobody shows up. Not a single person. And you are thrown back into daily life (doing side-quests you haven't finished up yet).The games is a lot of fun if you're not looking for a thick plot or complex characters, up until the ending. If I hadn't played the ending, and the game had just stopped working or something, I think I'd like this game a whole lot more.			"

												THIS GAME CONSISTENTLY CRASHED -- there's a Steam topic (pinned) on the issue. Just know that I'm not the kind of person to make knee jerk judgement calls. Ater researching the issue, I came to the conclusion that it's not worth my time, particularly since the game came out almost 3 years old. Square Enix clearly didn't do enough QA, nor did they followup with robust post launch support. If you do some googling you'll also note that the game was caught in ""development hell"" and well, it shows. The initial vibe I got for the short time the game did run was that the protagonist was too dry (voice over delivery) and uninteresting vs. the Garrett of the old games from around 2000. I'll add that with antialiasing turned off, I wasn't getting 60 fps on an Ivy Bridge  PC with an original nVidia GTX Titan. The geometry of the world didn't seem complex enough to be straining with so much hardware thrown at it. To be fair, I was running the game at a 21:9 resolution but the narrow city streets limit geometry (vs. an open world experience) and I exected far better performance. In closing, it seems Square Enix merely wanted to get this game out the door and recoup some of its development costs. Do yourself a favor, save your money and don't let nostalgia hook you (like I was), this game is not worth your coin. Otherwise, Garrett will break the 4th wall and steal something -- $$$ from your own purse.			"

												This is the least Thief-like game I've ever played. You can't jump whenever you want, can't climb 90% of the boxes/terrain in game, and you can only use rope arrows at specified locations. They somehow managed to make everything linear, and it sucks. Garrett just isn't himself either, it's like they looked at his personality from earlier games and shrugged before throwing it out the window.

												I have to write a negative review..First of all, it's not like Dishonored.. and the one who said it is somehow stupid!I've waited for this game for too long now (bla bla, etc), so to the point.It's not like any other Thief games (and I've played all of them)- 1. ABSENCE of a NORMAL JUMP is absolutly nr. 1 pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(jumping on the line from ledge is a ''little'' problem- 2. BUGs with audio, city watch guards AI, visibility crystal- 3. another voice actor for Garret and no more ''stupid guard, clever guard and a lazy guard'' voices!!! - 4. rope arrows can't be fired where you want, but only on predefined wooden beam (which is not so bad, but it is a step back)- 5. no sword? no dagger?? you have only that stupid blackjack- 6. smoking watter arrow?? well, that is a little strange- 7. storyline??- 8. no hammers, no pagans, no keepers, no undead HALO? THIEF?? WHERE ARE U???ok, now I would like to find something good about this game..+ 1. nice graphics, light shafts, shadows+ 2. sounds/music (if it runs correctly), it makes the atmosphere really goodI can't seem to find more.. :(It's a shame of the Thief series/universe, which i find very bad and it really is a pity, because it could have been the game of games..such a shame :(			"

												Well where to begin? first of all, what was the point of all the endless animations? to draw you away from the fact that the gameplay was as remarkable as vanilla ice cream?  i dont think i used the arrows for ANYTHING in this game.  just swoop and hide. but thats ok, because there were plenty of animations to keep me engaged!  the level design was an atrocity.  memory leaks, stuttering, lack of exploration options (except when doing a side mission, whoop dee doo) lack of free arrows, etc.  Worst of all, in an era of gaming where open world level design is not only very possible, but is becoming the standard (with Skyrim, a 3 year old game, as a good example of what to aspire to), it is flat out embarassing to have so many loading screens and points of no return. i cannot believe they actually had the nerve to charge full price for this garbage. also, no jumping? what a joke. and the rope arrow thing is just inexcusable.  anyhow i digress. of course the sound design stands out as the strongest evidence that the dev team simply did not give a damn about quality in this game.  and the writing is absolutely pathetic.  there seems to be no clear beginning middle or end, just a series of disjointed events that dont provide any kind of catharsis, or even a relationship with the back story, mainly because there simply is no back story.  everything from T1 and T2 was completely ignored, i cant even understand how this game can be part of the Thief franchise.  i thought the art design was terrific, very detailed and atmospheric.  however, this seemed to be 90% of what the budget was spent on, and when the dev team was given a deadline they quickly cobbled together some linear levels and a cramped hub map and slapped the Thief name on it.  this game was an utter joke, i didnt enjoy DXHR for many of the same reasons and i hope eidos montreal just goes away and is never trusted with making another game after this mess.

												Within 30 minutes of playing this game I could tell that it was poorly made. I started playing and liked the idea about stealing items for money and the story but it is impossible to play, not because of difficulty but because of how unrealistic and boring it was. Your only option in a fight is to shoot them with your weak bow or flee, I would've at least been able to punch. Also the AI is incredibly stupid, I remember at one point I was crouching in the dark about 2 steps away from a guy in front of him and he couldn't see me. Overall I would give it a 3/10			"

I tried editing the ini files up the♥♥♥♥♥with no luck. The character movement was clunky, sticky and not smooth at all, I guess I was asking too much from an agile thief. The script and repeated dialog from civilians were carnivorous ear mites. I had NO ♥♥♥♥ing idea what was going on with the story or who anyone was. Did I mention the loadings screens? Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it’s a damn joke, I managed to walk through 8 different sections each one with a loading screen in under 2 minutes apiece for each section, loading, loading, loading, loading. QTEs to pry open a window, useless waste of annoying time that served absolutely no purpose. There are so many windows to go through and some of them you can pry open and jump right in and others are yet ANOTHER loading screen with no warning what so ever. So if you go through a window thinking he will just jump in and it turns out to be a loading screen, yes, you have to turn around and pry open the window again wait for the loading screen so you can finish exploring the previous area.

												This review contains spoilers. I've just started playing Dishonored, sorry Tombraider, damn, sorry again, I mean Farcry 3, ah s#it I mean Thief.....Don't get me wrong, I think the game is fantastic, especially as I've never played the other Thief games so had no pre-conceptions and rose-tinted illusions to be dashed against the rocks.It's just certain things are slightly annoying, and come across as un-original, like the Swoop, (Dishonored Blink), and the Rope Arrow that can only be attached to rope wrapped posts, (ala Tombraider) . I mean, who climbed up their in the first place to attach the ropes. And the fiery bridge, (similar to both the Monestary in Tombraider and the burning building escape in Farcry 3), and the Beggar Queen, (Dishonored's Granny Rags anyone!).Like I said earlier, I'm still loving it and it seems a solid enough Stealth game to me, but a couple of changes would have made it fantastic, (IMO). Like a carry weight, (at least in the city), and having to return to Basso to sell the loot and get your gold and why don't you HAVE to return to him when you've completed a mission for him, again to collect my reward.It just seems a little silly been able to collect, probably a ton or more of precious items, (how many silver candlesticks / mirrors / flasks, can you carry. I accept that that mechanic may not be possible when on actual mission chapters, in the brothel for example, but side missions should end when you return to the person issuing the mission.Still, only a very small annoyance that really doesn't spoil the game that much.And, after that small negativity, it really is good. The mechanics are good, (a lot of people complaining about the contextualised keys, [space to climb, jump, swoop, etc], but I don't remember anyone complaining about it during the Mass Effect Series.)The graphics are good and clean, and in places dark, oh so dark. The options that can be turned on/off seem to go on for ever.The story is, well, meh. But I really am enjoying sneaking around, breaking into places and stealing stuff without getting caught, and as much as possible, without been seen.			"

												A good game that could've been great, but was ruined by variety of limitaions imposed by the release on older consoles.It's an enjoyable stealth FPS with some pretty good level design, decent storyline and it is a nice cuttlery stealing simulator too!Definitely has it's moments (scary ones, awesome ones and wtf ones), but still remains average at best.Unfortunately that good level design was as well limited by the same release on consoles. Levels are pretty tiny, there's a lot of loading screens (real ones and masked ones). The City feels small. Heck, the game overall feels small. And that is really unfortunate.Closer to the game's end, when you are running around doing side quests, you can rush through the city block (from load screen to load screen) in a matter of seconds.At some point it just becomes annoying.Main storyline is OK, nothing great, but not bad either.Also, I found that side quests are actually far more enjoyable than main quests because you have your freedom to get to the target however you like (not that you always have several ways, but yeah).AI sometimes does pretty strange things, which actually looks like bugs. There's also a strange thing about game saves - they seem to persist alert state on guards.Meaning that if you triggered alert and then loaded your last save, sometime (bug?) guards will still be in alerted mode.That's also annoying.Could it be better if they'd throw away older consoles? Probably. But sadly it's not.			"

However, can be very lagy, so i advise the people who laged in dishonered, hitman absolution, and this put the graphics low (it will kinda go slow but it is better than that other lag). Their is alot of loot in the game and i think of it like hitman absolution because in hitman i was a perfectionist and this game will make you want to be.

												Initially, sneaking about, looking around and stealing everything would seem to be a tedious affair, but very soon it became a fun activity.  Searching for the various paths and locations itself became one of the core game mechanic that also becomes an essential activity as the loot is needed to buy more tools and upgrades.  I had a lot of fun avoiding guards, sneaking in the shadows and pick pocketing most of the npcs strolling about.  It is this gameplay that made the entire game an enjoyable experience.  Also, started off on Thief (Normal) difficulty.Another game mechanic that I initially was not fond of but grew to like is the various map loading points.  Some windows will lead you to another part of the map which requires some loading.  Initially, I had to fumble my way through the various windows, searching for a path to reach my designated location and getting lost a few times.  All the windows have the same ""blue sheen"" so it required some trial and error to find the one that leads to another section of the city.  However, after multiple tries, I've managed to actually learn the layout of the city in my mind, and dont need to rely on way points to show me the way.  I was surprised to know my memorization prowess was good enough, and didn't need to rely on fast travels, waypoint indicators, and lots of hand holding.  I came to appreciate the developers design to remove such accessbility.On the technical side, there were some performance issues, which mainly is observable in the ingame cutscenes.  Fortunately halfway through the main plot, switching the game to use 32 bit binaries managed to solve the performance problems.  There was also a very recent patch that made the option to use 32 bit available in the launcher.  Kudos to the developer for including that.  Also the myriad of difficulty and hud options is heaven sent.  I expect lots of videos popping up showing how gamers would be able to complete this game at the highest difficulty along with disabling most if not all of the hud items.  Also expecting lots of 1st playthroughs with high difficulty bars set  on streaming sites.The only main negativity I found was the last chapter ending.  It appeared to be a haphazard work and it seemed that the developers just decided to brush it off.  This left quite a bad aftertaste, especially after having good fun previously.   Here's hoping an ending patch (ala ME3).Overall, an enjoyable game, especially if you're the type that likes running around collecting stuff with customizable hand holding.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It does some things right. But it does a lot more things wrong. It really does not seem to know what kind of game it wants to be. It starts off stealth and then turns into adventure/action near the end, with stupid boss encounters that are frustrating and nonsensical. The plot is awful. Pros+ Good atmosphere+ Graphics are nice+ Lots to doCons- Traveling between parts of game is a pain, map is not helpful in reminding you how to get to different parts- Poor story- Awful boss fights- Repeat animations (creeping through boxes and moving the same stupid animated pillar each time)- Unstatisfying ending			"

												There's a good game buried (somewhere) in here... but every time I think that i've found it, I fall down a one-way ledge while trying to explore the levels. There's clearly a lot of side content to be found, but don't go the wrong way or you'll miss it for good. I gave up and simply started running through the levels, alerting everything, and calling ""BASE!"" when I got to the next one-way ledge. Guards don't continue to chase and the game forgets that you were ever detected at all. You even still get the ""opportunist"" rating at the end of the level if you play this way. This is in contrast to getting ""predator"" multiple times when I actually tried to play the game as intended (knocking out a guard is equivalent to murder, I guess).On a technical note, the audio engine in this game is extremely wonky. Dialogue cuts in at a volume that might as well be random, as it seems to ignore the obstacles between you and the source half of the time. This is especially jarring if you're actually trying to play the game in a stealful manner.In the end, my (up-to-date) graphics driver crashed me out of the game, and I took that as a sign to stop playing.

												I immensely disliked this game and I wouldn't recommend it. First of all, the story is less engaging and more confusing. Reading the journal didn't give me much information either. Secondly, the map layout is horrid, and the map completely useless. The level is broken into several pieces and each is only connected to the others at one point. The drab design and atmosphere of the City makes it all the more difficult to nagivate through it. Thirdly, you aren't allowed to change the difficulty of the game. I thought the Normal (Thief) mode would be a good start for someone who's new to stealth games but it just got so repetitive and boring, and frustrating at some points, I wanted to move through the plot quicker by changing the difficulty. Nah. Can't do it. Finally, combat (choosing arrows when the enemies are alerted of my presense, bashing people, and dodging) is slow and clunky on the PC. I know this isn't an action game but it makes the Predator playstyle, which is the easiest of the three, very unenjoyable. Also, sometimes it's easy to get stuck at a level. It's probably a good idea to give hints on where/how to proceed when the action point (e.g. jump there) is easy to miss. Finally, while I know this has to do with the plot, I hated the atmosphere and colors of the game. It comes down to personal preferences but spending 30 hours staring at blues and greys and blacks isn't what I want to be doing.			"

												The main character is flat and is trying way to hard to be shady and mysterious and ""the lone wolf"".The ending ruins all the hours of fun you've had. The game is like the planning and preperations for a party a year in advance, and the ending is like the day of the party. You're so excited about how it's gonna be, but when the party is supposed to start, nobody shows up. Not a single person. And you are thrown back into daily life (doing side-quests you haven't finished up yet).The games is a lot of fun if you're not looking for a thick plot or complex characters, up until the ending. If I hadn't played the ending, and the game had just stopped working or something, I think I'd like this game a whole lot more.			"

												The game starts off pretty strong, but for a game about a master thief, you do remarkably little stealing. The gameplay feels like a clunky, non-lethal version of Dishonored. Combat, when it happens, is always impossible to win and unforgiving. Stealth is awkward, however I did appreciate some elements, such as the water arrows for putting out lights. The storyline is really sort of bizzare and entirely unengaging, and the final level has two ""boss fights"" that are very poorly designed and not fun at all. By the end of this game, I really just wanted it to be over.If it's cheap enough, it's not a bad stealth game, all in all, if you can get past the clunkiness.			"

												As a die-hard fan of the first two, and to a lesser extent the third, Thief games, I was filled with a sense of dread from the time a fourth game was announced until I finished it. Turns out, I was completely justified in this dread.They took everything that was fun about the Thief series and made a game with none of that in it. The first Thief game has a haunted quarter of the entire city with your loot somewhere in it. It leaves clues for you to discover and read. It forces you to find ways to scale the environment to check out places you can't easily reach. Exploration is not only rewarded, but essential to winning. This game, which I'll call Thief 4, prompts you to do everything needed. Just hold W to move forward until a glowing blue prompt appears for you to scale a wall, shoot a rope arrow, flip a switch, or grab a shiny object. At one point the combination to a safe with a key piece of loot is written on a note lying right next to the safe. That's what Thief 4 has for puzzles.Further, what they've done to the Thief universe is unforgiveable. They made Garrett into some kind of cross between the guy from Assassin's Creed and Marilyn Manson. He looks like a loser cosplaying as an even bigger loser. No offense to people who dress like losers and wear mascara while robbing houses, but that's just ridiculous. Garrett has destroyed mad gods and evil overlords and millennia-old beings of foul magic. There's no excuse for his appearance in Thief 4. They even gave him a whinier voice actor and pathetic lines to say. They removed everything interesting from his world, and filled it with repetitive brown barrels and splintered wooden planks.It's not a good game to anyone  in the first place, but to any fan of the Thief francise, it's a disgusting sin.

												Well, Thief is a game that makes me contradict myself a lot. Personally, how I feel about this game is split in half after I have finished half of the game play. I understand people when they say that they have cherished the old Thief games more than they do this, however, as much as it has flaws I found this game pretty entertaining so far.First of all, I am against comparing the latest game of the series to the previous ones because Thief on its own is a game that makes you feel as if you are playing a completely different game, as if it does not belong to the series and such games should be reviewed seperately from the rest. Here are the things that have caught my attention so far:+ The gameplay may either be fast paced or very slow. It totally depends on how you wanna roll. The fact that game offers you an aggressive approach even though you should not be playing a stealth game aggressively, is quite appealing imho. ( I am the aggressive type, what can I say ?) There are many options to how you may finish a chapter in this game and that is a huge advantage for Thief, pretty much since gameplay is the biggest entertainment source that a game like Thief may have. + Despite all the frame rate issues that I have pretty often, the visuals are outstanding to be honest. The dark, gloomy city is amazing and definitely makes you feel the atmosphere. I find this to be an important fact too since the game has to cover up for the lack of story coherence at some point, which is an aspect that I will talk about next.+ Controls are a huuuuge thing in this game. Everything is sooo responsive that Garrett immediately responds to every bit of control. After all, this is how a stealth game should be anyways. Considering how the responsiveness has improved the quality gameplay time, I am really glad they have paid attention to this. The moment the game tells you to walk in the water, you will start appreciating the flawlessness of the control design of the game.- I really love open world games, and I was really happy to see that this one is also one of that kind however the worst point that an open world game could get to would probably be not having any side quests. Luckily Thief does a little bit better than that ! But unfortunately sidequests are extremely linear and all about going somewhere and stealing something. That is it. If it had more versatility, the fact that it had some nice sidequests could have made me review this game much more positively. (Even tho I already am reviewing it positively, so imagine.)- Story sucks. Literally. Well I get that they have wanted to change it, tune it a bit but seriously it is really annoying to see even after you finish half of the game and yet do not understand a thing because of the lack of details and the cutscenes that feel like they do not belong or fit anywhere in the story. At the beginning it makes you feel like it has a great potential however I promise you, you never get to see that potential and it is just sad.- Music may get annoying after a while, at least it did for me so turning it down a bit helped a lot while trying to get into the game. With all these advantages, disadvantages and flaws, I really enjoyed Thief. I agree that it may not be the most memorable game neither of the series nor of the last year however it has some great potential with that gameplay. I also do not understand the hate pointed at it because people tend to bash something quite easily just because it does not look like the previous versions. So try it out and you may really enjoy it even though it is not perfect.			"

												Overall, Thief is not a terrible game, it’s just a terrible Thief game. If you’re a fan of the series, you’d be better off setting aside expectations that this might meet the grandeur of the previous three games. It does not. If you can treat Thief as its own individual product, you’ll find a decent stealth game with some fun stealing thrown in.Thief has some good ideas and the client jobs (rather than the story missions) hint at how good the game could have been.In all honesty, I hope Thief gets a sequel. Even with its missteps the Thief reboot is still salvageable, but the odds are that Square Enix will push this series back into the shadows.My full review can be read here:http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/GRiVEN/review-thief-missed-opportunities-271991.phtml "

												How to ruin one of the best game franchises in history: 1- Take the main character and remove just about everything that's interesting about him, 2- take a semi-creepy, steampunk city of stone and metal and turn it into a bland, wooden frontier town, 3- remove nearly all references to the original stories and plots, 4- add in a bunch of ridiculous combat modes and useless play styles, 5- throw in a story that is boring, makes no sense and leaves you scratching your head at the end, 6- slap the title """"Thief"" on the box and hope that people don't notice what a complete trainwreck it is before you bring in a ton of money. My OCD, completionist mindset is the only reason I was able to finish it. I think I'm going to have to pretend that it never happened.			"

												Can I be blunt here? I played the original Thief games years ago. I liked them, though I never finished them. I played Thief 2014 a couple of months after it came out. I liked it and actually completed it. I won't be recommending though, due to the unavoidable issues that the game has, especially in the narrative, characterisation and level design department.It may be an unpopular opinion, but Thief 2014 is at least better than Thief Deadly Shadows. Of course, it isn't in the same league or plane of existence as the originals by Looking Glass but honestly, it isn't the worst Thief game. What I found playing it back in 2014 was that it felt like an upgrade to Deadly Shadows, improving on that game's shoddy performance issues which make it downright awful to even be able to play today. But lets get down to the nitty gritty review of this, quite frankly, utterly conventional reboot of a classic franchise. The large swathes of hate for this game came from, once again, unrealistic expectations being piled upon it. My only expectation was for it to be better than Thief 3 and I got that... by the fact that Thief 2014 is practically just a graphical update and can actually run on most PCs. It looks fairly nice for a console port from the new generation of consoles, though since the colour scheme is, well, nonexistent save grey, darker grey and pitch black, it isn't much of a marvel to look at by any means. The story and characters are so bland I can't even remember their names or any of their motivations. The rebooted version of Garrett is, quite simply, insulting to even the most passing of Thief fans. I kinda liked him in as the smug sarky social pariah he was portrayed as in the originals (and to a certain extent in Deadly Shadows) but I wasn't going to parade him through the streets as an shining exemplar to being a great game character. However, in Thief 2014, he's been boiled down to the barest minimum; gruff, unimaginative semi-violent white-guy no.2million. A Batman figure, pratically, dragging along the spunky sidekick girl apprentice for missions, who overplays the 'I don't need you around anymore, Gramps' vibe far too much.Thankfully, she is ditched from gameplay after the tutorial mission, thank God. However, the only real story thread revolves around Garrett sneaking into places to find out where she might be. That's it. She's embroiled in some kind of hilariously cliche McGuffin conspiracy plot that makes other hilariously cliche McGuffin conspiracy plots laugh out loud at it's sheer mundaneity. Overall, the plot is merely a framing device for the all the things the game feels it needs to rip off from other, better games, notably Dishonored. Moving on from the awfully poor narrative, the game revolves around an incredibly laborious hub world to navigate around, find collectibles and engage in burglary side missions. The map given to you for navigation is horrendously unintutive to use, as from it you are not able to piece together where exactly you are in terms of elevation or whether you are inside or outside. Interior and exterior mapping isn't layered, it's it own flipping layer! It calls for some of the worst map design I've seen in years, if not ever. Gameplay wise, it isn't all that bad. By playing the game as it's meant to be played (i.e. focus on staying in the shadows and getting to objectives by avoiding guards rather than taking them all out) is quite fun. Hardcore stealth is the best way to play and the game gives you a decent degree of customisation in order for it to feel just right as a hardcore stealth experience. There's an Iron Mode difficulty level (which doesn't allow for quicksave spamming/save scumming tactics at all) and the dumb 'Focus' ability ripped straight from AssCreed's Eagle vision, can be turned off in the options with no impact on story/level progression or collectible hunting. The wide amount of customisation options, accessed any time in either a mission or in the hub world. is welcome indeed. Garrett has the practically the same standard yet functional equipment he had in the last games. The water arrows extinguishes torches, the moss arrows grant him a quiet floor to traverse and the noisemaker arrow distracts guards. The rope arrows this time, are used entirely contextually in only a certain place, which sucks but isn't a dealbreaker. If the levels were as open as the original levels and this feature was included, then I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but as it stands the game Level design is strictly middle of the road. It's gone the Splinter Cell route of basically amounting to nothing more than either a corridor or a courtyard setup, together with having no more than a duo of guards to about 7 wandering around in any given areas. The cramped levels tightens the element of tension and, unlike Splinter Cell, doesn't feel quite as random when you are spotted. This game knows when Garrett is out in the open or huddled in a dark corner, and the AI respond appropriately. I'd have been ready to have gone far enough as write an angry letter to the developers or maybe held one of their kids to ransom had this been buggered up. The challenge comes from finding the right moment to move when guards aren't looking, which to me has always been the very essence of Thief as a series, it's signature element. Despite the ability to use different, un-Thief like playstyles, at its core the level design is built to highly encourage ghosting. My big gripe about the level design is by far the fact that points-of-no-return exist. It's baffling as to why they have included these, but it's no doubt a huge downer on allowing any of the missions to be enjoyable. With them, the game propels itself another 70million miles from the original games. I'm suprised I got so many hours out of this game. It was probably because, unlike Thief 3, I was so shocked to find out it didn't just crash on startup or loop the intro cutscene half a hundred times then crash, that I kept playing not noticing the sense of shock I was feeling. Yet of course, in the grand scheme of things with the franchise, 25 hours is probably enough time to see/steal everything in just one LEVEL in the original games. I was suprised I actually finished the god-awful story. Maybe it was the promise of the game delivering a pretty good horror segment around 2/3rds of the way through and a pretty sweet race across a burning bridge of buildings close to the finale. These certainly stand out among the highlights of the story and, for the most part they were nothing but 'set dressing'.Despite a good amount of things that it does quite decently (the ability to customise gameplay mechanics, the essense of Thief not totally lost but only hidden between the usual modern game standard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, a really good horror level...), Thief 2014 is still a mostly unneccessary game, delivered to mostly newer gamers only to remind them that this series once existed back in the dawn of PC gaming and publishers be damned if they can't attempt to wease some life out of it yet for the new gaming generation. It's bland hubworld, lazy map design, uninspired colour palette, merely serviceable level design and truly horrible plot outweigh it's few yet significant strengths.To sum up, Thief 2014 is only slightly better than medicore. It pales in comparison to the original games and, while the stories of the originals and Deadly Shadows weren't that brilliant, the one in the reboot drags it down to bargain bin realms of quality. However, it isn't as bad as people have said. There are far worse games out of there obviously, and worse games which ruined their franchises. To me, Thief 2014 didn't ruin the Thief series as Deadly Shadows beat it to the punch. Though I'd be a fool to deny it didn't come bloody close.5/10 "

												This might have been such a good game.  As a long-time fan of the Thief franchise, I really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, the longer I played, the more the game's faults started to irk me, up to the point that I couldn't in good conscience recommend it unless the price goes down dramatically.Initially, my opinion was quite favourable. The game certainly looks pretty. Light effects and dynamic shadows are very realistic, and the first-person camera works better here than in almost any other game I can think of. Garrett's hands are just gorgeous and there's a strong sense of being physically present in the world. I didn't even mind the much-maligned context specific movement. Some of the missions were quite enjoyable. The story might be utterly forgettable and both the protagonist & the City have been given an unnecessary makeover (what's with the eyeshadow, Garrett?) but nevermind, it's a reboot and I can live with change... as long as the stealth gameplay itself offers the thrilling and robust experience I remember from previous Thief games.Unfortunately, this is where the game falters. Previous reviews have pointed out the outrageous flaws in Thief's audio design so I won't go there except to say that yes, it really *is* bad. NPC awareness seems to fluctuate wildly: guards often won't react to loud noises like breaking glass and knocking stuff over, but on other times they seem to magically detect the player even when crouching well clear and in dark shadow. The game's light gem is really inconsistent and visually it's difficult to see the dark spots the designers have meant for you to hide in, as opposed to darkish-looking places that are only there for show and offer no cover whatsoever.I played the game on Master difficulty, and about half-way through I started hoping I didn't - not because the game was too hard (it really wasn't), but because it made moving around the City hub an exercise in tedium. The City is a hopeless, frustrating mess of constricted pathways that at first promises freedom of exploration but quickly reveals itself to be just a claustrophobic maze with only few ways to pass through. There are certain choke points in the City that you end up crossing dozens of times as you track side quests and missions, and slowly sneaking around the same set of guards for the umpteenth time quickly grows old. By mid-game, I really wanted to play on an easier difficulty so I could just snipe the city guards full of arrows, or simply run past them. These choke points are made even more maddening by a terrible audio glitch that replays snippets of NPC dialogue over and over in an endless loop for as long as you stay in that area. An example:

			A couple of of guys in Thief voicing their opinion. Repetedly		

 Should you resort to blackjacking the guards to shut them up, well... bad news,  every time you go through a loading screen the guards are reset and back in action. And there's a lot of loading screens, even entering one-room random apartments often results in one.So, moving around the City is time-consuming and frustrating, and the maps are no help at all. They're confusing, badly executed and glitchy: at one point, the minimap went crazy and reversed north, south, Garrett's direction and the location of the quest markers completely. The most frustrating thing, however, is the lack of freedom in missions and the City hub. Instead of free-form exploration and clever tactics that made the first two Thief games (and the third, to a lesser degree) so exhilaratingly immersive, the game wants you to follow pretty narrow pre-designed paths. What's worse, sometimes in missions you open a door or a window, and without warning the game will transition you to a new area... with no way back. No matter that you still had half a manor to explore and loot to grab - the designers think that the plot has moved on and so should you! Adding insult to injury, there are several scripted points when you are detected and need to flee, following an exact path decided by the designers. Trying to be creative by attempting to climb a wrong wall or taking a wrong turn results in a quick scripted death. There are weird platform jumper sections and puzzles that are so insulting to the player's intelligence that it begs the question why they were included in the first place. Most times there simply is no way to get the puzzle wrong: you just need to press the buttons the game tells you to press, in the order that the game tells you. Thief is not an absolute disaster of a game. I certainly enjoyed some of it. It's just an unpolished, awkward mess that tries to include every trick the designers learned from recent games like Assassin's Creed and Dishonored, while getting wrong the core experience of original Thief classics.

												I was very excited about Thief. It looked great, I'm a fan of the genere, and the story looked compelling. Unfortunately it is also extremely boring to play. There isn't a lot of depth, the VO and story are dull and nebulous, and most of your 'gadgets' are just different arrow heads and nothing too interesting. Not a terrible game, not great either.			"

												Chapter 4 completely ruined that game for me. At the beginning when you have to run across a rooftop (I played with activated ""slowed down"" option), and later in the burning keep where I died so fast each try that I gave up now and stopped playing. What moron designed that level? Was it not tested? So on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) this crap gets a bloody 2 (for the earlier chapters).			"

												VERY hopeful that they try to redeem themselves with a sequel or atleast a content rich DLC download. Pros: Graphically beautiful. Sounds are good (can't say the same for the music.) Cons: Game world was very narrow, felt claustrophobic. Game play was linear and held your hand alot. Music was awful (menu music was okay.) There was a few moments where I felt like an epic thief, The Bank Heist the Jewelry Store to name a few, but generally didn't feel very ""thiefish.""I'm going to recommend Thief because it was still enjoyable for me despite all the negatives.

												This game is terrible. Optimisation and presentation is so horrible I'm conviced the devs never even tested it. There is rarely any semblence of a challenge presented and the design choices never pay off. It is more often tedious than fun and if I hadn't paid money for it I would be disinclined to make it more than a few hours into the game. The fact that this was someone's attempt at rebooting the Thief franchise is offenseive.If you've never played a Thief game, get the originals ""Thief Gold"" or ""Thief 2: The Metal Age"" instead. If you have played the originals and were looking forward to a new one, skip this and buy Dishonored instead, since it is hilariously more like a Thief game than this one.			"

												It's a great puzzle game! Playing on a custom Master difficulty setting, everytime you take damage or are noticed, it gives a fail screen. It's fun to sneak in the shadows and try to figure out how to get from point A to point B. There are some split paths, and even if it's not as open as the first Thief games, it still gives room for options. Using only chapter or checkpoint saves gives even a more satisfying tense feeling when a guard walks right next to you and you get sweaty and your pulse starts climbing ""Will he see me, will he see me?!"".I've heard that it has some sort of combat mechanic? Don't have anything to say about that, haven't tried it out.About the story I can say that something that happened in the beginning was interesting enough to find out what exactly happened. Still looking forward for the answers. Perhaps not the most interesting story, but gives something else outside the puzzle elements to look to.			"

												I'm torn on the recommendation and here is why.Environment, atmosphere, graphics, gameplay was all outstanding. Map design was hit and miss, some places far too linear but some were great. Sound was an afterthought in this game. Tons of sound issues, looping, double sounds playing over each other, volume issues, hit & miss voice acting. Unlike previous games, sound really is not an integral part of gameplay. Lots of AI issues during gameplay, especially with guards not moving. Usually a save game or checkpoint reload will fix the issue. As a stealth game I felt I got my $60 and would recommend it to the average player. 6/10. Would be 7 or 8 if it didn't have all the bugs, sound and performance issues. They should be able to eventually patch this.As a long time taffer, I'd have to give this ""Thief"" game a 3/10. I've been playing Thief since release in 1998, and still play to this day. The System shock series and Thief are still in my top 5 games list. I believe most hardcore Thief fans like myself, are going to be very dissapointed with this title. If a company is going to retain all the IP and legal rights to a game, why waste it by throwing it out the window? There are some references in the game, and items which you might consider easter eggs that pay omage to the old games. They should have left this a stealth game in the Thief universe and left it at that.			"

(really dumb, and exploitable)Story is annoying character dies, Garret feels bad about her death. Year later, city uprising starts, plot kicks into action with special stones that you don't understand and aren't explained too well. Getting around guards is more of a chore than a strategy, feels less rewarding than the previous games (thanks to dumb A.I.). You spend most of your time in hallways or constricted areas. The first boss-fight is hard and rewarding. The OG trilogy was about being careful and patient, this game is just about dashing over quickly when the enemy turns his back.			"

												Unfinished and unpolished. These two words spring to mind after playing this game. Don't get me wrong, it's far from a horrible game....it's just not a very good one. Thief tricks you into thinking it's a well made AAA title in the first few play sessions but with every hour more spent on the game, the cracks really begin to show. Thief for the first half of the game is a really fun and clever game with a true sense of immersion that most games fail to achieve. I felt like I really had control of Garett and his every movement had a true sense of weight to it. I liked the integration of stealth, it felt fresh and original to me. The graphics and art style really stood out to me and praise really has to go to the art team behind this game; Thief truly does look incredible with it's excellent lighting and slick model animations.Once the second half of the game approached, I started to grow tired of Thief's poor design choices throughout. 'The city' main hub is clearly intended to act as a sort of sandbox style of area where you are encouraged to explore however the poor layout, constant alerts by poorly placed guards, unecessary loading screens, invisible walls, and lack of freedom make it more of a chore to play in. The story also started to get a few too many loose ends which wasn't helped by some poor voice acting and weak script. Where Thief really shines is when it doesn't try to hard and simply sticks to the core stealth elements. The development team really nailed these sections. It's unfortunatly overshadowed by far too many action sequences that try to be cleverly inserted simply to ""beef up"" the game, when in reality they simply are not needed and certainly detract from the overall experience. Again, Thief is a fun game for the first few hours and does propose some very clever and original game mechanics....it just never realises it's true potential. Worth getting if it's cheap or a free game but not worth full price unfortunatly. Hopefully if ever a sequel emerges, these serious issues are ironed out and we truly get the game this one could have and should have been. "

												If you're trying to play this game as a previous fan of the series, stop right there. You don't need to waste your time with this ""reboot"" of the Thief franchise. It's sloppy, unpolished, and generally uninteresting.      As a huge fan of the Thief series, this reboot was the last thing any one of the fans wanted. With massive talents quitting the studio during Theif's development, it should have been a fairly good sign that things were turning to the dark side.      Gameplay. Hoo boy, that's a doozy. First off, contextual jumping NEVER works the way players expect. In previous Thief titles, you could freely jump, peek around corners, and generally feel like a theif with more dexterity than a drunk burrick. This reboot throws all of that out the window. Too many times I've fallen from the roofs and narrow walkways of this horrible reincarnation of The City because I simply wasn't in the right place at the right time to press the space bar.     Instead of using Q and E for leaning (or whatever your preference), you have to first be near a corner to press E, the main function button to start a locked player stance of peering around corners. It's blocky, non-intuitive, and it takes immersion out of the game. Why you may ask? Because having to go through extra steps to make sure you're actually on a surface deemed acceptable to the engine to be peeked around is pretty awful when you could normally just press a button to peek.     Story. Another damn doozy. Take what was awesome from the Thief series and throw it out the window. If you know how Garrett got his mechanical eye, that is no longer present here. Instead you get some mystical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crystal stuck in your eye, which has no great effect for you. The mechanical eye allowed players to zoom in on distant targets, and it was crafted by a chaotic good type faction: The Hammerites. They are all but missing from Thief. (Don't even start with the cathedral, that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.) Voice acting was dull, and the story just felt lifeless and not quite as interesting as the earlier games. You don't feel for the other characters since they just seem too over the top, or too lifeless.     Graphics, ehhh. Okay, it's not a horrible looking game by any stretch...but thats because most of the maps are smaller than your most recent FPS levels. I'm not kidding. You have to sit through annoying window opening, or crawlspace animations before meeting a loading screen that lasts far too long for each small area. How did level size suddenly disintigrate from earlier games, when this game totes the famous line of being the ""next gen.""     In summary, if you're a fan of the game, you're better off pocketing the money and finding another title to spend your money on.			"

												There is a good game somewhere in here trying to get out.I think at some point someone was on the right track of where to head with this reboot and then it just never quite got there.Game mechanics were generally fine and more in the tradition of the original thief games when set on custom difficulty than many complained about but it still never quite managed to be fun.Collection of loot other than a goal to beat never really made any difference as the entire game can be beaten without ever buying anything.Story was fragmented leaving you never quite caring about anything.Shame, it was obvious a lot of hard work went into it and I'm a fan of the genre and original series.In the end, it felt like 2 of 3 people had a great vision of the game at different times none of them getting their way eventually landing on polished by but bland mediocrity.

												So I got thief on a special deal and decided, before i play it, to play Thief Gold. Thief Gold is the original and features many great things. It has a range of arrows that the player can use to do a lot of things from putting out torches to causing distractions on the other side of the room. It is older than me so my hopes were not that high but it is still a very challenging game. But anyway, to the game in question. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic PC port. I was not expecting this but you can change almost everything including controls, audio, graphics etc. Jumping into the game I found myself in a world of grim beauty. The artwork creates a very good atmosphere along with the eary music that keeps you on edge. Those are all nice things but after completing a couple missions I realised the city/hub world was an ""always on"". The guards will always want to kill you and that makes getting around to the shops quite annoying. I read some reviews of people saying they liked this as it was good for practising but I found it more of a nuisance. Another unneeded nuisance is that, as far as I know, the only way to increase arrow holding capacity is to buy three extra DLCs all 79p each. It seems cheap but I do not want to pay money for something they could neatly add as the player gains more focus points. That leads me on to the skill points in thief called focus points. They are gained from completing certain missions and by paying in game gold to ""The Queen of Beggars"" for an ever increasing price. This is fine. I am perfectly happy with the gaining of focus points but not so happy with the usage. The skill ""Trees"", even though they are barely branches, consist of two perks; one will read something along the lines of ""Slightly encrease your ability to..."" the second one will be along the lines of ""Majorly encrease your ability to..."". I do not see a point in having them if they barely do anything. Even the first branch gets given a point already allocated to it before you get given an open map, leaving one space left for upgrade that early on in the game.The puzzles were another thing that stood out to me. They all seemed so forced like a cry of attension reminding everyone you bought a game with more than stealth. THey never really fit into place and delay the proper gameplay. At the end of each level you are ""rewarded"" for how you played. I say ""Rewarded"" because I have yet to see what it does besides XP. The three wins you can get are Opportunist, Predator and Ghost. I put them in order of how good it feels to get them, Opportunist being last. Opportunist is where you steal a lot of things and put out the most light sources but doesn't feel as rewarding as the others. In the first mission it teels the that the main character, Garrett, is against killing people then lets you get rewarded for killing as many people as possible. The game should strive towards making people want Ghost or Opportunist, not just Ghost.Another thing that made me want to steal less was the fact houses had around 2 things to loot in them and some even had really oddly placed traps that make their houses unsusable and just dumb thief killing machines.The combat was actually quite clever. In the original you were given a sword and blackjack, but in this game you do not get a sword. This makes people want to do more stealth than if they could just complete the game with stabing everyone under the sun. The blackjack is still used for takedowns ,although in an animation format instead a 'Click to hit' way, but you can press 'r' (by default) to hit with your blackjack. One verse one battles are easy enough with correct dodging along with one verse two battles, but any more and you are certain to loose life.Overall Thief was still a good game, it has an immaculate stealth system and an atmosphere that keeps you on edge with the chance of guards always being around the corner. I will compare it to the original and say it clung to it like it should. So I will give this game 7/10 as it seems completely finished just could be better in all the above stated reasons. :3			"

												I never played the previous Thief games, so I had no predetermined expectations about what the franchise should be. My only hope was for a good game, but unfortunately for every part of the game that I enjoyed, there was something else that I didn't like.The player takes on the role of Garrett who, as the title suggests, earns his living as a thief. When one job goes wrong, Garrett stumbles into a conspiracy involving high society and a touch of the supernatural. The following story is okay, but it never really excited me, and I didn't find any of the characters interesting.Thief's gameplay is primarily focused on stealth. You'll want to stick to the shadows and either avoid guards/civilians entirely, or sneak up behind and perform silent takedowns. One very good design decision is that the player decides how forgiving the stealth system is, in the difficulty options. If you want detection to mean instant failure, go for it. If, like me, you prefer to have the ability to fight through your mistakes, you can do that too.However, the combat is terrible, so you should avoid it unless you have no choice. Both the bow and the melee weapon are slow and weak, and Garrett's armour is paper thin, even when you've bought their upgrades. Taking on more than two enemies simultaneously is almost certain death. This may be realistic, but its not fun.There are three types of missions. Story and client missions are mostly enjoyable. These require you to break into a unique building and steal a special item which will advance either Garrett's story, or a smaller arc for one of two friendly NPCs. The buildings tend to be quite large, have multiple entrance points and hidden paths to reach your goal while providing excellent stealth opportunities.Side missions don't have a purpose beyond earning extra coin, which you can also get by stealing from random houses along your path. These all take place in the City hub areas, which is the weakest part of the game. The level design here is very narrow, full of dead ends and only one or two paths through. Even if you ignore these minor missions, you still have to travel through the City to reach the story missions. There's no fast travel option, so the amount of times you have to bypass the same respawning guards, while listening to their one line of repeated dialogue, quickly becomes tedious. You'll also notice that most houses are empty, which makes the City feel lifeless.It wouldn't be fair for me to comment on graphics because I'm currently below recommended spec for gfx card, so I had to do some tweaking to get a reasonable framerate. Controls are fully rebindable and work fine with mouse and keyboard. Most elements of the HUD can be customised to find your desired balance between functionality and immersion. It took me 17 hours to finish the main quest, and I skipped some side quests, so value for money is good.Overall I don't think Thief deserves a thumbs down, but I also wouldn't view it as an essential purchase.

												Well, Thief is a game that makes me contradict myself a lot. Personally, how I feel about this game is split in half after I have finished half of the game play. I understand people when they say that they have cherished the old Thief games more than they do this, however, as much as it has flaws I found this game pretty entertaining so far.First of all, I am against comparing the latest game of the series to the previous ones because Thief on its own is a game that makes you feel as if you are playing a completely different game, as if it does not belong to the series and such games should be reviewed seperately from the rest. Here are the things that have caught my attention so far:+ The gameplay may either be fast paced or very slow. It totally depends on how you wanna roll. The fact that game offers you an aggressive approach even though you should not be playing a stealth game aggressively, is quite appealing imho. ( I am the aggressive type, what can I say ?) There are many options to how you may finish a chapter in this game and that is a huge advantage for Thief, pretty much since gameplay is the biggest entertainment source that a game like Thief may have. + Despite all the frame rate issues that I have pretty often, the visuals are outstanding to be honest. The dark, gloomy city is amazing and definitely makes you feel the atmosphere. I find this to be an important fact too since the game has to cover up for the lack of story coherence at some point, which is an aspect that I will talk about next.+ Controls are a huuuuge thing in this game. Everything is sooo responsive that Garrett immediately responds to every bit of control. After all, this is how a stealth game should be anyways. Considering how the responsiveness has improved the quality gameplay time, I am really glad they have paid attention to this. The moment the game tells you to walk in the water, you will start appreciating the flawlessness of the control design of the game.- I really love open world games, and I was really happy to see that this one is also one of that kind however the worst point that an open world game could get to would probably be not having any side quests. Luckily Thief does a little bit better than that ! But unfortunately sidequests are extremely linear and all about going somewhere and stealing something. That is it. If it had more versatility, the fact that it had some nice sidequests could have made me review this game much more positively. (Even tho I already am reviewing it positively, so imagine.)- Story sucks. Literally. Well I get that they have wanted to change it, tune it a bit but seriously it is really annoying to see even after you finish half of the game and yet do not understand a thing because of the lack of details and the cutscenes that feel like they do not belong or fit anywhere in the story. At the beginning it makes you feel like it has a great potential however I promise you, you never get to see that potential and it is just sad.- Music may get annoying after a while, at least it did for me so turning it down a bit helped a lot while trying to get into the game. With all these advantages, disadvantages and flaws, I really enjoyed Thief. I agree that it may not be the most memorable game neither of the series nor of the last year however it has some great potential with that gameplay. I also do not understand the hate pointed at it because people tend to bash something quite easily just because it does not look like the previous versions. So try it out and you may really enjoy it even though it is not perfect.			"

												For a game trying so hard to be Dishonored, you'd think it take some of the things people liked about Dishonored. The level design was the standout part of Dishonored, with open, expansive levels with plenty of paths and secrets. At first glance, Thief's levels look like they have a taken a page from the same playbook Dishonored copy-pasted from, but once you explore a little, you'll realize that there is never more than two paths on each level. There is a level where you have to sneak into a mansion. There were two obvious paths into the mansion: one through the front door, surrounded by about six guards with the intelligence of a Michael Bay fan; and another path leading to a vent, which was completely unguarded. I first went through the vent but, upon realizing that the vent just put me behind the front door, I reloaded and played the other path. Another bonus of Dishonored were the abilities, each of which had their own use for exploring the levels. Thief's abilities are almost all boring passives, that I didn't upgrade at all after the initial level. Thief's abilities have no use in the levels, they open no new paths. There is almost no point to stealing things after the first few levels, as once you have the wrench and the wirecutters, the upgrades are almost completely useless. The focus is lifted right out of Hitman: Absolution because originality is hard. The game pretends to encourage different playstyles but anything other than pure stealth is completely unreasonable. The only way to kill guards is the bow and all of the lethal arrows are absurdly expensive. I'm alright with a game being a stealth game, Square Enix, you don't need to cater to the ritalin popping droolers who get bored when their fellow man isn't being exterminated at a rapid pace. Have some backbone and stick to your guns: If you want to make a stealth game, make a stealth game.			"

												Horrible game very repetitive, some puzzles are stupid only worth it if it was $5, multiple paths to finish missions etc no real consequences for any action, easy to stealth. Recommend master difficulty if playing once. Press e (or x in my case with controller) to do everything  every 20 seconds. QTE`s for some actions like opening a window or getting around tight spaces usually takes 5-10 seconds with a bit of button mashing.			"

												Having never played the original thief games I was not sure what to expect from this game. I did like dishonored, which I thought was a decent game, nothing amazing. Do I think this is a better game than dishonored? Yes and no.Technically the game is nice looking, I'm running 1600p with a 290x and it runs nice. The typical unreal engine stuttering and texture loading is an annoyance, but not a game breaker. What the MAJOR pain for me is the layout of cities with loading sections  littered all over the place when going through windows.The button bashing when opening a window is an obvious attempt to mask loading times. The objective markers are vague and had me trying to find ways into some places which were not on the current map, I needed to go through a loading window and go around behind. These are the flaws in my opinion which stop this from being a great game. Last gen cross platform games are still hurting people with PCs and new consoles.I'm not going to bother discussing the plot, because it's about as interesting as watching paint dry.With all the above flaws the game is enjoyable. Gameplay is more enjoyable than dishonored while technically dishonored is more accomplished.+Graphical lighting effects+Dark and dank, but always looking pretty+Gameplay is satisfying and sucks you in+Nice sound effects-Crap story-Technical limitations of engine breakup the fun-Boring charactersOverall a good game which does great in some areas and falls flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥in other.8/10 "

Posted: March 12, 2014
												So I got thief on a special deal and decided, before i play it, to play Thief Gold. Thief Gold is the original and features many great things. It has a range of arrows that the player can use to do a lot of things from putting out torches to causing distractions on the other side of the room. It is older than me so my hopes were not that high but it is still a very challenging game. But anyway, to the game in question. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic PC port. I was not expecting this but you can change almost everything including controls, audio, graphics etc. Jumping into the game I found myself in a world of grim beauty. The artwork creates a very good atmosphere along with the eary music that keeps you on edge. Those are all nice things but after completing a couple missions I realised the city/hub world was an ""always on"". The guards will always want to kill you and that makes getting around to the shops quite annoying. I read some reviews of people saying they liked this as it was good for practising but I found it more of a nuisance. Another unneeded nuisance is that, as far as I know, the only way to increase arrow holding capacity is to buy three extra DLCs all 79p each. It seems cheap but I do not want to pay money for something they could neatly add as the player gains more focus points. That leads me on to the skill points in thief called focus points. They are gained from completing certain missions and by paying in game gold to ""The Queen of Beggars"" for an ever increasing price. This is fine. I am perfectly happy with the gaining of focus points but not so happy with the usage. The skill ""Trees"", even though they are barely branches, consist of two perks; one will read something along the lines of ""Slightly encrease your ability to..."" the second one will be along the lines of ""Majorly encrease your ability to..."". I do not see a point in having them if they barely do anything. Even the first branch gets given a point already allocated to it before you get given an open map, leaving one space left for upgrade that early on in the game.The puzzles were another thing that stood out to me. They all seemed so forced like a cry of attension reminding everyone you bought a game with more than stealth. THey never really fit into place and delay the proper gameplay. At the end of each level you are ""rewarded"" for how you played. I say ""Rewarded"" because I have yet to see what it does besides XP. The three wins you can get are Opportunist, Predator and Ghost. I put them in order of how good it feels to get them, Opportunist being last. Opportunist is where you steal a lot of things and put out the most light sources but doesn't feel as rewarding as the others. In the first mission it teels the that the main character, Garrett, is against killing people then lets you get rewarded for killing as many people as possible. The game should strive towards making people want Ghost or Opportunist, not just Ghost.Another thing that made me want to steal less was the fact houses had around 2 things to loot in them and some even had really oddly placed traps that make their houses unsusable and just dumb thief killing machines.The combat was actually quite clever. In the original you were given a sword and blackjack, but in this game you do not get a sword. This makes people want to do more stealth than if they could just complete the game with stabing everyone under the sun. The blackjack is still used for takedowns ,although in an animation format instead a 'Click to hit' way, but you can press 'r' (by default) to hit with your blackjack. One verse one battles are easy enough with correct dodging along with one verse two battles, but any more and you are certain to loose life.Overall Thief was still a good game, it has an immaculate stealth system and an atmosphere that keeps you on edge with the chance of guards always being around the corner.

												The screenshots and video clips looked promising. The reviews sounded promising as well. I was fairly pumped to get the game.Boy was I disappointed.While this game looks fantastic, and parts of the gameplay are fantastic as well, I felt that the game went off down a really strange path with the storyline by introducing ghosts and whatnot that, for the lack of a better explanation, simply felt weird. I wasn't sure that I was playing the same game after a few chapters or that I was a thief. After all the game is called Thief, not ghost hunter.The controls fell short as well. The characters movements felt extremely unnatural and even lacks the ability to jump. Yes, you can't jump. What a basic movement. Crouching and running felt awkward and I died several times because of this.They only weapons you get are arrows, and those are far and few between. Good luck actually fighting anyone. There's tons of swords, why can't you use them? Sure, the game is about stealth but even ninjas have knifes and swords.I don't even think I'd recommend this game if it was free. The headache and frustration simply aren't worth it. Spare your sanity and find something better. "

												This has nothing to do with the original series and is much worse than the first three Thieves. Admittedly, that's a high bar to clear. But even judged on its own merit, this is not a good game. The level design is linear, your tools of the trade only work on designated spots (jump included!), the writing is bad, the sound design very flawed (the volume is all over the place). Moreover this screams ""consolitis"" unashamedly: For example if you play with keyboard and mouse, you must not turn off the frame-search helper, otherwise you won't know where a hidden button behind a picture frame is. Players with a gamepad get a vibration, for kb+m there is no alternative apart from a UI signal.Everyone forgot about this game, its price fell and there were no cry for more.Do yourself a favor and buy the first three Thieves. Or play them again. Or play the Dark Mod. Nothing to see here, just a butchered series.			"

What to pay to be happy with the purchase : < $20, < €17TLDR : Incredibly dissapointing. Dishonoured is a far superior game overall. THEIF is a dumbed down console game through and through. Simplistic maps and a shoddily implemented story really let down the artists/animators/coders that worked on the game. Compared to other titles, the initial price tag of 60 euro is insane. So much more could have been done with the components and IP they have here, but ultimately the oddly mismatching visual art and gameplay make sense when you did deeper. Reading up on the tumultuous developement history THEIF which dares take the name of the original franchise, is nothing more than an admirable last ditched revenue recovery, however as a title, it's mediocre.------------------------------------------------------------The BAD :The plot is disjointed and jarring, giving the impression they've hacked great chunks out with a blunt axe at the last minute. Important chunks. Like hearts and livers, not little fingers or toes.You have to spam E to open windows, which you can't cancel out of. Going through a window often causes a load screen, even if the ""house"" you're going into is a single small room. The entire game is extremely sectionalized, and there are many, many, many load screens. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to go through several screens just to go upgrade your gear or buy new arrows.The stealth system, one of the main parts of the game, seems little more advanced than Skyrims.You're funneled down paths. Choice is an poor illusion here. Cool toys like the rope arrow have their potential wasted, given they can only be used at set locations. You can't even swing on ropes. Often you'll be a short distance from a hand hold, but garret will clutch the rope, unmoving, like a scared child.You have a claw with a rope on it, which you use in maybe two ""press X"" contextual locations, Even although you can rappel with it, at no point are you allowed to manually rappel or use the rope-claw.If you die, several locations will respawn you in the light, right in view of a guard.The upgrades aren't explained well at all, and have little to no effect.Every time someone swings at you for the first time in combat, a dialogue box pops up telling you to press V to dodge. (see my Thief video for an example.)The noises you make in mele combat seem to come from a completely diffent voice actor than Garret, almost sounding female at times.Trying to get GHOST rankings is infuriating, and not fun. Apparently picking a pocket is not ghostly.Side missions would be much more cool if the city were open world once you completed the game or something, but it's not, so doing them becomes a slog of load screens.Reloading the the clock tower area a few times seems to cause a memory leak or something.Stealing things doesn't make you feel good. Most of the stuff you steal that you can use for cash is very low value, making going out of your way to lift shiny things somewhat pointless. The biggest steals are cosmetic, and even then they aren't very ...

What to pay to be happy with the purchase : < $20, < €17TLDR : Incredibly dissapointing. Dishonoured is a far superior game overall. THEIF is a dumbed down console game through and through. Simplistic maps and a shoddily implemented story really let down the artists/animators/coders that worked on the game. Compared to other titles, the initial price tag of 60 euro is insane. So much more could have been done with the components and IP they have here, but ultimately the oddly mismatching visual art and gameplay make sense when you did deeper. Reading up on the tumultuous developement history THEIF which dares take the name of the original franchise, is nothing more than an admirable last ditched revenue recovery, however as a title, it's mediocre.------------------------------------------------------------The BAD :The plot is disjointed and jarring, giving the impression they've hacked great chunks out with a blunt axe at the last minute. Important chunks. Like hearts and livers, not little fingers or toes.You have to spam E to open windows, which you can't cancel out of. Going through a window often causes a load screen, even if the ""house"" you're going into is a single small room. The entire game is extremely sectionalized, and there are many, many, many load screens. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to go through several screens just to go upgrade your gear or buy new arrows.The stealth system, one of the main parts of the game, seems little more advanced than Skyrims.You're funneled down paths. Choice is an poor illusion here. Cool toys like the rope arrow have their potential wasted, given they can only be used at set locations. You can't even swing on ropes. Often you'll be a short distance from a hand hold, but garret will clutch the rope, unmoving, like a scared child.You have a claw with a rope on it, which you use in maybe two ""press X"" contextual locations, Even although you can rappel with it, at no point are you allowed to manually rappel or use the rope-claw.If you die, several locations will respawn you in the light, right in view of a guard.The upgrades aren't explained well at all, and have little to no effect.Every time someone swings at you for the first time in combat, a dialogue box pops up telling you to press V to dodge. (see my Thief video for an example.)The noises you make in mele combat seem to come from a completely diffent voice actor than Garret, almost sounding female at times.Trying to get GHOST rankings is infuriating, and not fun. Apparently picking a pocket is not ghostly.Side missions would be much more cool if the city were open world once you completed the game or something, but it's not, so doing them becomes a slog of load screens.Reloading the the clock tower area a few times seems to cause a memory leak or something.Stealing things doesn't make you feel good. Most of the stuff you steal that you can use for cash is very low value, making going out of your way to lift shiny things somewhat pointless. The biggest steals are cosmetic, and even then they aren't very ... ""cosmetical"" ... some of them are even just a tickbox inside a chest in your hideout.The GOODLockpicking has been done far better than assassins creed 3, but that isn't hard.

												Such a huge letdown, I just hope either Eidos learns from this or lets Otherside Entertainment get the rights back to Thief. I do not recommend anyone to suffer through this mess. Either play Thief 1-3 or just go play Dishonored 1-2 if the older Thief titles are ""too old"" for you. Either option is a better one than playing this POS.			"

												The game isnt horrible, but it certainly is NOT worth the 50€. I loved the other Thief games, and i even still play them sometimes, but after just 3 hours of gameplay, i became bored and tired of the constant 7 FPS, the unlogical stealth system, no nostalgic enemies, stealing knives, headshotting enemies without killing them and the story. I dont recommend this game, but if you really want it, wait until theres a sale. 4/10 from me.			"

												If you liked the original Thief titles and want to get your fill of sneaking around and (maybe) killing people, just pick up Dishonored instead. The new Thief is an awful game by most accounts. I forced myself to play it, and it looks like company politics and bad project management got the best of this title.  It's really a shame. Really, really a shame. But as I said, just play Dishonored.			"

												First of everybody who says it is not the good old thief and it is different game go play the old thief and don't complain about this one. I've been playing it for very long time i've been almost everywhere in the City did everything and played through chapters very slowly and enjoyed awsome views and moments.Graphics are one of the best i've seen in my life, music is very good and gameplay is just perfect.There so many great things about this game i could talk for hours. Only 2 things are bothering me a bit and it is story witch could be better and A.I. sometimes they are very smart and clever but there was a few moments where they were stupid. I love it and i would give it 9/10			"

												This game broke me. I haven't played a game to bore me this much since... actually, as a matter of fact any game that I buy and bores me under 2 hours I decide to refund it. I bought this back in 2014, at about 2 months after its launch. Haven't installed it for 2 weeks, like the total fagot that I am, started playing, and I was bored to death, uninstall it, hide it in my library forever. Now, it's summer time and I decide to come back to some of the older games to get some avg completion rate for my 'chievos.And now we come to the actual game, and let me start right off the bat that the game isn't fffffFFF♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE, ALRIGHT?? There is no need to melodramatise this review for no reason, just as pretty much the rest of the negative reviews are doing it. And before you start downvoting this review for actually being positive, keep in mind this is one man's opinion AND I'm trying to understand the loyal fans of the series. Believe me, I do. For a fact I haven't played any of the previous Thief games myself, however I DID see speedruns and let's plays and I have to agree that the games sure are awesome, even for this time. But now, not as a fan but just as a guy that decided to play this game, let's get riiiiiiiiiiiight into the- nah, not doing the Keemstar thing. This is Thief.Actual review:If you haven't already guessed the premise by the title alone, God, I just don't know what a Thief does in this world, he surely doesn't, you know... STEAL people's belongings by any chance, does he? No, he actually just gives random foot rubs to all civilian he encounters and kisses them on the cheek to say ""Good night"".And yes, you steal stuff. Lots of it.What is the actual story behind this game? Well, imagine Dishonored without all of the cool powers. Then you got Thief, ez pz. The long version is that the city you live in with the name of... ""city"", has caught a disease called ""the gloom"". In the game, we don't get to see anything of what the gloom does, so we'll call it dibs and say it's just death. Or black plague the becoming/part 2/whatever. In this dark age, quite formerly and literally, as we'll see about that in a bit, the world, or more like, the ""city"" is being ruled only by royal blood and the rich, which gets the time period just right. Well, that and the fact that there is an unnatural power that apparently touching you turns you to Superman and the rest get transformed into big scary african monsters. WE ALL LEARNED THAT AT THE HISTORY CLASS, DON'T DENY IT!That was the overall of the world, by my understanding anyway. And I think by devs standards, too. The other half of the coin consists of the protagonist of the franchise, Garret, following through his new adventure of stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥/span> saving his sidekick from becoming a godess of destruction and stopping a crazy man of injecting 'juana into people to make them the big scary african monsters. That's not what I had in mind. Especially since we're talking about a game where your main goal is to, you know, steal things. Let's just say you rob the levels in the process, so that counts. Now, onto the gameplay!Since we're talking about thieving people of their belongings, the whole idea of the game is to stealth your way through everything, using your well-acquired gear as well as your Superman powers. Before getting to these subjects, the first is the light and dark mechanics from the previous games. This is your stealth folks: stay in the dark, remain hidden, stay in the light and everyone sees you. Even a 1st year student on game developing can make this happen, how can a big company such as Eidos could ♥♥♥♥ this up? Oh wait, THEY DID ♥♥♥♥ IT UP!A lot, and I mean it, a LOT of the ♥♥♥♥ing areas, both in the hub and the chapters have these places where you can stay right under the lamp post in the middle of the crowd and stay unseen OR stay in a corner covered in darkness but there is this one particle of light and you're given away, just like that. Mates, if you couldn't get the one thing right about a stealth game, that being your actual stealth, you blew it day-♥♥♥♥ing-one. GOD!Ugh, I feel bored already. Giving to its credit, there are multiple ways of making your way in or out of a place and the whole game can be beaten as a ghost main. You can access these ways with your gear, which may include a wrench for opening up vents, a prybar for windows, rope arrows(self explanatory), and my favourite: the claw, for reaching higher ground places. Now there aren't that many ways of going your way around(about 2 or 3 per mission), and I think that hurts the game quite a bit, mostly in replayability. Instead, if you want to replay the whole damn thing, you will have to go for all of the loot and collectibles, as well as completing the mission objectives, which aren't that special, but they're there and give extra money at the end of it, which never hurts. On the other hand, the collectibles are looking fantastic, always feels so NICE to get one expensive piece of jewelry made out of gold and all sorts of precious stones and gems with all sorts of meanings behind them. There are also plaques you will find across the city, as well as paintings, which whoever designed them has a mind beyond our plane of existence. He makes furry porn. That's about it.Now to the chapters and the hub said earlier, that's your game. There are a total of 8 chapters and a couple of side-quests and jobs. The hub itself is pretty big, with a lot of areas to explore and collect all of the possible loot. Too bad you can't keep exploring without stumbling on a loading screen. No seriously, what's up with that? I swear that I have waited through more loading screens than my entire Fallout New Vegas career. Hell, Fallout 4 at that. What, did the devs had a problem making the hub actually... OPEN TO EXPLORE?! Not only that, some aparments have thein own loading screens. And they bear nothing. Maybe a collectible and some loot, but no life, no guards, no extra hidden room, no NOTHING. So just a huge waste of time of yet another loading screen. I swear they have a fetish for this. One last thing about the hub is that it actually changes while progressing the storyline, but not by a lot. A few more npcs are added, some guards are removed, some added, nothing particularly noticable, but they are there. Also, from the earlier ""dark ages point"", I'm surprised how there is no single crack of sunlight to be seen anywhere in the game. Guess they took the dark part a bit too literal.The chapters themselves... oh god. Let me tell you that the first half is BORING. It feels like all of those levels are part of the tutorial, and that is simply a bad move, as I never felt like I had any of the liberty the game gives you in the the second half. And if you managed to get to chapter 5, that, my friends, is finally the point where the game is starting to feel alive, which is ironic for anyone knowing this chapter. Anyway, from this point I started to see the ways around, use my water arrows to extinguish fire, create mayhem through the guards by simply throwing one bottle and there are so SO many things I was able to do here that I couldn't do previously. Truth be told, I had a lot of fun in these chapters! To the point where I said this game is worth the damn purchase! But it just takes so long until then you'll most likely die of the boredom more than anything else. That and fall damage loltl;dr To recap, the stealth is broken, the first half is painfully boring and the upgrades are questionable. But beyond that, in the other half the game is playable it I felt like it was worth spending my time there. The final verdict for Thief is a 6.5/10. I'd say that if you catch this under 10 bucks, it's good. If you find it at 5, you're golden. Steam can't let me write anymore, so I say this has been one man's review, the decision is all up to you.

Felt Like I Was Playing an Unfinished GameThe long and the short of it is this: Thief is, quite simply, not a game I would ever recommend playing. To anyone. Do I regret playing it? Not exactly; some parts of the game were fun and enjoyable. But on a whole, I could have spent that time on a better, more worthwhile game. Dishonored and the original Thief games come to mind, and I've heard good things about Deus Ex. I have a few main reasons for disliking it this game: bad gameplay, poor level design, and low quality writing.GameplayI found the gameplay to be severely underdeveloped, counter-intuitive, and choppy. There is no ""lean"" control as there is in Dishonored and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Not only can you not perform this simple motion wherever and whenever you like in Thief, but if you're going to look around a corner you have to approach the corner and press E. Which is the action button for everything. So while you are searching a desk, you may find that Garrett gets in one of his jumpy moods and suddenly huddles behind it, peeking cautiously around the corner at...nothing. All because this feature was poorly designed. Also, counter-intuitive actions. You hold E to peek through a keyhole and press right-mouse to stop? Who thought of that awful idea? It makes sense to me that you press one button to start an action and the same button to stop it.Also, whose idea was it to have the player spend gold on upgrades that make a task harder? I spent some good money on upgrading Dexterity. Does the upgrade make lockpicking easier? NO. It is more tedious, it takes longer, and it uses Focus. Bad, bad idea.Level DesignOn several occasions while I played the game, I found myself unclear on what I was supposed to be doing and how I was supposed to do it. The tasks and how to accomplish them just weren't always clear, and it's not because I'm an inexperienced gamer or don't know what I'm doing, it's because the level and the sequence of events/objectives was not thoroughly developed.Also, was anyone else frustrated by an apparent inability to use rich text in the documents? It's really not that hard, guys. Couldn't you just write an italicized word like this rather than *like this*? Nothing interferes with a game's immersion like seeing that kind of notation to remind you that you're not, in fact, a thief in The City during a time period similar to the 19th century; you are in fact in the 21st century, playing a disappointing game.A note on graphics: it was excessive. I turned all of the settings all the way down on my computer, and it still crashed a good 20 times or so. I've played games with great graphics on my computer (all 3 Bioshock games, Portal 2, The Talos Principle, etc) that never made it crash; Thief could have easily been a good-looking game that didn't have a seizure every hour or so.Writing...Do I even need to say much on this? So much drama. The dialogue was sub-par, and Erin is the most annoying, angst-filled teenage girl I've ever seen in a game. The story of the game just felt...dry.ConclusionThief was a game that tried to be everything that Dishonored was, and fell miserably short. Dishonored benefited from a rich and immersive story, fluid and intuitive gameplay, and well-designed levels that gave the player options without confusing them; Thief had none of these in its favor. Eidos missed a great opportunity to make Thief into a fantastic reboot, and they could have done it if they had held themselves to a higher standard and taken the time to produce a quality game. Unfortunately, they didn't, and this is the result.			"

I'd pay $10 just to play the Asylum level once, but other than that, the rest of the game is horrifically linear and rather boring. It's just not worth full price at any time. Wait for a <$10 sale, play past the asylum level, as it's the high point of the game, and then go back and play the other Thief games, which are actually good stealth games.			"

												Thief ReviewA great, rich and decent franchise has something new to offer for us, when was the last part of the Thief's franchise? maybe in 2009. Eidos-Montréal finally had a new project to finish, they had been working in the game for a long time. the question is, will the franchise complete its games in a successfully/unique way, or with a stupid, foolish?

PresentationThief series had many rare moments and elements which every single substance turns your gameplay experience upward.The new Thief doesn't make any sort of sense, it's bad, boring, poor and less than tradition, it's hard to infer a good result, Relieves your boredom quickly, to be honest, I have enjoyed patience more than the new Thief, I guess, nobody would prefer it over Dishonored. Thief gave me the worst story, elements, almost everythin'. If you are looking for a stealth fun to play game, so there are tons of stealth games which are very better than Thief, translating the word ""Thief"", ""the person who steals without taking a permission"", ""taking things without a permission"", not a ""stupid story that is not related to stealing"", like what Thief did, I see.

Difficult, Very Difficult, Easy or Very Easy?Very ♥♥♥♥ing very difficult, Thief depends on your intelligence, and because doesn't has that enough quantity of tools to spy, to kill, to think quickly, Thief has only a bow to do, that which makes it hard and shows your foolishness. ""NEVER"" play this game in Master (the difficulty). the zombies are so tough and there are tough conditions to escape a zombie area. for the guards, they are so dumb but in the other hand, they have a high vesion so they can see you from distances, and they can realize your foot steps by brightness or by the foot step's sound done by you (I mean, the player itself), there are ton of impossible choices to escape a certain place, but when I say, ""Impossible"" means ""Impossible"", that what makes Thief a bothering experience, you shall think from where to go, to explore and which kind of bow shall you use, unfortunately, there is no tool to kill except the bow and the weak, stupid, boring hammer, my advise, don't play it on Master or Thief (""The Diificulty"") if you are dumb at thinking immediately.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivSr7YEd0wgThe Main CityThief also includes a city which has some of Dishonored's elements, like trading, is pretty similar to Dishonored's trading center, Includes some friendly characters but beyond the city, there is so much enemies, stupid guards, you know it. Don't predict a big city and don't predict an open-world city, no, it's smaller than you thing, very very very and very smaller than you think. the city is boring as hell, it's just a city to prepare your needs and your wants, not to live, make, build, mine, it's mainly needed before starting a storyline's chapter, because you'll be in a need situation to prepare thing before starting up a chapter, ""but"" if you didn't prepare thing up, you'll mix up the current mission/chapter.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PpEWYDwJ8The VerdictThief is a pretty poor experience, lack of important tools, boring story, annoying gameplay. a stealth game should include tools, not only a boring bow. poor combats are caused by ""lacks"", poor mechanics are functioning as a so funny mechanics, ARE YOU SERIOUS! I wounder, how the building had went to fire by whom using whoose thing is it used by whom. Thief isn't a good game, it's less than boring and less than stupid. to be honest, Thief is from my top 3 worst games of all time. if you don't trust me, so you're not a gamer, pretty clear that. But there is only ONE* thing that I loved about Thief, The Art Direction is the ""BEST ART EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE"", BEST ART AGAIN BEST ART, also in gaming, overall, so awfully boring, Thief made to cry by its unique boredom. I don't wanna play Thief anymore.Story: 2.5/10Gameplay: 0.5/10Graphics: 11/10Sounds: 0.5/10Music: 1.5/10+ Positives+Over the top Art Direction+Good Interduction for the storyline+Chapter 5 is atleast near fun- Negatives-Lack of tools-Lack of Things to Buy-Boring City-Too Much of Loadings-Poor Mechanics-Super Annoying Dogs, Birds to Alarm-Too doubtful in every foot step-In some, no way to cross through-Less than boring City-Choopy Framerate-Poor Comabt System-Contains tons of similar allays-Bow doesn't make any sense in killing silently-No found tools in exploration, just currencies-obvious technical problems-The sound effects and the music effects always plays the same-repetitive in each chapter-puzzles are super annoying-awful momentsThief is more than pretty boring experience and contains lot of obvious negatives, isn't a good game for more than a certain reason to it. improving, adding, touching the game, will be more alive and more exciting, said Iimonster297 to Eidos-Montréal  I want Thief to be more better, at this stage of developing Thief SO BAD.1.3/10 Sillyhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of_3FxnsCZcRecommended Price: 14.99$Games are Similar to It:DishonoredAssassin's Creed (City's lengh, a tower between a tower)Sly Cooper (In opening a safe) "

												I had high hopes for this game and honestly im pretty satisfied. Graphically this game is dark gritty and beautiful. I run this at max setting in 1920x1080 with no issues at all save the cutscenes which seem to lag a bit with the voice.The game play isnt much diffrent from the other thief games. They have added new tools and a nice upgrade system. The focus abilities to me seem a bit overkill for most of the options but do add some thing for new and old players. I dont use focus at all. I wanted the orignal thief experience. So i removed many of the new features by playing a custom game.Its like the old Thief games as long as you customize your gameplay experience. Make the game your own based off your play style. The option for added rewards by removing the new features from the game really makes it fun for me. If you were expecting somthing totally groundbreaking and new this game isnt it. That being said this is a good installment to the thief franchise and im happy to be able to play Garrett once again. If your new to Thief or a old school player give it a shot.(FYI: I'm glad rope arrow's are back i missed them alot in deadly shadows the gloves didnt do it for me lol)			"

												I have a somewhat old gaming rig that plays current titles resonably well on high or very high settings. It's running an Intel Core 2 Duo 3.3 GHz, two nVidia GeForce 9800 GTX+ GPUs in SLI and 6 GBs of RAM. Thief lists in its minimum requirements a ""high-performance dual core CPU or quad core CPU."" Apparently the highest performance Core 2 Duo manufactured does not make the cut. Granted this is a legacy LGA775 chip, but I wish the system reqs were a bit more specific. The game's benchmark averages 6.3 FPS on the absolute lowest settings while my CPU is maxed out just running the menu screen. I pre-purchased at full price and now I have to sit on it until I have a new rig, which I wasn't planning on building anytime soon. From what I hear I'm not missing much, anyway. Damn shame.			"

												A worthy reboot.If you've played the original then the changes may upset you. The originals had a steampunk shade to them before steampunk was even a thing, but this one does not. There will also be inevitable comparisons between the voice actors. Though if you let it stand on its own, Thief is solid. The gamplay is very reminiscent of the originals. The story is pretty good. The more open world exploration from Thief III is present and thriving more than before. There's a tinge of weirdness,  but not the same dose as the originals. Overall, solid and we'll see where it goes with the reboot.			"

												Custom difficulty is ABSOLUTELY the way to play this game. Put it on the Master setting, turn off focus, and set options that make it a 0 kill, 0 knockout, 0 detection scenario. This may sound like it would be too hard, frustrating, or even boring, but it's far from the truth. THIS is why Thief has been getting less-than-good reviews: the reviewers are ploughing through on the normal difficulty setting to get their ♥♥♥♥ing review out the door, and with all the helpful options enabled, a lot of what makes this game great gets screwed up.What you quickly realize playing a Custom setting of over 700 (there is an achievement for this) is that the maps were expertly crafted to accommodate this play style. There is always a solution that does not require any sort of confrontation, and it is this type of solution, whether it be quick-dashing from small shadow to small shadow, putting out lights, or creating distractions, that keeps the game thrilling in every engagement. In this way, every piece of loot is a challenge, whether it be attempting a quick lockpick while a patrolling guard is approaching or stealing a jewel from a tabletop right underneath somebody's nose.Meticulously blackjacking enemies and reducing the level's population one-by-one is much easier and robs the game of that constant sense of tension that works so well. When the enemies are a CONSTANT threat and you give yourself no ways to engage them, Thief is pure gold.It may be harder this way, and it will certainly be a longer game, but Thief is meant to be taken slowly, one area at a time, each room like a puzzle to be worked out.Perhaps Eidos Montreal's biggest mistake was not having enough confidence in their own gameplay and dumbing Thief down for the masses, hoping for a universal appeal. A hardcore, old-school type game might have gotten more attention in the press and more praise from the people who devoted some time to it.			"

												I am not a lot into Stealth games, or games that could be considered like that. I am not good at them. But this one is different, Thief amazed me, it blew my mind. This game has incredible, beautiful awesome graphics, an incredible art design and a really nice environment. Every model and level is really well designed. The gameplay is really good because it achieves to make someone like me feel like if I love Stealth. Again, I am not into a lot of Stealth games, when I play hitman. I do a massacre. I loved this game and if a friend would ask me about it. I will recommend him or her to play it. I really believe it will worth your time and plus you will have a great time visually. I just loved it.The things I really love:The story is very good. I don’t want to spoil but I loved how the plot was developing through the gameplay in a very unique way. I will not tell more about it because I want you to try it for yourself and experiment it.The graphics are stunning. Those are beautiful as I said. I really believe that the people behind the development of this video-game are 100% talented and skilled people that decided to make something great, and here it is. Thief.The thing I didn't like:The only thing that I didn't liked is that it don’t has a lot of action. But it's normal, I understand that it is a Stealth game. It has silent, slow action tactics which will bore to someone that loves games like Painkiller, Quake or Serious Sam wth continuous carnage and unmerciful killings, but still after that detail, the game is really impressive.

												This isn't terrible, and there are some genuinely good missions in it, but ultimately it becomes less fun the more you play it. I'm quite close to the end, but I don't care about finishing the game anymore. I have been doing a fair number of side missions, but still: 20 hours in, and I don't care about what's going on. It's full of clichés, such as the empty wheelchair rolling towards you in the corridor of the haunted mental asylum (seriously), and other games do everything here better. Get Dishonored and its Brigmore Witches DLC instead. A big problem is the city that connects everything. Familiarity breeds contempt, and you often have a lot of ground to cover to get from NPC to NPC which leaves the big feeling both big and small at the same time. You start to wish that some of the side mission characters might reward you with a fast travel option to other points on the map, given that you can't earn useful items from that work. Instead, we are forced to walk everywhere through a city that's bizarrely lacking interconnection. Often, you need to find an exact window to let you through into another city section. It is torturously stubborn when you're trying to get from A to B, and worse because of the completely unnecessary amount of loading points. Even with an SSD, this is still irritating. You'll quickly learn to hate the identical animations for squeezing through a tight space and the QTE to move the same fallen beam, and the ""Hold X, now tap X repeatedly"" thing for windows (which I could forgive if it was ever about a subtle movement to avoid being heard, but you will never be heard).This tediousness feeds into everything. I was playing for a long time wondering when I'd finally get a razor to steal paintings, or a wirecutter to disable traps, when Googling the problem finally told me that only one trader in the entire city sells those. This is one of many things in this dreary game that just makes you think, ""♥♥♥♥ you, Eidos"".Many reviews allege that the graphics are great, a viewpoint with which I strongly disagree. Animations, modelling and textures are pretty basic and old-fashioned. Swinging censers wreathed in smoke simply move their smoke field with them. Graphics settings appear to do very little to help or hurt the framerate, which is bizarrely low considering the lack of demand here (I have a 4GB Nvidia card, and it cannot keep the rate above 60fps at 1080p).

Posted: January 3, 2016
												Most of the things I wanted to say have already been said in the review section, but after two playthroughs (one for the story and challenge, one for assorted achievements) I feel like giving my two cents nonetheless. In the very likely case you don't want to read the wall of text below, my overall opinion is that while this game doesn't suck, it's also very much “meh”.If you want to play a Thief game, go play the old ones! I recommend the second :)If you want a modern, triple A spiritual successor to the Thief series that also allows for some really fun action gameplay, go play Dishonored.Thief 2014 is not wasted money, but definitely money that could have been spent better.My opinions on some major gameplay-related elements:Gameplay.The stealth gameplay is there and it's not bad. Sure, now you can see the alert status of enemies, but on the other hand I feel like their AI has been slightly improved: for example, they react to doors being opened\closed. The parkour stuff is really fun in theory, but you're limited to the places that the game decides for you (and conveniently color-codes for you). As a lot of other people pointed out, Thief I and II did this in a much more fun and creative way with the old rope arrows, fifteen years ago.There's a lot of potential for action gameplay and lots of upgrades, if you're into that; although it's kinda dull.Focus mode is basically Batman detective mode and conveniently highlights all the important things for you. It feels like cheating and it's kinda sad it was put in to begin with, but it can be safely ignored.There are also several action sequences and even QTEs. You can close your eyes when they come up, I guess.Level design.You could easily get lost in the old Thief games. The levels were huge and in order to figure out where your objective(s) was you could only rely on a minimalistic map, plus whatever hints you could find. In this game, on the other hand, you have an objective marker and a real-time minimap. The streamlining is also pretty noticeable: there's always a direction that's the correct one and in order to progress you have to keep moving in that direction; often times the game is even so kind as to close off parts of the level once you've reached a certain point. Since I'm on the topic of level design, this might be a good moment to mention how dark this game is. Not dark as in “it's night”, dark as in “there is no concept of brightness in this universe”: most things are black, grey or brown, any other color is actually a bleak shade of whatever that color is supposed to be. This has the double effect of making every level look the same and being pretty tiring on the eyes (in my experience, at least).Enemies.There are quite literally two enemies in this game. The standard human guard, and the freaks. The freaks are... the freaks. They all look the same and only appear a bunch of times, but at least they're pretty creepy and sneaking around them is slightly different. On the other hand, officers of the City Watch, Graven mob and random thugs are visually undistinguishable from each other unless you're actually in their face, and their “personalities” are the same: they all repeat the same lines constantly, relentlessly, until you know them by heart. In a game like Thief you need a decently varied array of enemies, both for gameplay purposes and to make the universe more engaging. Open world.Thief is an open world game. There's a (supposedly) sprawling city which you need to move through in order to reach the starting points of the game's chapters; and which you can explore to discover all its secrets. At first you're going to be awestruck by how big it is: so full of alternate routes, so full of secrets to find... but all that excitement is going to quickly disappear around the second time you're sneaking through the long path you're forced to take in order to get where you need to get, while you're trying to make sense of the map (spoiler: you'll never be able to make sense of the map). And you'll have to do this again, and again, and again.If all of this sounds familiar, congratulations, you've played Thief III! Except the City in the previous game wasn't as confusing, if I recall correctly.More ramblings of a salty fanboyThese are mostly minor nitpicks. You can safely stop reading here.The plot.In the old games the plot was some kind of creepy big conspiracy that Garrett stumbles upon because he's always where he isn't supposed to be; and it slowly built up level by level. Here they try really hard to make it extremely personal from the very beginning, but they do so using a character that's barely introduced and a world whose only inhabitants are idiot clones who spend their time wondering what's in the sloop. The plot is also at the same time predictably clichè and ridiculously vague. “Oh no, the bad guy wants to use the vaguely defined plot device to do... something! Oh no, now a new bad guy wants to use the vaguely defined plot device to do something else!”. ContinuityI can tell they decided to ignore all the series' lore because they thought burricks, treebeasts, haunts , automatons etc... weren't bleak enough for this modern triple A masterpiece of bleakness. The Pagans with their hilarious broken English and their creepy wood witch vibe are gone. The holier-than-thou, priests-turned-engineers Hammerites are gone. The Builder and the Trickster are gone. So how do you deal with making a sequel\reboot to a series while at the same time not wanting to use that series' lore, but wanting to keep the main character? Simple: you set it sometime in the future and make it so Garrett isn't actually Garrett, but another guy named Garrett who looks very similar to Garrett and is also an incredibly skilled thief, also has a fence who is coincidentally named Basso... you get the idea. And this is not a complete reboot, mind you, it's officially a future version of the old Thief world. You can check the wiki[thiefgame.wikia.com] to read more about it, because you sure as hell won't get more info by playing the game. Long story short, you can probably guess that I'm very salty about the complicated stupidity of this game's continuity and lore.Audio bugsThe in-game meThe in-game mechanism The in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.chaThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the vThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ery least questionable.nism that triggers dThe in-game meThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.chanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ialogues is at the vThe in-game mThe in-game mechanism that triggers dialogues is at the verymechanism that triggers dialogues is at the very least questionable.ery least questionable.BleaknessI've already talked a bit about how hard this game tries to be bleak, but I feel the best way to convey what it's like and also why I can't take it seriously is to write some sample dialogue, the kind that you'll hear constantly through the game.Guy #1: “My shift of♥♥♥♥♥♥shoveling is over.

												I have been a fan of the Thief series since it was first released over 10 years ago. That being said, myself along with many others, have a certain level of standard that needs to be upheld to really give the game a fair chance. Technology has improved by leaps and bounds even over such a short period of time, so it would be foolish to think it could be anything like the original in such a way that wouldn't already put a bit of a handicap on the view of the game. Mind you, that's not all true, as several aspects of the original series could have made and improved return and didn't, but I don't think that you should let that deter you from giving this game a fair shot.First off, if you were a fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution (I certainly was), then right off the bat, you might like this game (it was developed using the same technology by the same company). The game has that Human Revolution feel plus some aspects you might have found in Splinter Cell: Blacklist. At first, It feels very cover-based, but it does allow you the freedom to approach situations in any way you see fit (though it still may be pretty limited). The original Thief games were all about plopping you in the mission with a ""good luck"" and no idea what to do, without some deal of exploration. This game doesn't quite offer that level of challenge, as they will make objectives known to you, highlight items of importance, and allow you the use of the Focus ability (which basically shows you all the stuff you might be able to interact with), though it's up to you if you want to use it or not. This level of hand-holding in the various missions throughout the game may be what you aren't looking for, and if so, it's probably not for you. Granted, it's not idiot proof, so there's that.The original games gave you the choice of how to outfit yourself before each mission, depending on your playstyle, and this game does that too, albeit through the use of the hideout. You can store items in your stash for later use, though unless you like to stockpile items, I don't find it much use, as you can carry quite a bit. The game does let you begin certain missions without tools that would otherwise make it easier, encouraging you to scout around a bit. There is an ""open world"" feel to the game, as the major ""hub"" of the city enables you to roam around looking for extra secrets and loot to pay for your gadgets.The game does have an upgrade point system as well, which you can obtain by donating money to the Queen of Beggars or finding them in secret areas. You can also visit various people around the city who will sell you tools and trinkets for use on your missions. There are side quests, nooks and crannies, and a good deal of things to keep you busy in addition to the main story, which some people might find enjoyable. Depending on how you choose to play each mission, you are awarded points and loot based on how you acted (ie, did you kill everyone, avoid everyone, or use the environment to sneak around?) and if you completed other thieving objectives (such as not killing anyone, pickpocketing people, not being detected, and stealing all possible loot). These are unique to each mission, and the game doesn't tell you what you need to do, so you have to get in the habit of checking before each mission to see what you have to do.The map is handy, but it's also quite primitive. You can see major points of interest such as shops and objectives, but you can't set waypoints and you aren't always given a clear idea of what areas are dead-ends and what areas are transition points.The controls are very good, the graphics are great, and the music is fitting. The AI isn't too bad, and as you increase the difficulty, they get smarter, so it will keep you on your toes. The voice acting is pretty mediocre, but it's definitely not horrible. The story is not bad either.If you can overlook the fact that it's got some flaws and isn't the original game, give it a shot. It holds its own simply based on  the fact it's a Thief game.			"

												Very disappointing...I doubt that i could finish this game. No level design, no intriguing story, no pleasant and small secrets. It's a feeling some times that levels were created by generator, not a human... Nonsenses like stealing syringes from dirty mattresses in the slums, radiators in the houses of paupers, a lot of empty drawers (not a thing for atmosphere, not a thing for stealing) and at the same time heaps of different stuff in the rooms. Most of the playing time i feel not like a thief but like a beggar - ""oh a coin in the dust, let's pick it up!"" Some sort of torture when you need walk through the same places again and again with the same scripts between very small parts of the city (if this is an open city than - no comments).A secret for me - why the person can't jump at any place he chose, why impossible to perch on the pipe, why master thief has tricky bow but not a screwdriver or razor.So, if you are looking something like Thief 1 and 2, like me, this game does not fit.PS Pardon for my english			"

												The whole game feels very clunky. If you're climbing around there's a good chance you'll get stuck because you're not in the exact right position for the game to register you need to jump to the next ledge.The stealth elements are not much better. If you're discovered you may have little choice but to restart the area because you have no escape options at least not early on and combat only works 1v1 anything else and it's not worth the effort.When you're not being detected everything feels like a very linear path even when it looks like it may be more open. Sometimes there's a second way to go about doing things but it's rare and sometimes you'll require a special tool you'll only get later on. Had the combat been more fun or the game was more forgiving when you were caught it may have been better. It's not like it's a rewarding challange either. It's missing a bunch of little things that would have really made it a decent game.			"

												The game is a glitchfest. There are random invisible obstacles, ragdolls get launch into space when you put them down, NPCs sometimes get stuck while walking and start spinning around madly, HUD disappears completely. Somewhat entertaining, but annoying nevertheless.There's a lot of filler. Exploring dressers, bedside tables and picture frames is slow (due to animations and minigames) and unexciting. It's something I'd rather not waste time on. I'm a master thief, why am I stealing pens?Also, I'd give Thief the award for the most lifeless NPCs ever. Well, maybe just a honorable mention, but still. NPCs just walk in circles, repeating the same conversation over and over and over again, like a broken record. Nice touch: when guards rush to attack you, they just keep repeating their last phrase like a battlecry.			"

												So it's been 30 hours so far, and even though I'm having such a blast, the collecting of EVERY SINGLE LOOT (OCD) is starting to get to me. I just had to get that out of the way, here and now! Surely Garret is content by now?! Moving on...This reboot of the original Thief will not be suited to all, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if only 1 in 10 people actually will enjoy it, as the taste is a rather specialized one. If you are a diehard fan of the original series you may or may not enjoy this one, since while it still captures the essence behind Thief, the whole openworld experience is quite hampered with long loading times, awkwardly placed transitional zones and poor openworld map layout, other than that it is everything you could want from a Thief game!If you're used to running around and killing everything without repercussions then I suggest you look elsewhere. As the original games, Thief is very unforgiving in all but stealth actions. And rightly so, for this is a fully stealth based game, and thieves are no match in combat. Thief, not Rogue, there is a difference. They're light footed, they get in and out, that's all there is to it.A lot of people seem to want to compare this game to Dishonoured, and while the two may share similarities I can honestly say from playing both that Thief is the one to go for a complete stealth experience and a very dark storyline whereas Dishonoured you can get away with pretty much anything you do, without a real challenge (unless you impose one on yourself).All looting and thieving aside, Thief has one of those rare atmospheres that manages to draw you into the game world, and that is thanks to the talented developers at Square Enix, the driving force behind Deux Ex: Human Revolution which also had such an amazing atmosphere to get absorbed into. The story in itself is quite an interesting one, and later on towards the end the game starts taking a turn for the horror/paranormal reminiscence of Outlast which both terrified and excited me since at least in Thief you have a chance (emphasis on YOU, not me, as playing on Master difficulty with instant fail on taking damage/being seen is what I've condemned myself to).While the graphics in Thief never was an issue since it's such an old game, I can't help but feel that they limited themselves quite a bit by using the Unreal Engine (though I've seen much better looking games with the same engine). But to be honest, it's not about realism (though it does get that across), but about the dark noir/steampunk feel which goes hand in hand with its rugged graphics display. The audio is what really makes the game come to life though, with footsteps perfectly positioned and the rest of the sounds matched correctly more often than not you'll feel like you're really in the game until you're stuck humping a wall because it's not a predefined climb spot.Take all this and add the ability to start a custom difficulty game where YOU get to decide how the game will play out, if you can use healing items, if you are allowed to take damage or use specific items amongst many other modifiers makes for a completely unique experience tailored to your own playstyle! Think you're a Master Thief? Prove it!For those who haven't played any of the Thief games and are looking for something new which doesn't heavily rely on combat (though it is available) a la Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell then I'm sure you'll find something of value in Thief.For those of you who are Thief fans, or have played any of the older Thief games then for nostalgia sake you will enjoy being a Taffer once more, causing mayhem for the guards, racking up loot, finding the secrets and generally just being a badass.

												I played all the Thief games and I enjoy them all.This one the graphics are decent and a nice step up from the originals.The controls are simple to get used.The audio is nice and clear with no problems.The missions so far are decent and offer a nice wide range to power through and have fun. If you enjoy the original Thief games, then this one you will enjoy aswell.  Also the price is really cheap compared to AAA titles being something like £39 and this is only £29.99.There is no multiplayer before people start whining and asking for it.  This is a singleplayer campaign fun game with lots to do, and you actually get the feeling that it is open world.  I was walking around and had multiple routes to find and do something, and I really thought it was open world, when I know it is not.There are multiple ways to approach a mission or a person, with secrets, hiding spots and different things around.Overal this game is very much worth the time and effort you put into it, for a fun experience make sure you watch ALL the video's, they are really really nice to watch, and I am a person who skips them but a friend of mine made me sit and watch them all, and I did and thankfully I did because they are good video's.Anyway, worth the time, money and effort you put into it.Well done Thief.

												Yeh Stealthy.And It gets boring after an hour.The AI has gotten much worse during the thief games and for some reason this game has the same name as the original game.The difference is in the gameplay and AI. They are worse. A lot worse.If you want a fancy criminal simulator I would recommend Sly cooper for the PS2 and 3.This one is just a boring really slow based strange thief or more like an assassin simulator. Classic example of the game's strange nature is when you firstly watch porn and look for symbols over people that do really nasty stuff and then get yourself into a dark ancient ruin with a creepy humanoid creature as an easteregg or something. Quickly the game becomes a horror game.The easy difficulty is more like a hard difficulty if you ask me btw. So the game get's even more slow based when you are at low health running away from the horrible AI in some victorian london. If the running and bad AI wasn't enought, the fancy developers made every level a flipping maze.I guess the game doesn't know what is it supposed to be.			"

												This is not Thief. It's the hollywood cash-in version of Thief. It's every stealth game except the one it was named after, (and they just don't gel together). The thing just doesn't tick the right boxes for me - moving round in the game I feel like some unfit wannabe nut who thinks they're in batman/tomb raider (but lacks the skills). Other times it just feels like some Dishonoured rip-off; less-polished, with a mediocre story. Aeriel knockouts, ffs. I just quit out when I started clambering around on pipes like Sam FIsher and I started getting flashbacks to the last Splinter Cell. It's like they don't know why Thief was great, so they just tried robbing all the other stealth games since.Garret is just not the man he was. The sneering cynicism is gone. And so are his stealth skills, apparently. Guards have spotted me from (relatively) miles away when I'm perfectly still and in total darkness. I snuck up to a nice bit of loot, hit the 'e' key to kick-off the looting animation, and the sound I made when looting attracted guards. WTF?Back to The Dark Mod, I guess.			"

												I was really excited for this remake when it was annouced but it has proved to be one of the most uninspired remakes/redos / whatever this is trying to be. I loved the original Thief games and Dishonored because of the connections, but Thief 4 is neither of those in character or style.NPC's are boring and flat, world design is drab (there's no color like there was in the originals), and for some reason they tried to pull like a reverse borrow by giving Garrett supernatural powers similar to Corvo's and a plague. Also Garrett is now some kind antihero and lacks any of the character of Stephen Russell's version. I want to compare the level design to the Dark Project, but thats an insult even to that game, it's just so linear and boring and I can't focus on any of it for more than 5 minutes. There's no keepers no pagans no Hammerites, there's nothing here but tiny sneaky boring thief man.			"

												I know at the time of writing this I only have a few hours of gameplay into Thief, and I will probably add more over the next few days, but there are things about this game that I find let down lovers of the original Thief series.To be honest, I'm not even sure why this title was ""rebooted"" another time after Thief: Deadly Shadows.  The answer is probably out there, but I'm just too lazy (and I honestly don't care) to find it.The first thing I noticed when even starting this game is that it feels very much more like a reboot... far from the roots of the originals.The world, although they would like you to think it's ""open"" leads you by the hand down the garden path.  Practically every Thief game prior to this one is very much more ""open"" to exploration than this one.  In those prior installments, you could at least wander around a bit... find other marks, find other points of interest, find little nooks and secrets that you can explore and loot to your heart's content.  This game seems very restrictive by comparison.  You can't even jump up on walls or buildings.  For a minute there, I was wondering why the game would practically highlight everything that could be climbed or held onto, but now I guess I know why.... because you can't jump up on, climb, or hold onto just anything anymore.  It even tells you to ""find a way into <insert building here>"" but then puts a freakin' marker on your screen to point out exactly where to go.The next thing is the dialog.  I honestly can't explain why developers think that adding profanity will somehow lead to a better game.  The originals managed to do excellent without it.  Personally, I find it a sign of a weak script if the developers think they have to sprinkle curse words throughout just to give it some body (which curse words alone can't do).  It's getting that I have to ditch my computer speaker system and start using headphones because NOTHING is able to be played around my family anymore.That said, one of the tiny nitpicky things I found was that the lipsyncing sorta was hit and miss at times.  There were a few points where the dialog was done but the character kept flappin' their gums.  Other times, the character would speak but their mouth would not move at all.However, even having said all that, I'm still finding the gameplay OK... yes, merely OK... not stellar, not horrible... just OK.  I do have to admit that the environments and texturing are well done and they actually are one thing that shines in this game.  At least it still LOOKS like a Thief game.  But even then, it doesn't fix what's wrong with the game.I wish Steam had a sideways thumb... I don't really want to recommend this game for anyone who came from the original Thief series, but it's not entirely a bad game as such.  It's just not as immersive as the previous games.  So, that being said I will still give it a thumbs up, but it should actually be pointing sideways.			"

												Initial Thief — The Dark Project — once taught us to hide in shadows and to avoid battles, to listen to each sneeze and to make plans on the fly. Continuations, including in many respects disputable Deadly Shadows, all this picked up and developed, but now there was a restart, and a lot of things were for some reason forgotten. Thief of 2014 really refused everything that occurred in the previous parts of a series. Here never existed the stimpankovskikh tekhnofilov-hammeritov, neither sorcerers pagans worshipping to god Trikster, nor secret order of the Keepers, undertaken to store balance between these two extremes. The city in which the thief Garret bosses, too changed: if earlier in it the rough medieval architecture, now in a course elaborate constructions of the Renaissance and the Victorian era prevailed, and magics in it remained less than nothing. ""Stealth of new generation"" which was praised highly actively by developers, in Thief difficultly to see. It isn't known, unfortunately it or fortunately, but the new generation differs from old only existence of the indicator of uneasiness over enemies. For the rest the scheme old — we hide in dark corners, we try not to catch sight to enemies and if got — we are washed away at the fifth speed. The policeman попсихует, will shout: ""Leave, the coward! "", will come to a conclusion: ""I ran away, the swine"" — and will return on the post, is exact as in Deadly Shadows. And this algorithm doesn't depend on complexity level almost — simply at easy level security guards are blind, deaf and will forget about Garret, it should drop for a second out of sight, and on the heavy will sound alarm at the slightest pretext and then still the solid hour to shudder from the slightest rustle. Praised settings of complexity which in the theory have to allow to adjust game to any taste and to any player — only a set of sticks which can insert into wheels. For example, we can force game to set off defeat after the first given alarm. It is possible to forbid Garret to kill and even to deafen policemen. But with the same success it is possible to play one hand or, say, sitting a back to the screen — sense from such ""weighting compounds"" slightly. Unless it is worth turning off ""the concentration mode"" to feel the thief of old school. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												Garret is the thief in the game whom the player controls, he is a righteous man who refuses to kill a guard, but will gladly pick their pockets stealing their wages, and rob their homes, thus starving them to death.  If you cant tell Garret is a jerk, all this is visible from the start of the game where you are with another thief whose a female, go girl power!  Garret wont be shown up by her badassery and thiefs away her weapon which kills her thus reinforcing the fact that Garret is a jerk.  That is what should be on the box not ""Theif"", but in BIG letters the word JERK!The graphics are terribad, yet somehow they require very high specs, figure that out?  The graphics are so bad you cant see much on screen EVER!  Everything is grey, black, light grey, there is an entire rainbow of grey in this game.  For lovers of the color grey this would be a great game, because Garret is color blind to every color under the sun it seems.  Any colors that do appear are washed out.  The devs realizing how poor their choice was to use 5 colors to make an entire game, gave you thief vision.  Thats right as a super hero thief due to bad graphics you just hit a button and know where all the treasures are.  However instead of feeling like a thief you feel more like a garbage man.  There are bracelets in rain gutters, valuable goblets just lying in bushes, so instead of finding treasure your picking up scraps of garbage nobody wants.  Ever seen in movies where some homeless guy collects crazy trinkets like socks or other baubles and keeps them as trophies in his sewer domain?  Well now you can  live the dream of being a shiftless hobo picking up trash, you even get an abandoned clocktower to show off your shinies.Poor Garret, what did these developers do to the beloved Garret of the practically holy trinity of gaming called the Thief series.  With his eyeliner and deep voice he sounds more like he should be writing in his diary of woe, as an emo kid recounts their life memoirs about missing out on sales at Hot Topic while hanging out at the mall being all edgy.  These guys had a bajillion dollars to make this game and just wasted it, this game is a waste.  They had so much money they made a REAL LIFE version of Garret's bow, had it commissioned by some machinists and custom made for who knows why or how much money.  They even remade the ENTIRE foundation of the games XP system replacing it with some kind of force system where instead of earning xp for upgrades, you just buy them from a blind hag!  That is not made up, it sounds like something a crazy person would do, but yes, in this game you go and become better at combat or better at seeing things from a blind hag.  Ugh, when they made this game, were they even trying, its like trolling.  This is a first person stealth game which is an odd choice which the game suffers for.  There is only one FPS platformer that ever really worked called Mirrors Edge.  All of those gamers who to this day have nightmares of old games that were plaatformers with terrible controls, can relive those vietnam flashbacks playing Thief because the controls are awful.  Garret the thief gets no armor running around in his underwear, the reason for this is your a thief, you get no armor because it makes noise.  But every guard you see has armor, chain mail, swords clattering about and none of them make a sound!  The guards in their full armor are as stealthy as ninjas, sometimes you go around a corner and BAM a knight is walking around, completely silent.  Since this game has no radar your left guessing where enemies are NEVER feeling like your in the game.  The combat is awful, if you get injured dont worry, just bring up your inventory and enjoy some food, then go back to combat, stopping to eat food in the middle of combat?  For how much ""realism"" the devs proclaimed about how this game would revolutionize stealth, these guys got it wrong, all wrong, everything is wrong, and nothing is right.  Thief even managed to botch movement, thats right the simple act of traversing through the physical plane is mind boggling in Thief, you cant even jump, there is no jump button.  A platforming game with no jump button, Thief is a confusing mess of playstyles that cant make up its mind what it wants to be.  There are times you will move around and all the sudden your stuck, if you look down there is some small pipe you walked into or box that is below your line of sight.  Well, here is how to stop the ""Thief"" in ""Thief""  leave some garbage on the ground making it so poor Garret cant climb over it.  Garret will most likely abandon the mission since he cant climb over the garbage.  Becoming bedazzled by the pile of trash, rummaging through it like a homeless person looking for tin cans finding forks, spoons. and perhaps, even the holiest of holies a ""PEN"".  Thats right in this game a PEN is treasure, all Actuarial undergrads using mechanical pencils should be on the lookout for a thief named Garret.  All those lost writing utensils are probably due to a world class thieves guild hell bent on cornering the worlds supply of writing implements or maybe they just hate math, could be a little bit of both.Sitting trying to think of any redeeming qualities just gives a migraine.  The levels are all small like in Hitman Absolution which is also made by Square Enix, you walk from one end of a level to the other, thats it.  Thats the whole game.  Its horrible, even trying to force myself to play it is brutal.  Who let this game get made?  Why does it exist?  With all that money and this is what they create?  Indie games can be bad, usually its due to lack of budget, and even then the games dont suck at what they try to do.  In Thief the lockpicking mechanic is an empty circle, when it lights up you pick the lock its a downright insult to lockpicking in gaming.  As proof indie games can do it better, check out Motte Island which has a better lockpicking mechanic than multimillion dollar Thief.  Things like that are what make alot of indie games rule, leaving the AAA studios to drool.This game had it all, and threw it all away.  Every second spent playing it, anyone who owns skyrim will think, hey I can run around pick pockets and steel spoons and forks in Skyrim.  ""Thief"" with its AAA name, and AAA developers comes off like a crappy mod for skyrim, but of course skyrim does this without modding, so dont buy Thief, just buy Skyrim.  When this game came out and all the pro reviewers were drooling, how could NOT ONE of them say.... Oh hey Skyrim has a Thieves guild, with an open world of in depth quests, lockpick mechanics and stealth... because those reviewers suck, someone should make a list of any reviewer who liked this game and blacklist them for the good of gamer kind...   TLDR:  Like most modern games there are segments where you go through HVAC ducts in air vents.  Yes the middle ages suddenly has central air... The only thing thief will do is steal your time, literally its a time burglar, making doing anything better than playing this game.Buy Skyrim instead or buy any elder scrolls game even old morrowind is better than this.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			"

												The second you read Thief and dishonored in the same review, quit reading. Except for this one of course :)  I have no idea why the comparison, They are totally different games to be played in a totally different way. I've finished both, they are nothing alike, only extremely superficial people would compare them, but one thing is sure they are both incredible. Thief oozes quality, re-playability, amazing sounds and visuals, atmosphere is fantastic.It is to be played in a raw fashion, bow and arrow, ghostly assassin, or silent thief.Whereas dishonored is an stealth-action game with supernatural abilities. Really couldn't be more different. Buy this gem of game, you will not regret it, at the current price, it is a steal.			"

												Genre - Fantasy first person Stealth/RPGI have played through all the other Thief games to date and I was worried that this one wouldn't stay true to its roots, being too console friendly. Thank F*** I was wrong! I have only played through the first chapter and am freely exploring the second. However, I think I know enough to pass on a positive review. The fighting is balanced so that you might die if you get into a scrap against the odds, this means you will have to use stealth and the environment to succeed. The arrows are back to distract, put out torches and kill. You can sneak up and cosh unsuspecting enemies from behind or rob them. The story seems to fit in with the world created in the other games and the characters are lovable rogues. Also you can freely move around the enviroment, to a point, robbing random dwellings and finding secrets. You can buy upgrades to give you advantages in certain situations such as picking locks (this has also been done well) and healing. Also when detected there seems a fair time and situation to when aggro is reduced. Be careful as citizens will run and get the Watch when you beat up their mates.A game that encourages you to use the darkness as an advantage and be a sneaky thieving git!			"

Please note that I am reviewing this reboot as its own game. I have never played any of the original ""Thief"" games so you will not find a comparison here. My review will be based solely on my experience with this version of Thief.Ever since I first heard of Thief I was excited. I am a huge stealth-fan and I never got around to playing the original Thief-games, so this was a great opportunity for me and other newcomers to jump right into this iconic stealth series... and I am very glad that I did. Thief is a beautiful game and a unique stealth experience with smooth gameplay and lots of variety in your approach on things. Simply a superb game that is unfortunately brought down by critics and die-hards fan who expected something that would have stuck more to the ""original recipe"".The Good:· Smooth controls: climbing low obstacles, peeking around corners to get a better look at your environment, swooping from shadow to shadow... It all feels incredibly smooth, especially for a stealth game. If you have ever played Dishonored, just imagine something like that without magic and a more realistic approach.· Money money money: getting your gold-greedy paws around precious items such as common goblets and letter openers among countless others and more unique collectable items is incredibly fun and satisfying. This loot is generally realistically spread, meaning no golden goblets will be found on the streets and that jewelry will mostly be found in stores or houses. I personally think this encouraged me to explore different area's to find different kind of loot.· Phenomenal stealth gameplay: there are no stealth games this well-crafted in my recent memory. Your approach may depend on the situation, your goal or the difficulty (which is geniously customizable to enjoy the game as hard or as simple as you'd like). You can sneak past every guard, knock them all out, just steal all their money (heheh), or you can distract guards by firing arrows, putting out fires, throwing empty bottles etc. It feels fresh and addictive and completely different with every level or replay.The Bad:· AI: there's dumb AI and there's blind AI. I'd say the AI isn't necessarily dumb (birds and dogs will alert guards and guard frequently and correctly patrol the area) but the AI is blind as f*ck. Alright, you're in the shadows, but at times you can literally walk in front of guards and they'll keep their eyes fixed on you, but they won't react. This idiocy encouraged me to stay as far away from guars as possible, but I'd prefer my AI a little bit more alert and responsive.· Pure stealth may not be for everyone: in games like Splinter Cell or Hitman you can either go in pure stealth without ever being noticed of going in a bit more fierce, killing every enemy in sight. You can obviously kill enemies with an arrow in between the enemy's eyes, but real action is avoided. The more stealthy you play, the more rewarding (both in-game and personally) and immersive the game will be, but poor in-game combat will put off almost everyone looking to cause some fuss.The Ugly:· Man this game is gorgeous. Amazing textures, immersive lighting, stunning character models, an atmospheric city and espacially Garrett's hands are detailed beyond belief. One of the most beautiful games in recent memory.Final Verdict:· Thief is not for everyone due to its imperfections, but for stealth-fans like myself this game is a must. It's the very best stealth has to offer and undoubtedly a game that will stick with you for a long time. 9.5/10			"

												Thief is a great instalment to the series and as kind of a reboot it's does a great job paving the way for what will hopefully be the first of many more 'next-gen' Thief games.The game it's self is aestically very pleasing, the graphics are second to few and overall gameplay is smooth and relatively uninterrupted. The mechanics are well enough for sneaking around and looting etc, but don't expect to be going toe-toe with more than 1 enemy at a time. Basically, if you're discovered by more than one guard, it's a death sentence and you will learn how quickly you can load last save. Whilst I wasn't expecting much of a combat system from the game, I was hoping for sneak damage perk when using the bow and perhaps some minor melee combat, or the ability to counter (non-lethal) attacks so I could make my escape route with a sense of panic and urgency. That said, you can purchase/find poison cloud arrows that incapacitate the enemy – just don’t miss as the game is more unforgiving than getting the drunken wrong end of a cigarette. I would have like to have seen more of an awareness indication on guards and enemies – this would aid the swooping between shadows and give better aid to timing of attacks/takedowns as well as increasing the difference between similar games, cough, Dishonored, cough. It’s awfully frustrating drawing an arrow on your bow to maximum tension only to have it stick in a guards head and then him be fully aware and alert of his assailant. What the game does do well is the stealth and sneak ability, far superior to the likes of dishonoured and much less clunky than say for instance Skyrim. It’s impossible not to compare the game to Dishonoured with all the similarities but Thief is not smothered by the steampunk, futuristic, often hard to follow alternative universe. Instead, the immersion is founded on a gritty late 1800’s era where plague (the gloom) is run rampant through the city streets. You’re free to run the streets and break into houses via rooftops plundering all the fancy cutlery and golden microscopes you can fit in your endless wizard pockets. The game turns these delightful items immediately into an equivalent gold value you can spend on tools for more felonies. There’s an unmistakable satisfaction gathering up all the collectables to a set of rare items and where the game falls short of combat more than makes up for it with blatant burglary and theft. Thief doesn’t benefit from a completely free roam environment (like Assassins Creed series) unfortunately. This really brought the points down for me as Garett can easily scale most things then be completely unable climb or jump others that seem remedial in comparison. Perhaps if there was more of an assassins agenda going on in the game this could have been a reality for the game but ultimately it comes off as laziness or lowered expectations for the game. Fortunately, it doesn’t ruin the game but would have given it that additional dimension that could have made it a triple A title or worthy of a higher RRP. That said, I think the game is worth the money and is a good bang for the buck.I recommend this game if you get a kick out of sneaking around, outwitting your opponents and solving puzzles to progress the story. The story it’s self-unravels as you play through the game and combined with the incentive of stealing some fancy pants items, well makes the game worth playing. If you are looking for more of a brawling experience though, I cannot recommend it, you will be sorely disappointed and likely frustrated that your kick♥♥♥♥♥reflexes and ability to strike multiple keys in quick succession will do you no good here. On top of requiring a decent spec machine this game will also require patience, attention to detail i.e. don’t knock over cups, tread on broken glass etc and an appreciation for stealth & thievery. So far, I can’t really knock the game given what I spent on it. It has been worth every dollar and I’m sure it will continue to be so while I uncover more loot and more story.			"

												Since there are already many reviews with long detailed stuff about the game. I will keep it short as possible - Thank you Eidos-Montréal for fufilling my need for oldschool stealth gameplay with a touch of new technology and a helping handful of nestalgia. This game has brough me back to my younger years.   if you like to imagine yourself a greedy shadow in the dark.Then this is the game for you.			"

												The Bad: Awkward, unneeded 3rd person moments of climbing. The story feels flat and the characters aren't fleshed out at all.  When exploring the open world hub called ""The City"" there are loading screens everywhere. That being said, they go by pretty quickly or are hidden via a QTE event. Audio problems ranging from guards repeating their lines immediately after speaking, being able to hear them from a great distance away as if they are right next to you, or absolutely no audio at all during cut scenes (each of these things happened randomly at some point).  Removal of the dagger is a turn off for some but as I normally ghost anyway it was not a problem. The size of the levels vary from linear to nonlinear at times. The Good: The stealth is amazing and it's exhilarating to dash from one shadow to the next as you sneak around. The game itself looks beautiful and, in my opinion, really captures a steam punk Victorian London feel. The game mechanics steer you towards the stealth route (as it should) by removing the dagger (though really you can still use arrows if you wish to kill). The guards are not stupid and while you can take one on no problem, alerting several generally results in a death. That being said, an extremely patient player can take down all guards or slip past them entirely. The light and shadows look fantastic and work wonderfully as a stealth mechanic, though don't expect to be invisible in the shadows on harder difficulties when a guard walks right up to where you are. Speaking of difficulties, there are a ton of customizable options for tailoring your game to your desired difficulty. The game itself has a solid length and lasts even longer if you do all the side missions, which are probably the best part of the game. A ton of loot is hidden in the hub world as well as every story and side mission, including special collectables like paintings, rings, and plaques (can you complete all the sets?). The new focus mechanic is a welcome addition allowing you to view interactable objects such as loot, traps, and things that can be opened. That being said this new mechanic is not necessary to complete the game and can be turned off entirely. While the levels are not as big as in previous Thief games they still offer multiple ways of reaching objectives. Lastly there are upgrades you can purchase throughout the game for your focus abilities and trinkets that increase things like max health or decrease resource costs. While this may not be the classic Thief game many were hoping for, it is still a great game in it's own right. Aside from the audio problems (which may be fixed with future patches) the game gave me no problems and was enjoyable from start to finish. Though it may not be a perfect game, any fan of the stealth genre should enjoy Thief. I personally give it a 7/10. If you are on the fence I hope this helps!			"

												THIEF. You probably expect the oldschool THIEF, you go through the reviews, they say ""IT'S NO OLD THIEF, WHY."".. It was probably the last time i listened to any reviewsites, except the game has an overall of <35. However.You are Garrett, the masterthief and you start with a girl named Erin, going through the city, moving on many roofs, but already arguing. The objective was, to get something. It wasn't really clear. They were on the roof of a cathedral and looked down to people summoning something. Well, THIEF is obviously not a straightup middleage game without any fantasyelements. To keep it short. They start a fight because Garrett doesn't like how it works, she is loosing her claw and she tries to catch it, falls down and you have absoluetly no idea what happened. Except that you were one year unconscious. Enough of that.The game is welldetailed, every building is different so far, well some are just for some letters or documents, but still exciting.The atmosphere is awesome in a dark city with a terrible plague that keeps everyone small, except for guards and the rich ones and has great soundeffects, steps (blood, glass, books, leaves, etc.)There is tons of small loot to pick up, so you can buy different arrows that can help you through the game or upgrading your armor and different goodies which are permanent, like 25% lesser to pay for arrows. Also collectives, from a picture with a naked female body and a goathead. Rings, necklaces, signs and so on.The most important thing is the gameplay. You can play in different ways. Go full stealthy. Go and knock everyone out. Or go  aggressive and kill everyone. Focus is your friend of bluemarking loot, which can be very helpful, use it. But you don't have permanent focus, and it doesn't refill, unless you use flowers. The enemies aren't that smart sometimes, but smart enough to recognize steps if you are too loud or if they see you in the light. Even if you hide in the dark, they can see you if they're near enough. The controls are flawless, i actually expected a terrible port.The only annoying thing is to press [E] for pressing a bar or to open windows. Like it or not, it might be no oldschool THIEF, but it's still a pretty nice game and i didn't regret to spend my time on it.			"

												Great Game! Not sure why it got so much negative after all the pre release hype. This game delivers exactly what it promised it would. A great stealth game with minimal combat mechanics... you aren't an assassin this isn't dishonored. Love the world, love the graphics, love the concept. The broken up 'open world' loading times vary but are annoying however a small price to pay for a great new addition to the Thief series.			"

												This rendition of Thief is remeniscent of the original games in some ways, but probably not  enough  ways. While I enjoyed playing the game for awhile, I found myself becoming bored. Travel throughout the city felt tedious, and the loading screens every few feet are annoying and break immersion. The in-game map is borderline useless for actual navigation. The actual mechanics of the gameplay left me feeling as if they developed the game to appeal to a newer generation of gamers. I miss the excitement of sneaking up on someone and actually having to pull out a blackjack and knock them over the head. It takes away from my agency as a player when all I have to do to quietly take out a guard is hit Q. During development, Focus was a hot button issue for the hardcore fans of the series. I didn't mind it. I usually just let it run out, and I'd use it to temporarilly highlight things in the environment so it was easier to find stuff. The game is dark, as it should be, but sometimes its nice to not have to walk around in the dark forever looking for a switch. There are other applications of Focus for combat, but I mostly ignored that. The selection of arrows was nice and probably the aspect of the game most true to the original games. The story wasn't great, wasn't bad. It was a vehicle for gettting you from one place to another while you looked for stuff to steal. This review seems pretty negative; nevertheless, if you enjoyed the original Thief games, I still think you should give this a shot. It's a nice looking game and if you're okay with setting aside thoughts about how it should have been, you can probably manage to enjoy it for what it is.			"

												i7 2600k @3.48GB memory64 bit OS7870 graphic card.Everything is either high or maxed.No bugs or stuttering issues. Runs smooth 99% of the time, a bit of slow down/stuttering on chapter/area starts for about 5 seconds while stuff loads, but other than that smooth as silk.I'm first gen of gamers, and played all Thief games on release, and bought them all again on Steam recently while waiting for this to be available, just to get back into it. Yes it has some minor issues, such as guards repeating phrases (same happened in the first 3 games by the way now and again) Yes it is more linear than the originals, but still quite open, depending on how far your in to the game and what mission you are doing, and it is a different background and story to the originals. The story isn't as good as the first 3 games, in my opinion, but it isn't bad at all, it's just average for a story/plot in games these days. I quite enjoyed it. As usual these days…crap ending to an enjoyable game.The voice acting is good, I laugh at people freaking out just because they changed the voice actor from the originals. This new guy is good and does a good job. The quality of voices throughout the entire game is of high standard.The hub is a pain to navigate, but no more so than in Thief 3.The mature themes are ok for me but they are definitely mature with lots of bad language used throughout the game and some graphical sexual images and scenes. For me it was a little bit over the top and not really needed, but it does kind of fit into the setting so I can say it was ok in context of the setting and game. 18+ for sure.The AI is just as good as in all previous Thief games, and on Master/Custom settings, better, and harder. Those who think otherwise are recalling with nostalgia, not fact. Go play the first 3 games which are very cheap to get on Steam and you will see what I mean. The guards and their patrols in all 3 previous games were just as dumb as in this game, probably more so.Thief 4 guards actually react harsher and help each other better than the originals in most circumstances, and unlike the original 3 games, you can't really fight your way out of things and take them on at harder difficulties you will be dead pretty fast. You’re a Thief, not Chuck Norris, throw a flashbang and run is the idea, or kill them with arrows, silently, from a safe and hidden distance.There are so many custom options in this game that you can tinker with it to make it into a game of your style than just about any other game available, and this is a massive plus and a nod to those of us who played the originals first time around. If you don't like some of the new effects, switch them off, simple as that.This reboot is well worth the money, they have done overall an excellent job with it, and you’re just spiting yourself not buying it due listening to people who are a combination of uber fussy, where nothing will ever be good enough for them, the mentally idiotic who think it is some form of ninja game and try and kill everything that moves then complain about combat not being good enough (duh) or simply having never played this new game, but still slag it off anyway, such as the journos on a bandwagon of slagging it off, just the same way they pump up games all saying the same thing together like a herd of sheep when that game is terrible. Play it for yourself, play it like a Thief, not an Assassin and start on Master difficulty, and it is a very good game. This is one ""older generation"" who enjoys playing it very much and will soon be playing it through again, and trying to do better and closer to 100% for each mission. Which is VERY hard to do. This is one of those games with a ton of stuff to do and find, lots of nice touches, if you play it as it was meant and designed to be played you will have a great time. There are LOADS of side missions to do as well. A lot more than you might first think! Go back to Basso after you finish the main story line just for starters, I got an extra 19 missions just from him, and add on the other 2 sources of missions and there are tons of them.Overall I would give it 85% and recommend it as a not perfect, but a very good reboot of a dearly loved game, and well worth the money.

												After a huge amount of speculation and suspicion about the title before it's release, it has finally got out after long periods of delays.  I got to thank Eidos Montreal for not rushing with THIEF and listening to the fans and making changes to the game they desired.First off; the PC port is superb. You can adjust the difficulty settings and basically anything related to either the UI, interfaces or just general game experience and playstyle. Not to mention all those fancy graphics options out there aswell.The game looks and sound very good. The city takes a very dark and moody grip on you and the athmosphere is amazing. The City itself is a fully explorable Hub area, much like in Thief: Deadly Shadows or Deus Ex: Human Revolution.I think  the biggest thing that really made me love this game, were all the detail and little things around the City, including tons of secret areas, environments to exploit, dark corners and streets, hideouts, passages and the list goes on. This can also turn in to a real OCD hell, if you aim to hunt as many items as there is to be seen (or not to be seen) :D.The story is actually quite good in my opinion, yet icluding a bit typical theme of a dystopic/depressing world. Also do remember that this is a reboot: Not everything can be the same like in the good ol 90's.Garrett is not voice acted by Stephen Russell anymore, but the voice actor is no joke. He really reflects Garrett's materialistic, kleptomanic and cynical personality really well and gives a good immersion to the game.I like how the game doesn't hold your hand if played on master custom options. You have to find those switches yourself, figure out the puzzles alone and plan your movements when doing housecleaning and anything in stealth.  I highly recommend Master difficulty for the best and longest game experience. (this game hasn't got a 12h linear story like in Bioshock Infinite.)THIEF can be played with more aggressive gamestyle, but it's not regarded to be the most original way to play the game and it is not so fun compared to all the sneaking, lurking around and running on the shadowy rooftops. Also kinda funny when you think about Garrett's negativity about killing and positivity about stealing :).Compared to Skyrim, I didn't find almost any bugs or glitches, apart from repeating conversations and AI NPCs that sometimes just decide to stand all night long at the same place. Even with those, the AI is extremely intelligent when it comes to sneaking.  ---->You will use load/save alot.I did NOT like:                     - Some ridicilous obstacle restrictions that even an eight year-old could climb.                      - Getting stuck on finding a way to rare loot or avoiding randomly patrolling guardsmen.THIEF is a reboot done well, even with all the negativity amongst some of the oldest fans and people with too spesific expectations.

In reality the maps are not that large still you will feel like you have endless places to explore. Lockpick doors on the street or race along the thieves highway (roofs) looking for windows to break into! Gold and treasures are hidden all over giving you an incentive to explore high and low.

Also, there are a lot of achievements for a very agressive and offensive playstile, that doesn't really fit the sneaky Masterthief, but I ignored that.			"

												The bad reviews were mostly right. Just finished the game as a fan from Thief since the first game. Hated the stealth in AC4 (although is a great game) and hoped that this game would show how a stealth game should be.CONS: almost no freedom, poor AI, anoying bugs (specially the sound), and for me, VERY repetitive. Enemies have only 2 types, respawn of guards in the city, a lot of loading screens, and the lack of chars to interact. Lazy difficulty system (on/off hud itens).PROS: playing w/ Garret again is like meeting an old friend. Graphics and atmosphere are great. Some chapters are memorable and beautifuly designed. The first hours were really good to play. The optional focus system is a great idea for newbies.The AI is the more disappointing part. Scripted, dumb and lifeless. They should look real, go ask for help, surround, reinforce the protection (a more complex script at least). Instead, they act like an game from the 90's. Things shoud look really difficult to steal. Killing a guard should always be the last option.I was hoping an open stealth sand box, challenging AI and next gen graphics. Got only the last one. This game will be forgotten in some months, result of the poor experience, little replay factor and no innovation in the genre. Don't pay the full price if you're not a fan of the series.			"

												Side quests are where this game really shines - environments are small, but this is the only part where at least you have some sort of freedom of exploration. Main missions, on the other hand, are too linear for my taste and story is pretty forgettable. There's a lot fun to be had in Thief, mostly due to heavy emphasis on stealthy, non-confrontational approach to all adversity, but all too often you get the feeling that something's missing here, and it ain't all that sh!t you just nicked.Also, can't go wrong with those fabulous first person animations. I wish more games were able to give you this uncanny feeling of controlling an acual human being, instead of floating cameras with gun props attached on front.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Sure! At full price? No way. I think I got it for $10 on here and that was good enough. The game has a great concept but it's lacking content. I feel you could probably complete this game in 2 hours if played right. Certain bonuses can make the game too easy. By the end of my game not only could I one hit kill but I could go right UP to the enemies and dance in front of them. They just thought ""Oh... sometihng might be in front of me."" It's a fun game I guess? The storyline seemed very incomplete.			"

Sure not everything is perfect but all in all I'm gad what came out of this release. Untill this release I thought T3 is the best in the series... But Now of we looks at the all aspects I think T4 is the best Thief to play this day. I haven't finished it yet so I can't say for sure but I played a bout 10 hours... If the rest is like this then it is a good game.			"

												I can't say enough good about Thief!  It is so immersive and I love how they actually force you to play the game, there are no shortcuts and the in game ""help"" (focus) feels right.  I love that there is no fast travel, so you constantly have to move about the world.  I love how many hidden treasures there are to find, and the variety of collectable items there are.  I love the challenges that each client job and chapter give you, and the custom difficulty levels mean endless replay ability.My only complaints would be the occasional pathing glitches that the AI experiences, and some occasional Audio bugs which make some voices much softer than the normal volume of the ambient voices.9.5/10			"

Plus, I loved Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and Eidos are good guiys.  This game is one of a kind, what the OVERRATED Dishonored, couldn't be.  Dishornored stole from Thief, not the other way around, Thief was started before Dishonored and finished after, I would take Thief over Dishonored anyday.  Played through Dishonored once, probably will never touch it again.  That will not be true for Thief.			"

Thief strives to keep true to it's roots and manages pretty well. Do not forget, that it needs to sell and bring back money. It needs to offer different playstyles.			"

												i7 2600k @3.48GB memory64 bit OS7870 graphic card.Everything is either high or maxed.No bugs or stuttering issues. Runs smooth 99% of the time, a bit of slow down/stuttering on chapter/area starts for about 5 seconds while stuff loads, but other than that smooth as silk.I'm first gen of gamers, and played all Thief games on release, and bought them all again on Steam recently while waiting for this to be available, just to get back into it. Yes it has some minor issues, such as guards repeating phrases (same happened in the first 3 games by the way now and again) Yes it is more linear than the originals, but still quite open, depending on how far your in to the game and what mission you are doing, and it is a different background and story to the originals. The story isn't as good as the first 3 games, in my opinion, but it isn't bad at all, it's just average for a story/plot in games these days. I quite enjoyed it. As usual these days…crap ending to an enjoyable game.The voice acting is good, I laugh at people freaking out just because they changed the voice actor from the originals. This new guy is good and does a good job. The quality of voices throughout the entire game is of high standard.The hub is a pain to navigate, but no more so than in Thief 3.The mature themes are ok for me but they are definitely mature with lots of bad language used throughout the game and some graphical sexual images and scenes. For me it was a little bit over the top and not really needed, but it does kind of fit into the setting so I can say it was ok in context of the setting and game. 18+ for sure.The AI is just as good as in all previous Thief games, and on Master/Custom settings, better, and harder. Those who think otherwise are recalling with nostalgia, not fact. Go play the first 3 games which are very cheap to get on Steam and you will see what I mean. The guards and their patrols in all 3 previous games were just as dumb as in this game, probably more so.Thief 4 guards actually react harsher and help each other better than the originals in most circumstances, and unlike the original 3 games, you can't really fight your way out of things and take them on at harder difficulties you will be dead pretty fast. You’re a Thief, not Chuck Norris, throw a flashbang and run is the idea, or kill them with arrows, silently, from a safe and hidden distance.There are so many custom options in this game that you can tinker with it to make it into a game of your style than just about any other game available, and this is a massive plus and a nod to those of us who played the originals first time around. If you don't like some of the new effects, switch them off, simple as that.This reboot is well worth the money, they have done overall an excellent job with it, and you’re just spiting yourself not buying it due listening to people who are a combination of uber fussy, where nothing will ever be good enough for them, the mentally idiotic who think it is some form of ninja game and try and kill everything that moves then complain about combat not being good enough (duh) or simply having never played this new game, but still slag it off anyway, such as the journos on a bandwagon of slagging it off, just the same way they pump up games all saying the same thing together like a herd of sheep when that game is terrible. Play it for yourself, play it like a Thief, not an Assassin and start on Master difficulty, and it is a very good game. This is one ""older generation"" who enjoys playing it very much and will soon be playing it through again, and trying to do better and closer to 100% for each mission. Which is VERY hard to do. This is one of those games with a ton of stuff to do and find, lots of nice touches, if you play it as it was meant and designed to be played you will have a great time. There are LOADS of side missions to do as well. A lot more than you might first think! Go back to Basso after you finish the main story line just for starters, I got an extra 19 missions just from him, and add on the other 2 sources of missions and there are tons of them.Overall I would give it 85% and recommend it as a not perfect, but a very good reboot of a dearly loved game, and well worth the money.

												After a huge amount of speculation and suspicion about the title before it's release, it has finally got out after long periods of delays.  I got to thank Eidos Montreal for not rushing with THIEF and listening to the fans and making changes to the game they desired.First off; the PC port is superb. You can adjust the difficulty settings and basically anything related to either the UI, interfaces or just general game experience and playstyle. Not to mention all those fancy graphics options out there aswell.The game looks and sound very good. The city takes a very dark and moody grip on you and the athmosphere is amazing. The City itself is a fully explorable Hub area, much like in Thief: Deadly Shadows or Deus Ex: Human Revolution.I think  the biggest thing that really made me love this game, were all the detail and little things around the City, including tons of secret areas, environments to exploit, dark corners and streets, hideouts, passages and the list goes on. This can also turn in to a real OCD hell, if you aim to hunt as many items as there is to be seen (or not to be seen) :D.The story is actually quite good in my opinion, yet icluding a bit typical theme of a dystopic/depressing world. Also do remember that this is a reboot: Not everything can be the same like in the good ol 90's.Garrett is not voice acted by Stephen Russell anymore, but the voice actor is no joke. He really reflects Garrett's materialistic, kleptomanic and cynical personality really well and gives a good immersion to the game.I like how the game doesn't hold your hand if played on master custom options. You have to find those switches yourself, figure out the puzzles alone and plan your movements when doing housecleaning and anything in stealth.  I highly recommend Master difficulty for the best and longest game experience. (this game hasn't got a 12h linear story like in Bioshock Infinite.)THIEF can be played with more aggressive gamestyle, but it's not regarded to be the most original way to play the game and it is not so fun compared to all the sneaking, lurking around and running on the shadowy rooftops. Also kinda funny when you think about Garrett's negativity about killing and positivity about stealing :).Compared to Skyrim, I didn't find almost any bugs or glitches, apart from repeating conversations and AI NPCs that sometimes just decide to stand all night long at the same place. Even with those, the AI is extremely intelligent when it comes to sneaking.  ---->You will use load/save alot.I did NOT like:                     - Some ridicilous obstacle restrictions that even an eight year-old could climb.                      - Getting stuck on finding a way to rare loot or avoiding randomly patrolling guardsmen.THIEF is a reboot done well, even with all the negativity amongst some of the oldest fans and people with too spesific expectations.

In reality the maps are not that large still you will feel like you have endless places to explore. Lockpick doors on the street or race along the thieves highway (roofs) looking for windows to break into! Gold and treasures are hidden all over giving you an incentive to explore high and low. Welcome back Garrett. I've missed you.			"

												Dishonored is anoth...wait...this isn't Dishonored? Hmmm.Yes I realize this is part of an old series and not a Dishonored clone...in fact Dishonored is more of a Thief clone than anything else, but due to the fact that this is the first game in the series for probably a decade most people will shove out the Dishonored comparisons.I have to say I am a bit unhappy with the ""challenge"" aspect of each chapter of the game (given that's what games give you now...there's no more playing games for fun or entertainment, achievements and beating other people is far more important)...it can be interesting to have the challenges in the game but I don't really care for a rating system when I'm playing the campaign of the game, if I want to be insulted for a crappy performance I would specifically pick ""Challenge mode"".The game itself looks nice although it was made for previous gen consoles and received the ""upgrade"" for newer ones and the PC...the PC version feels more like a console port in regards to the graphics than a game that was tailored to each system (IE: Dragon Age Origins and other types of games that weren't just hastily ported to make money)...if it was upgraded properly for the PC I'm not seeing it (and yes, I have my settings turned all the way up).I do enjoy playing stealth games of this type despite not being all that great at the stealth aspect (patience is for losers).I'm now bored with reviewing this so my point is; buy the game if you enjoy stealth games. kthxbai			"

												Solid reboot of a classic series. While its issues are well-publicized (annoying button mashing, linear segments, iffy AI, poor writing, etc), most of said issues have been completely overblown by most critics. Yes, there are linear segments in the game but they comprise a tiny portion of the overall experience. Of the 40+ hours I spent playing the game, maybe an hour of that consisted of linear segments. The vast majority of game takes place in large, open-ended areas that promote exploration. AI can bug out on occasion and get stuck on the environment or loop VO indefinitely but these cases are the minority. On Master difficulty, the AI is pretty decent and will definitely offer a challenge. The game's writing isn't great but it's not the abomination some reviewers make it out to be. It's pretty standard videogame writing. If you're solely motivated by story, that may be a problem for you but if you play stealth games because you actually enjoy stealth gameplay, it won't be. Combat is clunky and unsatisfying but that was the case in the previous games as well. And really, if you're fighting in a Thief game, you're playing it wrong.Ultimately, when played properly (stealing all the loot without touching any NPCs) on Master difficulty, the overall experience is faithful to the series. You still get the same satisfaction from stealing without being detected. Make no mistake, the new Thief is very much a pure stealth game. Unlike the recent Splinter Cell and Hitman games, combat is not a viable playstyle. If the idea of sneaking around and stealing stuff isn't inherently appealing to you, you will not enjoy this game. However, if you're looking for a solid stealth game that retains most of the strengths of the Thief franchise, you will likely enjoy this entry in the series.			"

												Well it lost the feel of the first ones some how. I personally didn't like how it felt linear. You could only attach rope arrows to certain 'fixed' spots. My favorite part about the original games was you could put those things (rope arrows) anywhere and get to some really crazy places... Still good though.			"

												I'm glad I gave the older Thief games a try first... I'll definitely be playing those instead of this one.I played the bajeezus out of Dishonored and wanted something new to ninja around in. This... doesn't do it for me. I just couldn't get into it, and it's not just the jaggy pop in textures and weird emo characters (although they do make me a sad panda), it's... something about the game itself. I haven't gotten far into the first real level. Maybe it gets better, but it does just feel like a poor man's Dishonored.Maybe I should give it another try.			"

												Despite the bugs ( hopefully patch some of the bigger ones at least) Thief is a game which to get the full fun from it is to play it as stealth as possible , even going ghost at times (not knocking out guards etc), stealing jewellery and golden knifes and forks will be your main concern since the gold that u get is used to upgrade your focus abilities or abilities in general or just buy some new cool gear , like wirecutters different kind of arrows and more, you will WANT to steal *shinies* ooooh SHINIES O.O Shadows are your friend stealth is your game. The AI of the game has some nice touches imo its not that bad that people tend to say well not that bad if u think of all the stealth games that are out there, for example if u let a chest open and not close it up the guard will notice it and he will start searching for u, sometimes though it doesnt work that good  like for example i once got a painting out of the way to unconceal a safe and left it like it was and the guard didnt notice that the painting was out of its normal position  maybe i was hoping for too much ! Anyways i do recommend the game for all stealth lovers and gamers that have patience and dont mind of waiting the patrol to pass and then start stealing the bejesus out of em :p			"

												I enjoyed playing this game.  The end was ""What just happened?"" , but I still enjoyed it.  It has stealth and can play without killing.  I liked the fact that compared to early games you can't take 3 people out standing next to each other without alerting people.  The graphics were vastly better than Deadly Shadows.  The areas are bigger and more explorable.  Multiple levels and not just ground level and a few places to acend.  Guards actually re-lite fires I put out, if they were alerted, yay for guards with brains.  The whole people/guard AI was better.  The basic story line is the whole save day/girl thing but it was still fun.  Now off to find the rest of the loot.    Bonk.....what's your is MINE!!			"

												Thief 4 isn't so much imagined and designed as it is churned out by a giant game-making computer in the service of Square Enix's finance department. Everything is entirely as expected. Scripting awful, cut-scenes awful, voice-acting painful, plot unintelligible, graphics brown, textures popping in over a period of minutes (shoddy Unreal3 engine) etc. etc. The main city is not so much a real place as a more or less random copying and pasting of building parts. 75% of the door are just background and cannot be opened. All of the rooms contain the same things. That's not to say there isn't some fun in trying to steal all the trinkets on the side-quests, but the money you get for them doesn't buy anything useful, so there's not much incentive: the three main gadgets can all be purchased for peanuts early in the game. Main quest levels are abysmal until level 5, when the programmers finally decided to try their hand at level design, rather than just linear paths or maps no bigger than my house. After this, it gets a bit better, but then you have the plot to compete with (such as it is). Halfway through the game the obligatory zombies appear that can also see behind them, apparently, which is just cheating. Other misfires include some shadows which don't quite work properly, some light areas which shade you just fine, a sneak button AND a sneaky-sneak button, and the ability to climb up and fall down only when the game says you can. There are also some third-person climby bits like Uncharted and a level running away from things, like a fifth-rate Uncharted. To sum up: it's not terrible, but you're better off spending a few pounds on Dishonored, a game created with some degree of imagination, invention and passion, or playing Thief 1 and 2 (costing pennies), or playing The Dark Project (costing nothing) or even playing Thief 3, or perhaps just pressing your thumbs in your eyes until it hurts. 5/10.

												If you like sneaking, theivery, and assassination, this is the best game you will ever 'aquire'. It's hard, it has a good backstory, and you can steal just about anything and everything worth stealing. This is by far the best stealth game I have ever played, and has the best, most realistic stealth mechanics I've ever seen. Even if you're more in it for the graphics, this game will surely never disappoint.			"

												Despite a variety of bugs that signal the game was probably released too early, Thief is a title to recommend to people who like sneaking through the shadows.  DIRECT combat really isn't much of an option - sneaking around your opponents or distracting them usually works better. If the guards see you, run like hell (or reload a save). The story writing probably could have been a bit more fluid as the dialogue in particular is a bit cheesy at times. There are a few bugs, like the treasure map hunt that currently has no end, that need to be patched. The controls take some getting used to (such as the ""drop down"" button not typical in PC games), but once mastered, the game is genuinely fun to play. For anyone moderately serious about gaming and worried the game is too casual, I recommend playing on the hardest difficulty setting and turning a lot of the unnecessary bits off (such as the Focus ability). Eidos did allow for relatively nice modding in that way. Would I recommend to a friend? Depends on what sort of game they like, but I enjoyed my time in Thief thoroughly (college work did not get done).			"

												It certainly has some of the atmospherics from the original Thief games - but the story ends up devolving into not much by the end of the game. The side missions get a little repetitive and don't seem to really be big money items (why would I steal something that's worth only a few gold?), which end up making it longer than it probably needs to be. I found that for the last three chapters I just sped through and didn't bother fully exploring. It felt like I'd seen everything after the first 3 chapters of playing.			"

												Pros: patiently sneaking through this is fun, tense and challenging. Caters to many challenge levels. Lots of stealth tools and options. Captures a lot of major elements of the first three games. Memorable missions that flesh out the world. Focused plot. Disturbing, dark atmosphere. Playstyles, collectibles and Thieving Challenges add replayability.Cons: buggy, albeit I didn't encounter any that did more than break the immersion. Bad dialog with ok-to-bad voice acting, and obvious repetition of lines. Slow start, and not all will find it engaging even once it does get going. Plot revolves around the obnoxious, snarky, angsty Erin, and can be hard to follow. As a reboot, does indeed drop most major elements of the lore and world of the first three.My recommendation: lower your expectations, know not to expect something that lives up to the first three or to modern stealth games, steel yourself whenever Erin speaks... and this can actually be quite enjoyable through almost all of it. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, the game itself is unlikely to win you over.And whatever you do, don't pay full price.The four comics are decent. The first two provide backstory for the game, the last two explain more about events during it. They make up a 20 minute read. There The soundtrack is great, fits the gloomy mood of the game. It has a running time of 26 and a half minutes. The digital artbook is a fairly interesting look into the design work. It has 22 pages.Overall, if it looks to you like you'll love the game itself, and only in that case, it's worth spending a little extra on this edition.			"

												I played the Thief demo when it came out in the late 90's. I bought it as soon as it came out. I bought Thief 2. I bought the third ""Thief"". I bought Thief Gold when it came out. Then I repurchased all three on Steam. Suffice to say, I really REALLY like Thief. Needless to say, I had high expectations for this game.It didn't disappoint! This iteration is addicting, despite some issues. To avoid a tl;dr, I'll summarize:The good:Love the bow. LOVE the bow. Ambient sound and music is spot on (a cornerstone of the originals)Rich environments and some ""feels real"" settingsAt least one level that will make you want to curl up into a fetal position and weep in shame at your fearThe bad:Can't jump, except for under certain circumstancesSome levels feel small-ish, some feel abnormally large (i.e. a wooden ship that seems to have acres of square footage)The map. It's nigh useless, especially if you're trying to track down the level entrances once you've beat the game. The ugly (spoilers?):The story. That's not to say it's a bad story, because it really isn't, in my humble opinion. It's just incomplete. Garrett was out for a year, and there's loud hints dropped that he was in an asylum. Why? How did he get out? The Gloom is gutting The City. Why? What is it? Where did it come from? Is it even connected with the plot? What happened to Erin? Who IS Erin, anyway? And oh my! Garrett's eye is part of a mysterious crystal! Yet nothing comes of that. His eye remains intact and the crystal seems to get put back together without it. So why bring it up? Square Enix and Eidos Montreal have created a great platform that could see some very epic gameplay, it's just a shame they didn't spend a wee bit longer on fleshing out the main story. "

I wanted to turn off the visual assist but it requires the rumble of a controller.  Otherwise I enjoy it and have played quite a lot.			"

												shiver me quiver can only carry 15 arrows but me pockets are deep.Restrictive story based play , prologued , soon expanded to open world roaming , main mission and side missions coincide , hidden chests and loot to plunder , a worthy Thief sucessor despite some reviews.most decisions are story based , playing on hard custon based options , i found it easy to plunder.once inside a house tread as you will , not even the inhabitants in the next room will bother you. as it is obvious the doors do not open.. whom live in a house like this.and no person is ever home alike the original. No need to go back to the clock tower to stash your loot , your pockets are infinite , your quivers and health control the plot. as does the story line allowing you into more houses as the story path allows you.once its taken the loot is not replenished ,  it seems home owners rip their door knobs off and seal the rooms.character enviroment interaction and population of the story world is non existant.

												I think a lot of the reviews for this game are a bit harsh. I mean it's not going to win game of the year or anything but for the money it's pretty much all there. It's got a half decent story, it's not exactly challenging but it's fun enough. It's just an easy play, you don't have to think about it to much and it's entertaining. The graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is good, it plays a bit like dishonoured which is definatly a plus in my book. Overall if you have a bit of spare cash it 's worth it if you are into stealth and stuff like that, however there isn't as much combat as i thought there would be and frankly the combat sytem sucks, because there isn't really one there to be honest. combat, on the rare occasion that you actually get into it consists of mashing r and holding down q... not the greatest but it's not a big deal because it's a very small part of the game. If you are not sure wait untill it goes on sale (like i did). but honestly it is really not as bad as the reviews and metascore make out.			"

												Some nice mechanics and good stealth game massively let down by a some what bizzare plot, missing (basic and necessary) features and a scoring system for the main game that makes no sense. *SPOILERS*The open world thing is great but you can't place your own map markers which makes getting round really hard, there are some Assassin's Creedy pipe and wall climb bits in the missions that don't appear anywhere else in the game and give you a really obvious ""go this way its easier than sneaking past the guards"" path. The bank heist mission is interesting and adds some slight depth to the city, but is really just a way of getting cash and using the new mechanic of avoiding the cameras. The city felt alive and chaotic, people living on top of people and it gave some great areas to explore, but after a while I found them more and more like a labyrinth. Many of the areas look the same or similar enough to be confusing, and the map was less than useless at solving this problem when it came to finding the way into a window or to the start of a mission. I often walked around trying to find my way into an area only to find myself compleetly lost. The gameplay is fantasticly fun, sneaking up behind guards and cracking them in the back of the head was brilliant. The environment often allowed me to trick the guards, triggering a guard dog to get them to huddle in one area so I could explore the opposite side. I regularly got caught out by traps and guards not being where I expected them to be (like behind a door facing it so when you open it they see you) but they where all scenarios I could believe would happen if you thought someone was going to break in. It makes sense that people guarding something will be looking at the obvious way in....Allthough magic is a core part of the story it doesn't have to be part of the gameplay if you don't want it too. I prefered to play using it as little as possible and trying to work it all out on the fly unaided but that isn't always possible. There are two upgrade trees, one magical (exchanging loot for skill points that can also be found by exploring the story missions) and one bought from vendors (loot for upgrades and tools). I found myself using the tools more partly because there are multiple places you can get upgrades but only one (irritatingly far away) place to buy skill points.I beat the game in about 12 hours on medium, I didn't do all the side missions but I was satisfied with the level of quality for the price I payed, the custom mission system gives the game some real replayability and once you get past the story you can just have some fun with it. There's even a mission in a brothel where you can nock everyone out with, what appears to be, heroin. The graphics are stable even on my older machine, some of the fabrics have artefacts in the rendering that I can't get rid of even after messing with the settings but I expect this is a driver issue and will be sorted soon (it in no way affects the gameplay). At the time of writing the benchmark tool is not brilliant, it hovers around the 20-25 FPS mark regardles of changing the setting so I assume that this again is a driver issue (not being optimised for the benchmark tool) but the game itself runs much higher than that.*REALLY STORY VITAL SPOILERS*The ending was odd, why did he put his hand on the book? What did that achieve?I never really understood the deal with the android people, and when I completed Ectors missions he says the man is working but we never get to see it which would have been a nice reward for doing his missions. The final 'boss battle' for want of a better word was good fun, it took me a few goes to work out where the shards had gone and to collect them. The shadows mechanic used was intelligent and fits well with the stealth aspects of the game.			"

												Thief is a Stealth game with both fun and addiciting mechanics that will surely make you feel like the Master Thief the game wants you to be. But the biggest problem with this game is the story. It has to be one of the laziest, insensible stories to ever be featured in a video game. At very few points is it ever interesting, and at very points does it make sense. The open-world is dull, but can be fun, and the ability to set modifiers for your difficulty mode when starting the game allows you to go as hardcore as fan could want. If you look past the story and lack of life, then this game can be really fun. But only if you like Stealth games. 6/10			"

												I must say at first I was really excited for this game, then after reading through the reviews I was a little off-put. There was a stagering amount of negativity towards Thief.However after seeing it in the Steam sales and deciding to trust my gut and take a leap I must say that so far I am very impressed and satisfied. One could argue that the combat system is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ But a game about a theif shouldn't really support that much combat should it.it is a little awkward though, without a block you are left on the option of V to doge and R to melee. I can quite easily overlook this however as I do feel the point of the game is to avoid combat altogether and the fact that the mission doesn't automatically fail you for entering a fight is nice.All in all I I recommend Theif. It's AI is awesome (mostly)... I noted that while sneaking through a rather small room extinquishing candles as I went it was rather odd that the AI wasn't at all fussed by the fact the room was slowly becoming darker. - then, I had another moment when I stole from a display case and thoughtlessly left it open, seeing this the AI yelled ""There's someone here"" and began to search for me. I do think this is quite a nice touch.  OH and the actual  stealth is very well executed.			"

												Delving into the past is always a risky move and may not always win a company the encore that they desired. There is a very thin line between changing to much and changing too little in these sorts of games. Change too little and you will be branded as lazy, but change too much and people will start writing death threats to you. To be able to stand on that line takes skill, which unfortunately isn't always there.Thief, by Eidos Montreal is the reinvention of a classic franchise that has players take on the role of Garrett, THE master thief. When the city that created and defines him is threatened, Garrett must step from the shadows and uncover the truth before his world is torn apart forever.You begin the game in the middle of a job. Trailing along with you is your young, rash and slightly over confident protégéé Erin. In a nutshell you are tasked with stealing a special stone, you get caught up in the middle of a cult's ritual, Erin dies and you fall asleep for a year.It is when you wake up that the story truly begins, if you can call it a story. Throughout the 8 main missions it is really quite difficult to keep track of the storyline. All of the major events and characters that are meant to invoke an emotional response in the player just feel dull and boring, and the story elements just feel like a puzzle that's had all the pieces thrown in in the hope they will fit together. The story has to main ideas, the city is in peril and Garret just doesn't care and a revolution has begun but Garret just want's to find Erin. Your quest to find answers will unfortunately be quite boring and mundane, in many cases will only be half answered. ""How the hell did Garrett get super thief powers?"" is just one example. If you're looking for an enticing story to keep you hooked, the predictable betrayals and confusing plot points aren't enough to carry you through to the unsatisfying ending.However even with a whitewash for a story there is a silver lining, however thin. The stealth and thievery in this game is tremendously enjoyable, addictive even. Thief has abandoned the action loaded gameplay for a slow and stealthy style, and they have done this to good effect. As you will find as you play the game a majority of the missions require you to steal everything in your path. This will involve; lifting valuables, breaking into safes, and disappearing into the shadows. To help you with this you are given an arsenal of different gadgets, that will allow you to access new areas so that you can steal even more. Fire, Water and Gas arrows are also invaluable in distracting your enemies.Different arrows available to you in ThiefUsing all your gadgets and equipment effectively is extremely rewarding in a way that is hard to describe. It's as if you are a real thief, sneaking around in the shadows, disabling traps with your wire cutters, opening vents with your wrench or dousing flaming torches with your water. It is this feeling that probably kept me playing through even the worst moments of the game.The thieving in itself is an artform that will take many an hour to master. In every draw or cabinet there could be valuable treasure, on every desk there could be a clue to help you find a valuable treasure. It is up to you to find which draws actually do contain valuables and which on which desktops there are clues, but one thing is for certain. The thieving aspect can be dangerous, a guard could spot you at any moment so you must be very careful. The fact that it is so easy for a guard to spot you whilst you are opening a draw and the fact that you are very vulnerable whilst doing so creates an extremely addictive tension, and one must experience it in order to truly understand. It also allows one to become distracted so that they no longer have to concentrate on the many pitfalls of the game.Nice Golden Wine Bottle you can steal in ThiefSide jobs, as in any game, are optional. But if you truly want to understand what drives this dark and gloomy city it is strongly recommended. These jobs will allow you to meet citizens offering high risk jobs that can earn you some serious gold and some interesting experiences. Challenge mode is also recommended if you want to test your sneaking skills in well designed, timed scenarios. There are enough of these little hidden jobs and missions to keep you occupied and exploring the dark and mysterious city of Thief.Surprisingly enough this game often feels too dark. Yes as a Thief it would make sense that most of the things you do occur in darkness but it seems that, no matter where you go the lighting never changes. You could be in a house, castle or out on the streets and it still feels like you are just in a dark room trying to steal stuff. This doesn't make the game any better or worse, and it does create some atmosphere but I think it would have been more interesting if the lighting had have varied more throughout the game.Dark City of ThiefThe game is sometimes surprisingly too dark.Unfortunately when you start looking to aspects other than stealth to keep you entertained you will find that you are very limited. The combat for example, feels like it was thrown in as an after thought. Yes it is a stealth game and the aim is not to get caught but occasionally you will run into the odd guard. All you have to defend yourself is a high tech metal club and a weak dodge move and when you are coming up against fully armoured men with crossbows and swords, theres not much you can do to stop them from running you through.Armoured City Guard in ThiefThief Combat isn't great.On this gloomy note we shall move to the sound glitches. On multiple occasions I experienced looping guard dialogue, that continued until I got annoyed and shot the guard. There was also some inaudible speech during in-game cutscenes. It annoyed me even more that these occurred more often towards the end of the game, which means that I missed out on something that could have been vital to the storyline, but anyway. While there were too many sound glitches for a AAA game like Thief the experience wasn't completely ruined and I was able to push on.To sum up, if you are looking for a stealth based experience then Thief will probably fit the bill, although Dishonored may be more to your liking. Despite it's terrible storyline and multiple glitches it was enjoyable and I feel I got enough out of it for it to be worth the money.Thief Official SiteOur YouTube Channel			"

Dishornored stole from Thief, not the other way around, Thief was started before Dishonored and finished after, I would take Thief over Dishonored anyday.  Played through Dishonored once, probably will never touch it again.  That will not be true for Thief.			"

												Excellent game. Love the city design which has lots of twists, turns and nooks and crannies and multiple levels. There are a lot of hidden areas and secrets and much to explore. I miss Stephen Russell as Garrets voice but the new voice actor is okay and the game is still worth it. Some very interesting missions. Mutliple ways to play. The atmosphere is good and there are a lot of collectibles to get. All the Thief games are good and this belongs with them but they all have pros and cons compared with each other. Atmosphere wise this game is great in some areas but in others it feels less Thief-like. It is definitely still worth playing and there is some excellent dialog and fun moments/surprises. Graphically this game is absolutely stunning and will blow you away. I haven't finished yet but up to now the storyline is very strong. Definitely rewards patient and thorough players. If you like stealth games like Deus Ex then you will love this.			"

												This is the first time that I played a game from the Thief franchise, so I can't say anything in comparing to those. But overall I like Thief. It offers a great stealth game where you still have the freedom to play through it as you desire. You can earn point towards a different playstyle with every action you take in the game. At the end of every chapter, you get an overall score and it shows you your most used style, at the end you can take missions according to this style. The main story sometimes is a bit dull, and I find it very boring to keep running after a girl who can't stop whining. Sometimes this bothters me immensely when she pops up on my screen. Also, I didn't really like chapter 5, but that just because I found it really dark & scary. And truth be told, those kind of stuff just ain't for me. But the 'bad' things didn't spoil it for me, because it's so rewarding when you can sneak around stealing stuff and nobody knows you're there. If you like sneaking around, this game is for you! :)			"

												This is the first Thief game I have ever played. I enjoyed the missions a lot, but sometimes the storyline was hard to comprehend. And this was not the most interesting game ever. Overall, I give this game a 6.5/10. I got it for free with my GPU. Not sure if I would have bought this game. I recommend this game for people wo enjoy stealth, creepy kind of games.			"

												Solid reboot of a classic series. While its issues are well-publicized (annoying button mashing, linear segments, iffy AI, poor writing, etc), most of said issues have been completely overblown by most critics. Yes, there are linear segments in the game but they comprise a tiny portion of the overall experience. Of the 40+ hours I spent playing the game, maybe an hour of that consisted of linear segments. The vast majority of game takes place in large, open-ended areas that promote exploration. AI can bug out on occasion and get stuck on the environment or loop VO indefinitely but these cases are the minority. On Master difficulty, the AI is pretty decent and will definitely offer a challenge. The game's writing isn't great but it's not the abomination some reviewers make it out to be. It's pretty standard videogame writing. If you're solely motivated by story, that may be a problem for you but if you play stealth games because you actually enjoy stealth gameplay, it won't be. Combat is clunky and unsatisfying but that was the case in the previous games as well. And really, if you're fighting in a Thief game, you're playing it wrong.Ultimately, when played properly (stealing all the loot without touching any NPCs) on Master difficulty, the overall experience is faithful to the series. You still get the same satisfaction from stealing without being detected. Make no mistake, the new Thief is very much a pure stealth game. Unlike the recent Splinter Cell and Hitman games, combat is not a viable playstyle. If the idea of sneaking around and stealing stuff isn't inherently appealing to you, you will not enjoy this game. However, if you're looking for a solid stealth game that retains most of the strengths of the Thief franchise, you will likely enjoy this entry in the series.			"

												Well it lost the feel of the first ones some how. I personally didn't like how it felt linear. You could only attach rope arrows to certain 'fixed' spots. My favorite part about the original games was you could put those things (rope arrows) anywhere and get to some really crazy places... Still good though.			"

												""Do you recommend this game?""  Barely.  Despite a bevy of complaints, I still find it hard to pick either way.  I did enjoy playing it for a solid 40 hours.  On the other hand, I came away from it very disappointed.  It plays like a Thief game.  It sounds like a Thief game.  It doesn't FEEL like a Thief game, though.  I'll explain why in a moment but let me get to the good points first.  Oh and by the way this will be full of spoilers.  The sneaking and actual gameplay is great.  Most levels were actually surprisingly tricky to sneak through unnoticed.  But there was always a way.  I must've replayed most sections at least a few times trying to get it just right.  Figuring out those situations was quite satisfying.  Two levels in particular (one in an abandoned asylum, the other in some fantastic buried ruins) affected me quite a lot.  One was marvelously creepy and scary with tons of great moments.  The other was just a joy to wander through and wonder at the mystery of it all.  And it helped that both levels were quite nostalgic of great moments/themes in past Thief games.And one more good thing I can say is that, taken on its own merits, I think the story in this game wasn't terrible.  I almost cared about it at times.  And it definately had me wondering where it would go next... I kept playing just to see if the great potential of it all would pan out.  Their were certainly some fantastic opportunities for some really classic revalations to be made......which the writers/devs completely failed to take advantage of.  That's the first of my complaints.  The story overall does fall flat in the end.  And speaking of the ending, it's one of the worst I've seen in a while.  They tried to make it artsy, which some may appreciate.  However.... it comes way too fast, is way, way too short, resolves the story only as much as it absolutely has to, and leaves to rot all that glorious potential for tie-ins back to past games.  There is absolutely no attempt to continue to hook the player.  Nothing at all to leave you saying, ""Ooooh I can't wait to see where the next game goes!"" Looking back at the game in general, none of the interesting personality of past Thief games is there.  This I believe is probably because they decided to completely leave out all the great factions from previous games.  No Hammerites.  No Mechanists.  No Pagans.  In fact they're never even mentioned aloud.  There's guards, but they're not anywhere near as interesting to listen to.  And they repeat their lines way way way too often for how dull they are.  I miss the oafish buffoon guard complaining that he'd rather be at a bear baiting.  The side missions are mostly useless time-fillers that are there just to let you earn some money without actually providing any interesting content.  The environments look beautiful but nothing feels lived in.  There's plenty of books to pick up and read, but doing so opens an extremely basic, minimal text menu.  With all the beautiful modelling, texturing and animation in the game... why not show me reading an actual book?  Immerse me in the world more!  Don't remind me I'm playing a video game by showing me a menu unless I'm trying to change video settings or something.  I very nearly didn't recommend this game, for all these reasons.  Particularly for the horrendous ending.  You never want to end a game like this with a, ""WTF, that's it?!?""  Honestly, I think that kinda ruined the game for me.  But the more I think back on it, the more I can see that I did enjoy the majority of the time I spent actually playing it.  Particularly because the missions were challenging to perfect.  Given some time I could see myself going back and having a bit of fun knocking out the few achievements and secrets I missed.  But I'd also be disappointed again by all the wasted potential and lost opportunities for a game that could've been truely great.			"

												Wow!  I cannot believe how well done this game is.  Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere.  This company knows how to do it right.  I was taken in and became really invested in the game from the first cut scene.  I've read some horrible reviews on this game, and after playing I completely disagree.  Excellent job on the immersion as well as overall gameplay.  Gives a feel of real danger and thrill as well as the nostalgic feeling I was looking for from playing the first Thief and Thief 2.   I really hope there comes a sequel as I will pick it up in a heartbeat.  Only con I saw was equipment was fairly plentiful for a normal play through.  Playing on Master now, but should not have had to start there.  The quests are plentiful enough and plenty of achievements that replayablility is quite high.  Excellent storytelling!  That is something that is really missing from games today. "

												Pros: patiently sneaking through this is fun, tense and challenging. Caters to many challenge levels. Lots of stealth tools and options. Captures a lot of major elements of the first three games. Memorable missions that flesh out the world. Focused plot. Disturbing, dark atmosphere. Playstyles, collectibles and Thieving Challenges add replayability.Cons: buggy, albeit I didn't encounter any that did more than break the immersion. Bad dialog with ok-to-bad voice acting, and obvious repetition of lines. Slow start, and not all will find it engaging even once it does get going. Plot revolves around the obnoxious, snarky, angsty Erin, and can be hard to follow. As a reboot, does indeed drop most major elements of the lore and world of the first three.My recommendation: lower your expectations, know not to expect something that lives up to the first three or to modern stealth games, steel yourself whenever Erin speaks... and this can actually be quite enjoyable through almost all of it. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, the game itself is unlikely to win you over.And whatever you do, don't pay full price.The four comics are decent. The first two provide backstory for the game, the last two explain more about events during it. They make up a 20 minute read. There The soundtrack is great, fits the gloomy mood of the game. It has a running time of 26 and a half minutes. The digital artbook is a fairly interesting look into the design work. It has 22 pages.Overall, if it looks to you like you'll love the game itself, and only in that case, it's worth spending a little extra on this edition.			"

												The game is a lot better than what the big reviews make you think. A lot of people look at it with this franchise's previous titles in mind, but the game is very solid on it's own.I for one enjoyed it very much and hope that there will be another installment.			"

												Wow!  I cannot believe how well done this game is.  Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere.  This company knows how to do it right.  I was taken in and became really invested in the game from the first cut scene.  I've read some horrible reviews on this game, and after playing I completely disagree.  Excellent job on the immersion as well as overall gameplay.  Gives a feel of real danger and thrill as well as the nostalgic feeling I was looking for from playing the first Thief and Thief 2.   I really hope there comes a sequel as I will pick it up in a heartbeat.  Only con I saw was equipment was fairly plentiful for a normal play through.  Playing on Master now, but should not have had to start there.  The quests are plentiful enough and plenty of achievements that replayablility is quite high.  Excellent storytelling!  That is something that is really missing from games today. "

The game also offers 3 different types of play: Opportunist, Predator and Ghost. These gameplay ellements will test your skill (Apart from predator) and it can feel so satisfying to complete a chapter without being seen or with everything looted.The story in this game is confusing to say the least but gets quite interesting towards the end of the game.I would recommend this game to anyone.

												I've heard a lot of complaints from people around the time of this game's release, which made me skeptical from buying it. So I decided tot hold off until it went on sale and then bought it to see what all the fuss is about. I'm almost finished with chapter 3 at the time of this review and I can honestly say I'm pretty impressed with the game. It's not as good of a stealth game as something like Dishonored or Hitman, but it's a good game. The combat sucks, the AI is very bipolar, they either are oblivious to you or spot you from a mile away, and the story/enviroment isn't that good. Besides that the game is pretty good, I'd not grab it at full price, but when it goes on sale it's a great choice to spend your money on.			"

												Fun game, but not great however.Don't get me wrong, I definitely think my money was well spent buying it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. The bad:-As I never played the original thief games, the nostaglia factor was completely lost on me.- You need to mash ""E"" to do literally anything in the game, but once you get over that, its not that big of a deal.-The story doesn't really pick up for a while. -The puzzles are an insult to my intelegence, the take about 30 seconds to solve.-The sound is really messed up; sometimes there is someone talking in the next room and you will have no idea. Conversly, someone could be on the other side of the road and sound like they are right next to you. (this gets really anoying)-The supernatural skills, akin to those found is Dishonored, are next to useless. Combined with their cost to use ingame, they are a complete waste.-The guard AI should be totally scrapped, no redeeming qualities about it.-Character models look really weird-No character developementOn the bright side:-The game was able to introduce a supernatural element without coming across as hoaky-The art style and graphics quality are both beautiful in a very dark way. A powerful GPU is strongly recommended.-The game, like most other stealth titles actually requires some degree of skill.-Stealing things never gets old. My sum up:-mechanics 7.5/10-art style 9.5/10-graphics quality 9/10-story 6.7/10-character design 6.5/10-character develepement 4/10-guard AI 3/10 "

												Now that I have calmed down from my ""nostalgic"" rage, I have to admit: Thief (2014) is a decent game. I wouldn't go call it a master piece or very good, but it's fairly good and a nice experience on its own. If you start comparing it to the original versions or even Dishonored you are very likely to find a ton of things to nitpick and cry about. This was the mistake I did the first time, and although it was somewhat justified, it was in the end a bit unfair since I have to judge the game as ITSELF, not as a recreation of bygone glory days or as a rival to something else.With that said, I personally have enjoyed this new installment. There are, like mentioned, TONS of little and bigger things to complain about, namely the very restricted movement around the small sandbox environment you dwell in, and buggy A.I. (I just love the dialogue audio problem where the guards keep repeating the same things all the time... not). I also found the new way of peeking around the corners absolutely stupid (whatever happened to good ol' Q and E?), and the cinematic cutscenes look dámn weird at times - from cinematic view, that is. The story I couldn't care less about, and the chance to roam yourself from mission to mission in the city, although cool at first, is just tedious in the long run and I find myself getting lost half the time, thanks to the pretty useless map. I just wanted to get the mission started, not to trying to navigate through the confusing city layout and pondering which rope or ladder would lead me to a window that'd took me to the right place!And with THAT all said... I still like the game. The missions are fun to play when you adjust yourself to the game mechanics and the overall philosophy (meaning, the less you kill the more you enjoy the challenge), and some of the maps are just brilliant when it comes to gameplay, almost bringing memories from the Thieves of yore. Do I recommend this rebirth? Meh... on sale, definetely. If you loved Dishonored and unchristianly worshipped the original ones as your Lords and Saviors, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one as well... provided you play it with open mind. So, I might even recommend it. I think I will.			"

												Thief, is a game of stealth, is a game of risk. i really do enjoy the game play of thief. granted i haven't played too much of it. it shows promise. i think that the more you play this game, you'll see that if your as quite as a church mouse, and are quick, you'll get through the game with ease. but, if your like me who trys super hard not to be seen, and fails almost all the time. this is the game for you if you are paticent and steady. this is a game with a good story behind it. stealth is the key and if you know what your doing then you'll get thorugh the game in no time. but challange yourself in this game. make it your goal to get all the little treasures that are hidden throught the game.If you like stealth and a good story line, this is the game for you. yes its starts slow but, if you stick with this game it'll pickl up and you'll understand the game a lot better. yes i would recommend this game for sure!

												I have played Thief since it originally came out, back when dirt was still new :) This version is quite different from the original series, Garrett is still the main character of the game, but I don't care too much for his ""look"", I think he's too skinny, though that is probably because back in those days he would be skinny like that, especially living the kind of life he would have led as a thief. I don't care for his overall look, but his voice is still Garrett all the way. Most of the time you don't ""see"" Garrett because you are playing in a first person perspective, it's only in the cut scenes that you see Garrett.The game play isn't really like the original game either, but I can't complain, it's interesting and playable.I have been playing the game for a few days now and have a pretty good feel for the gameplay, you are given tasks to complete, so far I have been able to figure out most of what has been asked of me, I have only had to look up a few things online. I like the save game feature so I can try out things without losing my place.Now to the stats, I wasn't sure if I would be able to play this game on my system, and honestly it's barely playable, BUT I can play it, hardcore gamers wouldn't like playing on my laptop, but for me it's just fine. My laptop is under the minimum specs they say this game can be played on (barely), it wasn't until I saw a video on YouTube of another player with the same specs I have, actually I had double the ram of his, other than that, the specs were the same and it looked playable, couple that with the fact that they had it on for half price last weekend, I figured if I couldn't play it at all, I wouldn't have lost too much money.SPECSThe specs of my laptop are: Acer Aspire V5-571P-6698, 15.6 inch screen, Intel Core i3-2377M 1.5 GHz (3 MB Cache), 8 GB DDR3 RAM, 750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive, Graphics Coprocessor Intel HD Graphics, Graphics Card Ram Size	128 MB, Win 8.1 64 bitAs I said, it doesn't even have the required minimum specs to play, but it does play, on the lowest settings. The only setting I don't have at the bottom is the resolution, I have it set to the same resolution of my screen, I believe it's 1280x768 or something close to that.I do get the black screen when I first start the game, I have tried the various fixes and so far none of them have worked, BUT the game does start after 4-5 minutes, fortunately I am able to alt-tab out of the game and surf the internet while I wait for the music to start on the game, then I go back into the game, that's the worst part for me is waiting for it to start, I also don't exit the game if I think I might play it a short time later, I just hit esc to pause the game, then alt-tab out of it....I have a rather slow internet, 3MBPS at best, so it took me 2 days to download it, if I would have left my computer on overnight, it would have been even sooner, but it was worth the wait. I would give it 7 out of 10 stars, the reason I don't give it 10 stars is because the game, as good as it is, isn't really a major match with the previous versions, it's close, but no cigar.I use my keyboard and mouse to play, it works for me, I did reverse the mouse up/down movement, I have always preferred the airplane style of moves where when you pull back on the mouse, you look up and when you push forward, you look down. The keyboard and mouse settings are pretty intuitive, I haven't remapped any of the keys, yet...I would recommend it for anyone who likes first person shooters, you don't have to have played the previous versions to enjoy this game, it can stand on its own, though if you know the history it will make for a richer story experience.

												Okay is probaby the best word to descirbe this game.It's got great gameplay to start, and it's not hard to grasp. The game also offers 3 different types of play: Opportunist, Predator and Ghost. These gameplay ellements will test your skill (Apart from predator) and it can feel so satisfying to complete a chapter without being seen or with everything looted.The story in this game is confusing to say the least but gets quite interesting towards the end of the game.I would recommend this game to anyone. It's short but entertaining.			"

												I've heard a lot of complaints from people around the time of this game's release, which made me skeptical from buying it. So I decided tot hold off until it went on sale and then bought it to see what all the fuss is about. I'm almost finished with chapter 3 at the time of this review and I can honestly say I'm pretty impressed with the game. It's not as good of a stealth game as something like Dishonored or Hitman, but it's a good game. The combat sucks, the AI is very bipolar, they either are oblivious to you or spot you from a mile away, and the story/enviroment isn't that good. Besides that the game is pretty good, I'd not grab it at full price, but when it goes on sale it's a great choice to spend your money on.			"

												Now that I have calmed down from my ""nostalgic"" rage, I have to admit: Thief (2014) is a decent game. I wouldn't go call it a master piece or very good, but it's fairly good and a nice experience on its own. If you start comparing it to the original versions or even Dishonored you are very likely to find a ton of things to nitpick and cry about. This was the mistake I did the first time, and although it was somewhat justified, it was in the end a bit unfair since I have to judge the game as ITSELF, not as a recreation of bygone glory days or as a rival to something else.With that said, I personally have enjoyed this new installment. There are, like mentioned, TONS of little and bigger things to complain about, namely the very restricted movement around the small sandbox environment you dwell in, and buggy A.I. (I just love the dialogue audio problem where the guards keep repeating the same things all the time... not). I also found the new way of peeking around the corners absolutely stupid (whatever happened to good ol' Q and E?), and the cinematic cutscenes look dámn weird at times - from cinematic view, that is. The story I couldn't care less about, and the chance to roam yourself from mission to mission in the city, although cool at first, is just tedious in the long run and I find myself getting lost half the time, thanks to the pretty useless map. I just wanted to get the mission started, not to trying to navigate through the confusing city layout and pondering which rope or ladder would lead me to a window that'd took me to the right place!And with THAT all said... I still like the game. The missions are fun to play when you adjust yourself to the game mechanics and the overall philosophy (meaning, the less you kill the more you enjoy the challenge), and some of the maps are just brilliant when it comes to gameplay, almost bringing memories from the Thieves of yore. Do I recommend this rebirth? Meh... on sale, definetely. If you loved Dishonored and unchristianly worshipped the original ones as your Lords and Saviors, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one as well... provided you play it with open mind. So, I might even recommend it. I think I will.			"

												This is a an interesting review for me. Being a massive fan of the thief series in general, I had mixed feelings about this game before it was released.Being a fanboi i was dissapointed in the desion not to use Stephen Russel as the voice of Garret. As much as the guy they got to voice him has done a great job at it, and not ruined it (for me anyway), its still not quite Garret. Certain bits of the script aint great, but thats not the new guys fault.I personally have enjoyed playing the game, the story engaged me, and I like more of the elements of the gameplay than dislike.Foe people who have never played a Thief game, I can 100% recomend this as an enjoyable stealth game. People who are very familiar with the series however, may not enjoy it as much as the previous releases.One last note to finish on though, where have all the taffers gone?			"

												Solid reboot of a classic series. While its issues are well-publicized (annoying button mashing, linear segments, iffy AI, poor writing, etc), most of said issues have been completely overblown by most critics. Yes, there are linear segments in the game but they comprise a tiny portion of the overall experience. Of the 40+ hours I spent playing the game, maybe an hour of that consisted of linear segments. The vast majority of game takes place in large, open-ended areas that promote exploration. AI can bug out on occasion and get stuck on the environment or loop VO indefinitely but these cases are the minority. On Master difficulty, the AI is pretty decent and will definitely offer a challenge. The game's writing isn't great but it's not the abomination some reviewers make it out to be. It's pretty standard videogame writing. If you're solely motivated by story, that may be a problem for you but if you play stealth games because you actually enjoy stealth gameplay, it won't be. Combat is clunky and unsatisfying but that was the case in the previous games as well. And really, if you're fighting in a Thief game, you're playing it wrong.Ultimately, when played properly (stealing all the loot without touching any NPCs) on Master difficulty, the overall experience is faithful to the series. You still get the same satisfaction from stealing without being detected. Make no mistake, the new Thief is very much a pure stealth game. Unlike the recent Splinter Cell and Hitman games, combat is not a viable playstyle. If the idea of sneaking around and stealing stuff isn't inherently appealing to you, you will not enjoy this game. However, if you're looking for a solid stealth game that retains most of the strengths of the Thief franchise, you will likely enjoy this entry in the series.			"

												After seeing the Gamespot feature of this title pitted against Bethesda's Dishonored, one would have an uneasy feeling of having invested on the title. I was a bit conflicted to say the least - I loved the time I spent being Corvo, and honestly speaking it was one of the few stealth titles that I got really immersed in. On the other end, Garrett, the master thief is also an icon to be recognized - he is the hero of the game series that built the foundations of the stealth genre. How could a reboot of the classic title for the the current generations gaming not stay faithful to the original? A bleak picture was already painted for me before even getting a chance play it. But we play on. Maybe at this point, what I really want to say is: take everything you read and hear about with a grain of salt. I know Gamespot is an authority when it comes to games but the best judge is still yourself. (Or putting it more humorously, I already bought the damn game, what other choice do I have but playing it?)Lo and behold, some of the things I watched and read were dispelled once I started playing. Let me first tackle the four points where Gamespot compared this title to Dishonored:1) Authentic World: Both worlds are beautiful. While Dishonored does a great job of utilizing the Steam Punk overlay on a Victorian inspired city, I wouldn't really say that Thief doesn't do an equally good job by creating the The City more realistically. The gloom-stricken city of Thief is as beautiful in its own foggy London town way. The shadows around the corners and the residents' whispers are both functional and gripping, if you care to listen intently. Details were worked on well and this is coming from a player using a low setting laptop, as the GPU capability is quite gimped. The only losing points of Thief is the loading time and the navigation aspect. Continuity, which is technically the end product of both is not as preserved as Dishonored. 2) Creative Choice: Ah this one is a pickle. Dishonored really packed the title with a lot of choice from freedom of movement to the tools and magic the character can make use of. Thief doesn't have this full luxury of this but if you think about it really, being a thief with a limited set of tools and somewhat contract driven, I would have to say the limitation is the very challenge the game offers. The game obviously is single minded as a thief should be - you have something to steal, and too much freedom of choice can become the master thief's undoing. 3) A City Under Chaos: Gamespot says that Thief's City is somewhat under populated for you to feel the Chaos ensuing. I can't really say much for this point as I've only reached the fourth chapter. I haven't seen the full extent of any riots or street fights, if the narrative turns to those events. But the lack of population save for the patrols of the City Watch and underworld gangs should actually serve as reminder to the player that you are a sore thumb in all that is happening. Here is a city under lockdown - and save for the occasional hanging, a ♥♥♥♥♥ displaying her goods, gloom victims, and bystanders - the streets should really be empty. The emptiness of the streets evokes loneliness and a certain level of dread.4) First Person Immersion: Garrett's gloves look really fetching, don't you think? Kidding aside, Thief manages to do an excellent experience in my opinion. The stealth aspect is laid out more in detailed compared to Dishonored. And the way Garrett interacts with objects like Windows and Frames make for an authentic experience. However, it can be overdone, and I would have to agree with Gamespot, as it makes for a redundant experience in some cases. (How different will be this window to the one on the next rooftop really?) The Swoop is a really neat move for the character as it makes you feel really sneaky. Aside from the physical hindrances I've mentioned in Creative choices, I really can't complain much about the way the first-person design was developed for this game.To me, the game is really beautiful in its own respect. While I haven't completed it, I would have to say that still offers the kick that it should for a stealth title. Dishonored, to me, is a slightly different animal. The things Gamespot mentioned that are the losing points of Thief should be inspected in a more positive view, as the lack or absence of some freedoms and features offer the challenge or flavor the title needs. I can't say much for the story yet but so far the journey has been immersing. One of the best features, I think, would be the custom difficulty setting of the game. You can pump the highest difficulty setting of the game with truckloads of additional restrictions to really test your skills. I believe that limitations drive your creativity further, and in a sense creates an atmosphere that being an infamous master thief is a hard life underneath all that stolen glitter and gold.			"

												Fun game, but not great however.Don't get me wrong, I definitely think my money was well spent buying it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. The bad:-As I never played the original thief games, the nostaglia factor was completely lost on me.- You need to mash ""E"" to do literally anything in the game, but once you get over that, its not that big of a deal.-The story doesn't really pick up for a while. -The puzzles are an insult to my intelegence, the take about 30 seconds to solve.-The sound is really messed up; sometimes there is someone talking in the next room and you will have no idea. Conversly, someone could be on the other side of the road and sound like they are right next to you. (this gets really anoying)-The supernatural skills, akin to those found is Dishonored, are next to useless. Combined with their cost to use ingame, they are a complete waste.-The guard AI should be totally scrapped, no redeeming qualities about it.-Character models look really weird-No character developementOn the bright side:-The game was able to introduce a supernatural element without coming across as hoaky-The art style and graphics quality are both beautiful in a very dark way. A powerful GPU is strongly recommended.-The game, like most other stealth titles actually requires some degree of skill.-Stealing things never gets old. My sum up:-mechanics 7.5/10-art style 9.5/10-graphics quality 9/10-story 6.7/10-character design 6.5/10-character develepement 4/10-guard AI 3/10 "

The story I couldn't care less about, and the chance to roam yourself from mission to mission in the city, although cool at first, is just tedious in the long run and I find myself getting lost half the time, thanks to the pretty useless map. I just wanted to get the mission started, not to trying to navigate through the confusing city layout and pondering which rope or ladder would lead me to a window that'd took me to the right place!And with THAT all said... I still like the game. The missions are fun to play when you adjust yourself to the game mechanics and the overall philosophy (meaning, the less you kill the more you enjoy the challenge), and some of the maps are just brilliant when it comes to gameplay, almost bringing memories from the Thieves of yore. Do I recommend this rebirth? Meh... on sale, definetely. If you loved Dishonored and unchristianly worshipped the original ones as your Lords and Saviors, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one as well... provided you play it with open mind. So, I might even recommend it. I think I will.			"

												This is a an interesting review for me. Being a massive fan of the thief series in general, I had mixed feelings about this game before it was released.Being a fanboi i was dissapointed in the desion not to use Stephen Russel as the voice of Garret. As much as the guy they got to voice him has done a great job at it, and not ruined it (for me anyway), its still not quite Garret. Certain bits of the script aint great, but thats not the new guys fault.I personally have enjoyed playing the game, the story engaged me, and I like more of the elements of the gameplay than dislike.Foe people who have never played a Thief game, I can 100% recomend this as an enjoyable stealth game. People who are very familiar with the series however, may not enjoy it as much as the previous releases.One last note to finish on though, where have all the taffers gone?			"

												Very good game overall. A bit different to previous Thief games. More liner in terms of mission space but much more open between missions than other versions of thief. Map is awful, sound is buggy. The main character is really well executed, previous versions of him were much more interesting and better portrayed. Graphics are really good, a set up over human revolution but they seem to have come at a design cost in the form of loading screens. Combat was done much better in previous games. The interactivity of the world is a big improvement over past games. In comparison to Dishonoured, Thief is much darker, even though it draws on similar themes. Garret is a much more interesting character than Corvo but the voice artist in this game does not give the best performance. Gone is the world weary Garret and he is now a bit too smug.			"

												There are lots of conflicting opinions of this game. That's probably because some of the elements of this game are put together quite well while others seem like they were rushed through. Everything about Garret's sneaking around is flawless. The levels are also done well. Everything about his bow is great to. Also Garret has all these modified arrows that are so awesome.On the other hand it feels like the story line and the cut-scenes were an afterthought. If you are impatient you will not like this game. The next gen graphics take a while to load in between levels. Also you can't rush in and overpower your enemies. If you try that you will always die. That sounds bad, but it's not. This game makes the player plan my every move carefully providing them with a good challenge. It plays like a stealth game, because it's a stealth game (what a concept). If you played a previous thief game and enjoyed it you will probably enjoy this one. Over all it was a lot of fun and I that's the most important thing. I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Thief may not be everyone's kind of game and there are many comparisons to Dishonored. Both were extremely playable. The replay value is high and although you can do the usual go through harder difficulty, the 15 or so side missions are also good. My rating on replay value is a 9 with the game about 8. Smooth action except for a minore bug with some of the AI doing a ""jitterbug."" Otherwise Thief is stable with a good story line.			"

												The game is absolutely tremendous, and is a great addition to the Thief franchise. However, there is only one fatal flaw in the game that is making me write this review, and it is that one flaw that ruins the game completely. (NOTE: THIS HAS BEEN FIXED BUT READ ANYWAY)There is a bug in the game, and how it got past the QA team, it is a mystery. The bug consists of me trying to leave the clock tower after beating the 4th chapter. However, when I go to leave the clock tower, I am placed right smack dab in the middle of it, furthermore unable to leave or even proceed with the game. It is because of this fatal error that I simply cannot recommend this game. The game was working absolutely flawless up until this point, and up until then the game was just ruined for me.EDIT: Apparently Square Enix moderators aren't taking this seriously at all on the Thief forums (http://forums.eidosgames.com/showpost.php?p=1999513&postcount=7), as opposed to them quickly answering a gaming magazine about the issue (http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/04/01/users-report-date-related-thief-save-data-corruption-square-enix-responds-.aspx). I've tried doing the suggested action of reverting my computer time to April 8th, but that hasn't worked.Due to the irresponsibility of the company's staff and their lack of response to customers in place of the hasty response to public magazines, This game has earned an indefinite 1/10. EDIT EDIT: The bug has been fixed but the way the staff handled it was still unprofessional. The game is now playable just fine, but who knows what else could happen that could make the game unenjoyable? Only time will tell. The game's great, the techincal support, however, is not. For now, my final verdict is a 6/10, and is reccomended, as opposed to me earlier not reccomending it.			"

												Fun game, but not great however.Don't get me wrong, I definitely think my money was well spent buying it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. The bad:-As I never played the original thief games, the nostaglia factor was completely lost on me.- You need to mash ""E"" to do literally anything in the game, but once you get over that, its not that big of a deal.-The story doesn't really pick up for a while. -The puzzles are an insult to my intelegence, the take about 30 seconds to solve.-The sound is really messed up; sometimes there is someone talking in the next room and you will have no idea. Conversly, someone could be on the other side of the road and sound like they are right next to you. (this gets really anoying)-The supernatural skills, akin to those found is Dishonored, are next to useless. Combined with their cost to use ingame, they are a complete waste.-The guard AI should be totally scrapped, no redeeming qualities about it.-Character models look really weird-No character developementOn the bright side:-The game was able to introduce a supernatural element without coming across as hoaky-The art style and graphics quality are both beautiful in a very dark way. A powerful GPU is strongly recommended.-The game, like most other stealth titles actually requires some degree of skill.-Stealing things never gets old. My sum up:-mechanics 7.5/10-art style 9.5/10-graphics quality 9/10-story 6.7/10-character design 6.5/10-character develepement 4/10-guard AI 3/10 "

												Now that I have calmed down from my ""nostalgic"" rage, I have to admit: Thief (2014) is a decent game. I wouldn't go call it a master piece or very good, but it's fairly good and a nice experience on its own. If you start comparing it to the original versions or even Dishonored you are very likely to find a ton of things to nitpick and cry about. This was the mistake I did the first time, and although it was somewhat justified, it was in the end a bit unfair since I have to judge the game as ITSELF, not as a recreation of bygone glory days or as a rival to something else.With that said, I personally have enjoyed this new installment. There are, like mentioned, TONS of little and bigger things to complain about, namely the very restricted movement around the small sandbox environment you dwell in, and buggy A.I. (I just love the dialogue audio problem where the guards keep repeating the same things all the time... not). I also found the new way of peeking around the corners absolutely stupid (whatever happened to good ol' Q and E?), and the cinematic cutscenes look dámn weird at times - from cinematic view, that is. The story I couldn't care less about, and the chance to roam yourself from mission to mission in the city, although cool at first, is just tedious in the long run and I find myself getting lost half the time, thanks to the pretty useless map.

												I'll admit, when I first started playing Thief I felt like the game would require a lot of patience and eventually things would become mundane and boring. I decided to restart the game on MASTER difficulty and  I certainly made the right decision.The game really picks up after the first half and the enemies you face act realisticly and most environments are incredibly large and complete. There are almost always multiple ways to progress and the game allows for many different playstyles. The story is really what keeps me playing though. Each new situation is like a game of chess, you need to move this way as a guard moves that way. As I am about to complete my first playthrough I realize how much fun this game when it's challenging. I turned off most of my HUD (except lock-pick indicator and waypoint marker)  and I highly recommend it if you want the advertised feeling of true immersion. To conclude, this game can be great or bad depending on how YOU want to play it. Want to play on normal difficulty? Prepare for a mundane, short, less rewarding experience. Want to challenge yourself on Master and turn off a lot of the HUD? Then you'll have a dangerous environment filled with scares and strategies each time you open a door or turn a corner. This being said, I encourage those who enjoy a challenging, first-person singleplayer to check out Thief!!! 8.5/10			"

												I think of this game a lot like Portal.  ""But they're nothing alike"", you say, and you're completely and indisputably right.  But they share similarities and we'll start there.  Each main quest mission in this game is like a Portal chapter, at its core focusing on solving puzzles, avoiding environmental hazards, and using various devices, equipment, and well, stuff (portal gun, bow, gel, arrows, cubes, lockpicks).  But imagine Portal with the additional element of survival, more ways to play, extra objectives, better graphics, combat, more environments, and just overall more content.  That's what Thief is and that's why Thief is different from Portal - because it has all those things.There definitely was a lot of puzzle-solving in Thief.  Guards patrol the same scripted routes and the objectives remain the same regardless of which door you come in from to get there.  Perhaps some would prefer something more organic, but the way they've done it definitely impacts the gameplay, making it much more cinematic, dramatic, and rewarding.  It's the same feeling I got from completing a hard trial in a Portal game, and that's why Thief reminded me of it.  And it's not easy by any means to emulate that kind of feeling.So yes; Thief is, in a very important sense, kind of like Portal, but a lot better.  And Portal was a darn good game.  This game gets my recommendation.			"

												Dishonored is anoth...wait...this isn't Dishonored? Hmmm.Yes I realize this is part of an old series and not a Dishonored clone...in fact Dishonored is more of a Thief clone than anything else, but due to the fact that this is the first game in the series for probably a decade most people will shove out the Dishonored comparisons.I have to say I am a bit unhappy with the ""challenge"" aspect of each chapter of the game (given that's what games give you now...there's no more playing games for fun or entertainment, achievements and beating other people is far more important)...it can be interesting to have the challenges in the game but I don't really care for a rating system when I'm playing the campaign of the game, if I want to be insulted for a crappy performance I would specifically pick ""Challenge mode"".The game itself looks nice although it was made for previous gen consoles and received the ""upgrade"" for newer ones and the PC...the PC version feels more like a console port in regards to the graphics than a game that was tailored to each system (IE: Dragon Age Origins and other types of games that weren't just hastily ported to make money)...if it was upgraded properly for the PC I'm not seeing it (and yes, I have my settings turned all the way up).I do enjoy playing stealth games of this type despite not being all that great at the stealth aspect (patience is for losers).I'm now bored with reviewing this so my point is; buy the game if you enjoy stealth games. kthxbai			"

I went into it just expecting a good stealth game, but the story has suprised me and is quite captivating. the combat is a little lacking but you hardly ever use it unless you like every guard nearby to come mob and kill you. So dont get the wrong idea that this is an assassin stealth game, you are a thief not an assassin, it's a lot more fun to try and go through the level without a single gaurd ever seeing you and letting them all still patrol their little area. It feels like ""Ha i came in and stole everything you had and you have no evidence besides things missing that anyone was ever in the building mwahaha!""			"

												All around a great game.Definitely some annoying bugs, like conversion loops between guards that are the same (not even 2 varying ones, just the same ones over and over and over). Regardless, I was surprised at the low metacritic score, which I'm guessing is largely due to its attempt to stay within the Thief series.I'm a big fan of the original series and this one really failed in its story to keep on track with that... it's like they ignored much of the series' story. The female character in this one had the personality of a rebelious teenage girl - obviously something that gets pretty dang annoying.No real magical lure as existed as you got near the ends of Thief 1 and 2. Other annoyances, like the rope arrows not being able to attach to anything wooden, but instead only available at select locations (and there aren't that many really).Despite all that I still really enjoyed the game. You ""stole"" way more in this game, which makes since if you're a thief. The city was huge and full of secrets and places to explore.Whether you are a fan or not of the original series doesn't matter. It didn't ruin the series for me, but I'm sure hoping someone can follow this with another one that recovers it from that massive failure of this ones story... which I think is do-able, but no small task.

												If you're a fan of the original Thief games then you'll have fun with this reboot of the franchise. It adds enough new features on the original games to make it interesting, and its fun to have another adventure hiding in the shadows as a master thief once again.As a newcomer, this game wouldn't feel much more than an average. The story isn't that great and you don't end up really caring for any the characters. My biggest gripe was that the apparent open world city was too annoying to get from one side to another, which you had to do often. Nothing about the game is cutting edge in anyway and it might be best to leave this one unless you are a fan of the Thief franchise or you can pick this up for cheap.It was fun enough while it lasted, and I hope the next one's better.

												Good game, but there are a coupble of things I need to point out. The soundtrack for the game was bland, like it was put together in a couple of days. The music was extremely loud especially in the parts where concentration is a big thing. It's hard to sneak about when rock music is drowning out every other sound in the game. The storyline is kind of cliche plus the dialogue did not make it any better. The dialogue could have been better and I witness a few parts of the game where the voices did not match the character's mouths, but that could have been a delay on my part. Combat in this game is pretty much pointless. If you get caught, you NEED to run. If you fight back, you are just signing your death warrant. Even though the combat isn't all that good, I believe it just enforces the need to go stealth in a game such as this. You are a thief, of course.Being a some-what ""hardcore"" gamer for the Thief series, I enjoyed the game nevertheless. Although this game should have been an improvement, I consider the previous games superior.			"

												I thought this game would be good. I was wrong. It's fantastic.After acquiring the claw from Erin (Aaron?) traversing the world becomes almost infinitely easier - utilizing grates and hooks to get around and disappear in a flash. The sound design is fantastic, the graphics are beautiful, and the game itself is possibly one of the easiest to stick with that I've played in a long time. The story flows effortlessly and keeps your attention 100% of the time.I think my favourite part of the game is the extensive AI. Guards don't patrol a set path, they don't have specific orders from the game, they look everywhere and randomly -- and are even aware of hiding places that you might try to take advantage of. Don't rush through doors just because a moment ago nobody was there -- and don't expect him to stay asleep forever.Thief is easily one of the most exciting games I've ever played. It's rekindled my love for video games.Thanks, Steam.			"

												Though I was disapointed with the excessively linear nature of the game, as well as the constant points of no return, the fun factor of locating all the loot while dodging around packs of guards was sufficient to keep me playing. The control were smooth and reponsive, and the atmoshere was communicated fairly well. It managed to keep my attention well for the first 6 chapters. Unforuntately the last two levels were a chore. In all a decent buy for fans of stealth games.			"

												Thief really got beat up in the reviews, and that made me hesitant to buy the game. But I took a chance and bought it, and so far I have to say that it's amazing! I was afraid that it wouldn't feel like the Thief series, but that is exactly what it feels like, it feels like Thief: Deadly Shadows pumped up on steroids, amazing art (graphics), excellent precise controls, and the most important aspect is that it is just flat out fun! Big thumbs up, this is one instance in which I have to disagree with the reviews.			"

												Consolized version of a PC classic.  Thief takes away much of the freedom seen in the superior predecessors, and slaps on contextualized console gameplay mechanics to further limit the game.  Remember how you could climb almost anywhere?  Gone.  Remember how many different types of terrain would make a different amount of noise?  Pretty much gone.  Being able to interact with/pick up most objects you come across was also removed, and no longer can you use your rope arrows in many different places.Remember how detailed, unique, and interactive the world was in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which is from the same studio?  Thief doesn't even come close.  In addition, level design is much more linear and much less intelligent than that of the first two Thief games.This reboot also fails to capture the same mystical, creepy feeling present in the first two Thief games.  Instead, it has a very generic steampunk setting, rather than the distinct and eerie one seen in the classics.  They attempt to turn the franchise into a more story-driven one, but the cutscenes and dialogue are laughable and have signs of poor production value (with near-broken audio as well).  Mediocre sound effects and stupid, predictable AI don't help its case either.Fans of the original Thief games (the first two specifically) will be disappointed by this game.  Fans of Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Dishonored will also be disappointed by Thief's more linear, limited, and more casual gameplay.  They'll also be disappointed by its lack of detail and more generic setting.  Thief does nothing to stand out, it's just a reduction of the greatness seen in the first two games and it's worse in just about every way.  This is the result of console focus; it's dumbed down and just a fraction of the original, because a game as complex and challenging as Thief Gold for example would overwhelm most gamers.  Its gameplay is not quite as limited as, say, the Metal Gear Solid franchise, but that's not saying much.  Don't even bother getting this on a sale.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Sure! At full price? No way. I think I got it for $10 on here and that was good enough. The game has a great concept but it's lacking content. I feel you could probably complete this game in 2 hours if played right. Certain bonuses can make the game too easy. By the end of my game not only could I one hit kill but I could go right UP to the enemies and dance in front of them. They just thought ""Oh... sometihng might be in front of me."" It's a fun game I guess? The storyline seemed very incomplete.			"

												Side quests are where this game really shines - environments are small, but this is the only part where at least you have some sort of freedom of exploration. Main missions, on the other hand, are too linear for my taste and story is pretty forgettable. There's a lot fun to be had in Thief, mostly due to heavy emphasis on stealthy, non-confrontational approach to all adversity, but all too often you get the feeling that something's missing here, and it ain't all that sh!t you just nicked.Also, can't go wrong with those fabulous first person animations. I wish more games were able to give you this uncanny feeling of controlling an acual human being, instead of floating cameras with gun props attached on front.			"

												The bad reviews were mostly right. Just finished the game as a fan from Thief since the first game. Hated the stealth in AC4 (although is a great game) and hoped that this game would show how a stealth game should be.CONS: almost no freedom, poor AI, anoying bugs (specially the sound), and for me, VERY repetitive. Enemies have only 2 types, respawn of guards in the city, a lot of loading screens, and the lack of chars to interact. Lazy difficulty system (on/off hud itens).PROS: playing w/ Garret again is like meeting an old friend. Graphics and atmosphere are great. Some chapters are memorable and beautifuly designed. The first hours were really good to play. The optional focus system is a great idea for newbies.The AI is the more disappointing part. Scripted, dumb and lifeless. They should look real, go ask for help, surround, reinforce the protection (a more complex script at least). Instead, they act like an game from the 90's. Things shoud look really difficult to steal. Killing a guard should always be the last option.I was hoping an open stealth sand box, challenging AI and next gen graphics. Got only the last one. This game will be forgotten in some months, result of the poor experience, little replay factor and no innovation in the genre. Don't pay the full price if you're not a fan of the series.			"

This game is like meeting a guy/girl that seems nice on the outside but you then find out that they're really depressive and hard to understand. I ended up quiting half way becuase I just didn't like it. I do hate when people are comparing this game to dishonored becuase I have both and they are not alike at all!

												If you can overlook the bad optimized engine and sound problems it's a good stealth game overall. It's not for the fans of the franchise, they traded freedom of movement for context actions, you can't even jump on your own if you don't have a ledge to grab to. Also, this new Garrett doesn't even compare to the middle aged cynic the fans are used to. But as far as mechanics goes, it's a good stealth game, so I'm recommending it. But if you want a true feel of how the old Thief games played I recommend Dishonored or The Dark Mod.			"

												When it comes to the new Thief game, it's impossible to avoid comparing it to the now-classic predecessor Deadly Shadows. It also makes sense to rank it against the recent stealth/action hit Dishonored. In my opinion, Thief 2014 loses to both these games by a different margin. It's not nearly as deep and engaging as Deadly Shadows. At the same time it delivers the experience similar to Dishonored though I still find the latter to be the better game by design.However, comparisons aside, I still think we have a pretty solid game here. While it failed to deliver the constantly engaging experience, it still had enough moments to keep me going for almost 50 hours. Here are a few things to mention:- The game looks great. The graphics are impressive and the pre-rendered cutscenes do look really nice.- The level design is rather mediocre. There are a few cool moments in the game like the asylum (a neat tribute to Shalebridge Cradle) or the Northcrest Mansion escape. But some levels are definitely a failures with my biggest disappointment being the brothel level where in reality you have to spend 75% of the time exploring the dull catacombs. - The storyline is nothing but a glue to stick the missions together but it comes with a cast of rather believable characters.- The City itself is pretty interesting to explore and the client missions are definitely worth their time.- Finally, the overall game mechanics are subpar - the game is not really challenging on the regular Thief difficulty and most of the arsenal is barely used at all. A few trick will easily get you through all of the levels and there's no need to be inventive 99% of the time. Yes, there are tougher difficulty settings - but I expect every game to deliver the optimal experience on the regular difficulty.With all that said, I still can recommend Thief 2014 to the younger players who are new to the genre as well as the ones who have already enjoyed Dishonored. As for the veteran players of the series - there's a high chance of walking away disappointed.			"

												It's a grudging ""Yes I recommend this game"", but not as a Thief game. I didn't think the game was awesome (or even great), but at least it's playable. I suspected I wouldn't like this reboot so I deliberately played at the hardest level I could without perma death and made it as good a ""Old School"" Thief experience as I could. I wish they had created a new franchise for this, because this isn't really a Thief game. It's the same city, and the main character is called Garrett, but that's about it. I really didn't like the voice acting, Stephen Russell did a million times better job. But that's sort of OK, it's a different Garrett. The events of this Thief seem to take place some time after the original Thief games, but everything familiar is gone. No pagans, no Hammers (or Mechanists), no Keepers... nothing. On level 3 I briefly got excited when Keeper symbology showed up, then some pagan/trickster glyphs, but that was pretty much it. The old cathedral at the end of the game was a disappointment.The story was meh, but it kept me going. The ending was absolute utter beyond belief♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Graphically, it's pretty nice. Of course, it's light years ahead of it's predecessors, although of course those games are nigh on 20 years old. But I did enjoy the graphics.Audio was disappointing. There were times where conversations would go silent, and environmental effects like fires would stop – even when I was standing right next to a fire. Move a bit, and it would all come back.I play with sub titles enabled, and these were buggy as hell. Conversations would start that I couldn’t hear, and the subtitles would be printed on the screen. The silent conversations would then magically reset halfway through, and the subtitles would restart. On one occasion where I was poking around part of the city hub, the same conversation about Polly’s perfume/activities were played 7 times in a row, without fully completing the conversation.To complement this, some conversations would play twice audibly – there was a conversation about bear pits, and each time I heard this conversation, it would start, then as soon as the second sentence was spoken, it would restart and both would play at the same time.More ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Worse, conversations could be lost – on numerous occasions when playing a chapter level, a conversation would start as I was following people. As I was playing the hardest difficulty level, it meant instant fail if I was ever spotted. On reloading after a fail, the conversation would not start again, including the person not moving about as they had been originally. This happen half a dozen times that I was fully aware of, who knows how many times it happened when I didn’t notice.One final audio issue, I was poking around the edge of the city at one point and could hear massive fires, the sort of fires you’d expect if you were in a burning city. Later in the game that section of the city opens up – and it’s on fire. Even though the setting on fire bit doesn’t actually occur at the point I started hearing the flames. Overall, the audio was poor. Levels seemed well designed, I always had a few routes, and managed to finish the whole game without knocking out or killing anything. Hell, even Deus Ex made you kill the bosses even if you were playing stealth, this Thief on the other hand didn’t require you too – something I appreciated in a stealth game. So a bonus point or two for that.While the environments tried to be varied, the creatures which inhabit this city were another let down. You had guards and civilians. An invisible ghost. And some strange human like things. Again, think back to the older games - guards, ghosts, undead, mages, elementals, civilians, pages, hammerites, mechanists, bots, rat men, mantises, monkey men, do I have to go on? Sheesh.And don’t get me started on the “Lets turn Thief into Assassins Creed” with the utter wank action sequences. Fortunately they were few and far between, until they got to the end of the game then realized they’d wrote code which they weren’t using and so tossed in a few more. So many better things you could have done instead off that.I didn’t really like the city hub in Thief: Deadly Shadows, and I don’t really like the one in Thief – although admittedly it’s much larger and better with plenty to do. Although when you think of games like Grand Theft Auto, HUGE worlds which you can run around in without being stopped by loading screens, why they decided to make you load the next section every other street was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ In fact, while I’m complaining lets mention the pointless “Spam E to open windows” or “Spam E to move this amazing log that somehow manages to appear in every single ♥♥♥♥ing gap between a ‘S’ shaped crap”. Sigh.Can’t comment on the focus gimmick as I couldn’t use it due to the play settings, but my description of it as a gimmick should suffice to sum up my feelings on that score.Oh. And one last rant. HEY, GAME DESIGNERS. Since just after true 3D games were created, you've been able to jump whenever you wanted. In fact, I remember jumping on noisy surfaces in the old Thief games deliberately to draw attention to myself. So why the ♥♥♥♥ do you take away such freedoms in modern titles? Is it really so goddam hard to put in the basics like jumping.And something else - Thief 2 has a bank level. So does the new Thief. One of these is ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE with all sorts of fun♥♥♥♥♥♥ One is barely bigger than a shoebox. Guess which is which.I still replay the old Thief games every so often. I don't think I'll be replying this one.The Tomb Raider reboot returned to the origins of the story and retold it in a new way, and although I found fault with that game too, I enjoyed it greatly. This Thief root sets the old story on fire, pisses on its bones, buries it in♥♥♥♥♥♥and then dumps its own turgid story on top of that to make something unrecognizable. I really hope that this lacklustre game hasn’t killed the series for good. "

												This is a great game.  The graphics are terrific and the gameplay is very intriguing.  Now diehard Thief fans may not enjoy the changes from the older style Thief games, but for those folks who are willing to keep an open mind or who are new to the Thief genre, this game is a winner.  For one thing, there are multiple ways to approach almost any situation.  If you want to get through the game completely unseen, it is possible...not easy, but possible.  If you are the aggressive type and want to go through killing everyone in sight, well...ravage away.  It is a long enough game with a large world so you feel like you have definitely gotten your money's worth if you play all the side missions.  The storyline is interesting and the dialogue is very witty in many places.  It all depends on how you play the game and what your actions are.  This Thief is not as 'dark' as some of the earlier ones and differs in mood from say Thief Gold.  I didn't see this as a negative as some other reviewers did.  This game was a breath of fresh air after playing some of the earlier games.  This is not a criticism of the earlier games...just telling you that they shouldn't be compared directly.  This version of Thief is very good on it's own.  To believe it should be a direct descendant of the earlier games is to do all of the games a disservice.  Evaluate this Thief on its own and I believe you will agree.  There is a place for the old ones and the new both in the Thief world.  Enjoy...			"

												Yet another example of how ""video game reviews"" drag down a good game where many hours of blood and sweat went into. The tendency of reviewers to go mad as soon as a game does not reflect the reviewers expectation a 100%, is tiresome. This unprofessional babbling has nothing to do with reviewing objectively any longer. Every one can do it. It is mostly just the expression of a very biased opinion but disguised as a review. One article even rated Thief as alow as 40%....  come on, really? 40%??  This is a highly polished game, with a lot of atmosphere. Even the view of the scenes alone makes it worthwhile to play. How can one seriously rate it as low as a broken game (which 40% would imply - Yet the game is all but broken.)If you expect the freedom of previous Thief games, you will be disappointed. However, if you take the game for what it is, it is still a lot of fun. The tone it sets, and the mood it creates is very dark, distopian and gritty. Its first person movement immerse you well into the actions, and there are a ton of options to customize your difficulty. You can even switch off entire UI elements to immerse yourself even deeper.At times you struggle with the controls, but it is nothing game breaking and I got used to handle it as time passed. Thief's only big mistake is it's rather linear gameplay in the main missions, which is really the only downside of an otherwise great game.			"

												IGNORE all the reviews, do some research watch some game play videos and make your OWN mind up, all the reviews are bias for some reason or another, personaly I think this game is great its got smooth easy controls complete customisation of difficult and the decision you can make to do a mission with or without any violence or being seen.The load screens between houses etc. are just to try and bring back that old thief feel, which I feel didn't work as well.The veterans of Thief expected this to be exactly like the old thief's, which to be fair it is in some aspects but it is a completely modern game its got a new engine (obviously) to bring in new Thief players not just to satisfy the old/ original fans.I just also like to add this is not a clone of dishonoured or any game like that the original Thief was published in 1998.

												First of all. This game had a lot of pre-hate, because its different from the older games of Thief series. And I as a fan of older Thiefs, I can say this game IS the part of the series! This IS Garrett. This the new THIEF! After 30 hours playing this, its still a lot of fun. Dont mind a metascore ( 68/100 ). I give it 86/100.Positives-+ Atmosphere               + Soundtrack               + AI               + Level design               + Garrett- nice voice and cynicism               + Stealt mechanic Negatives- - Characters- they are writed good, but they dont have much space to introduce themsefls                 - Maps - they are big, but it could be better                 -Story- Its weaker, but still has lots of twists and its fun to watch it                - Price- 49,99 is quite much, but well... what can we do?

												""Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it...poorly""* Thief 1,2 = Coke* Thief 3 = Diet Coke* Thief (4) = New CokeFan reaction is same.Overall, I think it's a good game in its own right, just as I thought Dishonored was a good game. However, Dishonored wasn't called ""Thief"" with a pedigree to uphold. If this was released as a stand-alone game with a new universe and lead character (or even just a spin-off in the same universe with differe lead character) it would have had a much better reception.Reboot kerfuffle aside, this game reminds me a lot of Thief 3 ... in a bad way.* There's a City hub you spend most of your time retracing steps through* Level design is small and cramped* Missions are very short, even in the main quest* Your use of tools & abilities is often limited or contextual~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Unlike T3, The City Hub is the ""meat"" of the game, b/c you'll spend half your time exploring it or hoofing from point A to B in it. (Seriously, half my play time is just City Hub...*sigh*) It feels like a single ""go loot the city!"" Thief 1 / 2 fan mission (albeit a good one) with no over-reaching plot. Basso's ""fetch"" side missions increase the times you annoyingly retrace your steps in it. The addition of difficult-to-find ""trophy room"" loots eventually turns it from a fun ""let's see where I can go and what I can nab"" to a frustrating ""where are the last 3 items in the collection? I feel so stupid!"" Of major annoyance is how The City resets people. Knock a guard or citizen out, come back later, he's there again doing the same thing. It makes you feel like your actions have no impact due to lack of permanance. So, don't bother wasting arrows killing guards in The City. They just come back, and it's a waste of an arrow.* Ector and Vittori give side missions that involve going to separate maps, but they are small and short; probably 10-15 mins with a few guards and puzzles. They leave you unsatisfied and wanting for more. The main plot has the largest missions, but are still short, taking ~30 mins. Again, felt like T3 all over again. All of these leave you wanting for the days of Thief 1 / 2 where missions would take hours to accomplish on huge maps.* Folks complained about the spelunking in Thief 1 / 2 (eg: Horn of Quintus in T1), so T3 and T4 avoided it. You rummage through some old ruins in T4, but Garrett is no longer the Indiana Jones he used to be. Sad, because I loved those missions. Instead, you get ""asylum"" missions trying to creep you out. T3 had one (The Cradle), and it's like they rehashed it for T4. It's probably the best level, but it's been done before. The DLC provides a Bank Heist, but ""been there done that"" in T2.* The stink of X-box / PS port lingers as there's a crazy number of level transitions. They try to make them interactive (eg: opening a window, sliding through cramped boxes). What starts off as a novelty  turns into an annoyance. Why do I have to keep hitting the ""use"" key to finish doing this? Silly goose, that's so it feels like you're actually doing something instead of wasting your time on a transition. It  reminds you of how T4, like T3, was under tight build contraints, because it wasn't PC-exclusive. Hence the cramped, short levels and constant transitions.* Thieving is entertaining, but the constant petty larceny eventually turns into an insulting chore. You're a master thief, but you're lifting things that are worth pocket change.* Everything seems contextual. You can only jump & climb at designated spots. It helps to ensure you land properly every time, but it also reminds you of the lack of freedom you have. Likewise, I got stuck in a room looking for an item. I check a cheat guide... turns out I didn't try to climb the one specific bookcase in the room that allowed climbing while everything else did not. There's even an upturned table right next to the bookcase, but you can't climb that. I tried, hence I thought I couldn't go that way. But, I just didn't click on the correct object. Silly me. *rolls eyes** Same with your blackjack. You have to use the contextual ""take down"" button to knock folks out. You can't just whack them on the head with your melee attack button. * Same with the rope arrow. Did you honestly think you could just shoot it into any old wooden beam? No, silly. You can only shoot them at the specific beams that have specific rope-bound spots on them. That way you can't just go exploring whereever you please. silly goose.* Being ""leet"" and ""edgy"", there's now mandatory action sequences and parkour in some missions. This helps push urgency sometimes, but you're thrown into it abruptly and can die from a cheap kill if you don't react soon enough. It basically punishes patient gamers that play Garrett as a slow,  methodical thief by a) tossing them into situations they themselves wouldn't have let their Garrett get into, b) tossing them into twitch-gaming play-style situations they may not like playing. They also zoom out to 3rd person to show you doing some leet climbing parts. This just ruins the immersion of the game, making you feel like you're watching someone else perform the awesomeness instead of you doing it. Likewise, you can only do this awesome climbing on designated pipes and beams, not all of them. Why on earth should you be able to do it whenever you please? That's just silly talk, silly goose. (Again... lack of freedom).* When looting furniture, you have to open and check each drawer seperately. I know this lets folks pace themselves on it as guard patrols come by, but it just turns into a trudge. It would have been better to just have it automate the whole thing. Have Garrett quickly open and shuffle through all the drawers in like 10 seconds while the player looks on.* Lock picking ""mini game"" is still annoying. It was annoying in Thief 3, new version here is just as annoying. However, the ""mini game"" to search for hidden switches around books and pictures is really ingenious. It's actually immersive and intriguing. However, you get rewarded for Ghost-style playing, but there's no way to close some objects to make it really look like you weren't there. What kind of Ghost leaves a hidden floor compartment opened or a painting slid up with the safe exposed? Two steps forward, one step back?* ""Focus"" jedi skill and upgrades to equipment are a slap in the face catering to the ""everyone's a winner"" gamer. Your focus is basically a legitimate cheat that lets you no-brainer Batman detective your way through problems instead of exploring and thinking for yourself. I recommend playing the game the first time through with the ""can't use Focus"" handicap turned on in order to get a more Thief-like experience.* Like Dishonored, the difficulty modes are a joke, because the game is easy regardless (dumbed-down to the lowest common denominator). There's extra difficulty modifiers to disable aspects of the game, but some are a joke. ""Can only use utility arrows"". Really? I only used those as it was. ""Can't use Focus."" Really? Focus should be off by default. But, then they jump to Ironman modes or auto-fail missions if spotted. After a few cheap kills or guards spotting you while hidden you realize how abusive that can be.* Some missions have one-way doors/slides, and there's no warning. You're exploring, getting loot, oh, what's this button do? One-way door. But, I need to go back and explore that other area. Oh, silly goose. Just play the entire mission over again later, because you're stuck now. Once again, it gives you the feeling that you have no freedom.Overall, I like the game, I had fun, but it could have been more in it's own right.			"

I prefer the first one though.Anyway,I think this game worth 8 bucks(it's on sell now) and i recommend you to buy this game.			"

												Yet another example of how ""video game reviews"" drag down a good game where many hours of blood and sweat went into. The tendency of reviewers to go mad as soon as a game does not reflect the reviewers expectation a 100%, is tiresome. This unprofessional babbling has nothing to do with reviewing objectively any longer. Every one can do it. It is mostly just the expression of a very biased opinion but disguised as a review. One article even rated Thief as alow as 40%....  come on, really? 40%??  This is a highly polished game, with a lot of atmosphere. Even the view of the scenes alone makes it worthwhile to play. How can one seriously rate it as low as a broken game (which 40% would imply - Yet the game is all but broken.)If you expect the freedom of previous Thief games, you will be disappointed. However, if you take the game for what it is, it is still a lot of fun. The tone it sets, and the mood it creates is very dark, distopian and gritty. Its first person movement immerse you well into the actions, and there are a ton of options to customize your difficulty. You can even switch off entire UI elements to immerse yourself even deeper.At times you struggle with the controls, but it is nothing game breaking and I got used to handle it as time passed. Thief's only big mistake is it's rather linear gameplay in the main missions, which is really the only downside of an otherwise great game.			"

												If you can overlook the bad optimized engine and sound problems it's a good stealth game overall. It's not for the fans of the franchise, they traded freedom of movement for context actions, you can't even jump on your own if you don't have a ledge to grab to. Also, this new Garrett doesn't even compare to the middle aged cynic the fans are used to. But as far as mechanics goes, it's a good stealth game, so I'm recommending it. But if you want a true feel of how the old Thief games played I recommend Dishonored or The Dark Mod.			"

												When it comes to the new Thief game, it's impossible to avoid comparing it to the now-classic predecessor Deadly Shadows. It also makes sense to rank it against the recent stealth/action hit Dishonored. In my opinion, Thief 2014 loses to both these games by a different margin. It's not nearly as deep and engaging as Deadly Shadows. At the same time it delivers the experience similar to Dishonored though I still find the latter to be the better game by design.However, comparisons aside, I still think we have a pretty solid game here. While it failed to deliver the constantly engaging experience, it still had enough moments to keep me going for almost 50 hours. Here are a few things to mention:- The game looks great. The graphics are impressive and the pre-rendered cutscenes do look really nice.- The level design is rather mediocre. There are a few cool moments in the game like the asylum (a neat tribute to Shalebridge Cradle) or the Northcrest Mansion escape. But some levels are definitely a failures with my biggest disappointment being the brothel level where in reality you have to spend 75% of the time exploring the dull catacombs. - The storyline is nothing but a glue to stick the missions together but it comes with a cast of rather believable characters.- The City itself is pretty interesting to explore and the client missions are definitely worth their time.- Finally, the overall game mechanics are subpar - the game is not really challenging on the regular Thief difficulty and most of the arsenal is barely used at all. A few trick will easily get you through all of the levels and there's no need to be inventive 99% of the time. Yes, there are tougher difficulty settings - but I expect every game to deliver the optimal experience on the regular difficulty.With all that said, I still can recommend Thief 2014 to the younger players who are new to the genre as well as the ones who have already enjoyed Dishonored. As for the veteran players of the series - there's a high chance of walking away disappointed.			"

												This game is a mixed bag of quality; on the one hand, the main storyline is plagued by under-developed characters and an overall forgettable narrative (not to mention the presence of Erin, the most annoyingly pretentious character to ever grace a Thief game). In fact the only character that I personally remember from the main storyline is a corrupt Watch officer named the Thief-Taker General, mainly because he was just so much fun to watch in the cutscenes (everyone else is either mopey or bland). Furthermore, certain levels in the main storyline feel annoyingly streamlined and linear, which hurts the overall experience greatly (at least for this player). On the other hand, the gameplay itself is solid and the visuals are stunning. While certain levels do follow a specific path, others allow you to approach them in your own way. And some of them are even memorable, like the ""Dirty Secrets"" mission where Garrett infiltrates a brothel. I especially like how immersive Thief feels; the way Garrett interacts with the environment really feels natural, as if we're really seeing through his eyes. The game's setting, simply dubbed ""The City"", is a joy to explore -- especially with the new gadgets introduced in the game, which allow you to access places and trinkets that are otherwise unreachable. The atmosphere in The City is thick and gloomy, with sickness and doom as far as the eye can see. And for this reviewer, it was downright beautiful in its own twisted way.Furthermore, the ""custom difficulty"" options are superb and really let the player customize his or her gameplay experience as desired. This was a spectacular idea by Eidos-Montreal, and is something we could stand to see more of in future triple-A titles. However, the difficulty interface is also hindered by Eidos-Montreal's bizarre decision to prevent the player from changing the difficulty mid-game, instead forcing players to start a whole new save file to experience higher or lower difficulty.Overall, the matter of whether you'll like this game or not really depends on what you want from it; if you want a good story with interesting characters and a satisfying conclusion, don't bother. But if you want an immersive and atmospheric addition to your gaming library, or if you're just curious about Thief 2014 in general, I'd say give this one a go at least once (but it's not likely you'll care to go through the main storyline again). For a better overall experience, though, check out the original Thief trilogy -- all three games are dirt-cheap here on Steam, and this humble gamer recommends each and every one of them.			"

												Fun enough game i guess, is quite slow, didnt get story at beggining since i have never played the original thief games. Maps are cool although constant loading in main city sucks and maps dont allow much back tracking which sucks when there are bonus objectives e.g find all loot and you cant find all loot because you cant go back to areas to look for it also collectibles and notes there are way to many of them and they are kinda boring, game does offer more than just stealth you can go full combat if you wanted but you will probably run out of arrows to quickly and not have the gold to replace them so best to stick with your batton and stealth until you complete the game atleast. Graphics are good, sounds are good, sound in cutscenes on surround sound is horrible at barely works but in game its perfect. very short game maybe 10 hours to complete all chapters and side quests, possibly longer if you want all collectibles and achievements but if your just playing through for the gameplay 10 hours indeed. Sidequests are boring and take like 1-5 minutes each, there are 8 main chapters for the main storyline (take 20-40mins each) and about 26 side quests (1-5mins each). 6/10			"

												Thief is a good and entertaining game. If you like sneaky games, you'll find plenty to like here and its difficulty customization is great. The graphics, sound, etc are also good - not perfect, but they do their job fine. As far as ""Thief"" goes, though, it has little to nothing to do with its predecessors and if you are looking for a proper Thief game you will be disappointed. This is not a genre defining game. But as long as you are not expecting such a game, you will have fun.			"

												There are two problematic trends at play here:The first is to rush games out before they're ready; this is bad enough with respect to downloadable content, but with critical crashes and bugs, this is a betrayal to the consumer.  I have abandoned the attempt to finish this game after two times, as this game will erase your savegames the moment it inevitably crashes.  Do not trust the reports that the savegame bug is resolved; twice I lost my progress just before the last level and resolved the plotline on Youtube.The second is to take a beloved saga from a time of dedication and innovcation and continue it with today's negligent simplifications.  Thief began with a terrifying ideal:  what would you do if a run-of-the-mill guard could kill you and your only recourse was to evade detection?  What if you were less powerful than everything else in your world?  NOW save the world.  The fanbase, one of the Internet's first gaming fanbases, has disbanded.  You've one chance to bring them back.  Make another game, and make it Thief.  Oh--and please release it when it's ready.			"

												The Thief franchize has been a very unique one over the years. The whole purpose of the game was to steal, remain undetected and discover things that should've remain hidden.Now, 10 years after Deadly Shadows a reboot of the game has been made. It's not a sequel of any kind or does it share all of it's previous characterisitcs. The developers stated once: ""we made the game thinking about what Thief would be like in our times and not as a sequel to the previous games"".Leaving the fact that this is indeed not a sequel of the game aside, there are a couple of changes within the game that seem to cause hardcore fans to not like that much and casual players to be more attracted to it. First off, the story has been changed quite a bit; while it still keeps its mysteries and whatnot interesting conversations, the story is now full of action, enemies, allies and sometimes not as stealthy as one might want. Despite that it has stayed strong, while it might seem cliche at some points it still has it's Thief touch in it.Another aspect that has changed is the gameplay. It's now possible to complete missions in various ways, but don't get me wrong, anything un-stealthy might sound easier than it is. The mechanics of the game work properly and while thingls like opening drawers and closets while crouching might not be possible (as it will utomatically make you stand up), there is no reason to think the game fails at any of it's gamelay aspects. Focus is another great aspect of the game, some, such as myself, dont think of it as a necessary thing to use in-game but it certainly gives the game a new way of going about missions, in fact it's implementation in-game has been more than justified and it's not just a simple over the top ability you'll get out of nowhere.Finally there are some interesting aspects I have yet to talk about. The various maps/scenarios are a thing that caught my eye, they certainly are quite the thing and all in all I think the whole exploration and just taking your time to look arround your environment really pays off as you'll find yourself with more loot and a personally amazing level design. To follow that up is the audio, one of the strongest aspects of the previous Thief games and that might've not quite gotten there this time, with a couple of bugs and some reapeating conversations, however it still stays strong and manages to immerse you into the game. As a final note there is a bit of a Horror/spooky part to the game I, as a sassy, found pretty scary, to the point where I had to stop myself from playing many times, I think this part of the game was interesting enough and it surely adds a first in  experiences for me, and despite my struggles I think it was nice for the game to have this many sudden changes of pace.PS: I didnt mention Dishonored because I believe that's a different First Person Stealth game and wouldnt like to compare it to Thief despite them sharing a couple of characteristics.TL;DR:- Good solid story- Good gameplay mechanics and options (including customizable difficulty)- Amazing level design- Ok audio and sound effeectsLooking at the game from a objective point of view and forgetting about the rest of games I'd say it's a amazing game that easily stands up to other games with it's story and gameplay. As a Thief fan I can still recommend the game, because it's still as unique as it's predecessors and I for one think the reboot was a success.			"

												I almost feel guilty with how much I've enjoyed this entry to the Thief series. Folks have chewed the game up for not being very devout to the series and that it's another case of a cherished franchise getting screwed by corporate repackaging. While this game is far from perfect, I really don't think that's warranted at all. It's rare I have this much genuine fun with a game.First, I'll mention the bad. This game was optimized by a twelve year old. I had some stuttering on my system even on lower graphical settings, a number of crashes, and the occasional sound-glitch that cut half the game's sound. The dialog and story can be really corny (I mean, someone literally uses the line ""we're not so different, you and I"" without joking. Seriously?), and there's a huge detriment to the fact that you can't jump. Yes, that's right, you can't jump. You need to go to ledges to jump down or to jump onto something, but you can't leap whenever you want.So, with all that said, why do I like it? Well, I'm the kind of gamer who really, really likes stealth games, particularly in the case of FPS. I played a stick-to-the-shadows rogue in Skyrim, I snuck around throughout the Metro series, and I couldn't get enough of the earlier Thief titles. One of the most satisfying feelings I get is looting a room blind, slipping past guards just as they're about to catch me, and solving some tricky puzzles to get to a safe. This game is flooded with secrets, and between missions, you travel a huge city with a number of nooks and crannies waiting to be explored. There's also the stealth roll, which allows you to very smoothly leap from shadow to shadow, which is tremendously satisfying. One of the best aspects, though, is the environment. There's so much great atmosphere in this game, from a creepy abandoned asylum (with jump scares, be warned), to a burning bridge, to a lavish mansion. I got lost trying to look for so many secrets, and the rewards for finding them were pretty satisfying on their own. I even like the fact that Garrett is total crap in a fight. Makes it that much more terrifying when you're caught, because you can't defend yourself nearly as easy as other games.All in all, I'd definitely say buy this beauty, even if you're a diehard fan of the earlier titles. Once you get over some of the more glaring aspects, this is a real diamond in the rough.			"

												I have to give this title a 8/10. All in all it's a great game and proves to be very fun, especially with the sneaking aspect .So, here is my personal breakdown of the game.GRAPHICS- Absolutely freaking beautiful. Very gloomy setting to the game. With graphical settings on high, this game is most definitely eye candy. Only one issue with this and it just involves video quality and rendering at one of the cutscenes towards the end of the game. It appears to me that it is just the result of rushing the scene for whatever reason. It caught my eye and I'm betting I'm not alone. Otherwise flawless and fantastic experience.GAMEPLAY- Very responsive controls with a gamepad, no problems whatsoever. Engaging combat system which allows you to map inventory as you like, small upgrade system, just enough to keep you out of any customization menus for too long  and allows you to focus more on your creeping skills.STORYLINE- Interesting story that kept me grinding to see what was next( a good 20 hours even without secondary quests, no complaints here (although I cannot compare this with previous Thief titles as this is the first I've played). Regardless, i thought the game in itself did an extremely good job of morphing many story cutscenes directly into gaps of gameplay. UPDATES/SUPPORT- I know there was a save game problem due to a technical problem with time zones a little while back but the devs were quick to fix this problem and that is the mark of a good team. No problems I am aware of since that.OVERALL- To wrap it up, this game is definitely one to check out and not let slip through your fingers. I would recommend to everyone who loves: a good story, beautiful graphics, sneaking around, killing things, sneaking around, shooting arrows, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, burning♥♥♥♥♥♥ sneaking around, putting out candles, peeping through keyholes, picking locks, lifting loot while being sneaky, the dark, breaking bottles, and ummm...sneaking around ;)  Great Game, highly suggest checking it out.

Then be sure to turn off focus, waypoints and play on the hardest setting (Master) and this game is fantastic!Sure it's not perfect, and it's not the Thief game we have all been dreaming of, but it is a great game and a worth addition to the Thief series.

												Despite a lot of negative reviews, I gave this game a shot.  I think a lot of the problems people had with the game have to do with focus and their difficulty setting. I did a custom playthrough on master difficulty with focus, knockouts, kills, food, waypoints, and button prompts all turned off. I went through the game with the majority as a ghost and somewhat as an opportunist.  And while some problems still persisted, I think the game was really fun.Some of the missions in the game were not very fun, and linear. Mission 1, the end of 4, the end of 6, and part of 8 were not very fun, but the rest were pretty great.Pros:Extremely fun stealth and gameplay, lots of different routes to take the majority of the game, lots of difficult loot to get, great side missions, majority of missions are fun, guards see you pretty easily (good thing). great atmosphere.  The city (will discuss below)Cons:bugs in sound, guard pathfinding, and a few other things.  Awful soundtrack with dubstep when detected.  Pretty bad chase sequences and climbing sequences.  bad storyOther than the gameplay, the best thing in the game, in my opinion, is the city or hub area.  It's huge and open, and with plenty of secret areas to discover.  It has very good atmosphere, with a lot of side missions and mini missions to do.  It has this feeling of despair which really helps the atmosphere out.Overall I liked the game a lot more than other people did. The last few missions were very tough and fun, and mission 5 is pretty creepy.Given a score I'd say 7/10 good game (real 10 scale, not ign 9/10 it's garbage)			"

												  So I just beat Thief (not the Bank Heist dlc) and I have to say I love the game. Not sure what to make of the ending but if it means what I think it means then I don't like it (the ending that is). The ending aside there are a multitude of ways to complete objectives (you can go pure stealth-no knockouts/kills/being spotted, hybrid-knockouts and not being seen and/or Predator-killing and taking names) and to find loot. Just keep in mind that this isn't a fighting game so if you get 3+ enemies attacking you at once..you may not survive. You can replay missions over and over again building up money (or that perfect score) so you can afford the most useful/expensive items. New items from the merchant are released as you complete missions/chapters so don't bother hoping a good one will show up randomly.  At times killing/knocking enemies out is...broken. Some instances you can knock someone out and everyone nearby will hear it while other times they can be easily within ear shot and no one notices. You'll have to experiment (save a lot in this game so if/when you mess up you aren't screwed) to find a way that works for you. Some enemies are supposed to patrol certain areas but end up bugging and not moving which can mess up a perfect run (you'll have to log-out/back-in to fix this). If you do decide to kill with bow/arrows (your blackjack(melee weapon) is also an option) make sure you're accurate because certain ammo doesn't grow on trees if you know what I mean.  Although you don't need it to play/beat the game I suggest buying the players(strategy) guide because it will show you were 98% of the loot is (yes it still misses some here and there). It does show you were ALL of the ""collectibles"" are (I found all of them in one run during my playthrough).  If you really want a challenge you can turn off a lot of the help thats offered in the game and add more difficulty to the game. I won't bother listing all of the options just know theres a lot you can alter.  All in all I recommend this game to those who like stealth/stealing/puzzle-solving/action and a decent story. You will enjoy yourself.			"

												While I would reccomend this game, I only do so for the avid stealth game fans out there. For anyone else I'd reccomend something much less unforgiving. While it may look nice, the toughest part of Thief actually comes from the unified button for every acrobatic action you can do. The spacebar jumps, ducks, drops from ledges, dashes, and ultimately does way too much for a single key. Too many times I wanted to jump and fell to my death because the camera wasn't tilted upward enough. Additionally if you plan to not kill anyone and never get caught like I did then you'll be reloading your quick save quite a lot, making the game longer than I would have liked.Again if you're seriously into stealth games I'd reccomend it if only to get your fix, but otherwise I'd suggest you get something that's easier to play, or even just the prior Thief games.

												Just love this re invention of the classic Thief.  The prologue is a little slow but does an excellent job of aquainting players with the main game and developing the story.  Once the game starts proper, it is amazing.  So good to play a proper sneak em up again.  Refreshing to know that if you have to actually fight, you will die. None of the invincible hero stuff that fills most games.  Hide, run, sneak and hide again etc. Needs a reasonably high end pc, but its worth it.			"

												6/10I got this game at Media Markt for 4,00 EUR which was a great find. This game has a storyline very similar to Dishonored (sneaking, plague in the city) however, unlike Dishonored, the plot lacks in consistency and the game play is very linear. At one point I just got sick of opening and closing drawers and basically steal everything because it felt like it was the only point of the game.  The first part is very similar to Dishonored but then it's like the writers decided to change course halfway and instead of a plague infected city you have a thing called primal that got into a girl's body and made her create the gloom and blind faceless naked monster (wtf?). Then there was a scene at an asylum totally out of character for this game and that aspect could have been better explored because it was the most interesting part for me (phantoms, loonies, hidden cashes, and an overral good story). But then it was over and back we go to stealling all the things.  I also have to complain about the map, it's horrid, takes 20m to get to a place. Honestly there were parts I enjoyed like the client jobs but it was a bother to go an get them because of the stupid map. I could have given this game a higher rating if it wasn't for the ending - absurd as it was not to mention rushed as hell.Anyway, wasn't expecting more from a 4,00 EUR game. Good Buy,  "

												Thief's reboot came as a huge disappointment to me. Though the basic core mechanics are somehow functional, everything feels extremely artificial, constricted and predictable. The level design is both linear and uninspired, with obvious solutions to every single problem that's encountered. In addition to this, it is also highly inconsistent, and simple patterns are repeated way too often.The game isn't so much about observation and decision making anymore, it's more about dexterity and following the path that was carefully crafted for the player. Which is a real shame, considering that player movement is again very clumsy and restricted. I ended up getting spotted or falling to my death a few times only because Garett didn't perform the contextual action one would expect.Note that the linear structure is not necessarly a deal breaker for stealth games. Dishonored and Splinter Cell: Blacklist have the same level structure at their core, but individual action bubbles offer much more interesting challenges. Their AI is much more agressive, but the player is also granted additional options, meaning that playing as a ghost in those games require a fair amount of planning before jumping in the action. Thief doesn't have this anymore.Secondary game mechanics also feel very tedious. Lockpicking really only is a chore, and one you'll have to do pretty often moreover. Even stealing loot is painful because of the stupidly long animations which get triggered for every single action you perform. They're nice to watch the firt couple of times, but it just feels completely silly and boring when you pick up a bunch coins literally one at a time. Finally, the main city hub is also completely uninteresting. There's absolutely no challenge in exploring it, and I very quickly got bored of breaking into completely random windows (with once again a ridiculously long animation) only to slavage a couple of pointless items.After only 4 hours of gameplay, I'm already at the stage where I have absolutely no desire to get back to Thief, and think I will just stop there. I've only played the first 4 chapters (master difficulty), and so far there hasn't been one single moment where I felt that the game rewarded careful observation, planning or creative problem solving. It's only been about mindlessly crawling in the shadows, which should be one element of steal gameplay, but definitely not the whole thing. If you haven't played them yet, I would much rather recomment trying Dishonored, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, or the older Thief and Project: IGI games.			"

												Thief is fairly good and I enjoyed it. Not as good as the originals and has some designed choices I don't agree with (by virture of diverging from the original), but its very enjoyable. Worth the cost. Support it so we can get more Thief games and they can correct the oversights. (i.e.: no Jump button, no built-in ironsights on the bow, no sword or dagger WTF?, rope arrows very limited, original Garrett voice actor was awesome, world-lore from 1st three games is gone). This is a good game, but if you've never played Thief 1 & 2...maybe 3 (all on Steam!) then you should try those first.			"

This guard is on high alert, this one is asleep. This area is full of loot and baddies, this one is barren and boring. It just needed a more consistent feel.It was also difficult to stick to a particular playstyle, unlike the previous Thief games, whether that was being a Ghost, Opportunist, or Predator.Also needed more burricks.

												I don't know why this game has such low scores and so many people bad mouthing it.  I have been a fan of stealth games since the original Thief: The Dark Project and of all the stealth games out there, the Thief series and the Splinter Cell series has been my favorite.  This game is a pure thief game, bringing back great memories of cleptomania and the terror induced with nearly being caught.  I loved routng around in every cubby I could find trying to get the maximum amount of gold or trying to pickpocket everyone in a level.  And this game rewards you for doing just that.  If you want to sneak through every level without being seen, the more you do that, the more skills you get that help you do just that.  If you want to stealth assassinate everyone in the game like a ninja, you can and the more you do it, the more skills you get to help you do it.  Really, my only complaints are that it has a linear story and no open world, which in today's video game world, it should have been just the opposite.  Overall, a great entry to the Thief series and I foresee myself playing this one through several times, despite its linear story.			"

												I have to give this title a 8/10. All in all it's a great game and proves to be very fun, especially with the sneaking aspect .So, here is my personal breakdown of the game.GRAPHICS- Absolutely freaking beautiful. Very gloomy setting to the game. With graphical settings on high, this game is most definitely eye candy. Only one issue with this and it just involves video quality and rendering at one of the cutscenes towards the end of the game. It appears to me that it is just the result of rushing the scene for whatever reason. It caught my eye and I'm betting I'm not alone. Otherwise flawless and fantastic experience.GAMEPLAY- Very responsive controls with a gamepad, no problems whatsoever. Engaging combat system which allows you to map inventory as you like, small upgrade system, just enough to keep you out of any customization menus for too long  and allows you to focus more on your creeping skills.STORYLINE- Interesting story that kept me grinding to see what was next( a good 20 hours even without secondary quests, no complaints here (although I cannot compare this with previous Thief titles as this is the first I've played). Regardless, i thought the game in itself did an extremely good job of morphing many story cutscenes directly into gaps of gameplay. UPDATES/SUPPORT- I know there was a save game problem due to a technical problem with time zones a little while back but the devs were quick to fix this problem and that is the mark of a good team. No problems I am aware of since that.OVERALL- To wrap it up, this game is definitely one to check out and not let slip through your fingers. I would recommend to everyone who loves: a good story, beautiful graphics, sneaking around, killing things, sneaking around, shooting arrows, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, burning♥♥♥♥♥♥ sneaking around, putting out candles, peeping through keyholes, picking locks, lifting loot while being sneaky, the dark, breaking bottles, and ummm...sneaking around ;)  Great Game, highly suggest checking it out.

Throwing bottles at people is hilarious, but I have noticed a lot of glitches so far in my playthrough such as guards spinning around in circles, and the ocassional being spotted by a dead guard.Either way, it's a pretty mindless romp, and it's good to kill a few hours with. $32.99 may be a bit steep to get in on the game, so maybe wait for a price-drop.

												I almost feel guilty with how much I've enjoyed this entry to the Thief series. Folks have chewed the game up for not being very devout to the series and that it's another case of a cherished franchise getting screwed by corporate repackaging. While this game is far from perfect, I really don't think that's warranted at all. It's rare I have this much genuine fun with a game.First, I'll mention the bad. This game was optimized by a twelve year old. I had some stuttering on my system even on lower graphical settings, a number of crashes, and the occasional sound-glitch that cut half the game's sound. The dialog and story can be really corny (I mean, someone literally uses the line ""we're not so different, you and I"" without joking. Seriously?), and there's a huge detriment to the fact that you can't jump. Yes, that's right, you can't jump. You need to go to ledges to jump down or to jump onto something, but you can't leap whenever you want.So, with all that said, why do I like it? Well, I'm the kind of gamer who really, really likes stealth games, particularly in the case of FPS. I played a stick-to-the-shadows rogue in Skyrim, I snuck around throughout the Metro series, and I couldn't get enough of the earlier Thief titles. One of the most satisfying feelings I get is looting a room blind, slipping past guards just as they're about to catch me, and solving some tricky puzzles to get to a safe. This game is flooded with secrets, and between missions, you travel a huge city with a number of nooks and crannies waiting to be explored. There's also the stealth roll, which allows you to very smoothly leap from shadow to shadow, which is tremendously satisfying. One of the best aspects, though, is the environment. There's so much great atmosphere in this game, from a creepy abandoned asylum (with jump scares, be warned), to a burning bridge, to a lavish mansion. I got lost trying to look for so many secrets, and the rewards for finding them were pretty satisfying on their own. I even like the fact that Garrett is total crap in a fight. Makes it that much more terrifying when you're caught, because you can't defend yourself nearly as easy as other games.All in all, I'd definitely say buy this beauty, even if you're a diehard fan of the earlier titles. Once you get over some of the more glaring aspects, this is a real diamond in the rough.			"

												Despite a lot of negative reviews, I gave this game a shot.  I think a lot of the problems people had with the game have to do with focus and their difficulty setting. I did a custom playthrough on master difficulty with focus, knockouts, kills, food, waypoints, and button prompts all turned off. I went through the game with the majority as a ghost and somewhat as an opportunist.  And while some problems still persisted, I think the game was really fun.Some of the missions in the game were not very fun, and linear. Mission 1, the end of 4, the end of 6, and part of 8 were not very fun, but the rest were pretty great.Pros:Extremely fun stealth and gameplay, lots of different routes to take the majority of the game, lots of difficult loot to get, great side missions, majority of missions are fun, guards see you pretty easily (good thing). great atmosphere.  The city (will discuss below)Cons:bugs in sound, guard pathfinding, and a few other things.  Awful soundtrack with dubstep when detected.  Pretty bad chase sequences and climbing sequences.  bad storyOther than the gameplay, the best thing in the game, in my opinion, is the city or hub area.  It's huge and open, and with plenty of secret areas to discover.  It has very good atmosphere, with a lot of side missions and mini missions to do.  It has this feeling of despair which really helps the atmosphere out.Overall I liked the game a lot more than other people did. The last few missions were very tough and fun, and mission 5 is pretty creepy.Given a score I'd say 7/10 good game (real 10 scale, not ign 9/10 it's garbage)			"

While there are several aspects of this game that frustrate me, overall the missions are extremely well made, visually stunning, and the sounds/music create a very immersive atmosphere. I'm a huge Thief fan, I've played Thief and Thief 2 about a million times, not to mention tons of fan missions (some of which are almost better than the original missions), and this game doesn't disappoint me. Could it be better? Yes. Here are the cons:Less freedom: Frequently during the game you will get the sense that you are being too heavily directed especially in the city going to and from missions. Loading screens/busy work: The city area (where you buy supplies, go to and from missions, etc) is the worst part of the game. It's easy to get lost because it's too full of dead ends, and the ""gates"" to get to the next area aren't marked. There are windows you pry open, most just lead to homes, some are the ""gates"" that take you into a new region of the city. Unfortunately the map doesn't tell you which is which so finding your way around can take a while and be annoying. Hand animations: This one doesn't bother me that much but I still wish it wasn't there. Whenever you grab loot or open a drawer/door there is a short animation of your hands grabbing/opening. Some people may not notice, I just think the game would flow better without the animations. Those are my biggest gripes, but the pros far outweigh them. The pros:The freaking missions: The missions (especially starting at chapter 5) are extremely well made and fun to play. Chapter 5 was very well done and managed to freak me out several times. The music and sounds are excellent, and missions are large, beautiful, and difficult just like Thief should be. Upgrades/Swoop: The upgrade system fits great with this type of game, and the new swoop move where you quickly and silently...well...swoop adds a great dynamic to your stealth movement. Overall this is a really fun game and a great addition to the Thief franchise (I like it a lot better than Deadly Shadows), and while the city area can be a headache, the actual missions more than make up for it.

												I highly recommend this game for any gamer who is into excellent, top notch, stealth games. Where many people state that Thief doesnt provides ways through to an objectives as advertized and that it is only a point A to point B game; yes, thats what it is however, there are MULTIPLE ways to get through to something and it is how you get from point A to point B that matters. You are armed with a bow, and the environment around you, you have the ability to buy upgrades for your gear and obtain Focus points (Perk points to enhance your skills and make the game slightly easier) So it is a stealth game with limits, but you can still play how you see fit.I will note to anyone wanting to buy this game though, the setting is very similar to that of Dishonored in terms of, there is a plauge ravaging the city but where in Dishonored that was the primary reason for doing things. In Thief a plauge is there as a reason to why there are limitations in the city, it holds little to no focus. The story (plot) is about people fighting for power, how it affects the lower classes, and that greed for power is ultimatley what plauges the city. So for story wise, I also reccomend it, if you keep in mind the irony that you are a Thief and what everyone else does around you. Also, it is a FIRST PERSON game, but one of the best I have played.If you liked Dishonored, you will like Thief, if you enjoyed the original Thief games, you will greatly enjoy this. Take my advice,  in purchasing this game though; wait until it goes on sale. Square Enix will undoubtedly create more DLC so save money where you can!Also note, this is a Reboot, people complain that it is not like the original Thief, and it isn't. But don't let that knock you out of giving this Reboot of a series a good shot. This game was released in a different generation and is very good for what it is. Do not let the metacritic scores trick you into not buying this game.			"

												This game is good and bad.  The world created is impeccable.  The gameplay is likewise well crafted and fun, particularly if you turn off all the visual aids and assists.  The original was ground-breaking where stealth gameplay was concerned, this game honors its roots for the most part, while gently bringing the genre forward.  After Splinter Cell and Dishonored took what Thief began and honed it, rebooting Thief required some tweaking.  This is one of the areas the game suceeds in; most the missions and sidequests are fun to play with a fair amount of choice and diversity.  The world is not entirely open, but open enough to allow exploration without moving too far away from the story.  Story, unfortunately is where the game falls on its face.  It is clumsy, leaves numerous loose ends and often pulls you out of the action to rush you through a thrown together cinematic.  Voice acting is mediocre and audio bugs repeat the same line constantly or layer them over other lines.  The City layout can be very confusing, which does not sooth the frustration of the repetitive running back and forth the game puts you through.  The game contains profanity that seems awkwardly out of place for the time period it tries to mimic and falls into the same childish trend of ""there must be boobs!  And sex!!"" that seems to be gripping so many Developers anymore.  Personally I thought Disnonored handled its ""seedy grit"" more professionally.  Maybe I'm just tried of cheap thrills replacing creative content.  Don't get me wrong, as a whole the game is enjoyable with several shining moments.  It's no Human Revolution, but it's entertaining enough for a playthrough or two.  A filler until the next Deus Ex comes out.			"

												Solid game - the sneak-and-steal mechanics work, and don't need a great backstory. If sneaking though shadows, finding routes through dark corners of large buildings, and breaking into vaults makes you all giddy, this is the game to play. The story and overall execution are kind of meh, but nothing game breaking. For example, there's coins lying around in the streets where everyone is poor, sick and miserable. I felt nothing for Garrett's sidekick.			"

												Very pretty to look at, but something went off track when the devs created the gameplay.  You are doing the same easy things over and over again with rewards mostly meaningless, RPG elements are very undercooked to the point of being pointless.  Worst of all, the ""open city"" requires hard loading so you cannot explore the city without looking at load screens.  Graphically the fog and particle effects are very artfully done.  Whoever did that stuff should get a raise. Dishonored just walks all over this game unfortunately.			"

												The basic gameplay and mechanics of Thief are solid, but it's the level design that gets it. After playing the original Thiefs, all the main missions of this (compared to the originals) are really, super linear. Open door. Steal stuff. Get past guards. Open door. Repeat. There's no space to do the mission like you want to, outside of the aformentioned rooms. Except when there's instant-fail states.			"

												This game was fun for about the first 1-3 hours but after the initial few lvls, and eventually the scary♥♥♥♥♥ asylumn mission, the whole game is exactly the same. I feel as though i wasted my time going through the missions trying to get the unseen bonus only finding that speneding half an hour sneaking around only gets you 1 achivement. I would say this game is certainly not worth full price and would only recremend it if it is under £10 in a sale.			"

												From the steampunk/Victorian plague-ridden city setting to the first person stealth and even the use of Unreal 3, this and Dishonored are quite similar. However, here you really feel like your character has some weight and presense, and there are customization options out the wazoo to tailor the experience to how you want to play. Also Garret in leather armor = all the fetishes			"

												A solid reboot/sequel. It took me a while to figure out that you're not the same Garrett as in the previous games. It all apparently takes place years later. Good gameplay, story, etc. An excellent stealth game if that's what you're into. Not a lot of fun for those who enjoy non-stop action.			"

												Well, I just finished the game now and I can confidently give it a solid rating of MEH/10.I didn't dislike it, and I still think it's better than Thief 3 by a long shot, but this modern update is to Thief what the Bioshock games are to System Shock.I think this game felt a lot closer to the originals. Yeah, it's missing direct references to the Hammerites, and the Trickster is mentioned once or twice. Yeah, it's a new voice actor, and yeah, there's a bunch of crap added to make the game easier. But taking into account that they have to make a sellable product, AND the fact that most of the hand holding can be turned off (most, but sadly not all), and I'm willing to be a lot more forgiving than I was towards Thief 3.Touching on the new voice acting and stylistic elements, Thief needed to be rebooted. There's no way they could have continued from 3 narratively, and a prequel would've been crap. On top of this, the game is coming out so long after the originals it would be very difficult to access a new market. So yeah, it had to go the way of the reboot. I would've preferred it if they'd kept closer to the original setting but they didn't and I think the game suffered for not doing so in the eyes of original Thief fans like myself. As far as the voice acting goes, I think the new guy did a good job trying to read like the old Garrett, but it didn't help that the lines he was reading were so dull.Story-wise, I think this is where the game REALLY drops the ball. You CANNOT tell a player they care about a character, then expect them to get emotionally attached from the start of the story. You DEFINITELY can't do this if the character the player is supposed to care about represents the exact opposite of the character you want to play in the game. I kept hoping the story was going to escalate to something bigger than Erin and, even though the city was at risk, I was disappointed that this was the motivation for Garrett throughout. When Erin fell in the prologue I rubbed my hands in anticiapation of the real story starting. Instead, it went no where fast and finished with one of the bigger WTF endings I've ever played. SO disappointing.Graphically, the game was incredible. I have no qualms with anything they did visually, except for the overblown effects used for gameplay purposes (peek through the tiny hole in the wall here! for example). The visuals were let down by the bland, somewhat imagination free designs of the environments though. Myabe I just didn't find them all, but I was hoping for secret passages, interesting ways into buildings, etc. Very little of that to be seen. Then, of course, there's the critical error of making points of no return for no good reason. Just for the hell of it, you've gone through this gate and you can't go back now. Why?! Is this some kind of forced replayability trick? Because it's just intensely frustrating.I almost switched the game off during the prologue when I saw ""rope arrow points."" Sadly, this was a reflection of most of the gameplay; trying to match the original, but falling short for who knows what reason. This just leads back into the unimaginative design of the levels again as the whole thing seems to have been made to tell this story rather than allowing players to make their own. This is nowhere near as bad of a problem as with other modern games forcing their story on you, but it still feels like a string of linear arenas within which I have a small selection of methods I can use to get by. I kind of liked the swoop mechanic, and the way I felt like I was IN the environment, but these were both kind of ruined by the way the NPCs DIDN'T seem to be in the environment. Being detected seemed utterly random sometimes, as were their reactions to things that happened around them.As a jumping point for future Thief games, I'd definitely say this is a good start, but there's a list of Dos and Don'ts that come with that.Do:Build levels as real working environments, then give the player an objective and a set of skills and let them go wild in it. - These games should be about exploration, not forced routes and limited paths. Sometimes this'll allow the players to break the game (stacking crates to get onto parts of levels I wasn't supposed to in the original games, for example) but that's all part of the playing experience and doesn't take away anywhere near as much as boxing a player in with invisible walls and limited choices.ADD PROPER ROPE ARROWS - Seriously, there's no excuse for this.Embrace the diversity of the original source material and write smarter, not artier. - What the hell happened at the end of the game?! I have no idea, and to be honest I don't really care. You forced a relationship on me that I had no interest in and now the game is over I don't care enough to replay any of it. For an example of good plat twists, see Thief 2 when you go to pay the Sherrif a visit.Let me jump where and when I want to. - Because when I have to go through a convoluted Rube Goldberg style method to reach a platform I could blatantly leap to, your game looks dumb. In fact I'll expand on this and suggest your artists and level designers communicate more because when there's a chunk of wall with enough handholds in it to practically walk up the wall, but I can't because there isn't a ""climbing grill"" there, it looks dumb.Don't:Add pointless third person sections for no good damn reason. - Or at all for that matter. It ripped me so far out of the game I physically recoiled. Suddenly, instead of swooping and lurking in shadows, I'm prancing around on the pipe using a grappling hook to jump to grills and... WAIT A MOMENT, a freaking grappling hook?! The claw has a damn rope on it? Then why the hell can't I use this in about 99% of the rest of the game?! There's so many ways that would be useful! Seriously, it's like the Deus Ex: HR boss battles; a completely alien, different game that had no place being there at all.Points of no return. - Ever. Seriously, there's barely ever a good enough reason for this. Ever.There's no need for a city between levels. - This just bloats the game with running back and forth through the same damn environments for no good reason. If the time spent making the city had been spent on the levels, the game could've been far more focused and probably more enjoyable. On top of this, running through a city apparently populated by a dozen guards and half as many random drunks/beggars/civillians inexplicably walking up and down the same street is WEIRD. Maybe the rest of the cities population are all sleeping through this eternal night? NOPE. Having broken into a vast number of buildings and homes, the player will realise that the gloom has been far more devestating than previously imagined and anyone with enough money to live off the streets has already perished! Apparently being homeless, or a thug for hire, is a cure for the debilitating disease!This game could've been great, but instead it just leaves a bitter taste. Again, I'm not saying I diliked it. Despite everything I've said, there was still some entertainment to be had, but it was shallow and mostly a let down. It was like scoring a date with the hottest girl in town, just to spend the whole night listening to her talking about her recent trip to the toilet. Lovely to look at and spend time with, but not what you expected or hoped for and kind of unpleasant to sit through for too long.I'm glad this game was made, and I hope there are more like it, because even though it was far from the Thief game I wanted to play it's even further from the mindless rail-shooters/multiplayer shoot-fests that seem to be driving the games industry today. At least there are studios out there who are TRYING to make games more interesting. Yeah, they missed the mark, maybe they even missed the target, but at least they were aiming for it.			"

												Really good game if you have the patience, Thief is a game you can't take is you want to rush things. Here you play as a thief (see the name), you're not an assassin, you're not a ninja neither a warrior. You play as a thief, it means you have to steal things and stay in the shadows if you want to live, fighting nearly always means dying.If you can take that, this is for you.Thief is a sequel to an excellent serie which was thought to be dead. A lot of fans will tell you it's not the same, that all the atmosphere is gone. Well it's only half true. Thief HAD to get rid of some gameplay elements to become more manageable but still, it does not betray the spirit of its predecessors. When you look at the story, it's true that some things should have been preserved, there were lots of elements linked to the cults taking place in this universe and most of them were cut in the end which is quite sad.You might be discouraged by the repetitive loading screen when you visit the HUB but it is quite rare during most of the game since you're almost always on a mission.In the end, I would say that Thief is a good game, it's not excellent but still you might be surprised and like it. It is now quite affordable if you are concerned about the price so if you want to try a new experience or you simply are a fan of infiltration: do not hesitate, it is worth it.			"

												So i never this original franchise before this is my first time to play ""Thief"" and This is my reviewFirst Thing is i'm very happy to this game. This game is a fully stealth games not action stealth like Metal Gear or Splinter cell. In this game just one thing is you need to keep it quiet on every mission to be a master thief.And what is a good thing in this game ? or Why you need to play this game. this is so easy to tell youPositive- Smooth movement- more than one way to reach your objective- a lot of secret teasure- Upgrade your gear- Open gameplay full of side quest and some main quest- Really good stealth systemLooks really nice ? Hmm ? So let's see why you need to skip this gameNegetive- Poor AI- So very boring when you play too long - you always need keep to find some additional item in mission for gold...- Poor StoryOkay so finally Thief is a one of  damn good game but not at all. Maybe you like this game but maybe are not. Becuase this game is not look more gorgeous but not poorly too. it's just boring when you play so farMy Score is: 7/10			"

												I never played the original Thief games on PC. My first Thief game was the excellent (well I thought so!) Deadly Shadows on the original Xbox, which I mostly played in third-person.This reboot is first-person only but I really enjoyed it despite the mixed reviews it got. It has a good setting, sadly broken up into areas separated by loading screens, and each of the missions have different routes through them and they can be tackled in different ways so it doesn't feel linear. Graphically the game is terrific, making good use of the aging Unreal Engine 3, and the overall story is good. Voice-acting and dialogue is fine but music is sparse.Unfortunately for this version of Thief, Dishonored came out first and was overall the better and more interesting game (particularly in terms of abilities) but this is still an entertaining stealth romp if lurking around in shadows is your thing.

												While I did not play any other thief game before this I find Thief 4 very interesting and fun. The stealth mechanic is nothing special but still a lot of fun when you mange to get away with something just before an enemy spots you. Combat is close to non existant in this game and im not so sure thats a bad thing, the game is based around stealth. If people want combat they should play Dishonored instead.The city even if not huge like in somegames, it provides a fun way to get around and jump from mission to mission while offering a few side quests and interesting places to loot along the way.I was amazed at the amount of detail put in the light effects but the textures could be better.Overall this game is awesome and if you have a spare 50$ you should try it.8.5/10 on gameplay7/10 on story7/10 on graphics10/10 for originality and fetures8/10 overall			"

												In short… Based on the amazing originals this game is disappointing. The game feels simply rushed, it would have been so much better had it been polished and re-worked. However, I bought it on sale and found it worth the money in the long run; it wasn’t as terrible as some would suggest, just not great. You do occasionally get a glimpse or feeling reminiscent of the originals but never quite hits the spot.The graphics look good but still way too much copying of models, once you’ve seen one cabinet, chest etc. you’ve seen them all. The story is not that interesting and just confusingly unimportant. Annoying repeat animations for certain actions that are just not needed and waste time. Items for collection don’t tell a story or have any importance. The game just really feels rushed and disappointing that they couldn’t capture any of the original magic from the series. Saying that it runs well, didn’t crash and gives value for money in length. "

												Im not an oldschool gamer, so i havent beat the other thief games (but i own them). I really want to play this game, but there is a level in this that i am about 20 seconds into the main building and i already quit the game. Keep in mind for those of you that hate horror, level 5 is about an asylum with gollum like creatures that has been abandon and overrun basicly. If you do not like horror, i would not sugjest this game (unless you can do horror for like an hour). The mojority of the game isnt scary, so its really just a mission of horror, but that stopped me. The game is fun, and i bought it because i owned the other 3 thief games, exept they seem to give very little instruction and expert you to do this thing. I got a couple of missions in on the last one but still couldnt figure anything out. This gamme (as i had hoped), is alot simpler. There is a map marker and a dot on your screen above the objective, but it is not like it is handing it to you. I often spend alot of time trying to get to it because there are buildings in the way. So, even though this review isnt very long, i must say it is a good game, even though i havent beat it. Remember, if you do not like horror games, i would think about if you want this or not because then you dont play the whole game, but still, it is an amazing game.			"

It's a fun stealth game that lets you explore and gives you alternative routes to every objective, that influencing the end of the mission, whichis pretty cool i my opinion. Anyone interested in parkour games, stealth games and and games placed in the era of the nobles should give this game a shot.			"

												I could write MANY words about this... but I really cannot be bothered anymore.It's not awful, if I pretend to be a bit objective. In fact some bits are pretty good.But I hate this. I really, REALLY hate this game  with a passion. If you enjoyed the last three games, and Dishonored, stay away from this. It's not the remake I wanted and at times it feels like it isn't even the remake parts of the team wanted. It is fragmented, unfocused, horrendously written and shamelessly derivative.Avoid.Pretend it never happened, like Prince of Persia 3D.			"

												Thief is an intresting game. The stealth element of Thief is absolutley superb. You sneak from shadow to shadow using a dash like power called (swoop) picking up anything and everything you see that's worth a value. However the game's klunky mechanics make this difficult. Sometimes the game will stop you from going certain places...but you'll never know why. And don't even get me started on the city map...holy hell. 5/10			"

												Considering the fact that I suck at stealth games, you should probably take what I say below with a grain of salt.Pros: Visuals and gameplay. When playing the game, I found myself really enjoying the movements and the design of almost everything. The graphics are beautiful (and I have never been so fascinated by the hand movements of a character in my entire life until I played this game....). As for the gameplay: again, it's a stealth game so confrontation with enemies are not recommended or encouraged and, while the option is available, the tools and abilites you're provided within the game support this. One of the better reviews for this game points out the limited range of weapons/tools you're given to use, and makes a good point that that makes it difficult to kill someone when you're discovered via beating them to death with a blackjack (I honestly laughed out loud when I read that section of the review). And adding to that (or would this be pointing against?), you have to remember that you're a thief not an assassin, the limited range of weapons you have support stealth and distraction. Plus you have a number of actions to do when caught: attempt to run and hide (with varying results) or beat the crap out of the guard with the risk of catching the attention of others (if there are any). Also, the only way you'd possibly kill someone in this game is if you've missed the takedown option while you were beating them within an inch of their life, you're shooting arrows at them, or setting nearby things on fire (I don't know if piling their unconscious bodies on top of each other count, but the loud cracking sounds they make when you do makes me wonder...)Cons: Storyline and characters development and narration are okay. Could it be better? Probably (but you probably know something's wrong when you're more heartbroken about Jenivere the bird than that one girl you're trying to save). While traveling the city, you're still liable to be lost and confused even while using the map, because it's that useless unless you're tracking an objective or you remember the general places of things (but then that's what online guides are for I guess). Also: disembodied voices (but I guess you've already heard of that one haven't you?)I don't know if that's all I have to say about the game (I feel like if I try to think of anymore right now I'm probably nitpicking).But all in all, I think this is a game that's worth playing if you enjoy stealth games, and is the type of game you can play again and again, if not for the storyline and characters then definitely for the gameplay and visuals.

												Reading all the negative reviews, apparently this game isn't for everyone. However, based on the aesthetic aspects of the game (the atmosphere, detailed graphics, and artistic loading screens), and the fact that the stealth mechanics were pretty much just what I look for in a game, I would give this an 8.5/10 stars.Pros:-Smooth gameplay with few exceptions-Beautiful atmosphere with a soundtrack that matches -Great stealth mechanics; cannot rely on combat-Very well done suspense in the asylum level-Decent storylineCons:-I don't mind the loading screens (they go by fast on my system), but I guess other players do-AI could be more challenging (played Master difficulty, and though it was a bit challenging, I expected it to be harder.) The game does allow customized difficulty, though.-Stupid ropesOther:-Definite deviations from the Thief canon, though this game obviously takes place in a later era. History has repeated itself and a new Garrett (perhaps a descendant of the original), with many similar abilities and allies, takes the center stage. It makes perfect sense as you play the game (there are hints and references everywhere), and it helped me, as a fan of the original games, deal with the many changes to the Thief lore that took place in this new game.-People compare this to Dishonored, which I've also played and love. I say it's like comparing apples to oranges.-Remove 1/2 star if you don't like your games to end with a little ambiguity.			"

												Thief has issues. It has REALLLY big issues, and it doesn't hold a candle to it's predecessors. Yet, It's still very much a stealth game with a interesting art style that I was still compelled to finish. Thief may be ""Blasphemous"" to fans of the series but at least it works? That's more than I can say for most triple A releases these days.			"

												A good game that is saldly overlook. Just like the orignal game. In that sense is very similar, the FPS view, the clasic weapons, the atmosphere of the game, is very unique and true to the franchise. If you get the game thinking that it would be like Dishonored, you are not goning to like it. Remember that the two are way different.  If you like stealth games, this is for you, pick it up during a sale. Is fun to play, and that is what games are supposed to be, fun.			"

												6/10I got this game at Media Markt for 4,00 EUR which was a great find. This game has a storyline very similar to Dishonored (sneaking, plague in the city) however, unlike Dishonored, the plot lacks in consistency and the game play is very linear. At one point I just got sick of opening and closing drawers and basically steal everything because it felt like it was the only point of the game.  The first part is very similar to Dishonored but then it's like the writers decided to change course halfway and instead of a plague infected city you have a thing called primal that got into a girl's body and made her create the gloom and blind faceless naked monster (wtf?). Then there was a scene at an asylum totally out of character for this game and that aspect could have been better explored because it was the most interesting part for me (phantoms, loonies, hidden cashes, and an overral good story). But then it was over and back we go to stealling all the things.  I also have to complain about the map, it's horrid, takes 20m to get to a place. Honestly there were parts I enjoyed like the client jobs but it was a bother to go an get them because of the stupid map. I could have given this game a higher rating if it wasn't for the ending - absurd as it was not to mention rushed as hell.Anyway, wasn't expecting more from a 4,00 EUR game. Good Buy,  "

												Not a bad game. Not as good as it could be. The primary character can't do simple things (like jump) except in certain occasions, which means they had to put ramps in areas to allow access.  Seriously, what kinda crap is that? Can't even hop up in the air to look at something? Console-like key functions get boring and frustrating (to open windows, hold a key, then hit it over and over until the window opens), wasting 10 seconds on some windows, while others open after the initial space bar. Plus, why keep locking drawers Ive already unlocked if there's nothing in them the 2nd time around?  Can't skip some of the long mandatory ""watch this to see how great the story is""  scenes, like the elevator ride up. Can't skip the ""look how scary we can (not) be"" scenes. Watching them during the first playthrough was barely tolerable. I didnt buy the game expecting Oscar-winning actors, and after the first, somewhat disappointing, disjointed ending, IDGAF about the ""story line"". Fine, have mandatory crapscenes the first play-through, then allow them to be skipped. Also, if I wanted to play a 2-D side shooter where I'm locked in to one course of action, I WOULDNT, because I don't. Running through collapsing buildings trying to get loot before I burn to death, dying , then trying again and again until I make it through by trial and error. Not enjoyable, no benefit to the game, I'd say someone's girlfriend or boyfriend wanted to show off his/her arcade style design skills. Also didn't enjoy wandering around trying to figure out how to get where I needed to go . Surely it wouldn't have been too hard to have a map with freaking location names on it. I'd bet that was left out so that the total  time spent searching for a way to get to a portion of the city could be counted as play time, when it's  not really. The end of-mission rewards for goals didn't make sense. Ok fine, let's have a goal like don't be detected, and then have one for 10 combat takedowns, which pretty much means one of them isn't achievable. At least if I DO 3 or 4  of the goals, why are only 2 of them shown at the end? Are the goals based on play style?  Also, have one AUTOSAVE slot of you must, but if I hit quick load, allow it to load MY last save,. On the topic of saving, what moron came up with the idea that we can't save if anyone is looking for us? Sneaking through an area for 10 minutes, get spotted by one guard and we can't save while anyone is alerted even if we're hiding and there's no way they can reach us? That's a CROCK!. Next, the restrictions on passing through the transitions where we need to move a board. Dash to an exit , get spotted by a guard, try to move through the exit and get told,no , you have to stay, wait for the guard to come up and fight him. Again, BS. On the topic of fighting, yeah, I get it, we're not supposed to fight. I guess the same moron designed the fight limitations. Hit someone with a sword, try to hit them again, nope! can't do it, gotta pause until they hit you back. Can't block, and dodging wont work if youre in a narrow area. Same thing with trying to blackjack someone to initiate a combat takedown. Sitting for 5 seconds mashing the blackjack key while the screen is prompting me to do a regular takedown, then the guard turns around and I get nailed by 3 other guards when he yells because I couldnt initiate a combat takedown. Just crappy crappy coding. Now that I've listed (most) of the irritating and pointless parts of this game that had the potential to be great, but missed, here are the good parts.  Not many FPS games are worth a crap anymore. This one wasnt great, suffered from an attempt to make it more than it was, but it was fun when I wasn't trying to figure out how to get to a certain portion of the city if I didn't want to go on a prescribed mission. I did like being able to see what the goals were for each mission, but I and many others figured out how to by accident. I like the ability to jump from target to target in mid-air without falling. I like the bow, but it's underpowered until after it's leveled up. Shoot someone in the head or face with a bow, they should be down for the count, period. Over all, did I like the game, despite the many shortcomings? Yes. Was it worth $59? HELL NO!! Would I spent $59 on another game from the same developer? Nope, sorry. $50 and up should be reserved for top of the line, well-written games. No longer does just being New mean a game should be priced that high. I do recommend the game, but with reservations. I'd give it a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. That might seem like a low score, but a lot of the games coming out are only 3 to 5. The main benefit is this game CAN be played for hours and hours.			"

												This is a game I really wanted to enjoy but found myself struggling to the whole way through the game. I am a new thief player and have always enjoyed stealth games and was looking forward to see this reboot of the franchise that started it all. And all this game had me saying was I should really be playing dishonored instead. It felt almost exactly the same in every aspect. This would be fine by me if it they had been released close to each other but dishonored came out over 2 years prior which is a standard development cycle.The main story can get schizophrenic at times and several times I was lost having to look at recaps online of what was actually going on. The game liked to switch between 3 main storylines and not really explain when or why they were doing this. I think this was to make the game seem more mysterious and edgy, which I just found to be irritating. It seemed like the story was mashed together when square needed to stretch out this 7 hour main story.Now there are some points that I fail to grasp between game play mechanics and the story. The main one being that there is a huge point in this game to say that he doesn't kill people, only the ones who need it. This is brought up at least 4 times in the first 5 minutes of gameplay. Even saying that it was wrong of Erin to kill a guard  Yet one of the first things you get is broadhead arrows allowing you to just headshot your way through the game if you wanted. It even gives you slow-motion kill cams, Garrett you hate killing as much as I hate Lord Gaben.  I assume this was implemented to help out newer players but it just kind of makes his moral high ground that is referred to countless times fall flat.This games stealth feels fantastic 95% of the time. Getting to hide in the shadows and climb your way across the rooftops and hiding in the alleys to make it through complex puzzles of guards. In almost ever encounter in this game I found a way to get through it without having to knockout or kill guards. Another thing that I really enjoyed were the weapon upgrades and trinkets. It seemed like a fair amount of thought went into creating the names for them and what they do each of them made sense and were well thought out that level of immersion added a nice touch when upgrading my health of focus. I would say that my main gripes from this game didn't come from anything related to the game play but rather that the story was cliche and bland. I feel like if that I had put more time creating a fleshed out story that didn't quite feel so linear and run of the mill I would have enjoyed this game much more. But with nice stealth mechanics and thought put into gameplay I have to say this game works for someone who wants to take their time and not marathon through it and for someone playing on a console.Final vote console gamer and a 6 out of 10.

												While I did not play any other thief game before this I find Thief 4 very interesting and fun. The stealth mechanic is nothing special but still a lot of fun when you mange to get away with something just before an enemy spots you. Combat is close to non existant in this game and im not so sure thats a bad thing, the game is based around stealth. If people want combat they should play Dishonored instead.The city even if not huge like in somegames, it provides a fun way to get around and jump from mission to mission while offering a few side quests and interesting places to loot along the way.I was amazed at the amount of detail put in the light effects but the textures could be better.Overall this game is awesome and if you have a spare 50$ you should try it.8.5/10 on gameplay7/10 on story7/10 on graphics10/10 for originality and fetures8/10 overall			"

												In short… Based on the amazing originals this game is disappointing. The game feels simply rushed, it would have been so much better had it been polished and re-worked. However, I bought it on sale and found it worth the money in the long run; it wasn’t as terrible as some would suggest, just not great. You do occasionally get a glimpse or feeling reminiscent of the originals but never quite hits the spot.The graphics look good but still way too much copying of models, once you’ve seen one cabinet, chest etc. you’ve seen them all. The story is not that interesting and just confusingly unimportant. Annoying repeat animations for certain actions that are just not needed and waste time. Items for collection don’t tell a story or have any importance. The game just really feels rushed and disappointing that they couldn’t capture any of the original magic from the series. Saying that it runs well, didn’t crash and gives value for money in length. "

												Im not an oldschool gamer, so i havent beat the other thief games (but i own them). I really want to play this game, but there is a level in this that i am about 20 seconds into the main building and i already quit the game. Keep in mind for those of you that hate horror, level 5 is about an asylum with gollum like creatures that has been abandon and overrun basicly. If you do not like horror, i would not sugjest this game (unless you can do horror for like an hour). The mojority of the game isnt scary, so its really just a mission of horror, but that stopped me. The game is fun, and i bought it because i owned the other 3 thief games, exept they seem to give very little instruction and expert you to do this thing. I got a couple of missions in on the last one but still couldnt figure anything out. This gamme (as i had hoped), is alot simpler. There is a map marker and a dot on your screen above the objective, but it is not like it is handing it to you. I often spend alot of time trying to get to it because there are buildings in the way. So, even though this review isnt very long, i must say it is a good game, even though i havent beat it. Remember, if you do not like horror games, i would think about if you want this or not because then you dont play the whole game, but still, it is an amazing game.			"

It's a fun stealth game that lets you explore and gives you alternative routes to every objective, that influencing the end of the mission, whichis pretty cool i my opinion. Anyone interested in parkour games, stealth games and and games placed in the era of the nobles should give this game a shot.			"

												I could write MANY words about this... but I really cannot be bothered anymore.It's not awful, if I pretend to be a bit objective. In fact some bits are pretty good.But I hate this. I really, REALLY hate this game  with a passion. If you enjoyed the last three games, and Dishonored, stay away from this. It's not the remake I wanted and at times it feels like it isn't even the remake parts of the team wanted. It is fragmented, unfocused, horrendously written and shamelessly derivative.Avoid.Pretend it never happened, like Prince of Persia 3D.			"

												Thief is an intresting game. The stealth element of Thief is absolutley superb. You sneak from shadow to shadow using a dash like power called (swoop) picking up anything and everything you see that's worth a value. However the game's klunky mechanics make this difficult. Sometimes the game will stop you from going certain places...but you'll never know why. And don't even get me started on the city map...holy hell. 5/10			"
