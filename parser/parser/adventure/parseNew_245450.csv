												Oh Steam, thank you!Wizardry 8 is a wizened (ha) old game, having come out in 2001. That said, the old game has lost none of its charms. There is one race short of a dozen playable ones, and fifteen classes. Each race offers its own little perks, and each class has amazing abilities and powers. Combine this with the plethora of items and magic, and you'll be experimenting with different combinations over and over again.That being said, it is an old game. The graphics are pixellated (go cry in Skyrim if that's what you care about, you horrid wretch) and the control system is outdated (I spent fifteen minutes pressing WASD until I realized it was the arrow keys that moved the party). And it has the ""old school difficulty"": if your party isn't properly made or if you're missing a member (IE: someone who can tank or cast spells), you're going to get mercilessly butchered by the first boss creature, repeatedly.I'd recommend this game to all of my friends. It's amazing, it's fun, it's inviting, and it's dynamic. It's an age-old, forgotten gem that has lost none of its charm.TL;DR: It's a better version of Legends of GrimrockPS: Hey Steam, why not release other good, old games like Betrayal in Krondor/Antara while you're at it?

												I was introduced to this game via the Night Dive Bundle (Thanks Bundlestars!). I was originally planning to get it simply for Systemshock 2, but this wonderful game came along with it. after doing some research, i found out just how loved it was, so I tried it for myself. Basic, spoiler free tldr Plotline: Create your party, grab 3 artifacts and stop evil dude from doing the same, whist exploding everyone and everything that stands in your way of saving the world.The plot is pretty much put to the wayside in my own opinon, but it is interesting enough to be noteable. At first, It can be a bit daunting for players used to newer RPGs, but everything is very well streamlined when it comes to the User Interface and inventories. That is, once you get used to it.  Combat:Basic lowdown: up to six PC's and two followers fighting together against enemies, using ranged, melee, or magic, with enemies in a 3d space. Works in a similar way to the older FFs, and is very fun at as well as aggrivating in earlier stages. The game spices up this style of combat  by applying the strategies of positioning and formations, which are vital for both staying alive and dealing damage. The enemies have a bad tendency to be either mediocore or brutal, crushing your party to a pulp at times. But, the combat remains rather balanced throughout, and exciting.Characters and Character Progression:Much like Oblivion or Morrowind, each character has Basic Stats that can only be raised through leveling up, and Skill Stats that can be leveled both through gaining levels or by use in combat. Creating a character that fits his or her role into the party is absolutely esssential, and if not created properly, can permanently cripple the party. To survive basically, you need at least one Melee character in the front, a Ranged in the back, along with a caster to support them. Character classes basically divvy up the general roles into more specifc ones, with some classes unable to use certain weapons, you must choose carefully. The combinations of both races and classes, and the distribution of stat points allows for immense variety in playstyles, from the practical to the ridiculous.Probably my favorite thing about the progression is seeing how far my party has come from the beginning. From my caster being barely able to cast basic magic to being a Lord of Death on the battlefield, erasing damage to party members and boosting their stats to ridiculous levels.Another thing that stands out is the wide variety of Voice packs that each character can posess, and can be changed at any time. From laid back to the edge of sanity, sultry or sneaky, your choice. My favorites are the Male and Female Chaotic voices. These add much needed soul to the game, as well as some laughs.Graphics:The game looks ""Good Enough"" for the modern age of games. Thankfully, with programs included such as Nglide, the game can run on just about anything. Laggy areas can be prevalent, even on modern, top of the line PC's, but usually, it will run at a glorious 60fps. What makes it even better, is that Steam Cloud saving for some odd reason works perfectly with this game, and the game's saves can flawlessly transfer from computer to computer.Stuff I do not like about this game:This game is hands down the best of this specifc genre that I have ever played, but it still has its flaws.-quests and objectives can be rather ambigous, and without the help of online guides, some of these can be very frustrating.-Crafting recipies are never revealed in game, which can be agrivating unless you have them online.-Travelling the world can be rather slow, as it is quite expansive, and portal spells can only be unlocked later in the game.-Saving is a bit awkward, having to go into the options menu every time can get annoying.-Starting off on the wrong foot party wise can lead to a near impossible playthrough.Otherwise, I heartily recommeded to those wishing to sink a lot of time into a great, easily scaleble game.

												Not certain about the why of my doing this, but here's my remark on Wizardry 8. I just leave it here (beware of much text ahead).Straight to the point. Wizardry 8 is a fabulous game. I mean, the best game ever. Only after over 500 hours played I'm realizing that all of my best loved games are just no way superior to this masterpiece. Powerful artifacts, deadly encounters, incredible adventures – this is Wizardry 8 in a nutshell. Like any other game of its kind, Wizardry 8 is definitely not going to be appraised in terms of mere good or bad. Once in a little while it looks completely genial, sometimes you are like “What the hell were they dreaming of introducing this?!”, but rather more often you simply don't know how to react to what you see on the screen.Wizardry 8 is both amazing with its exceptional gameplay features and frustrating with its outrageous flaws. It provides a vast open world which should teem with lots of NPCs engaged in profound interactions, but for some reason it is nowhere nearly true. This world itself is not going to be lively and frolic of any kind. The sparse Dominus dwellers resemble me some kind of heartless automata, and only brilliant dialogues are the ones to persuade that these wretched beings are actually sentient and full of life. Most of player's concerns are confined to insane scouring areas for valuable loot and exterminating representatives of the local fauna, the remains of the later ones to be involved into a biological cycle. Many of the classes are interesting to try out and even extraordinary, though some of them seem not entirely refined. For instance, the samurai class. In my vision, these guys are implied to be ultimate fearless warriors, slicing their enemies into multiple pieces, casting thunder storm over them simultaneously. But like it was implemented in the game, a samurai will never exceed the plain fighter since he tends to get exhausted too quickly and even is not able to go berserk upon his foes. Similarly, he's barely capable of serving as a decent spellcaster for his getting some epic spells rather late, not counting the wizardry spellbook being not the most effective. It's also worth mentioning the minor racial abilities. For example, the faeries possess a natural bonus to AC which is predictably to be explained by their small size and high mobility. However, that gives no considerable benefits to their survivability in combat – enemies will regularly hit your faerie, shamelessly ignoring her gift. Some races weren't given any specific talents at all.Wizardry 8 is notable for its marvellous sounds and music, yet even this trait is innerly inconsistent. The musical compositions are great enough, but not various and for sure not numerous. Many of the sound effects are so stunningly convincing that sometimes they pierce your head, with sudden death of your character from Boiling Blood causing an emotional trauma.The auto-levelling system seems to make sure there is always a match to your heroes from the beginning towards the very end, but it proves to be broken inside. Being more precise, it comes out in that your party is often going to get either gutted by powerful beasts far greater or simply bored to death by those who are many levels lower than your buddies.The ferocious randomness and merciless monster respawning are supposed to make your characters’ life unbearable by all means. Having gone insane, a fighter will stab down his party mate just in a couple of casual swings, or give an instant deathblow to that one who urgently needs healing. Miscasted spells will backfly by chance which may turn demise for the whole party. Your enemies themselves will show up just from nowhere and tread your group around swiftly, leaving you no chances to get away. Bad enough they appear in enormous packs, but they also have ridiculous amounts of health and are always glad to perform some nasty tricks for you. Those encounters can be infernally difficult at times, yet they ultimately cause you build your team sensibly, with equal dedication to every single member.Either of those features seems not to be able to handle itself, to say nothing of how they all were supposed to get along with one another. That being said, overlapping and twisting into a disproportionately shaped entity, they basically form Wizardry 8’s tangled consistency. Deprived of any of them, the whole thing will get collapsed.But enough vilifying for right now. What’s so special about Wizardry 8?First of all, this game offers the most complicated character development system I have ever seen. It enables you to create a team of spunky adventurers, each of whom (in his own pathetic way) is going to embody your personal ideas on what the true hero should be. For a spry hardcore player, there’s a possibility to create a party of one – that’s when the real challenge begins. You can also import your characters from Wizardry 7 – then it gets even more interesting.Wizardry 8 got a tremendous score of replayability. Here one will find a lot of everything to tinker with: races, classes, skills, spells and so much more. Such a range of variety makes you dizzy of numerous options, meaning that none of your replays will be similar to one another.The communication system is rather unique to any game known to me – instead of clicking text-lines you are suggested to pick out a subject from the text on your own, and note that not interacting with everyone you encounter you’re going to cluelessly stagger around, futilely trying to figure out what’s the point and what you should do now. Rare NPCs you meet may not seem much sensible outside, nevertheless they have many interesting thoughts to share, and who knows what innermost secrets they may keep? Practically each of events happening to the group is accompanied by charming remarks let out by your adorable characters what in a way makes you believe they are real personalities. You see just the portraits of them all the time, with only lips moving and eyes blinking, but they do a great work towards convincing you they are alive.Thankfully, Wizardry 8 lacks in annoying cut-scenes and stretched videos, as well as evident hints at what you need to do next and where head for, like ‘walk there, kill that bad guy, enjoy the ending’. All you got is your own mind to apply and the vast open world to explore, full of obscure menaces and incredible adventures. The conditions of victory are stated explicitly, but what are the ways of pursuing them is not as clear. Upon the emergency landing on Dominus, one thing proves undoubtful, though: the fact of your party surviving a shipwreck is definitely not a prospect for having a nice trip after all. Prepare for a long and arduous journey which involves reaching celestial heights and diving in the ocean abyss, creeping along spooky dungeons and roaming around a whole city built up on a tree, meeting old comrades and making some new friends as well. You'll have to handle interracial disputes and solve fancy puzzles, and in the end of your adventure you're going to save the world, of course!I'm being out of space to write in, so let's get approaching a closure. To sum up all the stuff mentioned above, I’d say Wizardry 8 is a genuinely unique RPG game featuring challenging yet still rewarding gameplay, immersive rpg system, overwhelming sounds and adorable dialogues. It's the case when originality and inconsistency blended together make for products of the highest quality. Too bad such a game was irreverently forgotten.PS the text was initially written in another language and I couldn't squeeze it into a steam review due to the dumb limitation to about 2000 symbols. But once I stumbled across a review which, being written in English, was twice longer than mine having been cut short. So the main reason I even began writing a translation of the original draft for was my hope to win up some extra letters that way.			"

There is so much to try ... and so much to find ... and theese things make a game real special. Wizardry 8 is one of a kind.			"

												 For lovers of RPG's Wizardry 8 is definately worth checking out. I never played 6, played a bit of 7 but 8 is something special. If you have fond memories of the might and magic series, especially perhaps 6-8, and other ,more recent ones like Legend of Grimrock for example ( although that  has battles in real-time)   then wizardry 8 might scratch that 'rpg' itch.   It's a game where you control 6 characters, all highly customizable with several races, classes and a whole pool of skills and perks and go adventuring finding loot, exploring, levelling up and engaging in turn based battles. In fact even picking your party can be a daunting task with so many choices to make that can affect your chances especially the further into the game you go.  A word of warning though. This is a hard game. It can be unforgiving and frustrating even in the early stages which may involve a lot of running away and going back until you beat a particualr enemy or enemies. Indeed, at points there are a lot of enemies, sometimes unfairly so, and they come thick and fast where luck and frequent saves are sometimes the only way to progress. And, although i have no way of knowing how many hours i played this game ( but i would guess in excess of 50/60 hours) i never completed it. This is more due to the fact after upgrading my pc, the discs no longer worked and so  it was put aside but never forgotten.  Until now.  It's great it' has appeared on steam and i am looking forward to tackling it once again. If you have the time to invest in it; the patience to put up with some rage inducing losses; the vision to look past it's dated but functional graphics and the love of a deep, complex and involving rpg with great turn based mechanics and characters that  actually have a personality and some great lines, then give Wizardry 8 a go.

												It's more modern than its graphics imply - this game isn't just some old-school zombie that was kept alive by fans, it's an RPG that may be slow at at times, and have more than a few quirks that do require research before building your party, but it has a much deeper system than at first appears. It has true 3d, like an FPS while controlling a full party, and the party is arranged on a grid where ""short range"" is determined by what quarter of the grid is facing the enemy - attacks to the rear attack your rear line mages first, while your front line fighters cannot reach the enemy. It has an odd hybrid point-buy combined with train-through-use system, as well - skills are both bought and then trained through use, making player choices not be so much a min-maxxing for what skills are most valuable and worth your points, as much as it is a choice of what skills you can train through use the easiest, and which ones need those level-up skill points to get jump-started.If anything, Wizardry 8 is a transitional game. It seems clear that Sir-Tech was working hard to modernize their game while still keeping the depth of their old games, and it's a shame they couldn't have gotten past this point to create a Wizardry 9 that would have more fully brought the game into being both a modern RPG as well as the homage to the RPGs of years past. However, this game gives you all you need to see where they were going.			"

												I used to play Wizardry 8 as a kid a whole bunch, and when I saw it on steam again, I thought to myself ""hmm, I remember liking this as a kid a lot. I wonder if it's still a good game, or is it just nostalgia..."" And after 4 days and 38 hours, I still think it's an extremely good PC RPG. The dialog, story, RPG system, voiceacting are all top notch. World is interesting, surprising and has loads of personality. Graphics, even though dated, still work in their own personal style, and have not become unclear, you can still instantly tell what everything is supposed to be, even from a bit further away.The biggest flaw this game has, in my humble opinion, is the dated engine. It inherits the typical early 2000 engine limitations and quirks. You will probably get stuck sometimes, you will get crushed by physics objects (death by crates!) and you will get stuck behind patrolling friendly NPCs, who are surpsingly headstrong in walking in front of you slowly, or walking through you, pushing you along and frustrating you. Trynton is horrible for this very reason sometimes. Also, combat is sometimes very slow, and you will find yourself avoiding fights a lot of the time, because they take so much time. There is a way to speed up animations and combat when launching the game, and you should probably do that when nearing the end of the game.All in all, even though it's a bit dated game, and even if you've never played it, but like PC RPGs, it's a really good pickup.

												This is one of my favorite games, there is soo much customization and strategy to this game. If you like turn-based strategy and can handle older graphics (due to the time it was made) this game is probably for you. There are a lot of little things that experienced players know that you won't. There is a pretty large learning curve and I didn't really feel the need to grind much like in other games. My character most of the time felt like he was the right level to be in the area that I was in. Beginning The GameIn the beginning, you will probably be lost just at creating a character. Here are a few tips as well as a helpful video.- Always have atleast one fighter preferable 2- have a mage- have a psionic- make sure you don't have more than 3 ranged characters (with little health) with you. - SAVE OFTEN- If a character dies, load your last save.- Early on in the game (first 30 minutes) mages and other low health characters will probably die at least once your first couple parties.- Don't give up- Last but one of the most important, EXPLORE!!! It helps a lot.Finally here is the video and if you need more help send me a msg and I will try my best to help you.

Its D&D meets Legends of Grimlock without the puzzels. 11 races, 15 classes, dozens of spells, lots of skills. Leveling up is xp based plus skills gain through use in addition to level-up points. Multi-class any of your 6 character party!Its very slow. But I think that's a plus. I enjoy long slow games that challange me. Combat is done VERY good once I figured it out. Just requires some patience. Its an old game but I think the graphics are quite alright. I play in windowed mode so I can chat and do other stuff too (search online for the tweak). One thing I like is the way battles can be automated or micromanaged. Positioning, formation  and knowing when to use spells is critical! Save early, save often.A strong and intresting tactical cRPG. I give this a strong 4/5			"

A must have game for anyone who likes turn based RPGsThis is an old game that has aged very well. Graphics are clear and distictive (although a bit on the brown side) and the controls work well. You make your own party of 1-6. Pick race, class, skill&stats, portaits AND voice and then get going. Gameplay is very fun though some battles do drag out a bit. The game is very long. I belive I have only finished it once or twice BUT I have started over probably +100 times. Truthfully I'm a bit addicted to the creating a new party and starting a new adventure part of the game.Game has some bugs. I recommend keeping several seperate saves in case of progress stopping bugs. There is an optional iron man mode but only select that with the knowledge that you game might end with your party being pushed of a cliff to their death by a squirrel, or something.			"

												This is a game for you Magi-punk lovers. while you are confined to one planet, Mages in space is a ridiculously fun idea. Designing a party of 6 right from the get go is also a very nice feature that a lot of games don't have these days, and it which lets you get into playing as your characters. The game is a bit hard early on while you learn the controls and do your grinding, potentially learning what makes a bad party, (like one without a dedicated healer.)I highly reccomend going into the controls and switching things to WASD, because arrow keys are agonizing to use. and it took me a while to find that holding right click let's you mouse control instead of the Numpad. once you get used to that, this game get's amazing.

												Wizardry 8 was among the last 1st-person ""hard-core"" cRPG's, whereby the game is more like a table-top simulation than one aiming for realism. There is always an argument over what ""hard-core"" means, but for old guys like me (39) who have seen just about the entire evolution of RPG's ""hard-core"" doesn't necessarily mean hard--although they usually are--it simply means the player's skill is demonstrated by strategic and tactical strategy, exploration, character creation, willingness to keep good notes, and whereby the character's skill is responsible for combat initiate, to-hit, locating items, detecting traps, warning about out-of-sight monsters, etc...Wizardry 8 is a great game for anyone who loves developing characters! You get to design six, count 'em, six player characters, and then steer their leveling over the course of this long game. They will go through all sorts of armor and weapon combos, master their class skills, change professions to master new skills, learn dozens of spells, use musical instruments, create gadget weapons, master traditional weapons, etc... You will never be bored with a party of six PC's to manage.Wizardry 8 is also a great game if you love combat. In fact, back in the day this game became notorious for its marathon combat sessions. Fights can easily go on for twenty or thirty minutes real time! In fact, I would mark this fact as both a strength and a weakness. This opinion will switch back and forth depending on whether I just won or lost a marathon fight. When you win these huge fights you will often level up several characters, if not the whole party, but when you lose you just wasted a half-hour of your life you cannot get back. Often I have been traveling Arnika road, and have had to deal with waves and waves of enemies, expending every last arrow, bullet stone, magic spell and drop of stamina and life, but was richly rewarded with XP, potions, gear, etc...In true Wizardry style, the game world is just as much a puzzle as a fantasy world. The puzzles do not quite reach the sophistication of 'Myst' but you simply can't always go where you want to on the first try. You will need to solve quests for NPCs, find very well hidden artifacts, etc... to gain access to many areas. I love this though, because it makes reaching hard to access areas all the more exciting and rewarding.In terms of difficulty, this game is certainly not easy. There are no quest arrows or fast-travel. You must drag information out of NPC's using your PC's communication skill, fights can be incredibly long and even low level monsters can wipe you out if there are 20 of them and they manage to surround your party (this is one thing about this game that seems ahead of its time--enemies do not just stand there and take a beating. They will always try to flank or even surround you. They don't have 'AI' per se, but their fighting instructions are well-written.Obviously, the game's graphics have aged a lot since 2001. That being said, as you can see from the screen shots, the graphics are nice and colorful and quite sharp. The spell effects are varied, and there is plenty of variety when it comes to monsters. Besides, as I said in my opening paragraph, this game is really more a table-top simulator than a modern open-world RPG. It's not about eye-candy world (it's graphics were already weak in 2001), it's about thinking your way through quests, puzzles, long fights, and befriending NPC's to get much needed information. Also a handful of mods exist that tweak some of the balance issues in this game, and weed out some of the needlessly annoying issues that you will encounter in some areas.In conclusion, I would strongly urge anyone who likes a challenge, and who likes the recent resurgence in old-school RPG's, to give this original old-school game a chance. Also, take the time to read the  other reviews and the game description. You'll see they are mostly positive, and many do a better job than mine describing the game. I am really hoping that someone will develop a new-generation Wizardry-style game to go along with the spiritual successors to Baldur's Gate (Pillars of Eternity) and to a lesser extent Ultima (Divinity Original Sin isn't quite the Ultima 7 successor I would like, but it's still really good). Give Wiz 8 a few hours to grow on you. It's like a great novel that needs the first twenty or thirty pages to establish itself, and then it's a real page turner the whole rest of the way.			"

												I had a copy of Wiz 8 back when it first came out, thanks to my dad. I was so enthralled whenever I watched him play it because of the gameplay and the character-creation. When I played it after I got older and was able to better grasp the mechanics of the game, I was still in love.The first part of most RPGs, character creation, is an experience itself. With many races and classes to choose from, there is plenty of variety because you not only create 1 character, but you create 6. The races range from the Tolkienesque races to some really cool and unique playable races (Dracon. Faerie, Lizardman, Mook to name a few)There are plenty of different classes to choose from also. Developing your characters throughout the game is also great. There are many spells to use too. The game plays like many of the old school RPGs like M&M in a FPS type. Just watch the video to get the idea. Wiz 8 was the last of a dying breed when it came out, but I personally enjoy the gameplay. Combat is turnbased while exploring is free roam. The story of Wiz 8 is actually pretty fascinating and proves to be enagaging at times. I'll leave it there and let it unfold for you because I had the story spoiled for me and I will never forget it. I wish it wasn't spoiled.All in all, I can praise and review and talk about how fun Wiz 8 is til I'm blue in the face. For 10 bucks its a steal (comes fully patched and the graphics are improved compared to the original release.) considering to get a CD copy is about 50 bucks. (They don't make it anymore and not many were made). Get it, play it, and enjoy the experience of Wizardry 8.			"

												For those of you who did not grow up in the age of PC gaming with single-core, less than 277Mhz CPU/GPU setups, and CRT monitors only up to 15""... have you got a shock in store.Wizardry 8 is amazing. Simple as that. And not only is it the final game in the Wizardry series, it is also the final of the Dark Savant Trilogy, which consists of Wizardry 6, 7 and 8. We had to wait nine years for 8 after VII, but you know what, it was worth the wait. To some of us anyway. For those of us that played Wizardry Gold, the wait was a little shorter, but still, five years is a long time to wait for the final story of an amazing story arch and series of games.Depending on how you ended VII, if you did, then you have multiple beginning story archs to be a part of, then again, so to you have multiple endings.Remember in the beginning of Zelda: OoT, where you have to find the three gems to unlock the Temple of Time? Well, I think that borrowed from this entire story, because that is it. You have to find three gems, but make no mistake... you will not do it as quickly as you'd like. And then the story is just plain weird after you get them, because then you have to become a Templar. And well... that is the funny part, you will see.This title also takes away from the stepping from spot to spot of the previous two titles and you are able to walk (via first-person perspective) and turn and such in a full 3D environment. And even better, you can see the enemies this time, no random popping of battles. It may not seem like it, but in its day, this was amazing stuff to see. This game is amazing even today, so give it a go, you will enjoy it. It's fluid, it's great, and it will make you laugh with some of the story stuff, but I will not spoil anything.There are also mods for the game, however I have not tried any yet, as I am still giving it a go in vanilla forme.The game runs great, has multiple beginning and ending story paths and tells a great story for its time. I recommend this, especially if you enjoy the older RPG titles of PC gaming.			"

												Somehow i have missed this game in my 20+ yrs of gaming and discovered it in 2016.WHAT A MISTAKE HAVE I DONE.Game made by Sirtech (Jagged Alliance rings any bells?) which made me remember how the games used to be in times when great game dev studios still existed...I won`t write a game description (Wizardy 8 Wiki instead[en.wikipedia.org]) but let me tell you - if you play this you are in for a treat.Graphic is still ""playable"" (early 3d i would say ;) ) and the gameplay itself feels just awesome (mix of real time walking and turn based combat from first-person perespective).The amount of possible combinations for characters and party creation is vast and i can't yet imagine the replayability value (endless? :P ).Don't forget to edit the file 3DVideo.CFG (with notepad or whatever else) in order to type in your desired resolution (ingame utility offers only low res) and have fun.PSIf you are new to Wizardry series i suggest watching some youtube guides for first party creation like this one:

												So you been playing The Witcher or Dragon Age and just don't get all the shagging and long-winded dialogues. You're even annoyed that those games aren't featuring turnbased combat. And the setting seems too familiar like something done a million times before. Welcome to Wizardry 8. Pretty much the pinnacle of turnbased dungeoncrawler cRPG's. This one is gold. If you ever played Might & Magic, Eye of the Beholder, Menzoberezzan or the newer Legend of Grimrock (which is gridbased unlike this one) you'll most likely adore this game. This is a game for oldschool RPG players. It's stat-heavy, character development is exciting and fun, there is A LOT of combat and A LOT of loot, progression feels right and well paced, character voices are a blast, music is pretty atmospheric and nice, the world is a bit empty but looks decent for an oldschool cRPG and the 90's developer humour is a joy to behold (do check the manual as well for some quick laughs). The amount of races (11) and classes (15) gives this game one of the most intriguing character creation schemes ever. It's bloody hard to settle on 6 characters only when they all sound very unique and interesting. The game lets you recruit two npc's at a time (RPC's) with their own benefits and limitations (some outright refuse to go to certain areas).  Once created the future development starts to intrigue you. You'll most likely end up in forums getting answers to a lot of questions in that regard. Which is quite nice. I learned half of this game by reading posts and figuring out different approaches. Which is this game's strongest side IMO. There is no right or wrong way. It's how you wanna play it (for the most part). There is no such thing as an optimal party. It's what you want it to be. What suits your roleplaying and gameplay the best. And that's one of the reasons it's hard to become tired of this game. The amount of options, how many characters to run (1-6), where to go (semi-open world), what skills to emphasize developing, who you wanna recruit etc..... You most likely wanna try out every possible combination. The game has a few bugs. Luckily the game uses rolling quicksaves so you can have 3 quicksaves at a time (at which point the first gets overwritten and so forth). And the combat can get really slow. I highly recommend using the monster movement speed mod: http://wolfie.wiz8.de/Wiz8Fast.htmlTL;DR ""You're going to need someone of superior intelligence""If you like oldschool, combat and stat heavy cRPG's you will get hooked on this one. I've seen people with ridiculous amount of time in this game. People who tried multiple playthroughs with different setups, 1 character iron man games, you name it. Personally I have 300+ hours in the game (some off Steam) and have gotten around 15%-20% through the game then restarted to try out different parties and builds. This game will do that to you. I have rarely seen a starting zone (the Monastery) this many times in any cRPG I've ever played. And I love it. The game has some quirky puzzles. Things you wouldn't expect or see coming. And the feeling of solving said puzzles leaves one with the satisfaction like no other. Back in the day people didn't go online to check walkthroughs but sticked with it and got the most rewarding feeling of figuring something out for themselves. This game has that sort of ""achivement moments"". IMHO this game, Fallout 1&2 and Arcanum is the best non-D&D cRPG to ever have been made. It's just that bloody good. Not the story, but the level of party customization, the mix of ""improving through usage"" and point distribution at level-up's, the witty voiceacting, the weird fantasy-scifi setting, the extremely tactical combat system (positioning is everything), the small tricks you pick up as you get better at the game etc.... It is simply brilliant. Let me recommend you this video to understand the importance of Wiz8 and the Wizardry series:Spoiler alert!

												The last of a fantastic line of classical PC RPGs that stretch back to 1981. The Wizardry series was a founding father of the RPG genre and many great franchises of today, including Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Might and Magic, drew significant inspiration from it. Wizardry 8 takes the wide array of charachters and classes and challenging combat of its predecessors and places it into a new, for the series, 3D environment that, even after a decade, is still pleasing to the eye.Woven into this 3D world is a story line that is both unique and engaging. The story takes place on a classic medieval fantasy planet that is now host to a range of alien factions vying diplomatically and militarily for control over artificats that will grant godhood. This story drives gameplay both at the tactical level, with your party members choosing between swords, spells, guns, and technology, and at the strategic level, as you decide who to ally with and who to oppose among 2 major factions and a host of minor players. These choices affect gameplay in a way that puts modern AAA RPG developers to shame. Major choices set you on a road towards one of the game's various endings, but even these roads aren't set in stone as choices made with minor factions can alter your ultimate path. While I would be remiss in not recommending players new to the series try out Wizardry 6 and 7 first, the reality is that Wizardry 8, with its 3D environment and epic tale, stands head and shoulders above its predecessors and is perfectly enjoyable as a stand-alone experience.

												There is no other RPG like this. A full 1st person 3D open world with a combination of turned-based and real-time combat, full 6-party with 2 hirable NPC characters that can swap in and out (or simply become permanent), meaning 8 characters you can use as you progress through the lengthy game.The main features: amazing character progression: with classes like Lord, Valkyrie, Bishop, Bard, Ninja and yes, Samurai - among many others including the staples like Priest, Mage, Rogue, etc., this game rewards the player with every encounter. It's a use-based skill system where characters have simply tons of potential skills, stats, and magic options to increase, all packaged in a very workable and mostly modern UX (that supports right mouse click to open, close).By amazing, I mean amazing. Players have completed the game on its Iron Man mode, without losing a life, and have also completed the entire thing using just one character. I am on my 6th playthrough of the game (and I know many have much more than that). Any character combination is viable, and they are always growing in some way. great combat: what would a great progression system be without some place to show off. Here's where you can. While it's not the easiest game to at first get into (as it has more depth than almost any other RPG I've played), with things intuitively displayed such as your cone of facing, party positioning, short and extended weapons, all kinds of status effects you can get and inflict, all types of ranged weapons (including modern weapons and even a couple sci-fi influences), the game just puts it all together in an extremely well thought out experience. For example, cast a fireball spell and you'll get a nice draggable marker that extends out into the world with a range indicator, highlighting all it would affect. And there can be big battles. You'll be roaming the countryside and see a group of 10 bandits. They have an aggro range so when they ""sense"" your party, they'll start walking toward you. As soon as they get within combat range, turned-based combat will ensue. NOTE: by default you'll want to speed this up in options as it'll be too slow. Just slide it to its max.After any combat, you'll get a very cool list of all your character's skill increases, which always makes any combat worth entering into. By the end of the game, you will feel exceptionally, and appropriately powerful.  open non-linear world: the world is a scary place. You can definitely travel to areas with creatures way too tough for your party, which makes exploring so fun. The path is not always exceptionally clear - a good thing in my book as it really relies on the player to get immersed and explore its lore. But you'll get to travel around and within cities on the ground and in trees, military bases, outposts, swamps, and hidden labs, among other places. And the order you do this is up to you. There are factions you can ally with and work for with meaningful rewards / consequences.  replayability: the depth of the character progression and party options, as well as the non-linearity of main storyline, key randomized chest drops throughout, faction choices, as well as enemy spawn system, make for a highly replayable game.TIPS FOR BEGINNERS: important: for most wide screen monitors this game will by default looked ""stretched"". You'll likely want to (until a widescreen patch with proper UI support is made - there is one but the UI stretches) play this in 4:3 ratio. Which means you'll need to go into your graphic card settings (e.g., nVidia control panel), go to ""Adjust desktop size and position"", and for GPU set maintain original aspect ratio, then save changes. Also when you run the game and its 3D setup, choose Direct 3D as your mode, and ensure that it's set to 4:3 ratio. Then you'll get the correct black bars and your mouse will be nicely constrained. It will also look much better, and I find is completely playable. google search Wizardry 8 tips and you'll find a few key websites with information on party building, etc. GameFAQs also has some good guides make sure you have one or two spellcasters in your party (e.g., mage / priest) as they have beneficial long-term spells they can cast like Armorplate or Enchanted Blade that can be up at all times starting from not long into the game. And don't forget light. :) positioning is key. As you travel in the Monastery and in the wilderness, mostly stick to the sides of the area, as they'll have nooks and crannies you can get your party into, so enemies won't surround you and get your back-positioned party members. Doorways and narrow hallways help with this, too.  don't be afraid to find a corner, press ""c"" to camp, regenerate your spellpoints / hp, and then start again. there's a quicksave - simply press ""q"" and there will be multiple slots worth that recycle. It's instant, and do it often. practice using skills and spells - the more you practice, the more effective they become. For example you can practice examining locked chests for traps, or picking a complicated door over and over (when you find one) to increase your locks & traps skill. focus on only a couple primary stats at first until at least one is 100. It then unlocks a special trait that's usually very helpful. This won't happen until early-mid game if you're persistent. Sure there's more but there is a ton of info about this game still... and a somewhat active player community, even 15 years later. Crazy.This is a classic, and a great end to one of the series that started it all. This is by far the most accessible Wizardry, and the first (and last) one in 3D.			"

												This game is pure and simple amazing. There is a reason the people who have played it clamered to get it rerelased on any platforms.  I have put in MANY MANY hours into this game. and still it is one of my favorites. This game was a labor of love as it drove the company bankrupt and still they finished it long after checks stop comming in. and even released a patch. Prosunparralled character customization, Still unmatched by almost any game today.The game is fairly open world for its time, and still today has a you can go anywhere and do anything approch to the game from the start. 100's of hours worth of game play and replayablitiy. Replayability, this alone makes this game almost never ending in possibilities. random moster generators, and random loot generators also make the game never the same thing twice. cons, Graphics are dated. even with mods the game engine is limited in what it can do. Difficulty. The game can be hard to even the ones who have played it for years. If you had in Mad god's Cosmic forge program you can change almost anything about the game. Truely Truely wonderful. "

												This is the best RPG I have ever played. I will say that flat and simple. It has the best replay value of all RPGs I have played, best party building system, best leveling system, and great and unique combat system too. THe only con I can think of is the graphics very much how its an old game. It is about a slight step up from N64 graphics is all, but damn the gameplay is good. It is a complex game, but very straight forward like chess. The rules of chess are easy to learn, but figuring out how you want to play and the best way to play are a whole other thing.This game is worth $10. Ive got 25 hours right now and I'm still fighting with restarting and just trying out combinations of parties. I haven't even gotten 1/4 through thew game yet. I make progress fine, but I learn more about the enemies and flow of combat and think ""Oh wait I can do that! ok I'm ganna make another party with that in mind now""You can do almost anything you want too. Want all ranged members? all melee or magic? no problem you can do it, but it will take some time to tweak the and figure out how to make it be good, but the point is you can!My favorite RPGs before this were probably golden sun and legend of dragoon. If your like me you or like either of those games you will LOVE this game.			"

												Wizardry 8 is a must-own CRPG. It is on its own, the last Wizardry game of the Dark Savant trilogy made by Sir-Tech as well as being the last within the official series (the license was given to game developers in Japan who made their own Wizardry games such as Tale of the Forsaken Land which have their own story and universe in comparison to that of 8).The gameplay itself gives players either a turn-based approach or a more active but still turn-based take on combat. The game itself is a mixture of fantasy and sci-fi, pitting players against mundane enemies such as a human spell-caster and giant rats to more technological or magical enemies such as androids or demonic beast. Wizardry 8 offers a variety of customization to players based on the races and classes to choose from. This means one can play with a normal party such as a dwarf fighter, elf mage, and a human thief to something a bit more diverse such as Hobbit ninja's and Felpurr samurai's. Not only is there a variety in races (such as human, rawulf, dracon, mook, etc.) and classes to pick (such as bishop, priest, ninja, alchemist, etc.) but the game also offers a variety of equipment to use, each with their own advantages and restrictions.The story of Wizardry pits the player's party against the forces of the Dark Savant for whatever reason (using an imported save where you went with an important NPC to Dominus, following a prophecy you'd first hear a bit from the Trynnie merchant, the game does have different intros based on what saves you use, be it imported saves from Wizardry 7 or using an entirely new party). Ultimately (without trying to spoil too much), the story would lead to players trying to gain a power that the Savant himself desires.The only con to Wizardry 8 as far as I know is that trying to play it off Steam with a mod (only tried the Christian Coder mod) doesn't seem to work for some reason.If you are a sort of person who is interested in playing a good CRPG that is worth the time and money spent, Wizardry 8 is one to go with.

												A classic RPG that is easily a game to be recommended to any lovers of the older games in the genre, before quest markers and hand-holding became a more common theme to break the genre open and make it appealing to younger players.Wizardry 8 boasts a fitting musical score to bring to life a variety of environments, some surprisingly good if not hammy voice acting that often manages to bring characters to life, and a no-pulled-punches approach to the gameplay. I found myself engrossed in this game as a younger teenager and played the whole thing to completion, despite what was back then a lack of complete sensible consideration over certain decisions. Returning to the game years later has been as enjoyable as playing through it was the first time: the game is as challenging as I remember it being even with the additional bonus knowledge of tips and secrets that are incredibly easy to miss. Par for the course, by the time I hit the first real boss Gregor, I managed to have a character die on me and used my first Res. Powder - it's a surprising comfort to know some things just don't change.The controls are a little more wonky than I remember them being, and of course Wizardry 8 demands a resolution that some might not be entirely used to these days, but though the game has clearly aged over the years it has done so gracefully and still provides a great classic RPG experience to any who want to dabble in the genre.(Also, I'm not saying but I'm just saying, a full Dex/Strength/Speed Rogue with Antone's cursed sword Bloodlust in main hand and any decent dagger in secondary might sound like a terrible idea in principle, but let me tell you when that sucker hits four to five times with Bloodlust and five to six times with his dagger he's gonna be your favourite melee combat party member ever.)

												Ladies and gentleman, this is THE best RPG ever made, hands down.""What about Baldur's Gate?"" You might ask. ""Dude, Planescape is the best ever."" You might say. Well, put a sock in it, because this game is the epitome of RPG awesome. Those games are in a different category of coolness, but Wizardry 8 branches out and places a shadow over everything.Here are the reasons Wizardry 8 is the best RPG ever.*An uncanny amount of enemies in most fights, for an RPG of this kind. (You can have 30 or more monsters in a single battle.)*AoE spells are the best.*Every enemy EXPLODES or DISINTEGRATES on death. Nobody falls over and leaves a corpse. Cleaner world, cooler finishers.*This is one of those rare games with a class that can eventually learn every spell available, and that class can eventually one-shot the entire enemy lineup of 30 or more monsters. Bishop or bust, homes.*Monks will roflstomp everything. And I do mean everything.*It has Wookies.All you have to do is drop a measly $10, pocket change, and you've got hundreds of hours of gameplay at your fingertips. Ignore my steam times - I've been playing Wizardry 8 off and on for 13 years. I've probably beaten this game more times than any other game I've ever played. And I hardly ever take my games to a finish. That's the excellence of Wizardry 8.So stop wasting time reading my crappy review, and buy the damn game. You'll get more than your money's worth.			"

Wiz8 just rules.I tried 6 and 7 after this, but found 8 to be the only one that was palatable to me.

												Short version:  If you're a fan of classic cRPGs (especially those that are party-centric with turn-based combat) this game belongs in your library, particularly if you can get it on a discount.Long-winded version:Wizardy 8 is a worthy capstone to the long-running series.  It is certainly one of the best cRPGs of its time and, arguably, one of the best of all time.  All of the elements that made up a great game of this genre in the 2000s is here:  robust character creation, flexible party formation, plentiful combat, and addictive character progression.As might be expected of a game its age, the graphics in Wizardry 8 are dated.  But, importantly, not cripplingly so.  Watching a freshly killed opponent explode and seeing their skull careen across the screen is just...timeless.  Unlike the graphics, the sound is still top notch.  The ambient environmental sounds, whether in a dungeon, jungle, or graveyard, do a very nice job of bringing some immersion to the game.While RP elements such as open world exploration and NPC interactions are light compared to the standards of today, the character creation and party formation system provides enough variety that you'll develop an affinity for the members of your party as you go along.  Stat and skill prgression is a fairly straightforward affair:  raise the tank's strength and stamina, raise the mage's intelligence, etc.  But what's nice is that it's not just leveling up that provides progress.  Using skills repeatedly also raises their scores.  So, yes, you can develop a mage that's awesome with a bow (given enough practice).  On top of such flexibility, progress actually feels like progress.  You can sense the improvement in your characters as they climb the godly ladder even as they face more difficult opponents.The story is decent enough but, frankly, isn't likely to be the reason someone keeps playing the game.  That motivation will likely come from character/party development and....Combat.  This is truly a towering strength of the game.  It's plentiful and it requires adapting tactics to have any sort of long term success.  Fortunately, the game allows you to do just that.  The AI mobs can be surprisingly, and unforgivingly, clever.  Don't just stand in the middle of open ground...get your party's back against a wall to avoid being surrounded.  Guard that mage, because the mob's not going to charge headlong at the lady in plate armor with the big, pointy stick (unless you find a way to give them no alternative).  If the enemy has access to long range attacks, they will use them, so you better not sit back waiting for that fireball to explode in front of you.  There are even going to be situations in which your party is in over its head.  Retreat to fight another time.  Not every combat will provide a challenge, but just enough will to keep you on your toes.In conclusion, while it has the drawbacks of age, Wizardry 8 still provides a great cRPG experience.  As I said in the short version above, if you like classic games of the genre, give this one a go, particularly if it goes on sale.			"

												Wizardry 8 brings back the classic feel of some of the old school DnD games. Trying to figure out the various classes that fit in with your style of gameplay while balancing them with the ability to survive. So many different combinations that you can have will make this game fun to replay or run multiply runs at the same time. The exictment of finding the various classes that works well together to give you a difficult time surviving while at the same time giving you pride. Or the various ways to play classes. Like a fire only mage, or a damaging priest and so forth. The classes has so many different ways that you are able to play them.With all that going on you also have the going back to find stuff that you needed to go forwards to get. That and trying to remember where they were at the same time. Or if you forget to grab an item that you need later the trying time to figure out where it is, the hunt that you have for that one treasure that you needed. Getting the information from various NPC's or the notes that you have to find.All of this combined with the option of a ironman mode where you can only save when you exit the game and once your party dies it is all over. This brings out the caution for those loved party members, while at the same time making sure that you don't bite off more then you can chew. Not being able to go back and take back those options you did that makes people hate you or attack you.These various things in this game is a large part in why I would recommend this game to others. The long hours that you can spend on it along with the replay ability. The various difficulty with the option of Ironman to up the challenge. All of those and more make this game well worth the ten dollar price tag.			"

												This game is an absolute beast.I debated on getting this game for a long while. I finally broke down and got it in a bundle and I'm so very glad that I did. I somehow missed this game when it was current, so I don't have any nostalgia blinders. I did grow up in the 80s/90s though, so I'm pretty well versed in the various eras of ugly video games and older graphics don't bother me. Still, this one looked like it might have been just too dated to be fun. The screenshots tend to look horrible so I hesitated.I'm so glad my misgivings were wrong. The graphics are actually not even that bad once you have a little time to adapt. I find the visuals quite passable now (though they are dated for sure, lets be clear on that).One thing I noticed that kept being repeated while I was researching this game is that even today, nothing compares to Wizardry 8 or carries the torch. Its true. This RPG really is in a class by itself and if there is anything that really does its job, I have never seen it - spiritual successor or otherwise. The character creation system is complex. There are a lot of races and classes to choose from and you can have up to 6 in your party, with 2 extra slots to recruit optional NPCs later. The leveling system gives the player a lot of control in each character's development and skills can also be raised through use, which is nice.Combat is turn based and you can issue commands to each party member before rounds. You can also turn continuous combat off and on (even mid-fight) to speed things up if desired. Formation also matters a lot but you can change it up during combat if a group of enemies attacks you from behind (being surrounded can be very dangerous though!).For a game this old, the voice acting is surprisingly good as well.Another thing that's impressive about this game, is how sophisticated and polished the interface truly is. There are a couple of things that are kind of annoying when you're trying to do things quickly (such as mass potion brewing/stack splitting) and the inventory can be a bit of a pain sometimes but even so, the interface of this game is probably one of the best designed I have ever seen. This game is still worth playing, later. If you like party based RPGs this one is highly recommended.			"

												In my opinion, the best party /turn based RPG ever made.This is a game that continues to get better, the longer you play it.  The variations in party configuration, the epic story, the size and scope of the game, the incredibly well thought out UI (especially given the release date), all add up to make an amazing game, with a ton of replay value.I had this game on CD when it came out, and put hundreds of hours into it, I think I'm over 100 hours now on the steam edition (which I bought instantly when I found out it was available).  I'm sure I will put at least 200 hours into this version, if not more.  It's one of the games that you can just keep coming back to.  The different approaches you can make to the game via party configuration, really does make reply beyond viable.Wizardry 8 is a difficult game.  It doesn't hold your hand, give you quest markers, or make it easy for you to know exactly what you should do at all times.  It will nudge you in a general direction, and it's up to you to figure things out.  That can be a bit daunting at first, as the world is huge, and there are a lot of things going on.  It's also awesome, because everything probably actually does mean/do something.  See that blue feather on the ground?  Yah, it's for something, you just have to figure out what.  You have to think, deduce, and reason when you play this game, and that's awesome if it apeals to you.  There are of course, very in depth guides and spoilers, so you'll never really get stuck.I haven't gotten to the bottom of this game, even after at least 300 hours, and I still love starting up a new party and setting off again.  A tremendous game, that's well worth whatever they charge for it.  There are a few mods that will make your life a bit easier, and aim to adjust some of the few flaws in the game, most notably the wizfast fix, which speeds up monster movement (fights can become very huge).Highest recommendation, if you like party based RGPs.  First person, can play either turn based or real time, huge number of spells, abilities, and classes, and endless party combinations.  If this kind of game is even marginally in your interest range, it's a must buy.			"

												The party system makes this game! So much fun hand crafting all of the little details of your 6 man (8 with npc's later on) group and then going into battle with them.  You really feel like the choices you make with character development have a direct impact on how the game plays. I'm using a tradtional RPG party with healer, tank, dps's, etc... but still their are tons of choices for me to make, and intersting skills like lockpicking and alchemy help mix things up. So far I have played on  ""turn based"" combat, although the game does allow continous combat (option in menu). Personally I think this game should be played as a turn based game; seems like it was designed that way. In any case this will allow you to make tactically sound decisions, which is part of what makes the combat fun.  So far I have really enjoyed exploring the first area with my party, as you never know what monster/treasure chest awaits around the next corner.			"

												I haven't finished this game yet despite having played for almost 93 hours. I have newer, and slicker games than this, but I doubt that they're this good. Why is this game great even though it has primitive 3D graphics?The audio is excellent. The voice acting, and environmental sounds are top notch. The world is interesting, and it's populated with different races with distinct personalities. There are a lot of puzzles to solve. The combat is much more detailed than you might first think. Your characters can be put in formation. Your characters can be flanked. Magic is powerful when you use it, and when it is used against you. Character progression offers a lot of choices. Customizing your party's gear and abilities is crucial. This game is hard. You'll need to save a lot, and some of the puzzles might stop you. If that's the case, just reference a walk through for a little help.			"

												Actually still the best RPG ever. Or the only one. In some aspects.Aside from graphics (weak already at the release date) and some cruelty to novices, this game has many features that aren't outperformed yet. There are no dialogs: you can type what you want to say. There are no quests: you can change the state of the world any way you can imagine to achieve your goals. There is the craziest setting, where space-traveller battlemage samurai dragon with stone-loaded rifle looks ok. I believe, games in the future (when there will be real AI to talk with and world simulation instead of glitchy quest-lines) will be more similar to Wizardry, than to any other game series. But Wizardry will be the first for the all times.			"

												I've never played any of the Wizardry games before, and I actually found out about them from Todd Howard mentioning the series and playing it before he took hold at Bethesda. I can see relations between Wizardry 8 and Morrowind (the first TES game involving Todd Howard in development) and it's really interesting. It seems like a Fallout/Morrowind/Daggerfall mixture with it's own touch. Only playing three hours, I've found this to be really addicting. When killing, it feels more rewarding than most RPG games that I've played. I really feel like character progression is more refined in this game, especially for it's time. The game to be honest, is pretty hard if you don't know what you're doing. Essentially trial/error is what you have to do if you don't watch gameplay or not know what you're doing. I've found having a priest, tank, ranger or two, and a bard is standard. Bard's lute helps out loads and having the extra ranger if you choose, helps in sticky situation when your spellcaster(s) and ranger can only attack the far-away enemy. Overall, this game is great, I'd definitely pay the full $10.00 if it wasn't on sale. It's worth it if you like RPG games.			"

												Don't be discouraged. I read some of the negative reviews saying this did not work with newer computers and operating systems. However my love for this classic RPG drove me to buy it anyway, and it works flawlessly.Short rundown of system specs:Windows 8.1Intel I7 4790K ProcessorEVGA GeForce GTX 98016GB of DDR3 RamThe game started up without any extra tinkering on my end. Valve has yet again provided a classic game that runs on new systems.Gameplay:Like many others here, i have put 100's of hours into this game outside of steam. What you need to know getting into it, is that this is a very challenging, but rewarding RPG. You will have characters die, sometimes even wipeing your whole team. You will forget to save and have to restart from your last autosave(you did enable that right?). You may even have to leave an area to come back later because the enemies are just too strong. If you like challenging, long lasting game experiences, this is the game for you. If your looking for a strategic game, with turn based combat, and loveable characters, this game is for you. If you want to spend $10, and hide in a cave and play a RPG for a month, this game is perfect for you!			"

												Wizardry 8 is a great game if you are not a guy keen on crisp graphics.It's a classic dungeon crawler rpg where you can make your whole party in every detail which is part of the fun. You'll meet many incredible monsters, some easy to beat, some hard to beat, some even impossible to beat - (you might have to run from them).The story is continued from its predecessors and now your party can even ascend and become gods (or cosmic lords, as the game calls it). Which is incredibly fun!So it's not an easy game at all. It can be a challenge. And you can build your characters wrong so they may be useless in the endgame. But it's an incredibly rewarding game. For every new player, I'd recommend to make yourself familiar with the game on normal or easy settings, then go for the 3rd and highest difficulty for an amusing game where you'll sometimes have to run but where XP flows steadily and challenges come galore.Just for fun, I have started a speedrun to share my hundreds of hours I have played this game - not only on steam, but before too. I'm so happy about this version as my old DVDs didn't work with Windows 7 anymore.You can read newbie tips about the game here: www.thoughtfulgaming.com - and you'll have access to my YouTube from there too.And there are, of course, many Playthroughs on YouTube for the game. Some of them really funny if new guys play it blindly. You will experience some of the fun if you buy and play this game just like that.And for the speedbumps, you can go to e.g. my blog and get some starting help :-)

												Don't let the release date of 2001 scare you away because this is a very playable and enjoyable game. The controls and graphics are fully acceptable by today's standards (though you may want to swap your cursor keys for WASD) and I've seen many modern mobile games look worse. The introduction basically tells you all you need to know about the Wizardry games that came before, so no need to play any other titles prior to this one.The Wizardry series was hit and miss for me in the old days since it was one of the worst offenders in the ""ecology of a dungeon"" -- with rats and ninjas one step down a corridor from slimes ready to pounce you from total darkness. Wizardry 8 is much more realistic in that sense with slimes in rooms where it looks like they'd thrive, for example, although it still has some of the wacky characters and races more suited to science fiction than fantasy. I'm not sure how I feel about that aspect of the game - but this particular Wizardry seems less corny in that way.The locations are varied and interesting, and the game makes you want to explore every nook and cranny rather than blow through it. Sometimes you will find little hidden items and clues, so the searching is worth it. The gameplay is a hybrid between Castle Grimrock / Dungeon Master / Bard's Tale classic-style and 3D full-range movement CRPGs, and allows you to position your characters to the sides in your party formation. I have yet to decide if this works well (since while you can be flanked you cannot flank the enemy with your ""blob), but it does add interest to how you form your party. If you like dungeon crawls with inventory management, healing spells, and a casual tone (but with ample challenge), this one is a good use of your time.			"

												I can't even express how much I love this game. It kicks my♥♥♥♥♥ It makes me cry. I still haven't beaten it because I keep trying new parties to see if I find that magic key that works for me.But I really really enjoy it.One of the biggest draw is the party creation, in which you get to select semi-animated character portraits and select from a variety of personality based voices. Your party members speak quite a lot, usually as a way to notify you of things that've happened or are happening in game, and it really makes your party feel real. Try getting to level 12 with a group and not care about all 6 of your party members for reasons other than tactics. If you can do it, you're heartless.The other thing I love about it, is from the perspective of someone who hasn't completed everything yet, it's such an interesting world to explore. It's not quite what you expect and it always feels like there's more around the corner, and it's worth it to just spend some time cautiously poking around.As a comparison to another game, Legends of Grimrock, I consider LoG a dumbed down half broken crappy version of Wizardry 8 with much prettier graphics.

If you are looking for a party-based RPG with character creation that is deeper then most games even at the time of its release, accompanied by one of the best turn-based battle systems ever made, hard difficulty and a decently written storyline, then you owe it to yourself to pick up the last of a series of games that is one of the founding fathers of the coputer role-playing game (this doesn't count the Japanese made Wizardry games, not because I hate them, but because I have not actually played any of them).

												An old fashioned game for those who appreciate the feel of table top roleplaying, without the hassle that comes with a group of people. The game is deep, and highly complicated throughout, and in the end all players begin to decide what classes and gameplay is 'the best'. The only thing that I have seen as a downside to this game's design is the fact that what you encounter, and the overall difficulty is as much dependant on luck as it is skill. Creatures actively hunt you down, and you can easily end up against odds you cannot possibly overcome, especially if you have decided to try to run from an encounter, instead of putting your back to a wall and fighting it out in hopes of surviving with at least a few members of your party alive. If you are the type who enjoys tabletop games such as D&D or Pathfinder, this game will likely tickle your fancy, but if you are looking for another Fable or even a Final Fantasy, or Skyrim, you may as well move on, as this game will only frustrate you.

												Man, after restarting this game about 40 different times over 15 years, I love this damn game so much. It just has so much personality and character that isn't over the top or exceedingly epic, at the simplest definition its just a band of dofuses fighting their way to become gods over the course of a 4 day weekend. The vast amount of voice options you can pick your characters (9 personalities, 2 voices for each, for two genders = 32 voices to choose from) is awesome to keep the ingame monologue fresh. The only thing that is missing is banter between the characters that you make, but for a product of the 2000's this is a feature that would be far outside of a closing studios budget (RIP Sirtech)Combat is both tense and rewarding, planning a well coordinated turn that wipes the enemies in one sweep feels so satisfying, at the cost of some hearing ability depending on the spells you used (RIP Headphone users when you cast that magic missile towards a 7+ enemy pack).They don't make like this anymore, sadly.God, I just ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.Protip: Don't be frugal with Bombs, Stix, and Powders. Use them! They're very plentiful in the game, and having an Alchemist on your team is great for those!			"

												HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDThe best RPG of all time! That's an understatement.  You might as well trash your PC if you don't play his game, which was so ahead of its time when it came out and it still is unmatched.I have well over 800 hours logged in this game before it was released on Steam, so I have done EVERYTHING. I have beaten the game twice (Normal, Expert), each with different party composition. Even on Normal, this game is very challenging . There is an Easy option too, for a casual player.			"

It can be a little confusing for new players (the manual helps a lot) and some parts are a bit grindy, but the sense of adventure and exploration combined with your characters progress while levelling, make this a definite recommendation for RPG fans.Roughly 100 hours played, years before Steam was released.

Games problems are few: eye piercing graphics, scaling of enemies and pretty much absense of tutorial. There is not much else to say really, so many words were already told about this game we could probably create several massive tomes comprising all the reviews and praise. Buy it, enjoy it, just remember this came out more then a decade ago. A huge shoutout to those who ported this game to steam, along with system shock! You guys are awesome!  "

												It may be an old game, but this game has some of the best fantasy and sci-fi mixtures ever seen in a video game, and the enemies are just so much fun to fight. I reccomend this game as one of the last opportunities to figure out how a game works and what works best by yourself. Sadly, it seems that too many older games did not go fully appreciated, and this is one. So if you are tired of new games and you are ready for a STEEP learning curve, play Wizardry 8, and don't get too frustrated with the op enemies. The enemies are relentless....			"

There is this strange athmospere when you travel arcoss the land in this game. Somewhat haunting as one might say. Every profession is meaningful and has special items spread across the world. For example i recommend you make gadgeteer in your party before venturing. If i recall right gadgeteer can make the game alot easier on some points and it also has upgradable pistol. I remember getting tons of pistol parts ingame and didnt have a clue what to do with those lol :D10/10 game!			"

												I played this game about 14 years ago and loved it. So many different races and classes I could include in my party and customize. So many puzzles, traps and different npcs to meet and talk to. I could start with a party of 6 and include 2 more characters at any time along the way. I loved the secret doors to underground dungeons. So many different and strange creatures to battle. I can't imagine how awesome this game would be to play if it had updated graphics. If my windows 10 loaded this game I would still play this game from time to time, that's how much I loved this game. I was crushed when Sir Tech went out of business, they were going to come out with Wizardry 9 and 10. For me, this was the best game I ever played and have not found anything else that even compares to it. Best all time rpg for me. Still a good game to play even with the dated graphics.			"

												I have 45.9 hours on record with Steam for this game, but the save file I played from was over 10 years old with countless hours invested in it.This game is difficult. It is awkward. It is annoying at times. This is offset plenty by the rich storyline, the character creation system, an interesting formation-based 6-person party (8 w/ temporary NPCs you can control) that can engage in combat in either turn-based or real-time, and the fact that no matter how hard you smash this game you will almost certainly never beat it. In a timely manner.While the game itself is outdated, its playability is not. If you want a game that you will spend countless hours playing with no hope of an easy victory, coupled with the lack of Achievements to document your epic feats, then this game might be perfect for you.

												Kind of old school, but very fun game.  I could not get it to run through Steam though, Steam users posting in the discussion board for this game helped me out.  The fix that worked for me:1. Create new folder on C drive named ""w8""2. Copy everything from your steam\steamapps\common\Wizardry8 folder over to the new c:\w8 folder3. Click on ""Wiz8"" application in c:\w8It should run.  You can exit out of the game and go back to the c:\w8 folder to launch 3DSetup application and make some changes to resolution, suggest selecting ""glide2x"", and then launch ""nglide_config"" application in the same folder for more resolution options.Good luck and have fun.

												Sir-tech's final entry in the series does not dissapoint. I've played Wiz8 a long time ago and now it's finally available on Steam.It's not perfect, but it's damned close. It can be very difficult for a new player who never played Wiz series before.For the first time in Wiz series you will see a completely 3D environment - game is still quite pretty for its age. Player can create a party and fully customize each party memeber (like class, skills etc ). Each character has its own dialogue, animated portrait, and unique voice tone. The characters and the way they interact with each of the NPCs have come a long way since Wiz7. Your personality, communication skills, and the way you and the NPCs view each other all determine what happens during a confrontation. You can talk by either typing in complete sentences (like: Where is XXX?), and also by selecting words from your already memorized ones. Combat system is very good IMO. Player can setup all party members in a formation that could be anything from *fighters in front and ranged characters behind* to a *fighters in the middle and casters on the sides*. Player can setup virtually any formation desired. Either way you will be able to change the way your party attacks/is attacked and do so on the fly, letting you devise a new formation during battle to adapt to the new combat situation.I highly recommend this game - it's difficult but very rewarding. It's definitely an underrated gem.			"

Unique personalities and voices help bring characters to life in interesting ways.  This game is a must have for any RPG gamer.  Want a real challenge? Try Ironman mode on expert.			"

												This game can be difficult to pick up at first, as it's complex stat/skill system can be a little overwhelming, especially if you don't know what you're doing. But overall, once you get used to things, this game is extremely enjoyable. (Assuming the outdated graphics don't bother you)The class system is pretty extensive, several to chose from, with the ability to multi class in addition to that. Luckily there are a few hybrid classes to begin with (Lord and Samurai for example) so you may not have to multiclass to get the build you want. The combat in slow but satisfying, with enemies exploding as you defeat them. Leveling get's pretty slow as you go along but the skills you have develop as you use them (Sword skill increases as you attack with a sword, Wizardry skill increases as you cast spells, etc.) and how fast they increase is dependent on your stats. (Sword skill is dependent on Strength and Dexterity, magic element skills are dependent on Intelligence/Piety etc.) This system of skills increasing is one thing that makes this game unique and makes very slow leveling much, much, more bearable. The thing that really makes this game unique is the magic system. Your casters don't have just one magic meter, they have a magic meter for each and every element, and the amount of magic they each have is mostly dependent on your caster's skill level with magic (other factors being character level, piety stat, etc.). Normally I prefer hybrids over pure casters but this game's magic system makes classes that only cast spells appear much more appealing. You get a good amount of character portraits and voices mix and match to create characters that are just right for you. Plus you can change them at any time so if one voice or portrait get's tedious you can always try a new one without having to reset the character completely. (The only thing you can't change is the character's gender)NPC interaction is also extensive, to the point where it's kind of tedious, and you can even recruit a few NPCs into your party, and develop them the same way you would develop your own characters.  Speaking of development, the way you can develop your characters any way you want in terms of stats and skills, which you can increase as you level, is what makes this game really great. (Though it can be very unforgiving if you develop them poorly) However, the game can be very unforgiving as well. Unlike most RPGs, monsters get stronger as time goes by so if you start struggling with tough monsters you can't go back to fight weaker monsters as those monsters will be stronger as well. The complexity of stats and skills is great, but it may be to the point where you need to look up a walkthrough on how to build your characters before you can even make a party that doesn't get killed easily.   Overall, this is an amazing game, if you can handle the complexity and the outdated graphics and difficult gameplay.Pros:    + Character development is deep, especially for a party-based RPG    +Open world gameplay gives you several story choices, even if you aren't aware of them.    +Graphics are outdated but are still pretty well-made    +Did I mention deep character development?Cons:    - Very difficult and unforgiving, even on Novice difficulty    - May require a character building guide    - Several things in this game may slip by you without a walkthrough    - Combat is slow, with encounters lasting an average of 5-10 minutes (Some are faster, some are slower)			"

												This is a classic game in every possible way. Its hard to decribe it fairly without beeing too nostalgic on my part but i will try. Its a heavy roleplaygame - dungeoncrawler. So Dungeoncrawler like Grimrock, Roleplaygame like the Might and Magic (NOT Heroes of might and magic) series. It is hard, doesnt have a tutorial and punishes mistakes in character building and creation without mercy. It has some bugs....so all these bad things now to the good things: It is challanging, has a great story , gives you great freedom and knows several ways to solve problems. Naturally the graphics arent great because its old but if you endjoyed any of the ""old"" RPGS like  DSA, Might and Magic etc. then u might want to try this. Even if you dont like it...you didnt use a lot of money for it :)			"

Many options for character/party creation, so many ways to go about building a party, plenty of classes and races to keep it interesting.

												I first played this when it was state of the art 10 or so years ago.  I loved it back then, and it fills a place that not many more modern games have filled since: turn-based RPGs where you control a whole group of characters.  Like a table-top RPG, you can pause and think about the spell you want to cast next or which monster you want to kill first.  *gasp!* You can use strategy!  Comparable games from the time would be Might and Magic 7 & 8.  If you enjoyed either of those and never played a Wizardry game before, this is a good option, with slightly better graphics than either of those two (yes, they're all dated.  Get over it.).  What sets Wizardry 8 apart from similar style Might and Magic games is the unique story, non-standard character classes, and a science fiction edge you don't normally get in fantasy games.  In fact, some of the playable character races are aliens!If you like oldskool RPGs, I'd definitely recommend picking this one up at a good price.			"

												It's the best RPG I've ever played--in theory. However, there are a lot of bugs. I prefer to play this on Iron Man, Expert, because it's more fun to me that way -- in theory. In practice, what actually happens is that at some point the game crashes and corrupts your save, and then if it's Iron Man you're literally totally screwed, because you have to start over. If you are saving manually, you had better put in multiple saves.That being said, the reason why it's the best is because the story is different and interesting combined with the fact that you can ask anything in dialog and it's all voice acted -- I don't know of any other game that does this. Tons of classes and races and combat can be complex and interesting. Everyone that plays this has their own opinion about what is best for a party, but they're all wrong -- only I know what is best (joke). There are many great party combos and the game has a lot of replayability, though it's quite long.I recommend playing this game; and particularly if it doesn't happen to crash for you and get out of sync with Steam and corrupt your save.

												Wizardry 6 and 7 are really old hard core DOS games, so many people may not enjoy them due to their clunky interface, but saves carry over from game to game and the story changes depending on the previous game's ending.    Wizardry 8 has a more natural modern game feel to it but still is deeply rooted in turn-based tactical combat.   All three games offer a deeply satisfying amount of character customization coupled with a decent storyline and awesome setting.  Even if you don't enjoy the DOS games, starting a new game in Wizardry 8 is still very satisfying and the game does a decent enough job of introducing the storyline to the player.   (scoring is for wiz8) Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 6/10(but thats not what this game is all about) Storyline/Environments: 8.5/10 Overall 8/10.  Very much worth the money.   I spent a few hundred hours of my life playing this when I wa high school and it still holds up today.Edit:  The game does have old-school control issues though, such as using Arrow keys instead of WASD etc.			"

												If you love old school RPG's then look at Wizardry!  It's hard, lots of races and classes, mixes sci fi and fantasy; it has it all!  Wizardry 8 is particularly good, as it includes voice acting not found in the other titles.  If you are up for a challenge, I cannot recommend enough.			"

												Perhaps one of the best turn based games of all time. Wizardry 8 is, sadly, the last chapter in Sir Tech's long running Wizardry series. I've played this game since it initially game out back in 2000, and I still regularly play it today which is a tribute to simply how good this game is. The quest resolves around some mysterious artifacts, an evil dark savant, and an awful lot of random encounters. The combat is turn based, with each of the characters in your party been able to perform actions on each round, which can vary from casting one of the many spells, to playing an instrument, or simply hacking away with your sword. The spell casting system deserves a special mention; rather than simply having a fixed damage for each spell, they can be cast at a variety of power levels, with lower level spells been easier to cast at the higher levels (up to level seven). This help stop even your lowest level spells from becoming redundant for most of the game.This game is however fairly hard, (through it is perhaps the easiest Wizardry game), and you will most likely have quite a few frustrating moments, save often because you never know what is round the next corner or whenever the rng will go your way. All in all if you enjoy any type of turn based strategy games, and especially if you enjoy turn based RPG's then trust me but this game because you are missing out.Still as great as ever.			"

												An old classic that's easy to recommend. The Wizardry series was once THE big thing, together with Ultima, Might & Magic and a ton of classic DnD games it helped define the CRPG genre. Wiz8 is the final part of the ""Dark Savant trilogy"", which started with Wizardry 6, but truth to be told, you can enjoy it without playing through the other games: There's not much of a story and while there are references and the option to import an old party, Wiz8 works as a standalone game. There are three powerful artifacts. There are several parties hunting for them. Go get'em and become as gods.What Wizardry8 is, is an old-school CRPG with a heavy focus on numbers and game mechanics. After creating a party of up to six characters from a wide range of classes and races, you're quickly introduced to the quest for the three artifacts that will make you the most powerful of all beings. But you start out weak, ill-equipped, and rather clueless, so it's time to  whack some rats first.Especially for modern players, a party-based RPG with intricate combat, magic, crafting and lore systems will look... odd, maybe. There's more to it than charging at foes and waving your pointy sticks- Wiz8 comes with a pretty intricate combat system that takes into account anything from party formation to range and cover, so swapping weapons and using a turn to reposition your wannabe Gods is as important as taking advantage of elemental damage and resistance, items and special abilities. The interface looks rather crowded and clunky at first but it's amazing how well the various systems work together. With a simple click you swap a dagger for a crossbow, cast spells of varying power levels, or force your fighter into berserk mode. It's a good thing the combat IS so entertaining, because you will be fighting a lot. Fighting, and getting better at what you do, seeing your ragtag party dveloping their roles and skills and minmaxing the hell out of every character. If you enjoy that kind of stuff Wiz8 will be right up your alley.The setting, too, does stand out even today. Just like the old M&M games there is an oddball mix of classic ""Sword and Sorcery"" fantasy and high-tech- characters travel between planets and dimensions, crossbows exist next to laser guns, and it's not uncommon to see a kickass Ninja Fairy gibbing a troop of androids.I repeat. Ninja Fairy. Fighting ANDROIDS. If THAT doesn't get you exited, nothing will :)Highly recommended to anyone who knows about the series at all or enjoyed some good old-fashioned CRPG games already. Even more highly recommended to the modern crowd to learn where all the badassery of modern, streamlined CRPGs stems from.			"

												The myth, the legend, the one and only staple first-person dungeon crawler... In 3D! You make a team of either preset characters, or some of your own, and you can invite up to two more characters for your party. Your party characters have voices, and you can't really say they're devoid of personalities as they comment on many things, which is quite a nice touch and makes you feel more emerged into the game, like you really are among your companions, united together for the sake of a wonderful adventure. There is some plot going on, but it's not the focus of the game as you mostly just crawl the dungeons and participate in turn-based fights. Nowadays the fighting process seems super long and tedious, especially if you manage to run into a cluster made out of enemy groups, but it's manageable. The setting is quite nice, with some attempts to take a step away from the painful mediocrity of your average medieval fantasy WRPG setting. Lowpoly 3d still holds together quite nicely, and the game has been optimized to run smoothly on modern rigs. If you've ever played Morrowind and want some more of that experience, but with a slightly better battle system that treats the player in a fair fashion, this is the game for you.			"

The graphics are not up to par with today's standards but is still good considering how long ago this game was released. If you missed this sale wait for the Christmas sale and hopefully Steam will sell it for same price again. Out of all the games on sale this was the best one by far.			"

												I guess I should try actually writing a review.Wizardry 8 is an enticing game.  I've played it for quite a while, and I haven't actually finished the storyline. Granted, the first time I played almost-through it, I had to reformat and forgot to back up my save, but I had no issues restarting and enjoying the quests all over again.  I got to just about the same point in the game, when I got distracted with other things, and so I haven't played lately.  I will likely be restarting again - not that I mind, because again, it is great fun.There are a few things that will irk you when you play, either the limited resolution options, the lack of windowed mode, or what-have-you, but to me, it's all outweighed by how fun the game is.Pros:-Create your own party with thousands of possibilities for customization.-Enjoy the storyline or free roam, play how you like.-Replay it again and again, find things you've missed or experience your favorite moments again.-Low price, plenty of play time.Cons:-Occasionally a little difficult and/or frustrating-Spawning of enemies when you're trying to rest is a bit hard on the patienceIf you're looking for a game that'll occupy you for hours, and you don't want to spend a lot of money?This is one of the best.

												A retro gem worth taking a look at, Wizardry 8 is a single player RPG that allows you to create several party members, choosing from around a dozen races and classes to do so. The game is aging but should appeal to old school gamers who remember the days when video games were about interesting game mechanics and not just having the latest and greatest graphics. The game is turn based, which should appeal to players who enjoy games from the time period the Wizardry series of games originally came out in. Sadly, it seems not many today know or remember Wizardry, but if you enjoy games with a lot of different mechanics you can utilize while not being required to use them to complete the game, and have a special place in your heart for retro games of an amazing caliber, Wizardry 8 has a lot to love. The battle system is easy to learn but hard to master, yet once you are able to do so, you will feel like a true boss stomping over weaker enemies that gave you trouble before, while still weary and afraid of what new beastie may be lurking around the next corner. As far as the story and dialog goes, Wizardry 8 certainly has no problem seating itself into a more comical niche. At first glance, it may appear some of the  lines and plot are just corny and lame because of Wizardry 8's age, however, if one were to look closer, they may see that the game enjoys being campy, welcoming your eye rolling and snickering. Embrace the silly dialog and goofy plot! Enjoy the in depth character creation and entertaining battle sequences! And if you find yourself afraid to venture forth to your next objective without going back and leveling some more, don't be ashmed! The world of Wizardry 8 can be rough and heartless, at times, but with your wit and your strength, you may yet complete your adventure!			"

												I never played this game before, somehow it got by me over the years. But I must say, Wow, Wow. It has alot of innovative, polished UI improvements for its time (Dated a bit), and you can see the heavy influence modern games have taken from this. Remap the keys, etc. Too bad it hasn't been remastered for larger screens, texture modded. It DEFINATELY holds its own, even now.I have enjoyed this game so much, so far, that I must say it is a must own. If you love turnbase games like I do, then you cant go wrong, especially for around 2 bucks. It rocks.amazing.I would buy a remaster-remake in a heartbeat, now that I know I missed a real gem.EDIT: The combat can get a little slow in turn based mode, but its still good, and turn based is the way to play.If you have a controller with "" Controller Companion"" off steam, then you can sit on the couch, relax, and play this (albeit a bit slow paced). Just use the left right mouse click together to walk (x, a buttons on my controller) and your good to go.			"

												I am hooked again. Wizardry 8 is SOOOO good. A deep, difficult old school experience that is completely worth the price and more. I remember ordering it directly from Sir-Tech years ago because it wasn't available in stores. The game was finished but the devs could'nt get a distributor, or something like that, so I ended up ordering it from them. It took a while but when I finally had my hands on a copy I played it to death but never actually finished it. This little baby is HARD, make no mistake. Like Dark Souls hard in RPG form. A great story in a HUGE world filled with great characters, loot and the hardest mobs of critters you'll ever encounter. And just because you just beat a big swarm of 20+ wasps, don't think you're out of the woods because another one just like it could be right around the corner. Get your back against a wall, rest and move on. Yes, Rest and save. OFTEN. Offensive magic isn't too strong, but support magic can truly turn the tide of battle in your favour. Early spells like Web, Sleep and Terror will be essential in vanquishing large groups of enemies. Use the formation feature adequately, keep close to the walls to protct your mage and healer, and go to town. A fantastic experience that has aged very well, and a true blessing to get it on Steam. 10/10!			"

												Wizardry 8I've had the hard copy of Wiz8 for many years but unlucky for me I somehow broke the ""Play"" disk a few years back. When Steam did the fall mega sale I just HAD to buy it. This is one of those RPG's that you have to play, yeah you can cry that it's old, or it's dated in many respects. But if you look beyond that it's a fun game, you can play this in so many different ways.You start off with 6 adventures that you can customize yourself, all the way down to how they sound when they talk. From there you are cast in an adventure of a lifetime. The combat is turn based, and some of the spells are cool to aim around. There are all kinds of classes to pick from, and races to mess with... Oh and your rag tag team will talk to each other, it's kind of funny.Pros - Mix and match classes and races, lovable chatter within your party, spells are fun to use and all areas of magic are useful in some respect, replayability is high if you don't mind starting over, ironman mode can make the game a real challenge.Cons - Some monsters are hair-ripping frustrating to deal with, graphics are really dated, some races are useless, backfiring spells can be a problem, monsters auto-level with you.Verdict - Only get this game if you don't care about graphics and those auto-leveling monsters, I highly enjoy this game to no end. It's a good RPG where it counts and the banter with your party can really be funny and enjoyable.			"

												i remember playing this game when it came out its a hard game but good its very dated indeed but modern rpgs could learn a lot about character creation from this  game it gives the player huge choice and flexability unlike modern rpgs which     deffinately dont as theyre all dumbed down so George Bush can play too			"

												This is one of the best combat RPGs ever.You make a party of 1-6 from countless of classes, which all have a multitude of different skills and attributes and a ton of different spells. There Are Samurai, Bishops, Thieves, Bards, Engineers, Monks, Psyonics etc....The game is open world with very unique locations, the dialogue system is also interesting as you can type in your own questions for the NPCs to answer.The main gameplay is the turnbased combat. It is very well done and the fights are challenging, but fair.Sometimes you even run into two different factions fighting a battle and then you join an hour long epic fight that you will not forget. Even the combat music is great.This was a very worthy finish of the Wizardry series.Its also might be a game for JRPG lovers that have difficulkty finding PC titles.			"

												An excellent game which i quite sincerely recommend to all peoples who love AD&D or are quite simply fantasy fanatics. The indepth conversation and cannon D&D classes such as Fighter/Mage, even a ninja class! The game includes a very understandable storyline which holds it's punches when it come to plot discovery and has an outstanding disappearance of 'handholding'. The Min/Maxer's mentality to succeed in all instances even if their characters are punative at early levels can look forward to competitive scaling mechanic will not leave any berift of challenge. The existence of prior iterations of Wizardry, these being 6 - 7 which involve an importation based party mechinc similar to Baldur's gate EE - EE2(though entire parties, not only the *charname*)This becomes a party of personally tailored villians or heroes to be used towards ones intended AD&D goals. This game though old in our standards is enriched with mechanics that modern games seem to have a deficit, and provides hours of entertainment to all !			"

												I made a dual wielding, samurai Faerie with a thick, female German accent and named her Tinker Bell. In Wizardry 8, Making your own characters is a blast. This game is full of interesting races like the Dracon, Mook and Rawulfs and classes like the the psionic, Bishop and Ninja; this is so refreshing compared to the generic human, elf, dwarf races and the fighter, mage and thief classes you see in most modern day RPGs. I also love how  the custom characters are brought to life with a variety of  wonderful voice actors and animated portraits that make your creation feel alive; I haven't felt this attached to characters in an RPG in a long time. I know many RPGs allow you to customize your characters appearance, but Wizardry 8’s character experience stands out to me; theres just something special about taking the time to craft  the whole cast of characters in your group, then crash landing them onto the planet and see how far they can go as a team. My only real complaint is that the combat seems a little drawn out compared to other rpgs (there are mods to speed it up but I haven't installed those yet) Of course the graphics might look dated (to be expected for a game this old), but Im having a blast playing this game so far with my crazy cast of comrades. Now Excused me, I have to go make sure Tinker Bell doesn’t rip the bartenders face off...			"

												Great game, for fans of the turn-based RPG genreStory Summary: The third of the Dark Savant trilogy, this game begins where Wizardry VII left off. Your party crash-lands on the planet Dominus, and is soon confronted by the servants of the Dark Savant, who challenges you to retrieve the three artifacts: the Astral Dominae, the Destinae Dominus, and the Chaos Moliri, place them at Ascension Peak before the Dark Savant can ascend to Godhood.You create a party of 6 characters (plus up to two hired guests) from 11 races, 15 classes. You can customize each character’s portrait, and assign them one of 18 voices. Or, you can import your save game from Wizardry VII, and continue the story.This is what computer RPGs looked like before the genre was taken over by dungeon diggers (like the Diablo series) and single-character real-time RPGs (the Elder Scrolls series).Pros:* Parts of the game have aged remarkably well—despite being made in 2001, it runs natively even on 1080p monitors and works with modern 3D video cards (despite its hilariously dated 3DFX logo on startup.)* Huge world, huge number of races, huge number of classes, multiple beginnings and endings make this a highly replayable game. I've been playing this game for literally years, and still haven't experienced all of the content in it.Cons:* Random encounters can be badly-paced and repetitive. (Especially the plant monsters around Trynnie area, making even just moving from point A to point B a chore at times.* Lack of in-game help text makes the manual a necessity. (The manual is available on Steam; you might consider printing it out for reference.)* Alt-tabbing from the game can sometimes cause the game to lose keyboard control. (You can sometimes solve this by hitting alt-enter twice in a row.)Things Modern Gamers Might Have Issues With:* Difficult: even by 2001 standards, this was a difficult game, even on the “easy” setting.* Graphics: while the graphics engine can display at 1080p, the models aren’t any more detailed than they were in 2001. Some monsters (slimes and spiders) look very good even by modern standards, others (humans) look blocky.* Not all of the dialog is voiced.If you’ve played and enjoyed any of the Ultima series, the Might and Magic series (before they became strategy games), or the modern indie game Legend of Grimrock, I think you’ll enjoy Wizardry VIII.

YOU MEAN THERE'S ALL THESE MYSTICAL RACES AND♥♥♥♥♥♥ BUT THERE'S SPACESHIPS TOO?!Made party.. I have a talking husky.. IN SPACE! This is going to be AWESOME!Started the game up, to witness the full glory (at this point I'm highly caffeinated, and up too late, and way too excited over SPACE HUSKIES.. IN SPACE. Tempted to roll a party comprised entirely of talking dogs). I got about an hour into my first adventure, when I picked the lock to a door and encountered a King Crab. Two of my party members were butchered by the crab while I struggled to realize how exactly to control my characters. I immediately exited to read the manual. 142 pages of photocopied vintage gold. --------TL;DR -- Read the -ing Manual -- and ROLL A PARTY OF TALKING SPACE DOGSI'm way too stoked to play this in the morning. I'm pretty sure the next two months will be me playing Wizardry and ignoring all of my friends -- and probably, to be honest, my family.			"

												This game is gold! It's a piece of history! It's a godlike game. No rpg fan should miss this game. It can't be compared to any RPG i've ever played, but i like to compare it to FF7 because this is essentially the Western Game Equivalent of FF7. In my mind both games are equally epic and share the first place among my favorite RPGs of all time. (2nd place goes to morrowind and 3rd place goes to Dark Souls, gives me a nice and even amount of Asian and Western games in my top 3. since my top 3 is essentially 4.)The game has the most perfect, smooth turn based combat system i have ever experienced in a game. Truly masterful, and fun!It has one of the most fun Character Creation systems in gaming since you can make up to 6 characters for a single playthrough.It's soundtrack is perfect.It's setting is perfect. A mix of sci-fi and dark medieval fantasy.I almost jumped out of my chair when i saw it brought to steam, and didn't hesitate for 1 second to buy it again (also got 6 and 7 because i'd like to play this games predecessors)For a personal rating lets see.Overall 9.5/10 (All things considered. that's what i'd rate it as, very close to perfect)-Graphics (For it's time) 10/10 (Perfection)-Graphics (For now) 5/10 (still enjoyable to an extent)-Gameplay 10/10 (Obviously i think that, i can't describe it in brief either. It just is.)-Soundtrack 10/10 (It does everything a soundtrack is meant to do, and does so well.)-Voice Acting 9/10 (Very solid voice acting. And yes pretty much every npc is voiced)-Controls 8/10 (You can survive this game using only the mouse, except for dialog boxes where you need to type. You will get used to the controls very fast but that does not make them good, however you will not use most keyboard shortcut functions i suspect. only keyboard for movement and mouse for combat, but if you learn to use the keyboard shortcuts for combat it can be a great asset to speed up your fights)-World (Layout) 8/10 (It is very open and unexplored at first, but once explored once, it usually wont show you anything new except maybe a chest you didn't notice before or something like that. Also for an open world game, the maps in it are surprisingly linear, this is not bad however. It helps you know where you can go to continue)-Story 8/10 (I have not finished it yet because i just wasn't up for that difficult task. But from what i have seen, it's story is quite good, good enough to get you immersed in it. But it doesn't hold anything new that i hadn't seen before unless maybe the end which is unseen by me. I feel the 8 does it justice.)-Hardcoreness 10/10 (Think, Dark/Demon souls or Witcher as examples of hardcore modern rpgs. This game stays very true to being an RPG, It's got difficult fights and a learning curve. (For example mob spawns are mostly not levelled like in most modern games) It's very dark fantasy which in itself is a part of being hardcore. The game has every bit of hardcore Witcher or Dark souls offered me and much more.)-Fun 9/10 (I really love making characters and custom teams in the game (or any other), it's a huge part of my love for it. Then once in game i love progressing and leveling up, it feels like so much happens, but levelling gets very slow after a certain point at which you've still got ways to go to finish the game. The only thing that dropped the fun from 10 to 9 was that i've felt the need to grind for levels in the game occasionally. But this in itself is reasonably fun sincei ti s challenging)-Value 10+/10 (Yes i'm saying that this title i wouldn't have hesitated to buy for 30$ today. and in it's own time i didn't hesitate to buy it for like 50~ish. This game has as the trailer stated roughly 200+ hours worth of gameplay. You're not gonna miss your money, it tastes better than any hamburger, it gives you more fun than any movie ever could. Look at all the awards the game has!)Conclusion: MasterpieceIf you like RPGs, buy this and play this without even thinking twice. Kudos to Night Dive Studios for bringing the best titles back from the dead!Update: That's how the game is anyhow, but Night Dive's version of the game (this version) has a lot of terrible issues that make the game hard to run on Windows Vista and up, (I have a guide on how to work around it but sometimes people try everything in it and still can't get the game to run). Therefore I would recommend the GOG version over this one since it features the original unadultered version of the game and none of the issues that Night Dive introduced, and after years have still not bothered to fix.

												Buy it for the nostalgia, buy it because it's a fun way to waste an afternoon, but don't buy it for the Mac port.  There basically isn't one.  They just threw Wine at it and called it a day.  The game supports resolutions higher than 800x600, but you'd never know it if you ran it on a Mac.  It comes with 3D setup programs for Glide and DirectX7, but you can't run them from OS X, so there's no way of knowing what resolutions Wine might support.  Hand-editing the text file with common resolutions just fails.  For the best experience, you're going to want to run this under Windows.			"

												This game is easily one of the best PC RPG's of all time.  I just got this game on steam but Ive owned the disc version for several years and replayed the game many times.  I have never owned or played any other version of this game, but there are a few easter egg dungeons that are in the old style of the dungeon crawler from previous versions...  You can find out how to unlock them from some online walkthroughs.Things you should know if you buy this game:1. This game is not compatible with high mouse DPI settings.  If you can set your uber gaming mouse dpi setting to the lowest possible or off, then game will start just fine.  If you use a standard mouse then you should have no problems there.2. If the game still wont start, try compatibility mode for winxp package 2, and disable high dpi setting and run as administrator.3. Basically, the game will run, but depending on your system, you may have to do some settings juggle to get it right.If you have the disc version the same is probably true.Buy the game, you will have no regrets.

												Haven't played it much from steam since i already have another highly modded version of it but wanted to support it all the same since i have, in fact, spent countless hours playing it.Still, hands down the best old-school rpg's of its kind. The character customization, combat, magic system and difficulty set this game apart from most others and it has some pretty solid music tracks to set stage for epic battles. A multitude of races that all have their unique strengths and weaknesses along with a great selection of classes that all rely on seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, willpower, endurance, dexterity, speed and senses) which somehow all manage to be relevant at least in some way to every class.One of my favourite things about this game is that you can make up a party of 6 adventurers from scratch and by the time you are done, they all have personality. One thing of note about this game is the amount of lines of voiced dialogue from you party members.In any given battle they will be shouting out about being hurt, landing killing blows or getting poisoned and the like that really immerse the player in what is going on in the battle, all the while doing so in the personality of the voiceset you picked. While this may not seem new, the sheer amount of things they will comment on gives enough variety so it always seems to add to the situation instead of being repetative annoying drivel. MANY games have attempted to give the freedom of character creation and maintain a level of personality and have failed. This game does not, and considering it has some of the most in-depth of its kind that is fairly amusing.The only thing about this game that hasn't held up well over time is the greatly outdated first gen 3d graphics and a mediocore story (mostly due to limited interactive npcs). This game is BEGGING for a remake/facelift and someone would stand to make a LOT of cash in doing so.			"

												I didn't make far into the game, so maybe the whole awesomeness starts later, but in nearly 7 hours I finished the 1st dungeon and the game was awfully repetitive, with nearly no difficulty, no interesting exploration, nor any special event.I had never played a wizardry game before, and I started right away with the hardest difficulty level, and except the tough learning curve in the 1st hour (need to read a lot of stuff and go through an awful lot of stats to get an idea of how to build our party and level it up), I didn't have to use my brains to win the fights : the mage was killing most of the mobs with 1 group spell, and was finishing the last one with a single target spell. Over and over again. In the rare cases where another party member were getting injured too much, I had to throw a couple of healing spell and done. Then sleep, and repeat.There's almost nothing to do during the combat : we mostly spend time looking the combat log & waiting for the round to play out, only quickly setting a spell now and then.I can't imagine anyone who played more recent & evolved RPGs to enjoy this one. I do see the hypnotizing effect of staring at the combat log, but I don't think it's a nice way to spend the little time we are allowed on this planet... :)Pros :- a lot of classes with a lot customizationCons :- awful visual, with a colorblind art director (even in 2001, it was subpar)- the party members repeat the same sentences over & over- basic, repetitive & slow combats with minimal required input on our part to beat the hardest difficulty level- exploration to a bare minimum, with nearly no interest- slow to move around, especially when staring at long empty corridors- my mage killed more mobs than the 5 other party members combined- more than 60% of the attacks (except the spells) end being a miss or without any damage (who thought it'd be something exciting ?!?)Bonus Note :If you want to give a try anyway, at least boost the combat speed and once you'll be familiar with everything, look for a little tool to speed it up even more : http://steamcommunity.com/app/245450/discussions/0/846965056744779633/ .

												Very outdated systems making gameplay somewhat a chore...also game did not age very well...however it has something that has probably made it very fun a while back when it was released.For that reason it is getting a positive review, if steam wasn't so lacking and actually had a neutral one, it would have been neutral.

												I can't in good conscience recommend this game. The combat is ridiculously, mindnumbingly slow, and this game has a tendency to throw dozens of enemies at you at a time. Inevitably you'll wind up backed against a corner against 10-15 enemies. It's not particularly difficult, (ASIDE from Arnika Road) just time consuming. The interface is a strange mix of mouse and keyboard inputs with no real rhyme or reason to which controls what.Unfortunately, this game is completely devoid of atmosphere, with orcs and goblins rubbing elbows with spaceships and computers. It's all very poorly explained and random looking.The character creation system is incredibly deep however, and everything is very well explained with modern-looking tooltips all over the place. I appreciate that, but it couldn't save a mediocre game for me.			"

												REASON FOR NEGATIVE IS BASED ONLY ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE GAME ON MODERN PC.Avoid this game if you have a modern computer. Starting it up is a nightmare - tends to crash for no apparent reason. Seems to hate my multiscreen setup and graphics card which shows itself in the form of starting once in a while, while refusing to start again for the rest of the day.Possibly great RPG with awesome story and world, but it's slightly difficult to enjoy it when you never no if it will start or not.CONCLUSION:get this if you have access to an older computer that can run it with no issues.

												RNG too easily hacked to feces.  You attack- you miss! You attack- you miss! You attack- you miss! You attack - you miss!reloaded the same fight against under level mobs 10 times to progress because the RNG is hackable and something hacked it.I thinK I would beat the game faster using a DOS 586 pulled out of a trashbin, hunt the original game discs off ebay down and then install, play, and finish the game there than right here, right now on this machine.  Games with hackable RNG's should not be released or should be patched to address the issue.			"

												This has some charm and depth as an old-school CRPG. However, it is ultimately crippled by tedious combat mechanics. It is still weird enough for me to recommend it, but with the caution that it is best suited for gamers who can view this boring combat as a form of meta-challenge; I do not, and I did not continue.For old-school fans, there is fun to be had in the kooky character background and class options, the stat-tweaking galore, the deep party-building, the non-linear play with many story options, and the offbeat NPCs. The voice acting is quite good and it all makes up in novelty what it lacks in graphics.There is not fun to be had in the combat. The turn-based combat is not difficult in any engaging, strategic sense. It is simply slow and boring, even with a continuous-combat option. A single combat can easily last over 10 minutes of hack-slash-repeat. Much of this is because the game predominatly uses large groups of monsters, each moving in turn-based fashion. Other factors slow it further. AOE magic is typically quite low-damage; there is good CC, but never any quick mass-kills to clean house and move on. Your party has to move constantly, again in turn-based fashion, into extremely close range to hit with melee weapons, while enemies inexplicably do not. You cannot disengage from combat by running away or having enemies run from you; so if you Terror the enemy, you may have to wait a long time for them to return while you sit there, turn by turn. And there are many unavoidable fights, especially as creatures respawn in narrow roads, tunnels, etc.Overall, I enjoyed the rest of the game and explored five major areas of it. But I finally gave up on this one night after an hour of gaming that consisted of walking about 1/4 mile on a road, and engaging in three unchallenging combats and one NPC conversation. The convo was about 5 minutes, the walking less than that. Do the math on how tedious the combat is. And looking down the road, I saw yet another mega-mob coming... No thanks.			"

												Seriously, without a doubt, one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time. Especially for being a game that was released 15 years ago, by a developer that shut down right after it's release.It's kind of like if you took the original Everquest engine, added actual questing, made gameplay turn-based like the old school RPGs, but with an open world to explore, and decent voice acting. That's this game. The story continues from Wizardry 7, which was release eons ago. Which was also a direct follow - up to Wizardry 6. The entire trilogy spans well over 25 years which is insane for a video game (well minus Super Mario and all of course).I'll end this by saying, this is the game that Might & Magic 9 wished it could have been. And who ever has the Wizardry license now, need to take notes from this game... not that damn Anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they made of Wizardry Online. Ugh what a disgrace.			"

												With various technical issues, slow battle mechanics and dungeon crawling with old-school difficulty levels this game is not everyone's cup of tea, but I love it for the multitude of character building options and the story which combines sword-and-sorcery with space opera. Everyone's talking about the characters they've made so allow me to introduce Mo the Ranger who is basically a very sarcastic Wookie armed with a blunderbuss. I also have an ex-ninja female bard who never fails to cheer me up with her brooding aggression and unquenchable bloodthirst.My Steam playtime is low for this game because it abruptly stopped working several hours in, and for some reason the only solution was to move the exe file outside the Steam directory. After which it has worked fine, but I haven't a clue how much game time I've clocked in. A LOT, in any case. This game is very addictive.			"

												Wizardry 8 is by far and away my favorite game and rpg of all time. I played it when it first came out in 2001 for weeks on end.  The game is fantastic and huge even by today's standards. The only thing that dates the game is the graphics (which still aren't that bad). If you love old school RPGs where it's about character building and what to do on each turn on combat (not just hack and slash) then you will love this. I do recommend looking at online guides for help there is one on sorcerers.net that is still there from when I played them game but with updated you tube videos!!! It will help you find the good stuff (excaliber, light sword, light shield, fang, etc...) that you may not know even existed but make it so much more fun. Good luck!!!!!			"

												Loved this trilogy. I sadly have spent around 400 hours collectively on the 3 - Wizardry 6,7 and 8. Without guides it would have taken a LOT longer probably. I can't believe I didn't play them the first time round. Having completed all the greats, this definitely ranks up there, if not at the top. I am used to the frustrations having played many hours through the bards tale series etc. before the internet and guides even existed. I can understand if you are not used to the 'old' systems (like spending ages trying to sort inventories in Wizardry 6) but if you get past the quirks (which to me make it more enjoyable - sad as that is) then the series is second to none.

												A great, original turn based combat system and customization of a group of characters are the core of this game.There are some truly epic combats in this game and evolving your party is a real pleasure.Be aware however of the ugly 3D graphics that do not age well at all (the first screenshot for example is a crab...).Exploration is first person in real time but this game is all about long, intense, hard turn based combats where you control a full party of adventurers. This will be a turn off for some (felt as a grind) and a sweet joy for others. You can like the story or not but the fact is that you will spend most of the time in this game doing combat using a very special first person turn based system. Combat takes place in the same first person world view as exploration when enemies spot you and are close enough or when you decide to turn on combat mode. At first, it is difficult to understand the combat system and how it works, but once you get the hang of it (or read the manual) it is truly amazing. Turns are simultaneous, meaning you first choose an action for each of your characters (or keep the default one), then click ""end turn"" and see what happens (both your party and enemies will act according to their initiative, some actions may be cancelled or become useless depending on what happens and when). In first person view you never see your characters in 3D but there's a combat formation pane to position your group of characters (you can change during combat as well costing a turn to involved characters): it affects which enemies you can reach in melee depending on your weapon and the position of the enemies, and vice-versa. You can also move the whole group during a combat turn but it can prevent some characters to act for this turn. Positioning does matter in this game, and it's not at all like a simple turn based rpg where you just choose an action and a target for each character one at a time. There are also AoE items and spells, you can choose spell levels at your own risks (a spell may frizzle or even backfire if you're not skilled enough, on the other hand you can always choose a lvl 1 version of a spell for lower mana cost and safe results).There is also the characters creation system with A LOT of races and classes to choose from, more than any other RPG I know. You can make a party of 6 characters or less (plus there are 2 guest slots reserved for story NPCs). The levelup and skill systems are great. Once you have enough XP, you levelup your characters when you want outside combat (you can pile up levels even): you invest points on stats and skills and spells, separately (each have their own points so you don't have to sacrifice one for the other). Your skills and spells also improve by using them (in and out of combat).Improving your characters is a real pleasure in this game and it feels very rewarding, never limiting or frustrating.Honestly, I'm still looking for another game with these features and I don't find it. Plus the way your characters portrait talk and react to things in and out of combat really gives personality to the adventure (without cut scenes and long dialogues). You even choose your character's portrait, personalities and voices for various hilarious results (and you can change those anytime during your adventure).			"

												8.5/10.   This is a pretty great game in terms of plot, dialogue, loot, action, and the whole CRPG package.   It doesn't feel dated, even though it is, which is a bonus in my book.  It gets a knock off for having no tutorial - it took me more than half the game to learn how to move and to inspect traps - and a half a knock for turn based combat that sometimes goes on too long due to the sheer number of mobs/npcs involved or it initiates five times while you're three feet from the door and just want to go inside.  (At one point, I left the combat running while I made and ate lunch and when I returned, combat was still going.)  Otherwise, I recommend it for people who enjoy story-based RPGs.Pros:-Story-Music-Characters-Loot-Plenty of walkthrough/advice webpages still around -Graphics don't seem dated even though they areCons:-No tutorial-Combat sometimes make you cry from length			"

The personality system gives characters breath, and as silly-on-purpose as the plot is, it's an amusing, relaxing, balanced RPG that I'm glad I picked up.

If you miss turn-based roleplaying games, this one's most definately for you!			"

												Please disregard the 0.2 hours played: I played this game for hundreds of hours back when it was released in the early 2000s, and I've bought it four times altogether (a version in my native Russian, a hard copy from Amazon, a GOG version, and one here on Steam). I still give the game a run every year — though the GOG version runs better on my machine. Wizardry 8 is my second most favourite RPG of all time (after Morrowind).It is an old-school party-based RPG: you can have between one and eight characters in your party, with the range of six and eight being the standard, and there are fifteen classes and eleven races to play with. There is no artificial limit to the possible combinations, so you can try all kinds of characters, be they wacky and gimmicky or not. Each character is excellently voiced; there are 18 different voices/personalities for male RPCs, and as many for female RPCs, not to mention  the mercenaries you can hire. Each is quite distinct from the others (for example, there is a New Age dreamy kind of girl, an aspiring writer, a warlike battle-maiden, a conceited know-it-all), and the amount of dialogue and remarks is staggering. Listening to your characters' comments is one of the best things about this game.The main feature of Wizardry 8 is almost non-stop turn-based combat: you have to fight most of the time; no location (including the cities) is devoid of monsters. Some fights can be quite impressive, with your party being outnumbered four to one by creatures several levels higher (hey there, Rapax Castle!): such battles take a lot of thinking and adapting your tactics as the battle keeps on flowing.The skills in the game are numerous: there is a dozen or so of combat skills, six schools (""realms"") of magic, ""expert"" skills that you can only get by getting one of the primary attributes to 100, and supporting and miscellaneous skills. You can multi-class, creating amazing hybrids to better slay your enemies. The array of monsters is equally impressive: there are dozens of types of enemies, and hundreds of subtypes (say, the more generic ""android"" archetype comes in several variations — ""troopers"", ""slashers"", ""gunners"", ""berserkers"", and others). Each type of enemy requires a different approach: some will overpower you with magic if you let them; others will force the members of your party to attack each other; still others will rip you to shreds at close quarters if you let them close.The setting is unique: it merges sci-fi with its spaceships, light sabers, and earth-to-air ballistic missiles (that you get to launch at people you don't like) with the more traditional fantasy elements, such as dragons, ghosts, and dwarves. And you've not seen it all until you've had your elf blast demons to smithereens with a rocket launcher.The plot is not that impressive (though it's far from bad), but you don't play this game for the plot — you play it for the combat and the open world.The difficulty comes in three levels, which fact will make the game manageable for everyone — provided you are careful and don't act like you are death incarnate. In this game, it's easy to lose a high-level party if the enemy gets a jump on you, along with a bit of lucky RNG. There is also the Ironman mode, wherein your save gets deleted if your party is killed. You can change difficulty at any time, but you set the Ironmade mode before you start playing.I highly recommend this game if you don't mind dated graphics and slow-paced gameplay. You can find fan-made patches and widescreen support mods on the interwebs.			"

												One of the most indepth RPGs I've ever played, and while the graphics haven't really aged well, the RPG parts of this game still stand strong. The combat can get tedious in fights with a large number of enemies, but the combat speed can be changed outside of the game, which greatly improve the overall speed, and would highly recommend using that.

												This is one of those games i go back to time and again over the years. Testing a new party setup and rediscovering the great story while having fun with the combat mechanics. If you like open-world RPGs with intricate mechanics and don't mind the graphics this is one for you.			"

												I am pleasantly surprised. A few months ago I tried to run it, encountered plenty of hurdles, to cut a long story short - I couldn't run it from the Steam client. Now the game is fully playable with no need for tweaking. I withdraw all of my previous words of disappointment, a great thumbs up for Night Dive.			"

												This has some charm and depth as an old-school CRPG. However, it is ultimately crippled by tedious combat mechanics. It is still weird enough for me to recommend it, but with the caution that it is best suited for gamers who can view this boring combat as a form of meta-challenge; I do not, and I did not continue.For old-school fans, there is fun to be had in the kooky character background and class options, the stat-tweaking galore, the deep party-building, the non-linear play with many story options, and the offbeat NPCs. The voice acting is quite good and it all makes up in novelty what it lacks in graphics.There is not fun to be had in the combat. The turn-based combat is not difficult in any engaging, strategic sense. It is simply slow and boring, even with a continuous-combat option. A single combat can easily last over 10 minutes of hack-slash-repeat. Much of this is because the game predominatly uses large groups of monsters, each moving in turn-based fashion. Other factors slow it further. AOE magic is typically quite low-damage; there is good CC, but never any quick mass-kills to clean house and move on. Your party has to move constantly, again in turn-based fashion, into extremely close range to hit with melee weapons, while enemies inexplicably do not. You cannot disengage from combat by running away or having enemies run from you; so if you Terror the enemy, you may have to wait a long time for them to return while you sit there, turn by turn. And there are many unavoidable fights, especially as creatures respawn in narrow roads, tunnels, etc.Overall, I enjoyed the rest of the game and explored five major areas of it. But I finally gave up on this one night after an hour of gaming that consisted of walking about 1/4 mile on a road, and engaging in three unchallenging combats and one NPC conversation. The convo was about 5 minutes, the walking less than that. Do the math on how tedious the combat is. And looking down the road, I saw yet another mega-mob coming... No thanks.			"

												 I saw this game years ago at gamestop and thought it looked lame. I was never big on party based games. Several months later I decided to quit WoW and started thinking about other games to play. I found the demo for this and was hooked. Its the first party RPG I've seen where its possible to get through the game with any party combination if you're determined. The first party I ran with was a fighter, rogue, ranger, mage, bishop, and a second fighter. A rather dry party but it got the job done. I've started several other play throughs but life keeps getting in the way. The bard class is excellent as you can level the music skill up outside of combat. The bards instruments focus on dealing damage and debuffing the enemy. The gadgeteer is the opposite where his creations focus on buffing the party and his weapon upgrades with every level. There are several other classes, all classes bring something unique to the table.The world is narrow but big. My current play time of 1.8 hours only counts my steam played time, not my GOG or CD playtime. For $10 you will easily get your money's worth out of this game. There are secrets dungeons and unmarked quests to explore. While you can only have 6 PCs that you made in your party, 2 NPCs can join you. Keep in mind the more characters you have in your party, the less exp each of them gets as it is divided up.My biggest issues with the game are 1. Combat can take a while at higher levels and 2. The mobs level up with you at times. Of course you do get some rather powerful weapons and abilities at higher levels. You can feel your characters getting stronger and they do unlock new abilities with each level up. Theres a great sense of progression with the game. I would highly recommend this game. Since I first played it I have looked for games like it. Etrian Odyssey is to grindy for my taste but I like the map making system. Other games the grinding is ok but the map system is horrible. This is one of the few games that I cant find anything like it to play afterwards except for one of the spinoffs that came out for ps2 but that still doesn't have the same feel.			"

												For my taste, not as outstanding as Wiz 6 & 7, but those were legendary.This one is solid good anyway, nice and long-awaited conclusion to all the saga.Enemies scaling make it _very_ hard to beat on max difficulty.If it is your type of a game, 70+ hours of amusement guaranteed.			"

												This is one of my all time favourite RPGs. Complex party creation, infinite replayability, just try different party combos, try a solo ninja, or a dual party, or multiclass 3 or 4 times to get the perfect solo character.The game is difficult, the positioning matters, how you build up your characters matters and the story is very good. Voice acting is very good.  "
