├Professors Review┤Game Pros • 89-90 Characters to choose from (All featured in the anime/Manga) • Bonus support characters (Non-Playable) • In-Depth story following the Naruto Storyline  • Online play • Online leveling system • Various game modes (Story, Versus, Tournament) • Tons of intense attacks and abilities  • Beautiful cut scenes Game Cons • Online play isn't highly populated, so it takes time to find a fight sometimes • FPS locks at 30fps • The Camera can very rarely get at a weird angle while fighting near walls (Nothing that lasts more than a second) • Does not play well with Keyboard. Would highly suggest using a Steam controller/Xbox ControllerRelateable Games • Legend of Korra • Street Fighter  • Soul Calibur  • Tekken ConclusionNARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 is one of the most amazing fighting games I have ever played. If you loved the anime and or reading the manga, I would HIGHLY suggest buying this. Even if you just love fighting games, and have no back story of Naruto, you will for sure fall in love with this game. (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

												Full Burst... an exceptional game? The answer is: Yes. The production quality of Full Burst' Story mode is incredible. If you're looking for a game, especially based off an anime, this is what you want to get - its very immersive and a lot of fun. The fights are well done, every character is fun to use!But... unfortunately, the online experience has been rather mediocre. The game has a bunch of problems - Full Burst is not very competitive, rather a casual beat 'em up.Then again; Do you want a fun, anime fighter, enjoy your time and have some cool fights?The Storymode gets an 8/10 from me. You won't be disappointed.The Onlineplay falls short, thus only a 5/10.  Here you go: 6,5/10. The game is fantastic, unfortunately it has been plagued with problems. If thats no biggie for you, grab the game now. You won't regret it!			"

												Best Naruto game ever. Way better than the new one, way better than the previous one. I highly recommend it. You don't really have to be at episode 200 in shippuden to watch. If you plan on watching shippuden, I would start this game around the arc where the five kage meet, but if you don't plan on watching shippuden and just playing this game, this game is amazing. It does a good job of summing up everything if you haven't watched the anime or read the magna. This game managed to manipulate the fillers that everyone hated and turn them into something with very powerful emotions. Recommend that you watch the first 120 episodes of Naruto (not shippuden) before you play this game at a very minimum, though. 10/10			"

												This is just a brief review of the game/product~ ／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is the latest installment in the Ultimate Ninja series. Full Burst brings you a revamped of Storm 3 Cinematics and a New Chapter, a Chapter that enables you to fight against Kabuto at his Sage Mode, he can be playable after the completion of the chapter.The game has over 80 playable characters, from the young generations to the characters of the On-going 4th Great Ninja War. In addition, 100 new missions has been implemented on this version that expands the gameplay hours due to challenging objectives. In addition, 38 Free Costumes, character outfits that were DLC's from the orginal Storm 3, which were worth more than £30 in total. English and Japanese audio is available within the game alongside with english subtitles. Overall the gameplay is fun and entertaining, ain't hard to get grasp on to execute visually appealing combos. The characters has been re-balanced for the satisfaction of online play from the orginal Storm 3. The game does not end after the story mode, the all New 100 Missions and Online play is available for the challange. Over two thousand in game collectables are available to haul, from profile cards to titles, which can be used to customized your in game battle profile.Verdict:As a Anime fan i would give this game a 9.5/10 due to the justice it served on the original content as well for the Ninja Storm franchise.However as a Gamer the game appeal to me as 6.5/10 due to the lack of depth gameplay mechanics, although this type of game isn't supposed to be complex, unlike Guilty Gear and Street Fighter which have more rigid and competitive gameplay. Though Storm 3 serves multiple objectives, it can be a gateway to a reminisence childhood or enter a whole new world of dedicate fans of animes. Or maybe you just simply want to enjoy to see Sasuke getting lariat by the Raikage dozen of times. *no offense to Sasuke's fans ;)*NOTE: The game starts directly after the Pain Arc, no filler characters are in this game, only Canon story is implemented - summarization with 3D visuals, more than 24 hours worth of 3D custcenes.In case you're not familiar with the Shippuden series and want to watch/catch up, there are roughly 200 anime episodes to watch in total, filler excluded, in order to catch up with the story in this game.Watch Guide List:Watch episodes 1-56Skip at 57-7071 - Last 10 min or so is manga material. But is relevant for the next arc.Pick up at 72-89Skip at 90-111Pick up or Skip - 112 - Last 10 min or so is manga material. But is relevant for the next arc. You will see eye burning filler but all you need to know is that the akatsuki captures the three tails.Pick up at 113-143Skip at 144-151Pick up at 152-169Skip at 170 & 171Pick up at 172-175Skip at 176-196 (Some of this arc has filler mixed in with manga material so for those who care about the 100% completion and dont mind seeing a little burning lol, check out the spoiler below.)Pick up at 197-222Skip 223-242Pick up at 243-256257 - half filler/half mangaSkip 258-260Pick up at 261-278Skip 279-281Pick up at 282-283Skip 284-295Pick up at 296-302Skip 303-320Pick up at 321-Source info (watch list) : http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=350747 "

[SPOILER FREE] Very, very good game - Not so good port.If we were to focus on the porting of the game rather than the game itself then we'd get nowhere, as there's not a lot to say and not much of it good. So instead, I will focus mainly on the game itself from my experience with the Console editions, and later tie that in with the PC port.So, as anyone who has played a game in the STORM series knows, it is the go-to series for a true-to-the-anime experience. Everything is there; the beautiful graphics, the original voice actors, the story, everything. Even the tiny details you wouldn't normally catch (Such as Tobi's subtle and goofy taunts), are present. It's really what the anime would look like if it were real.STORM 3 was a massive step up from its predecessor, Generations, in that it took the new mechanics and elements brought to the table and refined them further, and over a year after release there are still new mechanical tactics being discovered or used in entirely new ways. There are more ways to fight in STORM 3 than there were before; many viable combinations of characters and playstyles. Although it seems at times that some are more useful or practical than others, typically it lies down to individual cunning to overcome what is ahead of them.The story is faithful to the anime (Up until a certain point, however the anime hadn't got to this point yet so it's understandable), and really makes you feel as if you were in the Naruto universe. My main gripe is the endless chains of cutscenes, with no option to skip them all, as there is a loading sequence between each one. I love the cutscenes as they are stunning, especially with Full Burst's revamped graphics, but they lose their impact if you're replaying the story mode. It would be nice to be able to skip them all without loading up each one.Aside from the main story, there are side missions aplenty, allowing you to learn a little more about the other characters in the universe that still tie in to the main story. Very good for anyone who enjoys the other characters and want to see more of them.The soundtrack to the game is reminiscent of the anime and equally as awesome. No complaints what-so-ever about the audio, as it's been spot on in all of the STORM games and I'm a huge fan of each OST. (My personal favorites were STORM 2's ""White hot battle at the summit"" and ""The Uchiha Hideout"" stage music.)Another reason people are drawn to the series is for the multiplayer. Sadly, with exception to the new roster and mechanics, STORM 3 did not bring much new to the table that was exclusive to the multiplayer, however they did take what was already there and make it just that bit better. For example, whilst there are now thousands of possible ninja info card and title choice to choose from, none of this is visible to other players unless it's a 1v1 fight. It subtracts a lot of the motivation to unlock these cards and then spend time personalizing it when there are only two modes in which people can even see it, and even then it's only for a few seconds before both players prepare to begin character selection.As for the non-1v1 modes, Tournaments or Endless, Both modes had a new feature added, but neither of them were really that interesting. Nobody plays elimination Endless (A mode where you keep playing until you lose, at which point you are kicked from the lobby) because people join endlesses to play mutliple matches with a group of people over a period of time, and being ejected from the lobby for losing, or having your opponents ejected when you win, is just like playing 1v1 modes except with a waiting list.As for Perpetual tournaments (Tournaments where each match has two stipulations that affect both players), they can still be interesting, however the feature just wasn't taken advantage of. There could have been countless possibilities for different rules and options. They could've made it so one player is affected by one rule whilst the second player is only affected by the second one. They could have also added in many more rules, too, however you'll usually have seen it all after your 3rd or 4th tournament.The Ranked mode has also gotten considerably worse; CyberConnect2 sacrificed a lot to try and keep the game balanced, and ultimately it went to waste as there are still the small stable roster of characters and supports you'll see in the majority of your matches (Looking at you, Kimimaro and Neji.) however unlike the past games, balancing patches have been brought out to try and quell this, however most players still stick to the familiar ""meta"" teams.Disconnections (Or Ragequits) were an issue CC2 attempted to address, however there still seems to be literally no penalty for people disconnect often, as there are players with thousands of disconnects and people still play against them. Some people actually take pride in their disconnection frequencies now that they have no limit.Essentially, CC2 is concerned about punishing legitimate players who accidentally disconnect, however that's exactly what's happened now; I'm still getting disconnects just like someone who ragequits. If they would just give disconnecters a loss and, or heck, even JUST give the other player a win, then nobody would be bothered by disconnections at ALL.But not all multiplayer must be online - The offline multiplayer is fantastic. All of the tournament features are available for offline use, and with addition of Full Burst; there are plenty of challenging missions which actually net you some nicely-made wallpapers. Each battle has unique stipulations, which further begs the question of why they didn't include them in the tournament mode.Another unforseen but very welcome addition only possible due to the PC port is the inclusion of mods. Sadly is there no official support for mods - yet (wink wink) - however the community has still managed to bring some incredible content to the table, such as unlocking characters that were once unplayable and actually caused CC2 to recieve a bit of backlash for not including. There are new costumes, new stages, new characters, new movesets, you name it.Sadly that's where the good news stops when it comes to the PC port. On launch, the game was plagued with a terrible bug that rendered the online mode nearly unplayable. It took a rather long time to fix, but it was eventually fixed. There were also many crashes during the story mode, however one still remains as of writing this. It appears that CC2 is eager to co-operate with its community though so I expect that these issues shan't persist forever.Another problem were the very high system requirements. Although understandable for such a stunning and complex engine, it was rather disappointing to many people that the game simply couldn't run, especially due to the very little amount of graphical settings available to the user.With that being said, here is my conclusion;+ Brilliant graphics.+ Perfect OST+ Faithful to the anime+ Very easy to pick up and play+ Huge and active fanbase+ Mountains of content of all kinds+ Community-driven developers- PC port was rather disappointing- Too much focus on a ""balanced"" online mode which didn't end up being balanced, often at the sacrifice of other, much more enjoyable features- No official support for mods despite a thriving modding community- poorly optimisedOverall, I love this game, and this series. I have put thousands of combined hours into the entire series on PC and consoles.There are definitely glaring issues or places where they could've really put some work in and made something incredible, however everything else that is expected of the STORM series is met in spades. I cannot wait for the next STORM game and can only pray that CC2 keep up their level of community interactivity and keep on improving on constructive feedback.			"

												I bought this with a low discount. I felt ripped off when I was in the launcher, as I there are only two graphical options, no default keyboard config(many ppl recommend to play this game with a controller). After I got a good keyboard config(guide made by ThillinaC), I launched the game, hoping to find my moneys worth. After the prologue, my feelings about this game turned 180 degrees. I wasn't a Naruto fan, but the story of the game won me over. I wasn't a fan of fighting games, but now I have more of those in my wishlist. This game isn't a good PC port, but it has the steady 30 FPS, so you can enjoy this game that it's better than most expect. Like every fighting game, there are a ton of characters with different unlockable skins, each one with their unique moves. Even tough you'll most likely end up with picking favourites, picking random characters will show you that each character can win if you have the skill. The battles aren't about tactics as much as about timing, as the controls are the same for everyone, just the way the characters execute the commands is different, which makes every character interesting.The story is so good that it makes the game deserve an underrated tag. For me it's up there with games like Mass  Effect, since I've experienced many emotional impacts and catharsis throughout the game. It's all about the kid who turns out to be the hero that inspires five nations to believe in themselves again and fight the war to prove the opponent that peace in this world can be. The story can turn out to be enough to get a person out of depression. There's also free roam and the sense of exploration brings many rewards. The missions can be replayed, along many bonus ones. There are a lot of extra battles, like tournaments and mission challanges, that make wallpapers be available for the desktop. It's a great game, both in quality and quantity, but it's also a bad port. I won't complain about the graphics, but some texture models could have used an improvement. 9.3 is the score for the game and I(along many fans) look forward for the next game and every naruto game that comes after it(that's how much of a fan this game has made me)			"

NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full BurstI'm really amazed with how good this game is and it totally worth a shot, even if you are not watching Naruto Shippuden, the game itself it totally awesome and i am sure you will get a little bit curious about the Anime/Manga serie ( I'd recommend you to watch some episodes to get into the story of the game and make it more enjoyable) , the story mode start out after the battle against Pain (The Leader of The Akatsuki) following the anime/manga story untill the 4th great ninja war.As a Huge fan of Naruto i totally loved the whole game story and the challenges in the game, there is lots of interactives scenes where you gotta make some combos to get things done and some beautiful moments in the anime that will touch you also the Ultimate Decision that can make some battles even harder if you choose Legendary mode and a bit easy with Hero mode, one thing that might disappoint who watch the Anime/Manga is the final battle that looks a little bit out of concept of the Anime, But i guess that it was a way better to avoid spoillers (at least for me) but nothing to worry about, the whole game is absolutely fantastic.Alright let me talk about Pros and Cons :)Pros:  :)  Fantastic Graphics: There is a great visual aspect in the Battles and in the story mode, also very beautiful maps when you're walking through villages (I wish they were little bigger).Fighting System: Combat system easy to learn, easy combos, Ninja tools to give you a little help and it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED A CONTROLLER/JOYSTICK.Lots of Characters: Lots of Unlockables Characters, Customized characters and characters supporters only (I'd like to see even more characters than that btw)Lots of Unlockables: You can unlock Videos, Collectibles, Ninja Cards, Some Customizations Itens, Audios, Music and lots of other things.Achievements: That makes the challenge even more enjoyable and a way harder, totally worth spending some little time chasing after them.Cons:  :(  Multiplayer Mode: At least FOR ME wasn't a really good experience, lots of connection problems and instability that made me give up of multiplayer mode for a while :( Missions/Requests: Well, after I finished the game i've been completing request in the villages and it wasn't really hard as i thought but its still fine.Crashes: I can tell that over here crashed every time tried to close the game and sometimes in the middle of some battle.FPS: Well i don't know much about this but i've seen some players complaing about Fps, Feel free to take a look at the game's foruns to check it properly if you're worried about it.Video Options: I'd like to see more video settings to make it run more smooth and playable for everyone.I Totally Recommend NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst! ^^ "

												The hours I have clocked in explain everything.Here is my actual ♥♥♥♥ing review. The game highlights some parts that the show skimped out on and made it much more epic. But most of the important parts are under played and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off (Like where was the Madara verses 10,000 soliders?).The voice acting (English voices) is some how worse then it is in the show (execpt for Vic Mignogna and Troy Baker; best ♥♥♥♥ing voice actors)The Soundtrack is done well but I am pretty sure it is a copy paste from Ninja Storm 2.The combat is the axiom of the hole game so it is only thing that is aggrandized in each new installment.The person that thought a 30 fps cap lock was a good idea for this game can go commit Sudoku.The whole free roam element is mentally r e t a r d e d (thanks Steam for censoring a medical condition) when every thing is beyond painfully linear.The online is alright, but the poeple that have horrible internet seem to bail in free wins way to often (That is when it came out on the Xbox 360, but now it is more barren than than No Man's Sky)Was called a Nig*ger a few times online, which was a little bit off putting (Again, exclusively on the Xbox version)The Dynasty Warrior sections are painful and usless. The last boss battle was way to hard (which i actually liked in a sick, twisted way).Missing Characters in Critical Scenes. (like the last battle *coughcough*)""8/10.

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is perhaps the most extreme example yet of Namco Bandai's attempt to appeal to the converted and only to the converted. Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise.his may be a beat-'em-up, but the primary Ultimate Adventure mode features so little gameplay in comparison to cutscenes and dialogue-heavy exposition that you'd be forgiven for thinking you're sitting through a barely interactive (albeit combat-heavy) soap opera. It feels as though developer CyberConnect2's plan was to create a condensed edition of the anime in which fight scenes are playable, rather than create a game in its own right. This leads to an experience that features such haphazard and irregular pacing that your principal cause for intrigue rests in trying to work out just how long it's going to be before the game asks you to pick up the controller again--and even when you do, the core combat is a shallow, button mashing affair that requires little in the way of skill. While there's definite and worthwhile value in repackaging the events of a beloved series in a new format, there's also value in a game giving you something to do.There may be a lack of interaction in story mode, but that doesn't hold true for the package as a whole. Including all of the downloadable content released for the original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 3 release, the volume of content on offer is gargantuan. Chief among the additions is the extra Ultimate Adventure chapter, which sees Sasuke and Itachi Uchiha take on the nefarious Sage Kabuto, a segment that is so phenomenally difficult in comparison to the rest of the game that all previously learned tactics become essentially redundant. The same Sage Kabuto is unlockable as a playable character if you have the patience to jump through the numerous hoops to unlock him, and there are also some new costumes to swoon over.he biggest, but certainly not most interesting, piece of extra content comes in the form of supplementary challenge missions. One hundred of these have you beating an opponent in a fight while handicapped in some way--removing your ability to jump, for example, or setting a limit on the number of attacks at your disposal. While these missions do add some welcome variety to the combat, they primarily serve to highlight just how shallow the core mechanics are. Without these externally shoehorned twists on battle, fighting suffers from an overwhelming shallowness that sees you engage autopilot once the basics become second nature. Only during set-piece boss battles are you asked to do something out of the ordinary.To compound matters, the most members of the enormous character roster plays in the same way. You swap between characters regularly during Ultimate Adventure, but this is done predominantly to facilitate the narrative rather than to spice up gameplay through variety and diversity. Granted, significant and impressive visual flair is achieved by switching often between characters with attacks that are literally out of this world, but that aesthetic quality doesn't remain interesting long enough for the combat inadequacies to be forgiven. Clearly, this is not a game with the remotest desire to cement its place in the bastion of hardcore fighting game legacy, but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's so little meat to the gameplay that you're essentially feasting on elaborately painted bones.Similar problems exist with Ultimate Adventure's role-playing-game-lite elements, which allow you to roam around a number of different environments with a view to collecting and buying items to use in combat (health potions, strength buffs, and so on) and optionally talking to loitering non-player characters. At times, these moments provide a welcome break from the cutscene/fight/cutscene pattern, but more often than not, they feel designed to artificially lengthen the game and trick you into thinking you're playing something with genuine genre-blending aspirations.The closest comparison to this format is Asura's Wrath, another of CyberConnect2's offerings. However, where Asura's Wrath succeeds in this style of storytelling thanks to its short length and ferocious pace, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 suffers from attempting to cover far too much ground for the core mechanics to handle. If you do classify yourself as a Naruto aficionado, then simply having another medium through which to consume the narrative is potentially going to be enough to satisfy you. Without a doubt, everyone else should look elsewhere.			"

												Time for a long essay about this game because that's just how awesome this is.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is a game based on the manga/anime franchise Naruto (obviously). Since this is the 3rd game, it starts the story in the middle so if you haven't played the other games (I haven't) but you have read/watched the entire series, it's all good. This game just goes on the story from the part right before the Great Ninja War. If you are a Naruto fan, this is a guaranteed ""You'll like this"" game for you.The game is a 3D style fighting game and you go can either go through the story to fight the battles that happened in the manga in the game. The one thing I like about this is that everytime a battle starts, it starts on the normal difficultly, but if you are having trouble with that battle and lost over three times, the difficultly gets lowered. I really liked that, caused me not to get stuck on certain battles.The cutscenes are animated 3D models, and that is pretty amazing how they made them look beautiful with models, at the same level as RWBY, which is probably the best 3D animation(anime?) ever. The characters and voices were great (I think they used the same ones from the anime) and matched the story of Naruto overall.There is one section of the game where you can play as Naruto's pregant mom and that part really cracked me up. Another thing is that everytime you buy ramen from the ramen guy in town, all your health and chakra gets restored. THE RAMEN IS MAGIC!!!!This game is supposed to be on XBOX controllers but the PC version is also great, but has some problems. There are glitches in the game. Sometimes theres one battle that just causes the game to crash, or one specific move that will cause the game to crash. This is one of the reasons why I never actually completed the entire story within the game. One of the last battles during the Great Ninja War would keep crashing, so I gave up. (I already know what happens anyway)I suppose one of the things I didn't like was the spread of save points. Some save points would be placed 2 minutes of each other while others are 2 hours from each other. That was one of the cons of this game since I can't play games in a marathon and I don't think I am the only one.Overall, this game has its ups and downs but is a great game. It's also pretty long and hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading this long essay. ^-^			"

 I recommend you buy this game if you have a gamepad. What can I say about this game? Hm let us start with... The price.So I got this game for $12 only because of the sale. You guys need to save your money, wait for the sale. Note yourself that this game can drop as low as $12. Don't waste your money even though this game is cool. So about the graphics, the graphics is... Awesome. The scenery of Konoha Village is beautiful. Note that I play with full resolution (1920x1080) and Super-Sampling is 2x.So the storyline? It's amazing. You can feel the intense, you can feel like you are in Naruto's place.Highly recommend you guys to buy this game. If you are a Naruto fans, buy it. If you want to be a Naruto fans but you don't want to watch the Anime/Manga, buy it.			"

												The story mode itself is wonderful, the giant boss battles is fun, and in each battle they give you an option for Hero or Legend, giving some different fight scenarios which makes it fun to go back and redo the fight. In the Full Burst edition, they're supposed to have Directors Cut cutscenes in story, but it looks exactly like the same thing from the first version of Storm 3, on the compare videos, they actually look worse to me. Full Burst also gives the majority of all the DLC characters for free from the first Storm 3 game, except the Pre-order Goku outfit, and you can't get Hokage Naruto, however you get a new mission mode, which adds 100 missions to the game but... it's nothing worthwhile. Free Battle fights on the highest difficulty can actually be somewhat a challenge too, but some of the AI just spams to reinact online mode, even though the combos in this game is so easy to do, however you can make your own combos (sorta) in the game and do some heavy damage but doing that is can make the game harder. Online mode is so flawed that everyone just spams jutsus, and if they lose... they'll leave the match, and no, they don't get any penality for it. Most of the people you find online anyway, will probably have a poor connection anyway, making the game very hard to play. The online mode is pretty much only fun if you have friends who have this game too and you can get mods to make the game even better like... combo customization, unlock characters that shouldn't be playable, model swaps, and texture changes.I recommend this game to:- Those who want to play the great story mode- Looking for a simple combat system that is creative and can get complex- Who want to play online with friends- If you want to play with modsSome problems:- The Story mode at the end is not canon (It's not the true ending). - Free Battle is missing some characters that should be there. - Online mode is incredibly laggy.- There is no penality against people who disconnect or 'ragequit' before they lose.- The community is awful, everyone does the same thing, spamming jutsus and choosing overpowered support.Suggestions in the future for Naruto to CC2: - Stay canon obviously, why would they think that doing a fake ending was good? It'll only cause confusing in the next game.- Include every character that is fought in the story mode, now I'm not meaning giants from boss battles but... The Edo Kage, The 7  Swordsmen, Dark Naruto, Edo Sasori, Gin and Kin should all be in the game.- Also, put more customzation into the game, looking through the files of the game, I found that you could swap jutsus and ultimate jutsus without having to choose the certain character, just like in the older games of Naruto. If I want to play as Anbu Itachi and have Fireball, I should be able to, the jutsu shouldn't be locked to a certain outfit.			"

												I'll start by saying that my only real prior experience of this series comes from the first game which I played on PS3 and very much enjoyed. That said I can't comment on how true it remains to the story in the manga or anime or whatever. Yet, it delivers a stunning movie like experience that rivals that of games like Metal Gear Solid and the Yakuza series. The attention to graphical detail is top notch and I've encountered very very few graphical errors which is pretty impressive for a console port. Going back to the cinemographic experience, the game is locked at 30 FPS in order to maintain the feel of the anime and even so it plays really smooth.The gameplay itself is more reminiscent of a button mashy beat-em-up or more like one of the Dragon Ball Z fighting games than a true fighter. However, there is definitely a little bit of skill involved in managing your chakra and substitutions in on-line battles. Right now the on-line seems hit or miss. Some people can't connect to me at all, however with one person I played 10 matches without a single error and no major latency issues. Hopefully a patch will be deployed to fix the on-line issues. Single player vs cpu versus is available in addition to a local 2 player versus. The single player story mode starts off exciting, hits some slow points, then gets pretty good again and held my attention. Overall, as someone who is not a typical fan of the series I can highly reccomend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy something not typically found on PC. It is easily one of the best looking games I've played in a while.9/10			"

												Well, it's certainly a pretty fighting game. If you like anime, you'll love this stuff, it almost ís an interactive anime. Great over-the-top ""ultimate"" attacks with matching over-the-top visuals to show it off, yeah, the fighting scenes really look nice...The combat controls take some getting used to, but when you get the hang of it you could win a fight in seconds. Mainly it's a 3d fighter, so if you're used to the 2d fighting games you'll have to learn some new tricks... No ducking from high attacks, but sidestepping frontal ones, and other such differences.Apart from fighting solo, you can also fight with a team, and summon teammates to stand ine way a bit, or launch team attacks. Which makes a fight look pretty busy the moment all 6 characters jump around on the field.The game consists of a Story mode, Free fight mode and online mode.The story stays true to it's nature, which is nice, the only drawback I guess is that it's either full of spoilers if you really want to read/watch the manga/anime, or you end up skipping most of the cutscenes because you already know what's next.There's also a few boss battles that require QTE's. Oddly enough they kind of make sense with the motion, rather than throwing random button inputs in your face, but they do detract a little from the action scenes going on. Either way, don't worry about normal battles throwing a QTE in halfway.After completing the story there's a few extra quests to do and roam a bit around a few locations of the story.Free fight has a survival mode which is nice to test skills with. And also has a mission mode, setting a few extra fighting conditions like losing power, getting poisoned by enemy attacks etc. Ofcourse there's also the mandatory quick battle.Online Multiplayer seems to be a hit'n miss with lag, as with most of these fighting games... I guess getting a second controller and sticking to local multiplayer would be the best idea as long as internet can't catch up to these games. Or make sure you know who you're playing with and both have a decent connection to play this stuff.			"

												The Good:- Awesome realization of a fan-favorite anime/manga, with voice-acting in both English and original Japanese- LOTS of unlockables, including 80 characters and hundreds of music, audio, video clips and customizable features- Art is colorful and detailed and stands as a shining example of a game adapted from a manga/animeThe Bad:- *Very* cutscene heavy; familiarity with the series is basically a necessity in order to keep players invested in the lengthy story- Many forgettable level-specific mini games- Online play can be frustrating since some characters are very imbalancedNaruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is a solid manga/anime-inspired fighting game that does a great service to fans, but might have a bit of trouble drawing in newcomers. It's not really a stretch to say that this game expects its players to be familiar with its universe. Taking place fairly far along into the series' second major story arc, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 jumps right into the story. The game does a good job of introducing characters and events, but I wouldn't be surprised if some people new to the series were to get a little lost in all of the terms and introductions.The story mode is very custcene heavy. These cutscenes feel almost like they were extracted directly from the anime, which serves for a pretty cool and authentic experience. This is strengthened with the presence of the series' well-known music, which plays throughout the game's story and further immerses the player. However, similar to the anime, these cutscenes can be drawn-out at times, testing the patience of its audience. While there is always the option to skip these cutscenes, one should be aware that the game's story mode sometimes expects the player to be sitting for up to nearly ten minutes at a time, watching the story unfold like a movie, with little to no interaction.Visually, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is very colorful and exciting. The cel-shaded graphics do an excellent job of capturing the aesthetic of the anime, really helping to bring the ninja world to life. Throughout the cutscenes and in-game environments, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 blends animated graphics with detailed illustration, providing a seamless picture that looks like it was taken straight from the anime.Additionally, the animations of all the characters are very fluid and nice. General movement and specific fighting styles are all unique among characters and do an excellent job of giving each character personality. While the combat system itself is not remarkably deep, it still feels great to see and play as some of your favorite ninja, with most of the playable ninjas having their own unique style.One thing about Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 that fails to impress is the multitude of mini-games and forgettable mechanics that the game tries to implement and then quickly discards.The game does this multiple times with several different mechanics, introducing different mini-games that appear once in a level, never to make another appearance for the rest of the game. The fairly common introduction of insignificant mechanics lowered the game's overall quality for me, being a common but nonetheless painful mistake made by all sorts of games.However, outside of the story mode, these mechanics are not present and do not affect the fun of the game's actual versus modes.Aside from the story, there is also challenge missions which challenge the player to complete fights under certain conditions. Along with the multitude of unlockables, these challenge missions do a great job of adding to the game's replay value.EDIT: Since beating the game's story mode about a week ago, I've played more of the challenge missions and done some of the side quests that are left over after the main story. They're actually really enjoyable and give you more opportunities to interact with your fellow ninjas, which is pretty cool. There's also a lot to explore - it surprised me how many places you can go after you finish the story! It does a great job of adding to the game's playability after the story mode! :DThough Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 does nothing to revolutionize the fighting game genre, I highly recommend this game to fans of the series. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 stands as a solid fighting game in its own right, but the greatest appeal it has to offer is the way it brings the beloved Naruto universe to life.			"

												First of all I must stay I am a Naruto addicted so my recommendation may be biased xDThis will be a long analyses, but I am hoping useful for people interested in the game.Naruto is a 3D fighting game developed thinking mostly of the fans of the anime. A proof of this the extent of the cutscenes in the story mode (some of them go as long as half an hour - you are basically watching a tv show), which means that if you are not a fan you will probably not enjoy this game very much. It is also advisable to have a  gamepad  to play, since fighting style games are not really developed for keyboard and this one is no exception.You have 3 game modes available: Ultimate Adventure, Free battle and Online. Starting by the Ultimate Adventure, the story picks up after Pain destroyed Konohagakure and goes until the end of the Fourth ninja war (giving it an alternative ending to the manga). The main story takes about 10-12 hours to complete, of which probably 6-8 are cutscenes. After you finish the main story there is a load of side missions to do, and if you want to complete everything to 100% (S-rank every fight with bonus) it can take close to 30 hours. The art is fantastic, with little to no bugs in the free world map, and with very interesting side quests in my opinion. In here was where I learned the game mechanics which are pretty simple but still manage to make the game enjoyable.After you finish the Ultimate Adventure more than 100 characters will be at your disposable to use in Free Battles. In this section you can also do the 100 misssion battles with different challenges each, which should take you 10 more hours if you go for the 100% again.Lastly the Online. It is terrible in my short experience. Games crash a lot (I wasn't able to finish a single combat in 5 tries and have a 100mb connection), and there is also a significant delay between when you press a button and the action takes place. This could be a turn off for you if you are buying the game for the online, but for fans like me, the offline mode will keep you very happy.I saved the best for last: YOU CAN USE MODS IN THIS GAME!! It is awesome, you can add characters like Goku Naruto, change characters movesets and even add new stages, all developed by a fantastic community and just ready for you to download xDTL; DR:Pros:+Simple but addictive gameplay+Lenght (40 hours offline only)+Ammount of characters+MODSCons:-Extensive cutscenes-OnlineHope I have been helpful (:  "

There’s also a lot of freedom and missions to do after completing the main story, ensures long hours of gameplay. Highly recommended game! Especially if you are a fan of the show			"

												If you're getting this to fight people via the online multiplayer, do not buy it. Over half of the matches you will play will end in a ""transmission error"" because of the broken servers they use. The publishers also do not plan to fix it anytime soon. If you are buying it for the story and the characters then go for it, it is a fun game with a 7-10 hour single player story line with plenty more to do after you finished it. Also there are tons of playable characters and follows the anime (However if you are not up to the 4th great ninja war arc there will be spoilers). I DO NOT recommend this game because I bought it for the multiplayer and it barely works and if it does it is extremely laggy. If you plan on playing it for the story, yes it is fun, but save $40 and just watch the anime. The only thing going for it is its fun gameplay (besides the often pointless and laggy ""free roam"") and the vast amount of characters you can choose from.			"

NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst ReviewAnime game done right, PC port done wrong.PC portWell, since i'm a toaster user, i can't really tell if it is my PC's fault or game's. Even unparking CPU method couldn't stop occasional slowdowns from appearing. As for controller support, it didn't work with my PS2 ripoff controller until i downloaded Xinput. StoryNot gonna lie, i have skipped most of the cutscenes because i plan on watching NS, so i can't tell much other than cutscenes and QTE's being really well animated. GraphicsHoly sh#t, the art style is great! As i have mentioned above, cutscenes and QTE's look simply amazing! There are so many details, colors and what-not, and I can easily say that this is the most cinematic fighting game i have ever played. However, when you're free roaming, there's not much going on, and it's just meh.GameplayIs it unbalanced? Yes. Does that means it's a bad game? Hell no!While not being on the same level as Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat or KOF, it still haves a learning curve. By time you will learn how to cancel your attacks into specials, activate support characters at the best moment, hitboxes, pretty much what every fighting game haves. There are items which can be used during battles, and also boosters which can increase your status for one match. There's a HUGE amount of playable characters, however, some of them are so unbalanced and broken, which means there's almost no point in playing ''Relatively balanced'' ones against them. As for the so called ''Free roaming'', it feels like it's there just to make the game seem longer. I mean come on, i'm playing as Naruto, can't i at least have a running button or something? There are side quests, but most of them are ''Find the item and give it to me'' or ''Hey you, fight me!''. It could have been so much better but, oh well.... There are also Challenge Missions and Tournaments, which are relatively interesting.Boss BattlesAh yes, the best part of the whole game. Bosses are very cinematic and engaging. Some of them have phases, others don't. Although i'm not a fan of sudden ''Completely different'' gameplay, it wasn't much of a problem here, because the mechanics aren't deep at all when you're playing as a giant character Stares at Choji and 9 Tails or going around and killing enemies. People often say that Kabuto boss battle is ridiculously hard to S rank, but i personally think that Last Battle is one of the cheapest, most frustrating bosses i have ever witnessed, well, until i learned about shouriken method... SoundtrackFits the emotions just right. Especially during Kakashi vs Zabuza fight. Dem Killer Bee rhymes yo!OverallA fun fighting game with a lot of replay value. It's pretty much anime game done right, not some Mario Party ripoff or most common DW spinoff (although PW3 is damn good). Only thing which would stop me from recommending this game to someone is PC port, but apparently there are some fixes (which didn't work for me). If you're hesitating to buy it or not, just wait for sale which is at 75% discount. Hey Bandai NAMCO, aka Anime games publisher , if there was a JoJo or Bleach game on Steam, that'd be great... 8/10			"

												A fantastic anime fan that will fullfill your Naruto obsessions. It is an exceptional fighting game with strong and weak points to boot. As a fighting game and anime fan I do find this a very exceptional gameThe story of Naruto if you don't know it please do look it up for it is long and still ongoing. The game will move on this time around to the ninja wars and will cover pretty much the events leading to it along with some material that isn't canon (Due to the fact the show is still going on and the game was made before it was finished so they had to find an area to stop). Also after beating the game there are also points in the game that will revisit the past Naruto.The music is Fantastic, the voice acting is right off the show, and the style this game is done in fits it completely. Very fun game to play if you are looking for something to kill time on, lasted me hours playing this at least more than 10+. Works best on a controller.The game features the fighting system that was used in the recent Dragonball games. You have dash away, power moves button, item usage, and attack, charge up etc and basic buttons and that you can learn. If you master them they can be pulled off in very advance ways. Though some of the characters are overpower nevertheless you'll have a ton of variety to choose from, play single player but ALSO INCLUDES TAG TEAMS AND MORE GAME + Less dlc! WOOT!+Voice acting is well done, You have the options of playing Japanese/English.+Many characters to choose from the series and also TAG TEAM INCLUDED!+ Epical Music scores+ Some fights are really epic and flashy with Qtes+Hours of cutscenes and can be bypassed+Overall Fun game to play+Controller support+- Argueably some characters seems a bit more overpowered than the others in fact they are and this is hugely debated right now.- Online is ok but isn't stable if you play against those in other regions, lag can really ruin games- Some of the parts of the games were completely unecessary, it acted like it was going free roam or you can explore a bit but its very limited and the hack and slash wtf?.-The non canon part ruined it lol			"

												This is a good game which suffers from being a weak port.Before I talk about what I liked about this game, here are some issues I had with it...- The game crashes for me on every other exit.- The loading screens are annoyingly long. This was especially annoying while trying to 100% the challenge missions.- Not enough graphic options.- The game seems to use more resources when running on window mode. I had no framerate issues while running the game on fullscreen.- Cutscenes. Too many damned cutscenes! The original cutscenes animated for the game were good but a good chunk of it is reused from the anime. It actually feels like the cutscenes were longer than the campaign itself.Despite all that, the game left a good impression on me.- The battle system is simple and easy to learn. The set of battle tips found in the start menu did a good job of explaining various mechanics. I think that a proper tutorial such as a practice fight would have been a lot better though.- The game cutscenes (not the reused anime cutscenes) were done really well.- The challenge missions were a good challenge. Some of them ranged from really easy to moderately hard.- Large cast of playable characters. I wish it were larger though.- Flashy moves!The game was decent. It has problems that are common among ports but the production quality redeems it to a certain extent.7/10			"

												This review was voted Not Recommended due to poor PC conditions, not that it's a bad game. Continue reading for further explanation.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst for the PC is a poorly optimized port. Judging this game on PC alone simply goes by how well your system is. The FPS is capped at 30, which is fine for me, yet high end systems still have difficulties hitting this cap. In addition, the game suffers from serious slow down at certain moments. While this is ignorable in moves that bring up cutscenes like Ultimate Jutsus, when they're on the field due to intense gameplay it really kills pace as frames slow down and inputs are delayed.The story mode is alright. Free roaming doesn't really hold as much of a point in this game than it felt in Ninja Storm 2 (I skipped Generations so I cannot compare to that) there feels to always be something right to another which is understandable due to the approaching and commencing Fourth Great Ninja War, there is still a huge amass of repetitive side quests, a lot of them looking like things that won't lead to fights, and then lead to fights because its a fighting game. While Super Hard difficult CPU are alright, they tend to use Instant Awakening litterally until the points where they are forced out of it due to low Chakra or verge of death in some characters cases. This can make some fights really easy if they have jutsus that replace their supports if you end up landing a hit and able to predict their subs and counter, as they will have no outside help and will continously lose chakra.Story mode CPU while getting more difficult also tend to gain bonus stats to confront your ability to use food to boost your stats pre-battle for the whole battle, but becomes tedious and unfun as you're constantly breaking from the action to restock your ninja tools, which I flat out skipped aside from Paper Bombs and Healing items which I was reluctant to use due to having to manually restock them even if you have them stocked. The food items that heal you and give you bonus stats are still necessary if you're going into battles with lower health but also become tedious when you're full health having to navigate and wait on the menus to use one for the stat benefits, which almost feels necessary torwards the end of the game and in post game content when opponents can have +70 - +80 in one stat, which if that stat is Attack, a jutsu can end up doing around a third of your health which is about the amount a Ultimate Jutsu does.(No Spoilers) The ending of the game was also a great disappointment as fights have altered endings from Manga and Anime counterparts that drop all action immediately to just try and make sense of the game ending where it did and giving a bad transition into letting you free roam again to do the countless requests and Ninja Time Line, the rewards gained are for the most part not worth it. The benefit of some items are absolutely none as they sit as key items in your inventory that don't end up doing anything other than be collectables, while the majority of prizes are Ryo and ninja tools which while Ryo can be used to buy asthetic cards and titles for the Online mode, you only need to have around one run of the story to get enough Ryo to buy most if not all of the cards you can want. Ninja tool item rewards are lackluster as they are one time use and only useable in story mode, while thankfully, but serve little of a point as it seems the reward of one request is pointless money and tools to replace the ones you used if any. There are, however, some fights in the Story mode with bonus missions, while all story mode fights have bonus missions it becomes more clear when looking at the time line that the rewards are different, getting Great Ninja Timeline scrolls for the timeline missions they have and beating those, result in gaining cards and titles which can be nice as they are normally relating to the fights which tend to be big ones like Naruto against Sasuke in the Final Valley, Sasuke vs Itachi in the Uchiha Hideout, Naruto and Pains fight in Konoha/Hidden Leaf.While the game does have its balance issues, I enjoy playing online. Although fights rely on the system and connection of both players to be fun as you sync with your opponent in frames so the slower of the two sets the frame rate for the game, while connections can still display ""Transmitting..."" connections in fight, which can range from sparce to every second or two, and even result from minor to drastic input delay. If you're looking for online play it may be better to pick this up on console where everyone has the same system and only worry about connection issues, while you may have a high powered computer to play the game 30 FPS easy, and internet to match, won't insure your opponents from having the same setup and will cause frusterating gameplay issues.The game itself I feel is great. It's issues lie in its balance of certain characters, while there are a lot of characters and most of them sit in the same reigon of difficulty and reward, some even being lower in terms of reward, there is unarguably a higher tier of characters that have less difficulty for higher reward due to their high responsive movsets and great hitboxes allowing them to strike opponents straight out of subsitution or even hit opponents who substitute due to back hits and quite possibily attacks that make opponents sub in the same place which they aren't able to guard before hitting the ground allowing them to get locked again unless subbing multiple times to avoid taking full combo damage which can also be counterd by dash canceling to continue combos. Adding on the Guard Support, while not entirely broken, is nearly a must have on any team that isn't single support as its presence cuts momentum for someone who's ahead trying to keep the offensive, and for cutting the momentum of players in a loser position trying to capitalize on certain things like trying to cover great distance to an enemy who's just lost all their subs, but the guard support can end up blacking any dash as long as the opponent keeps his distance and making the opponent try and use dashes and counter them when they hit the guard support. The down side to this is when a Guard Support is deployed either as the manual jutsu support or doing its guard, if its on the field it won't guard if its on the field. If you strike a guard support with your dash it will be knocked on the ground giving about a 1 dash window where you can try and close distance and make contact before showing up again, but this is again, up to the enemy if he tries to delay you with jutsu, supports, chakra projectiles or even back dash. This is going to be fixed in Naruto Shippuden Ninja Storm Revolution where suppor types are taken and revamped into battle types, and that supports can be damaged and removed permadently from any source of damage be it even projectile tosses or dashes.Overall, as a PC Port, I've seen more than enough issues that cause the game to be unfun. The game is good but by extension of massive slow down, hard to reach but low FPS cap, and possibility of transmission screens and input delay fights online I'd have to give it overall a 6/10. If Cyber Connect 2 somehow ports this better to fit on more systems to better improve medium and lower end systems FPS it would be the difference between playable and unplayable. The game is over priced with a sequel on the horizon promising to be made more competitve and we can only hope that CC2 will end up making a better port as it will come to PC as well.If you're looking to get Storm 3 on PC I would suggest waiting until Revolution comes out, and if it's in the same state or better in terms of optimization for regular game and online servers then pick it up as they will probably be a $10 difference at most, unless this game is on sale.

												Pretty good naruto game and the story is really well told even better than the anime without all those horrible fillers and arcs. Combat is improved but i would like to see more of a all around character than having lets say naruto in different modes like sage mode regular etc. Also alot of the side quest are boring and pointless and too much filler grinding side activities like the bandai store that sells cards which are pointless to buy. I also Hate the quick travel which should be in the map  instead of finding an npc in every village which is a pain. its a good 7/10.			"

Very fun game.I played a lot in local battle, and it still isn't boring. There is also a storymode (that I still have to play) and a very nice multiplayer with your own customized profile card. This game is well-balanced, since I could win with Zabuza from the Hokages and the Sannins easily. Also very fun to play this with friends or random online people. The hours I played is mostly the hours from local and online battle. It still didn't get boring.Art-style/GraphicsIt looks like your very own trusted Naruto. The graphics are pretty neat since it still has the anime style in it and the characters don't look very different from the original anime.I hope this helped, and if you have any questions, just ask and I'll answer it as fast as possible! Update after playing 150+ hours  Combat System The combat system of this game allows a lot of freedom. You can walk around the battlefield freely while fighting the opponent. There is also a substitution system in this game, which lets you transport most of the time behind the enemy, however there is a limit to doing that which is 4. After that, it recharges after an amount of time. Furthermore if you ever get beat down, you can use your awakening to try to take the lead again. Some characters have the ability to awaken whenever you want (at the cost of your *chakra) and other characters get the ability to awaken when a certain amount of health is left. The 2nd awakening is mostly more powerful too.*Chakra = it's a system where chakra stands for the energy your character has left. You can charge your chakra whenever you want in the battle and use it for quick dashes, ninjutsu** and your ultimate jutsu***.**Ninjutsu = if you want to deal more damage than just hitting the opponent, all characters have a special kind of attack to offer, called ninjutsu. For example, some characters like 'Itachi' can shoot a fireball.***Ultimate Jutsu = You are able to do the ultimate jutsu when your chakra fills up to 75% - 80% of your chakra bar. If you hit the opponent with your ultimate jutsu, the opponent will have a big part of his health bar reduced.			"

												STORY:To those that have watched the anime, the game starts off after Naruto defeats Pain and ends off with a fight with Tobi and the rest of the tailed beast, but his true identity was not yet revealed. Should you watch the anime first before playing the game? Ideally, yes. The Naruto STORM franchise basically caters to fans of Naruto in cases where one can simply skip one of the first few games and jump right to the latest STORM series and still be immersed in the story. This is especially so for us steam players, where only STORM 3 and 4 are available, but not the earlier STORM series. GAMEPLAY:Gameplay is very smooth and I personally feel that the fights are very fluid. Each character has their own unique jutsu (spells), thus making it more interesting to play each of the many playable characters to witness it, along with a short unique scene if you defeat your opponent with your ultimate jutsu. Not to mention that there are different combos that each character can use. Would definitely suck if there is only 1 attacking combo :(After you have completed the story mode, there is a free roam gameplay where you can roam to different villages and complete missions for achievements. However, one flaw of the free roam gameplay is that there isn’t a menu that lists the available missions. Only a few missions are available on the get go and the rest will only activate after you have completed a particular mission or fulfilled a certain criteria. I would find myself constantly referring to guides to figure out what and where are the available missions I can do so that I would avoid wasting my time running around aimlessly. It would also be nice if the free roam gameplay is a little bit more interactive, like being able to climb up walls with chakra, jump across huge gaps, and maybe beat up some random shinobis whenever I felt like it. This could be felt mostly during the story mode, where free roam gameplays simply just felt like filler to extend the overall gameplay time since all you can do is just run to your next destination. Well, I guess that it isn't Naruto anymore if there aren’t any fillers :pAnyway, I'm sure that most of the people here are more concerned about the 30fps cap. In my opinion, I felt that there is no need to have the cap raised as it has the same native fps as the anime. With this configuration, it felt familiar to those that have watched the anime. Furthermore, the fps of the game does not dip for me, giving a very stable fps of 27-30. In the beginning, I too was concerned about the 30fps cap. I mean, most games that I've played have fps above 60, but I eventually got used to it and felt that it wasn't really much of an issue that would stop me from enjoying the game.However, at certain instances, the animation videos doesn't sync with the audio. It isn't really much of an issue since it only happens once or twice, but would definitely be nice if it is fixed. GRAPHICS:The graphical quality and art of the game is beautiful in my opinion. During the free roam gameplay, you are able to explore some of the villages like the Sand village. In between each village, you can witness the several breath taking landscapes unique to each of the villages. There are cases where I would simply just stare at the background of the game for several minutes :pEven though I'm using a NVIDIA NVS 5200M, which is a business oriented graphic card, I am still able to play the game with a stable fps. This would be good news to those that are not using a gaming laptop. ACHIEVEMENTS:Achievements are relatively easy to get since you can simply replay a particular fight to get an S rank by going to the menu. Some fights may be challenging, but looking up guides will definitely make you feel otherwise. The only tedious part of the achievement process is the one where you have to complete 50 mission battles. Other than that, getting all the achievements isn’t that hard.  PRICE:Is the game worth getting at full price? Yes. In my opinion, spending around $39.90 to entertain myself for more than 30 hours sounds pretty good to me.  However, if you’re willing to wait and not in a rush to play the game, I would recommend to just wait for an offer since the game usually goes on a discount of 75% every few months or maybe more in the future.

OVERALL VERDICTSimply put, a solid fighting game with beautiful anime inspired graphics and animation. The Boss battles are epic. All characters have their unique moveset and it is purely inspired by their traits and abilities in the anime and manga. Even if you aren't a Naruto fan or have never watched Naruto Shippuden anime, I'd still recommend you get this game but not from the steam store directly unless there is massive drop in the price or some sale.STORYIt begins the story mode in hidden leaf after Sasuke attacks Bee and there's an all kage summit scheduled to take place to discuss his actions with Danzo being the Sixth Hokage candidate, and ends/leaves the story mode in the middle of the war. It is continued further in Ninja Storm 4 and not Ninja Storm Revolution.AUDIO & OSTVoices are available in english and japanese (as expected). I prefer japanese voices for this game (and anime) mainly because it expresses certain emotions a lot better than english voices. Furthermore, I believe there is a lot of inconsistency in the english character voices when you compare them with their japanese counterparts. However, the subtitles expand to various languages.Now if we talk about OST, I think it's befitting for the most part even though it's not been ripped off from the anime. The developers composed their own music for the game or rather I should say for the series. I suppose the stage tracks have been carried forward from the previous installment of the series, i.e Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 (I haven't played the first one so I don't know whether they recycled anything from that one), and there are some new tracks for new stages, moments, scenes and so on.GRAPHICS OPTIONSWell, there's nothing here of significant importance except the Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing. When enabled, super sampling eliminates majority of the jaggies from the characters while also making the game look overall great and appealing to the eye especially when viewing at closer angles. Other usual options include Resolution, Windowed/Fullscreen modes, Aspect Ratio, and VSYNC. Also, on a side note, none of the graphics settings can be modifed while being ingame. You need to change them in the launcher itself before running the game.XBOX CONTROLLER IS A MUST!An Xbox controller is a must. Don't even think of playing this game using a keyboard.ONLINE GAMEPLAYI was unable to find any online match session at this point in time, maybe because this is a 2013 game and many people have stopped playing it? You can organise matches with your friends though. Since I have been unable to find a session, I can't comment on the online gameplay lag or how the network packet transition goes during the match. If I ever get a chance to play an online match I will surely update this section of my review.~Update~ So finally at last I found an online match, however the match was very very laggy. I was constantly spammed by a dialogue box saying ""Transmitting"" which ruined the whole experience for me. And surprisingly, this was so bad despite me having a 50mbps connection. So clearly, something's definitely wrong with the way this game ""transmits"" PvP data online.30 FPS LOCK. BUT NO LAG OR CHOPPINESS RELATED ISSUESFPS is locked at 30 and there's no way to unlock it. Even if you manage to do so, it would break the game because from what I've heard all the gameplay mechanics including sound were built for 30fps only. But there is nothing to worry about, the controller feels really responsive throughout the game.PRICINGI'm so disappointed with the pricing of this game. At the time of writing this review, i.e November 18th, this game is priced at around $30 here for India as well as the U.S, and around €30 for the EU region. Okay I know this game has lots of content apart from the regular story mode but it's still not worth the money it demands because of the simple fact that this a four year old game now. Two more installments in the series have come after this. And yeah as you may have probably guessed, I didn't get this one from the steam store directly.P.S. This game was lagging and stuttering like crazy on windows 7 but now it's all gone on windows 10. Some people told me that this was related to CPU cores being parked by windows 7. So if you have any lag issues maybe try unparking the CPU cores and see if it helps.If you find my review helpful, please hit the thumbs up button. Thanks! "

												Definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into Narutoverse. Great game with great storyline adoption from the manga. One can claim that a lot of these animations are even better than the anime itself! It also have a very complete storyline to play with. Even with 16 hours in, there are still missions that I've yet to complete.			"

												Naruto fans, grab this game whenever its on sale. I will tell you why:+Story mode is not too long but its quality makes up for it+There are lots of characters to choose from and their moveset stays true to what you have seen in manga/anime +Graphics look really good+Gameplay is both simple and funIt has some flaws though:-Multiplayer is laggy and empty-Some characters are only usable as supports-Can get boring quickly "

												How can they sell this game without having set some pc controls. This kind of reminds me of dark souls , all the commands are xbox commands too, so when those quick actions come at you, you get a bitter taste in your mouth when you miss one simply because there are no default controls.  I mean otherwise, it is a good game. I don't like the way your keep the health from the health you had from the previous fight, seems to me like a way to make people who suck at the game feel better about themselves when they win against weaker ai opponents. I notice that in those matches they barely come at you unless you come up to them. It's clearly noticable. When there are single fights, no back to back fights, the opponent can play normally. There should be a difficulty setting in that case. Maybe it's just me but I just think it's a bit sad that that's the way they chose to make the fights more challenging(which they aren't).			"

												I'd be lying if I said I'd seen more than one episode of Naruto, and I'd be lying again if I said that I thoroughly enjoyed what I have seen of it. That being said, I recommend this game, albiet only circumstantially. I'll elaborate on what I mean by that.Whether or not one considers his or herself an ""anime fan"", it's hard not to find satisfaction in over-the-top ninja battles and explosive action in general. I personally enjoy this game because it thrusts you right in the middle of the ridiculous madness that is a Naruto battle, and it feels very fun. I know practically nothing about the series, and by purchasing this game, I didn't hope to expand my knowledge on it. I only play the story mode (which isn't anything special except for the boss battles) to gain access to all the characters to use in multiplayer battles. There isn't much depth to that, and that's significant in my personal enjoyment, because if we want to get metaphorical, I didn't buy it as a game. Rather, an explosive Japanese cartoon ninja action simulator. And at being that, it excels.If you want story, don't buy it. If you don't have friends to play with, don't buy it. If you don't have a controller, don't buy it.If you like fighting games on a large 3D plane, throwing fireballs at your friends or co-workers, or have ever dressed up like a ninja and run around your house yelling ""rasengan!"", this one's for you.

At the start gameplay throws you to the one of the most important battles in story. In the first minutes we are playing as Minato, struggling masked man that control Nine-tailed beast, a moment later we are fighting as third Hokage. Hiruzen Sarutobi is jumping on the flaming roofs dodging fire breath of Kyuubi. After long war we are saving the Village. Naruto SUNS 3 include many introspection about Naruto parents. Game is made for people who are following Naruto from years, because no one explains who the main hero is. In my opinion that's the best option because people who know something about this series don't need to listen what unites Naruto with Kurama or what is chakra, but novices will feel very lost. Without knowing the history and motivations of the characters their decisions may seem confusing and illogical action. Do not undermine a mini-encyclopedia which would include the most important events and introduced a deeper outline form of characters. Especially that the answers to many questions does not bring even end, because the story breaks off at some point, as if the writers thought: ""Okay, enough is enough. The rest we leave to the next part."" People may feel disappointed by the position too much pressure on the elements about fights, but knowing the policy of Namco Bandai opportunity to brand to satisfy the latter in the form of another views Naruto Shippuden will appear soon.

												A very satisfying game. Great game and story, but how did I last so long through a terrible port?Positives:+ Great story+ Great Free Battle+ Wide Character Roster+ The Combat system makes you want to come back for more+ Sakura is useful compared to the show and other games (LOL)+ It got an 80 from Metascore. Not bad!Cons:- 30 fps deadlock; terrible port- Online is full of foreign spammers (Didn't mean to be racist)- Online servers are just terrible - Namco just doesn't care about the game. No bug fixes in this game -_-- Collecting chakra fragments get repetitive- Free Roam is just extremely boring with a bad port. No fast travel too.Overall: 8/10 = If the port and online wasnt bad it would be 9.5/10, but I still recommend this game!			"

												If you are thinking about getting into the Naruto game series I think this is a good place to start.  It has tactical fighting requiring you to use tools, dodge, block, and time your attack patterns.  You success depends on making the right moves at the right time.  It's a great game and I think it's a worthy buy.  The cut scenes are extremely long and there is a long time between save points.  That's the only thing I have to say I don't care for.  But on the flip side you can skip all the cut scenes so no harm done.  Recommended highly!			"

Best decision ever. The game looks amazing and when you fight others online or even friends, it heats up. People Awaken and go ape over winning and when both players are Awakened things go crazy. Next thing you know someone slips and the victor is decided. The AI for NPC enemies is great, too. I've had the difficulty on ""hard"" and it's actually a challenge to get some hits in. So, buy it on sale! What are you waiting for?			"

Its ONE OF THE BEST NARUTO STORM GAME TO PICK UP FOR $7.50  and dont buy storm 4 if your new but buy this game as it captures what every naruto storm game needs, but as of right now, the online is kind of dead as u rarely see anyone playing online now, There is some people hosting endless,player,and ranked matches,so pick up this game right now for it amazing SALE!!!Also Feel Free To Add Me If You Want To Play Naruto Storm 3 Online With Me.

												NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is a good made Beat 'Em Up. In this review I will tell you somethin about the pro's and con's and at the end I will present my own opinion.+- (my fav. point) 3D battles- good storyline - nice and easy gameplay (with controller)- great animated characters- good synchronisation (japanese voice included)- fun with friends- many skins for the characters- diffrent gamemodes (online & singleplayer) like tournament, survival, ... + challenge mode- in free battles: the difficulty of the NPC's changeable (difficulty + handicap)-- almost every onlinegame has a bad connection or disconnections (pc only .-.)- hitboxes are sometimes not understandable- the story includes 60% cutscenes- some overpowered characters (e.g. spammer, crazy range characters, ...) - only 30 fpsAt the end I think: NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full  Burst is a awesome game, wich makes super fun with friends, because you have good connections, when they live near you. I hope that NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution is awesome like this game and I hope i could help you!Please rate this review :)Have a nice day!			"

Not recommended for those who didn't watch or read Naruto. Otherwise - a must have for any Naruto fan.[This was my first Naruto Storm game]The story mode: Very neat, it contains various minor and boss battles with beautifully made quick time events. The only downside may be a huge amount of cutscenes and unnecessary ""walk from A to B"" feature. The story covers everything from the end of Pain arc till Naruto breaks Tobi's mask.Adventure mode: A complete boredom. It had a solid potential as you take a look at Storm 1 but in this game it's just terrible. You can't sprint, you can't jump on buildings, you don't get fully voiced dialogues while interacting with other characters. All that you can do is travel through some places, break a crate, hit a mushroom (WTF?), receive a ridiculous amount of Ryo, finish a few filler-ish requests and complete the ninja timeline. That's it. I'd be willing to pay to see at least one person who enjoyed the adventure mode.Characters, freebattle and online: This is the main thing for the majority of people who bought the game. Fighting mechanics are fairly simple, yet hard to master. You won't win against anyone that has spent some time on this game with your pure mashing/spamming skills. There's also a reasonably decent amount of characters but some of them are outdated or broken (overpowered/glitchy).The online mode itself is O.K. These are the modes that you can find online: Player matches, Ranked, Tournament and Endless. The biggest downside of online experience is the community itself. It's a rarity to find a decent player since most of them will try to play in the cheapest way possible and later on they'll rage quit if you will have the lead. Oh, and don't forget about the lag! You do need a good connection, otherwise don't even bother playing online or just submit a refund. So I suggest to find people to play with and you're good to go.Visuals, options, technical stuff: Every Storm game had sick graphics to present that anime feeling, it's famous for spectacular boss battles and especially ultimate jutsus, no complaints here. However, the video settings are just poor as well as the keyboard support. It is playable in freebattle just fine (keyboard warrior here with 500+ hours) but It's complicated to do analog spins in story mode. Overall, the port is poorly made (fps drops here and there), long loading screens, lack of settings, multiple bugs, netcode and server issues, etc. But despite these cons. I'd still recommend this game since it's fun anyways. 8.5/10My Storm 4 reviewMy Storm Revolution review "

												Only for hardcore Naruto fans.PROS:+ great presentation+ controls(easy to learn, hard to master)+ MASSIVE character roster+ all characters feel unique+ ultimate abilitiesCONS:- the cutscenes are LONG(this could be a PRO if you're into the franchise)- the camerawork- difficulty balance is off- some characters are overpowered while others pathetically useless- if you know nothing about the manga/anime, the story will be confusingUNS 3 is really easy on the eyes.Plenty of characters to choose from, they suit multitude of playstyles.There's multiplayer, local vs mode, pretty long single player campaign with extra end-game content.Sounds great, no?However, once you start playing, little nuisances start chipping away at your patience.To the point that you may stop playing and give up on finishing the game entirely.Happened to me a couple of times during my gameplay(I'm looking at you, Deidara, YOU PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥.And, mark my words, the final battle is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke(the camerawork during that one added an insult to injury, it's almost as if the devs implemented a clunky camera on purpose).I'm all in for difficult games, but difficult as in ""challenging but fair"", not as in ""dificult because of factors beyond the player's control"".Ultimately(huehuehue), Ninja STORM 3 isn't that bad, but it isn't good either.I had some fun with experiencing the fights from the series in an interactive manner.But that's it.Sorry, but no.""Fool, ya fool!""

												Terrible connection errors. They said connection error will be fixed but there is no fix and they are not even working on it because of the new upcoming naruto game. People can leave when they lose in matches without penalty just by powering their modems down. Compared to PS3 version, this game has fps issues which makes this game worthless. In short words, this game is worthless. If i could have my money back, i would do it gladly.			"

												This is a great game. I have one problem with it though...why does it have music and voice volume settings, but not general sound volume settings? Like, I'll have the music and voices down really low, but while fighting, the attacks are SUPER loud. And there is no way to change that that I've been able to find. A bit of a design flaw if you ask me.And before you say ""Just turn down the volume on your computer"", the reason I'm complaining about this is because it makes it extremely difficult to talk to people while playing. Because during a fight, and even just scrolling through the game mode select screen, the game is all you can hear.			"

												What can I say? I'm a huge fan of the Naruto series. It's one of those rare animes that really reach deep into your core. This game is a beautiful tribute to the Naruto anime that takes you back to the reconstruction of the Leaf after the fight with Pain up to the fight with Tobi and the Tailed Beasts.What I love about this game:+ Beautiful graphics+ Very satisfying fighting mechanics+ Sticks to the Naruto story well and accurately+ Online/multiplayer batteling+ So many characters to choose to fight as+ You don't just fight as Naruto, you fight as other characters as well+ Cutscenes: there are a lot, and sometimes are long. If you can't stand long cutscenes you have the option to skip them (I did not)+ Some fights challenged youCons (for some people but not for me in some cases):- Some of the fights got waaayy too tough (which is fine) and they give you the option to heal but it lowers the rank you recieve. Some fights you just have to heal or you won't win. However, you won't get higher than a D.- Does sometimes get intense on my computer. If you can't stand fps drops make sure your specs are good enough to play (they didn't bug me too much but at times it was annoying)- 30 fps lock (again, not an issue for me)This game is a tad pricey but it's worth it. The main story will take aomewhere around ~18 hours. If you are a huge Naruto fan like I am, this game is a must have.			"

												Okay, so with Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution coming out in about a month, I guess I figured ""Why not make a review on the last Storm game?""Only, I don't want to go lengthy on this, because most Storm games will play like most Storm games.With a few new mechanics thrown in here, and there, and boom, you got your Storm game that's somewhat different than previous Storm game.For this one, I guess that would be the fact that this is the first Storm game that pushed pass the Shippuden Story line, and gave us a ton of DLC later on during the game's launch.So, what will I be rating this game on?Delivery.Did it deliver?Yes.Did it deliver MUCH?Not that much, but enough to hold you off until the next Storm game.With all of the characters, online mode, and DLC they packed in, I'd say Storm 3 would hold anybody off until Revolution came, and the DLC was fairly decent, amped graphics, more costumes, a new part of the Shippuden story added in, along with Sage Mode Kabuto added in.And now, WITH the DLC, this game is about $30.So, with Revolution coming out in about a month, would I say this game is worth buying?I'd say if you don't have this game, and you're really itching for some Storm to play, but have some extra money on hand, then buy it.It is fun, and will keep you busy, and if you're a fan of Naruto, or any fighting game for that matter, you'll enjoy it.If I were to rate the game itself?Mechanics: 9/10. (Some nicerStory: 5/10 (Rating how well it did in adapting from the Anime/Manga.)Replayability: 8.5/10 (Online mode, and story mode have some stuff going for it.)Music? 10/10 I thought it was done very well throughout each stage. I might be giving it too much credit, but it's definitely doing Naruto music justice.Variety? 8/10. Despite how much is put into the game, a story mode, an online mode, and a vs mode is really all it has. It wasn't jam packed with much, so the online mode, and even vs mode is really all you'll be coming back to the game for. Unless you're that psyched for the story mode in the game (Which, I'm sure not AS many were.)Overall rating for the game:8.5/10.I'd recommend picking it up if you had some extra cash at the moment.And definitely if you're a Naruto fan.

												I have been thinking about buying this game. But, I never really thought much out of a fighter game, even naruto-based game like this would be PC worthy. Well, I was wrong. It has sparked the Naruto fan inside me, even thought I was a big fan of it before. I loved this show then and kinda fell off after a while because they had a new artist change the entire look of naruto. But, I felt I should put it aside and play the game. The storyline is breathtaking, that might be a level of nerd that people aren't necessarily suppose to expose. But, it truly is one of the best storylines put into a game if you haven't watched the series. Please, if you want a single player game this is the way to go. ALSO, KEY INFORMATION: If you don't have a controller, then this game will be dramatically less fun if you play it. Put the time and effort into getting a controller. It's super simple and costs less than the game itself. Especially since Xbox and Playstation are moving to the new console controllers. Go to google shops and or just best buy and they can sell you one, honestly cheaper than the game. Lastly, I highly recommend this game to all my friends and gaming peers. It's well worth the time and money. However, the multiplayer I can not recommend because I don't play multiplayer on this game.			"

It's pretty fun to experiment with all those ninja moves and jutsus , which the characters offer you. Unfortunately the story is short and only contains a part of the Naruto Shippuden series and the online mode isn't very good, because it takes a long time to search for players and most of them are PROs, which beat you up or Ragequitters. :D My Opinion: If you are an ardent Naruto Fan, then buy it. :)			"

												Keyboard = BS? As my Dualshock 2 wasn't compatible with this game, keyboard was the only option I had and !""#¤% me was it hard to configure. Well the configuration per say was easy enough, but to actually bind all of the buttons needed for this game through a keyboard was a challenge in and upon itself. I believe the setup took apx 90min with some trial and error to get a grasp of the game mechanics and what worked or not. That being said... It is most definetely playable through a keyboard given the correct settings! Don't get me wrong, a controller is a much better choice mind you... Still, you can enjoy the experience and get used to playing through the keyboard as well!Game itself? I honestly didn't feel much for it at firsthand, battles feels like a mixture between the Gekkitou Ninja Taisen series on GC and Ultimate Ninja on PS2. Overall it works but I don't enjoy them nearly as much! The overworld imo doesn't fill any meaning other than being an annoying slowdown between the progress of the game per say. Speaking of which - The game feels more like a movie! Now I've played the DBZ Budokai series and they too had fights followed by cutscenes along with various unlockables, however the game definetely was more challenging and fun due to customization of capsule skills, true you can customize your items for this particular game but at the same time I never found myself using them EVEN ONCE!Overall it is almost exactly like watching the anime with the exception of worse graphics and certain altered scenes, again for the worse.. I really !""#¤% hated it in the beginning, but as time went on and what it really comes down to is that it's still very much Naruto at it's core and naturally you DO have an interest in the characters and the story...As for the gameplay, it is extremely unbalanced! it goes from certain battles being a joke to some being insane, granted you can still S rank them within 5 tries or so. There are however during certain battles and these are mainly during the bosses when you have special objectives to be filled if you wanna achieve the highest rank. Some of these being purely !""#¤%&/ LUCK BASED!!! For me this game goes to shiets at when you're supossed to rely on luck rather than skill..Bottom line is that you will most likely enjoy the game if you are a fan! But truth be told, there are better installments of the franchise and it's by far not a masterpiece by itself either. I think metacritic was very generous giving this game 80 or what they did.. I wouldn't give it more than 65 at the most!My advice is to pick it up on a sale at 9,99 AND NOT HIGHER, if you are to pick it up at some point. All I can say is don't expect greatness from it other than feeling a bit of nostalgia from the series, as the manga is to end within 8 weeks from typing this, it's fun in a sense to remember the past 15 years that has been Naruto. At the same time though, I can't wait till the anime is complete in order to re-watch the series and TRUELY feel nostalgic the correct way			"

												It's a must-buy for the Naruto series' fans.    Even though a quite a BIG amount of characters are the exactly same intact thing as in the previous games, there are new boss battles, new free battle and, generally, in-battle features, new chararacters, nice anime graphics and visuals...etc :)    On the other hand, the online mode is full of damned noobzz who only spam so as to win and have no fun,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and proceed to the next rank (also quit when it comes to losing). In addition, many fans (including me) have grown indignant of purchasing EVERY damn game of these damn series, but still had to pay in order to get some freaking alternative costumes...... -_- (such a let down....)    Finally, many really beloved to the fans characters (Kin, Gin, Edo Kages, 7 Ninja Swordsmen) are found in the story mode, but not in the free battle mode.... so.... that's another negative point...   Anyway, all in all, it's a truly pleasant game that anyone, fan or not, can savor. But in contrary to that, it could potentially end up being a bit monotonus and annoying (especially when playing online). So, give it a second thought before spending your precious 40 bucks carelessly ;)			"

												NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is a good game ... but it should have been way better with- no duplicated chars 3 naruto , 3 Sasuke , 2 Gaara , 3 tobi , 2 itachi , 2 killer bee , 2 Choji and 7 support only chars ... so 17 chars slot wasted... a lot of war arc chars missing ex :-7 swordsmen of the Mist (edo and alive)-Sound 4 (edo and alive)(yes there is edo sound four check out ep 305-306 of shippuden)-Edo Kage (edo and alive)-Kin and Gin (edo and alive)-Pakura and Gari (edo and alive)and more...- Also the moveset are the same since storm 2... its time to change the moveset a little...- Some chars didnt get upgraded ex :-Tsunade Byakugo awakening-Orochimaru better ougi and awakening ( like the 8 headed snake he used against Itachi)- Konan new ougi (600 billion paper bombs used against Tobi)-Juugo curse mark stage 2 awakening-Gaara with Shukaku awakening and Naruto with Kyuubi awakening (part 1)-A lot of alternate ouftit are missing :-Madara Torn Armor with Hashirama's face-Edo Sasori , Edo Chiyo , Edo Kimimaro-Tsunade without godaime coat-Younger Raikage , Hanzo , Mifune-Hidan and Kakuzu full akatsuki cloack-Hashirama , Tobirama , Hiruzen Hokage cloack-Orochimaru Akatsuki cloack , Jonin ouftit , Kazekage cloack-Konan and Nagato Old akatsuki ouftit (before the red clouds)-Juugo , Suigetsu and Karin with Akatsuki cloack-Tobi torn clothe ( when he fight against konan)-Tobi spiral mask for masked man ( in road to ninja movie he use the chains too while bearing the spiral mask)-Kakashi childhood with scar and sharingan-War Tobi without mask-Hanzo alive-Deidara ouftit ( when he fought Sasuke and Itachi) and Iwagakure ouftit-All Konoha members with the white cloack (after the kage summit)the online is unplayable on pc... but even if its fixed it will suck because :- Overpowered chars are not nerfed : Nagato/Hidan/Kakuzu/Minato/Itachi/Hanzo/Mifune/Kisame/Neji/Lee/Gai - Support with invincible frames like Neji/Kimimaro/Akatsuchi/Tsuchikage and more- Some awakening are too Op like fuu/itachi/sasuke EMS/ Sasori and more...- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on how fast characters are i mean little sakura is faster than zabuza ... and karin is faster than hashirama really ?!- Deidara , Temari , Utakata should have taijutsu combo because people tend to spam the projectile and its annoying- Instant awakening is broken people tend to use it to reset the combo and make an infinite combo...- Fuma shuriken spam is annoying the stun effect should be removed like pain/asuma charged kunais before full burstI really hope Naruto Storm Revolution will be better with mmore balance between chars and TESTED before release...

												As a heavy fighting gamer, I was taken aback by the one button melee attacks at first, but that simply hides the surprising depth of the system of this game.The fighting flows extremely smoothly once you have a feel for the basics, combos are basic but with the substitution system and animation cancels, it's rare you land more than a handful of hits per string, leading to kind of back and force exchange of strikes based more on evasion than blocking.There is a bit of learning curve however, I would highly recommend playing at least 3 or 4 chapters of the story mode first before trying to play online matches.As far as the netplay goes, the netcode is a little hit or miss. When the connection is clean, the game runs without a hitch, but when the connection chugs you'll feel it in both delay and the occaisional ""Transmitting Data"" popup for a moment. The gameplay flow makes laggy matches far from unplayable as there really isn't any urgency with your inputs or strict timing, but it's still an inconvenience when things slow down.The single player story in this game shines bright, between the gorgeous graphics and the well written story (granted, it's yoinked from the show/manga, still a solid story), it's just a good experience. Also it's long. VERY. LONG. In a good way.Overall, I'd say this game is worth a pickup for both fighting gamers and fans of the series alike. Just don't try to fight players outside of your region online.			"

												Fun game for the people who like the anime and / or manga. It follows the series up to a certain point where it sadly cuts off rather unexpectedly. But other than that, it gives the feeling of actually being a part of the game. The biggest downside is that you pretty much need an Xbox360 controller to play it properly seeing it doesn't have a fixed control setting for keyboard and a mouse doesn't work. Other than that, I'd say it's well worth the money.			"

												I'd like to begin by saying that I am not a fan of Japanese cartoons, and so the plotline to Naruto Shippooden: Ninja Deluge 3 Full Burst Title Extension was completely lost on me. Nonetheless, the gameplay was top notch, with my regular X mashing resulting in lots of ranked wins, meaning the game represents my real skill.Note that this game is a little pricey as it is more expensive than $0.99, however, Skel bought it for me so we can forgive this.Overall I'd say the following:Animation: 7/10Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10Japan: 0/10.

												Highly recommended for fans of good story in games or simply fans of good anime.The fights are fun and exciting enough, and not difficult to master but the real gem is the story mode.Some events of the story have been re-written or re-ordered into meaningful progression for the game's story line, but relates the story of the 4th Great Ninja War in a concise manner compared to watching the anime which makes it more exciting when coupled with the fights (no boring fillers).The game itself made me interested in watching the anime surrounding this 4th Great Ninja War arc, and actually made it easier to get into the anime by skipping parts I already know from the game to just gather more background on the events.A spoiler here would be the game's ending is designed to culmulate events and end on an epic high note whereas the actual anime's story surrounding the ending is different and in fact continues much longer in the still ongoing anime.That's a good reason to go watch the rest of the anime to continue unraveling the story. (Note the manga is ahead and has in fact already ended.)			"

												I have way more hours in this game then what it shows on here, probably double maybe even triple of the time Steam has calculated, most of that was offline due to me being without internet for a couple of months. This game is extremely fun, even if you know nothing about Naruto or are not really into anime/manga in general, its still a fast paced fighting game with dozens upon dozens of characters to choose from each with their own unique fighting styles and flashy abilities. Only game I've played that I can compare this too is Dragon Ball Z and honestly I like this game more, theirs an endless amount of fun to be had and the only fault I have with this game is that if you don't have a controller you'll have to set up your keybindings yourself. I literaly had to Google search a good keyboard setup because the default keybindings suck.			"

												One of the best fighting games i have ever played period! First off if your a die hard fan of the anime or manga you will love this game. If not, you will still enjoy this game. The art style is so beautiful and story so rich & great. Even if the story doesn't follow much of the manga since the manga is still going on, you will still get the great parts of the Great Ninja War; that takes place. Most of the online parts are dead but I still enjoy playing with bots on expert and above. Plus the story is long and has a lot of reply value! So i highly recommend this game to new comes  to give it a shot, you wont be disappointed!			"

												The first Naruto game on Steam, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is a great addition to the saga. I've been a fan of the Ultimate Ninja games since they were on the PS2 (in fact, I have all the Ultimate Ninja games for the PS2), as they're excellent fighting games. However, this is my first game since Ultimate Ninja 5, as I could not afford the newer consoles. The combat system has changed since the old PS2 days, going from a traditional 2D fighting style to a more open 3D arena, and I'd say it's a great change (of course, I think this change occurred when the Ultimate Ninja Storm saga started).The combat system, in itself, it's quite simple at first sight, with physical attacks alongside the traditional jutsus from the anime, and ranged attacks using different ninja weapons like shurikens or kunais. The traditional Ultimate Jutsus remain here, and they're bigger and better. The animations are pretty good, and the art style closely resembles the anime itself.As for the story, it starts with a prologue set during the destruction of Konoha by the Kyuubi, and then jumps onto the Five Kage Summit, and ends during the Fourth Great Ninja War. The story mode features the already common open world featuring several landmarks of the ninja world, including some of the hidden villages. Besides the story itself, you can also take different special missions, including fighting some ""historical"" battles from the franchise (ie, battles that happened before the main story of the game).The game includes a large roster of characters, each with their own skills, straight from the anime. Among them are the Hokages, the Jinchuriki, and the Akatsuki. The game also allows you to select up to two extra characters to help you along during battles, which can create some very interesting and dynamic teams.If you're a Naruto fan, or fan of fighting games in general, then this will be a great addition to your library, I recommend it.

												*If you like Naruto-THEN GET THIS GAME*if you like fighting games- THEN GET THIS GAMENaruto is a great game with an awesome storyline ( well it just follows the manga); although the fighting challenges are extremely easy, it's fun to play as your favourite character as you move on through the naruto storyline. There are many character choices ( bascially all the significant characters in the naruto story line). One the features I really enjoyed is battling multiple enimies at once; although still very easy, it inroduced a fun and new aspect of the game. I personally have had no problems with multiplayer, and had a really fun time fighting other players. I barely suffer any lag, even when the opponents connection is low. Overall this game was a 10 out of 10 for me.			"

												If you ever watched the anime then you pretty much know what the story is going to be about (The Great War). But in my suggestion i liked this alot better than the anime. Even though there were alot of cutscenes and Quick Time Events (which i do love in this game.) The game had so much emotion in the game that will make u feel depressed or sad in some ways.The only flaw i would say in this game (If people have a xbox controller then your one lucky mofo) is that you have to setup your own keybindings for the game.Usually people who don't have or seen a xbox controller would be REALLY confused and there is no tutorial to exactly know what the controls are (unless you look at your setting controls or when u press start to see the buttom mechanics.) that will be fustrating also for alot of people. But after a 30+ i got used to the controls so well (Using Keyboard)and the movement is smooth and fluid, also it's fine with the keyboard(but i would recommend people to use the xbox controller if you do have a controller O.o). Other than that the game is pretty fun.Mostly the multiplayer is pretty much the main potentiol of the game and it's characters. The only problem i have witht he multiplayer is if the host is either lagging or has some horrible internet, it will infect u while your trying to fight the person in a 1v1 match.I would rate this game 9/10. Just bc i am a huge Naruto Fan and the game is fun even though i watched the anime/manga I am kinda glad they have this game on PC other than xbox or ps3.			"

												This is my first game of Naruto, I always wanted to try a Naruto game so i'm just writing what I experienced.A really great game had a wonderful time. What a great way to relive Naruto, the stuff I once memorized when I was a kid now got to shine like: all of the kages, villages, clans, the feuds even some hand signs (which I used to do when I was a kid in front of a mirror lol). And the gameplay is awesome too + the challenge missions with the reward system everything. I even got some wallpapers for my desktop a feature which I havent seen in any game before that I played. The free roam system feature + tournaments + random events + tons of missions and even some kind of a moral/friends system for your fellow ninja and a samurai you met in adventures with mail getting to choose the right question for more favor all great. Also my favourite character is sage mode naruto his ninjutsu never missed and always guaranteed a ring out. :D			"

												This game is amazing! If you have watched the anime then i suggest this game. Its just keeping you on the end of your toes one thing after another! But there is one minor detail that people dont like about this game, you need some sort of controller. If you do then i suggest buying this game on a sale (such as one now) because the game is really expensive, and the bundle is only $19-$60 its a great deal but i already had naruto revoulution (also an amazing game)			"

												**If you are a Naruto fan** who always wanted a good Naruto game on pc go for it, its totally worth it :D Story mode is really done nicely tho ending is sort of an alternative ending which is not canon, can't blame them for that since the time this was finished cannon story was still going without any sorts of ending. Some cut scenes are very long but animated and voiced superbly so its not a torture to watch 'em. Also in story mode its not just fight after a fight after the cut scene, instead you can explore,so some side missions,send letters(sms equivalent I guess lolz) to your friends & lot more. Even after finishing the main story mode there are so much to do if you are a perfectionist. Fighting mechanism is not complicated at all but its done really well considering this is an anime based game. To finish the story mode you don't need a controller, but its not easy with the keyboard until you get used to it. This edition have all the costume(apart from Goku costume for Naruto & hello kitty costume for Sakura,Goku costume is already ported by the community) & one story dlc included,complete edition.About the multiplayer mode, this is where things went to hell,at least at the release. At the release netcode was so bad that was impossible to finish a single match without game getting disconnected. But I guess CC2 patched most stuff out & it is more than playable now. But you will need a good connection with good ping to get everything working pretty well. Also beware in matches there will be guys who will spam long range technique characters like no tomorrow to increase their win rank, believe me I played this when it was first out on ps3 thanks to my cousin and it was much worst, most characters CC2 patched out to reduce the unfair advantages I guess so that's a plus.  As a pc port its not a superb port but for me its an okay port considering this was CC2 first PC release. This is more like a direct emulation on pc type of port. It don't have any advanced graphics settings(you can only set resolution,supersampling & vsync) to play with. Game will need at least a good pc to run it on 1080p I guess since game is not greatly optimized to the pc platform. Also there is a 30fps cap that is hard coded to the game engine but it is not that noticeable but might change your decision. Game keys use the xbox style X,Y,A,B method and before starting the game you can map the controls of the keyboard, inside the game it shows X,Y,A,B keys.   As final thoughts this is the best Naruto game out there right now and a year ago nobody even thought there will be a pc port and the best thing is next Naruto game will be released to ps3,xbox 360 & pc simultaneously. Its not a perfect port but its a very enjoyable game, I have 100+ hours on this & this is the only game I've ever pre-ordered. Also this title is not going on sale very much so if you want it now go for it dattebayo :DHope my two cents helped someone with their decision =)			"

												If you ever watched the anime then you pretty much know what the story is going to be about (The Great War). But in my suggestion i liked this alot better than the anime. Even though there were alot of cutscenes and Quick Time Events (which i do love in this game.) The game had so much emotion in the game that will make u feel depressed or sad in some ways.The only flaw i would say in this game (If people have a xbox controller then your one lucky mofo) is that you have to setup your own keybindings for the game.Usually people who don't have or seen a xbox controller would be REALLY confused and there is no tutorial to exactly know what the controls are (unless you look at your setting controls or when u press start to see the buttom mechanics.) that will be fustrating also for alot of people. But after a 30+ i got used to the controls so well (Using Keyboard)and the movement is smooth and fluid, also it's fine with the keyboard(but i would recommend people to use the xbox controller if you do have a controller O.o). Other than that the game is pretty fun.Mostly the multiplayer is pretty much the main potentiol of the game and it's characters. The only problem i have witht he multiplayer is if the host is either lagging or has some horrible internet, it will infect u while your trying to fight the person in a 1v1 match.I would rate this game 9/10. Just bc i am a huge Naruto Fan and the game is fun even though i watched the anime/manga I am kinda glad they have this game on PC other than xbox or ps3.			"

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is the update release of Ninja Storm 3 and it's a fighting game with some RPG elements that follows closely the story of the second part of the Naruto Shippuden manga series till its most recent chapters.The main beef of the game is its story mode: you can do some free roaming in the world of Naruto while taking part in the most important battles from the series, collect items and clear some side quests too. In story mode there are either normal battles or boss battles, with unusually strong opponents who need advanced strategies and some QTEs to be defeated. The RPG elements of Ninja Storm 3 comes into play regarding some ""ultimate decisions"" you can make in certain battles (which can change the way some encounters are played) and the items you can equip and use in battle (some of them being able to heal you, others to boast your stats, others to depower your opponent, ...). The game follows the series' main plot very closely, sometimes even expanding upon some specific events (and always for the better). The only downside of the story mode is the enemies AI, which leaves them wide open to exploits, making several battles rather easy (with the exception of later bosses).Ninja Storm 3 is a solid fighting game with some unique and interesting features: you can use a substitution technique in battle to escape an opponent's attack and get him easily (althought the technique works only with a set of charges that aren't always ready); you can summon a maximum of two supporting characters to either protect you, attack your enemy or pull of powerful combination moves; you can use ultimate awakening modes if low on health to gain the upper hand.Ninja Storm 3 features also a multiplayer battle mode and a free battle mode, which are made very entertaining by the high number of playable characters and combinations of them you can make.The Full Burst expansion comes with updated graphics, a challenge mode that requires you to beat a series of battles with specific conditions and a short new bonus story chapter, ""Brothers reunited"", which pits you against a new bonus boss, Sage Kabuto.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is both a great game for Naruto fans (who will surely appreciate its many details coming from the series proper) and an entertaining title for who is just looking for a fun fighting game			"

												The first Naruto game on Steam, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is a great addition to the saga. I've been a fan of the Ultimate Ninja games since they were on the PS2 (in fact, I have all the Ultimate Ninja games for the PS2), as they're excellent fighting games. However, this is my first game since Ultimate Ninja 5, as I could not afford the newer consoles. The combat system has changed since the old PS2 days, going from a traditional 2D fighting style to a more open 3D arena, and I'd say it's a great change (of course, I think this change occurred when the Ultimate Ninja Storm saga started).The combat system, in itself, it's quite simple at first sight, with physical attacks alongside the traditional jutsus from the anime, and ranged attacks using different ninja weapons like shurikens or kunais. The traditional Ultimate Jutsus remain here, and they're bigger and better. The animations are pretty good, and the art style closely resembles the anime itself.As for the story, it starts with a prologue set during the destruction of Konoha by the Kyuubi, and then jumps onto the Five Kage Summit, and ends during the Fourth Great Ninja War. The story mode features the already common open world featuring several landmarks of the ninja world, including some of the hidden villages. Besides the story itself, you can also take different special missions, including fighting some ""historical"" battles from the franchise (ie, battles that happened before the main story of the game).The game includes a large roster of characters, each with their own skills, straight from the anime. Among them are the Hokages, the Jinchuriki, and the Akatsuki. The game also allows you to select up to two extra characters to help you along during battles, which can create some very interesting and dynamic teams.If you're a Naruto fan, or fan of fighting games in general, then this will be a great addition to your library, I recommend it.

												I'd like to begin by saying that I am not a fan of Japanese cartoons, and so the plotline to Naruto Shippooden: Ninja Deluge 3 Full Burst Title Extension was completely lost on me. Nonetheless, the gameplay was top notch, with my regular X mashing resulting in lots of ranked wins, meaning the game represents my real skill.Note that this game is a little pricey as it is more expensive than $0.99, however, Skel bought it for me so we can forgive this.Overall I'd say the following:Animation: 7/10Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10Japan: 0/10.

The art style is so beautiful and story so rich & great. Even if the story doesn't follow much of the manga since the manga is still going on, you will still get the great parts of the Great Ninja War; that takes place. Most of the online parts are dead but I still enjoy playing with bots on expert and above. Plus the story is long and has a lot of reply value!

												As a Naruto fan, i've never expect Bandai to make a Naruto PC debut. Wonderfull game, 5 stars and completed the main story within 25 hours ^^. The game has good balance between battle cinematics which involves the players interaction and also allows players to make decisions in game.Battles are exciting and upon completing the main story line, it allows the players to go into ""free roam"" mode. From here, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Naruto world. Very good concept and only can be done by Bandai.Recomended to all my friends looking for a good story & fighting game. Even if you've never watched Naruto before, the game is pretty much the entire anime story. So you wont miss out or not understand whats happening. Now i'm looking forward to finish all the quest in the free roam mode and looking forward for more hours of fun.			"

												I have way more hours in this game then what it shows on here, probably double maybe even triple of the time Steam has calculated, most of that was offline due to me being without internet for a couple of months. This game is extremely fun, even if you know nothing about Naruto or are not really into anime/manga in general, its still a fast paced fighting game with dozens upon dozens of characters to choose from each with their own unique fighting styles and flashy abilities. Only game I've played that I can compare this too is Dragon Ball Z and honestly I like this game more, theirs an endless amount of fun to be had and the only fault I have with this game is that if you don't have a controller you'll have to set up your keybindings yourself. I literaly had to Google search a good keyboard setup because the default keybindings suck.			"

												Highly recommended for fans of good story in games or simply fans of good anime.The fights are fun and exciting enough, and not difficult to master but the real gem is the story mode.Some events of the story have been re-written or re-ordered into meaningful progression for the game's story line, but relates the story of the 4th Great Ninja War in a concise manner compared to watching the anime which makes it more exciting when coupled with the fights (no boring fillers).The game itself made me interested in watching the anime surrounding this 4th Great Ninja War arc, and actually made it easier to get into the anime by skipping parts I already know from the game to just gather more background on the events.A spoiler here would be the game's ending is designed to culmulate events and end on an epic high note whereas the actual anime's story surrounding the ending is different and in fact continues much longer in the still ongoing anime.That's a good reason to go watch the rest of the anime to continue unraveling the story. (Note the manga is ahead and has in fact already ended.)			"

												I'd like to begin by saying that I am not a fan of Japanese cartoons, and so the plotline to Naruto Shippooden: Ninja Deluge 3 Full Burst Title Extension was completely lost on me. Nonetheless, the gameplay was top notch, with my regular X mashing resulting in lots of ranked wins, meaning the game represents my real skill.Note that this game is a little pricey as it is more expensive than $0.99, however, Skel bought it for me so we can forgive this.Overall I'd say the following:Animation: 7/10Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 8/10Japan: 0/10.

												The story mode tells the story well, with some changes for the videogame counterpart, but it's too linear compared to the PS2 games and its god-tier world. The music are good and fighting is really good, though the camera can get a bit awkward at times. Haven't tried online. Overall, 7/10. A great game where the focus is 2P fights and online.			"

The ninjas are, as expected;- Naruto Sage Mode- Naruto Bijuu Mode- Rock Lee- Guy Sensei- Minato Uzumaki- Deidara- Pain- Sasuke  (Susanoo)			"

												I have way more hours in this game then what it shows on here, probably double maybe even triple of the time Steam has calculated, most of that was offline due to me being without internet for a couple of months. This game is extremely fun, even if you know nothing about Naruto or are not really into anime/manga in general, its still a fast paced fighting game with dozens upon dozens of characters to choose from each with their own unique fighting styles and flashy abilities. Only game I've played that I can compare this too is Dragon Ball Z and honestly I like this game more, theirs an endless amount of fun to be had and the only fault I have with this game is that if you don't have a controller you'll have to set up your keybindings yourself. I literaly had to Google search a good keyboard setup because the default keybindings suck.			"

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is the update release of Ninja Storm 3 and it's a fighting game with some RPG elements that follows closely the story of the second part of the Naruto Shippuden manga series till its most recent chapters.The main beef of the game is its story mode: you can do some free roaming in the world of Naruto while taking part in the most important battles from the series, collect items and clear some side quests too. In story mode there are either normal battles or boss battles, with unusually strong opponents who need advanced strategies and some QTEs to be defeated. The RPG elements of Ninja Storm 3 comes into play regarding some ""ultimate decisions"" you can make in certain battles (which can change the way some encounters are played) and the items you can equip and use in battle (some of them being able to heal you, others to boast your stats, others to depower your opponent, ...). The game follows the series' main plot very closely, sometimes even expanding upon some specific events (and always for the better). The only downside of the story mode is the enemies AI, which leaves them wide open to exploits, making several battles rather easy (with the exception of later bosses).Ninja Storm 3 is a solid fighting game with some unique and interesting features: you can use a substitution technique in battle to escape an opponent's attack and get him easily (althought the technique works only with a set of charges that aren't always ready); you can summon a maximum of two supporting characters to either protect you, attack your enemy or pull of powerful combination moves; you can use ultimate awakening modes if low on health to gain the upper hand.Ninja Storm 3 features also a multiplayer battle mode and a free battle mode, which are made very entertaining by the high number of playable characters and combinations of them you can make.The Full Burst expansion comes with updated graphics, a challenge mode that requires you to beat a series of battles with specific conditions and a short new bonus story chapter, ""Brothers reunited"", which pits you against a new bonus boss, Sage Kabuto.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is both a great game for Naruto fans (who will surely appreciate its many details coming from the series proper) and an entertaining title for who is just looking for a fun fighting game			"

												[No Spoilers]Did you like playing of the previous Ninja Storm games or perhaps the DBZ Budokai games? If your answer is yes then I have little doubt in my mind that you will love this game as it is all that you would come to expect from the Bandai family.To keep things to the point and spoiler free I will cover some of the Pros and Cons of the game on PC:+ The game is beautiful, the cell shaded graphics and stunning animation have been put together beautifully to make all that crazy-epic anime action come to life.+ For those of us who watch the anime or read the manga you will be happy to know that the game covers most of the story line with good accuracy [Please play it in Japanese, this is just my preference but the Japanese voice actors are the best!]. For obvious reasons the game deviates from the anime slightly towards the end to create a suitable conclusion to the in game story.+The combat system is easy to master and very fluid; this makes it relatively easy to play on a keyboard [xbox gamepad is better] and still have a lot of fun.+The main story mode allows you to explore the ninja world on foot which for naruto fans is an amazing experience; you get to see parts of the villages that you don't really get to in the anime.-A large portion of the game revolves around secondary events and requests that you get from all sorts of NPCs which is not bad as it adds a lot of extra hours to the game but running back and forth through the same areas can get tiresome. One of my biggest issues is the lack of effort put into the way you move through the world; you can run, jump and break stuff. It would have been amazing if you could actually jump on/off of trees or buildings, or at least dash.- The combat system is a little limited due to the simplicity in my oppinion and I personally would have liked to see a few mor button combinations to allow for more jitsus [special moves] than just Y+B or Y+Y+B.- Multiplayer is an option for PC but in my opinion nothing beats a console at this sort of multiplayer; not having the person in the room as you smash him/her into a mountain with a giant Rasengan is just not the same as seeing that person slumping in defeat right next to you :DTo conclude I would have to recommend this game especially right now as it is on special, it is a great addition to the Bandai fighting game family.

												The story is just like in the anme, word by word, action by action.I bet many people questioning if you can play and enjoy the game if you haven't watched the anime.so there are 2 sides for this answerfirst side: yes, you can, the story is exactly like in the anime, like I said word by word and action by action few minor changes there and there but nothing really special.second side: people who haven't watched the anime won't understand 70% of the situations, what I mean by that?I mean that you won't understand what happend before that lead to the current events and I think it's very important to know the previous events to enjoy the story telling.even if the story is exactly like in the anime, so basicly it's like playing the anime, but the story is in the ending state of the anime, the ninja war 4, so I recommend you to watch the anime if you want to enjoy the story as well and not only the fighting.overall Great game9/10 to music same soundtracks like in the anime, most of them atleast, they could change it a bit10/10 to graphics I call it ""anime graphcs style"" drawn and colorfull, I love this style.10/10 to animations, the animations are perfect, all the fighting scences are incredible and amazing, I really really enjoy watching them and following the key combiantions to succeed in the battle.8/10 to fighting and battles, the arenas feel a littel small compare to the vairty of your and your enemy attacks,and they could add more combination of justu and ninjastsu, I tought the game will have almost the same amount of attacks like in mortal kombat or injustice, it has less but I'm fine with it for now, overall I enjoy the battles, the early battles feel too easy and the ending battles feel too hard, but I guess it designed like that in purpossand for the online gameplay, i tried only 3 battles and all I can say is few things depending on this 3 battles.1) no lagging isuees, nor to me nor to my enemy' smees like the battle goes smooth and that's great.2) there are not many people playing the game and from the players only few playing online, and that's a bit sad, it's finding me a match fast enough but the issue is becasue of the low populated online it matches me against skillfull players and veterans, it's not a problem of the game, it's just I wish there would be more players playing online on this game, so I could match agasint begginers just like me, so i could practice a bit versus people and not AI.anyway I give 9/10 overall to the game, Buy it, when it goes on sale it will be -50% probably so it will cost 20$it's worth the money, I got only 15 hours for now on this game, But I I think this game can even get me to 300 hours fI I will have time [i'm in the army currently. playing on the weekends sometimes]			"

												Yet another enjoyable Naruto game.Story:The story starts with the Five Kage Summit and ends with Naruto vs. The Tailed Beasts/Sasuke and Itachi vs. Kabuto. All the events in the game have been covered in the anime already, so people who watch the anime will have no problem following the plot. People who are new to Naruto should probably read up on the events leading up to this game.Gameplay:I played Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (UNS 3) after having finished Revolution and Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (UNS 4), and if you want the best gameplay then going for the newer games (especially UNS 4) might be better. UNS 3 isn't a bad fighting game by any means, but if you don't really care about the story mode there isn't really any reason why you should get this game over the other ones.Another minor complaint I have about this game is that it did feel like there was a lot more running around in between missions in this game compared to the other ones. And running around wasting time is not fun.Graphics:The graphics are good. Very anime-ish, just like a Naruto game should be. Yes, the game is locked at 30 fps, so if that is a deal breaker for you then you should pass on this game.Music:Music taken straight out of the anime. Characters sounding just like they do in the anime. What more could you want?Overall:A good fighting game that any Naruto-fan will get a lot of enjoyment out of. However, if you want to play the (in my opinion) currently best Naruto game on Steam you should probably get UNS 4 first. After finishing that game, if you still want more story then this game is a good choice, while if you want a different fighting mode (orb collection) then you might want to get Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution instead. Or, you can do like me, and get them all. They are all good games.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Revolution ReviewNARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 Review			"

												If youre a fan of Naruto or shonen anime in general, this game couldnt be better. It has vibrant stylized graphics that jump straight out the screen, epic special attacks, fantastic gameplay that leaves you coming back for more. Oh yeah, and there are TONS of characters and stages to choose from. This is a fantastic game that im glad ended up on PC, however a few small setbacks keep it from joining the greatest hits collection. So lets go over the pros and cons real quick.Pros:> Fantastic Graphics & Presentation> Highly enjoyable story and characters> Engaging and addicting gameplay> A must if youre a fan of the showCons:> Best played on a controller, if you own one.> Frustrating connection issues during online play> Balance issuesAll in all though, i think if the game ever gets its online issues patched out, i think it has the potential to be even better with functional online play. But if online isnt a concern for you, this game is just fine on its own. 8/10			"

												Having watched Naruto a long, LONG time ago, and recently getting back into it, one of my friends bought this game for me, and I must say, I LOVE IT! The fights make you feel like your playing an interactive battle from the show, all the characters fighting style feels great for the character your playing as: Garra is heavy hitter and slow mover, Rock Lee is a fast mover, heavy combo hitter, Tenten is a long range attacker with her weapon summoning, so on and so forth.This is a very fun game for any naruto fan to enjoy, I would recommend it to any fan of the anime or manga			"

												Okay, For those who doesnt want a long and boring review i recommend u skip this 1Anyway Lets start this reviewThe Pros:Improved Graphics: They have upgraded the graphic since the last storm 3 which makes the game more ""realistic"" Voices And Sound: The soundtrack in this game has improved too since the storm 3 and made it much better and improved. Most of the soundtracks are from the anime but there still is some new ones which is really good. You can see that the voice actors in this game really did some work on the voices. If you played the game you know what i mean.The Story: Much like the anime it plays out in the Great Fourth Ninja War. From fighting and big demon fox too playing as konohamaru this game really have some amazing characters chooses. There are some quick time events which are real fun too. DLCs: There is no you get the full package when you buy this gameThe Cons:If you buy this game on pc your gonna have a bad time. There is no keyboard support for the game which makes it really hard to play it if you are on pc and dont know how to plug in an controller or dont have one. The fights in this game can sometimes be really glitchy and overall bad, there is still really nice fights but some are just naaah. Final Score:Graphics 4/5Sound 4/5Fighting: 3/5Story 3/5Total Score: 3,5/5Play this game if you really like naruto or want to try a new game. I dont recommend this game to people who doesnt read the manga or watch the anime. Sometimes it could be really confusing and some people could have a bad time with it  "

												This is a good game, but as for right now there is a bug with shikamaru's ultimate jutsu freezes the game.  Other then that everything (except for a little incedent agenst madera that i have not made it to yet, but heard of and heard you cant get around) else is in order.  I just hope they fix the glitch quickly so i can finish the game.  If anyone knows how to fix both glitches please let me know.			"

												Unless this game is on sale & you're a Naruto fan, this game isn't worth getting. The fighting isn't super unique or even well balanced. But it is a great game if you're a Naruto fan & want to see really good cut scenes! I wouldn't pay full price for this game, it is best to buy it when it is 75% off or more. The game has some issues running & freezes or stops responding some times. But over all nothing that breaks the game or makes it completely unplayable. These problems seem to only arise when you first try launching the game.			"

												A decent Ninja Storm game, covering a strong part of the Shippuden story.It's fun to experience the story again, the game gets mildy repetitive through fights being the only relativley immersive experience in the game. A controller is a must have in this game, it isn't well optimised for a keyboard-and-mouse user but through clever communitity keybinds, it is only just bareable. One part I particularly enjoyed was the battling friends aspect, where you are allowed to select any character of your choice and battle with your friends through steam.One of the best Naruto games for PC, I wouldn't pay full price for this however.7.3/10			"

												Very awesome, in fact my very first Naruto game ever. Plan on getting Storm 4 once I have fully beat and enjoyed this one, Storm 4 focuses more on the fight and finalizes the story mode of Naruto Shippuden's Manga though has less fancy story mode animations. Highly recommended for Naruto/Dragon Ball fans a like. Pro: EverythingCon: Requires tedious step of selecting Exit > Select > then a button then > Proper exit. Basically requires like 4 steps to properly exit the game, very unnecessarily tedious; no simple ""1 step yes or no, I want to exit out of the game"" step most likely due to the fact this game is a console port. Other Pro: Runs great on a Phenom II X4 840 3.2Ghz Quad/660 TI			"

												A fantastic fighter, especially if you are a fan of the manga or show and even if your not. ****Transmission Error's or not.**** Scroll to the comments section to for transmission error fix.-- Singleplayer --If you're someone like me who can't sit through 15 seasons of filler and slow paced talking scenes the game does a great job of filling you in on most of what's happened without eating up months of your free time. Even if you have been watching or reading though it also gives you the option of picking the ""Legend"" route on certain fights to experience things differently; a great alternative to experiencing the same thing you've seen before but still progressing. The cut scenes are fantastically done and the option for the Japanese vocal track is always nice as I for one will punch someone if I hear Naruto say ""Believe it!"" one more time. Of course you are still forced to play as certain characters for certain parts that aren't always fun. Some of the boss battles can also be down right cheap, the final one for instance but hey, you only have to do it once and that's a small price to pay for how much fun is packed in there.-- General --Now for me considering I haven't played an Ultimate Ninja game before this was a welcome change from the Clash of Ninja fighting games, the cinematic, epic feel of every battle and the sheer complexity of the mechanics was something I wasn't expecting from an Anime fighter. If your looking for a little one on one kick-assery this is a fantastic place to land your feet. It is a little sad that you can't play even a tag mode or something similar, the complete lack of co-operative fighting does seem like an oversight considering how entertaining it could be and considering it's something Clash of Ninja has had since the get-go.One more key thing to point out as well is the sheer amount of content here, holy crap the content. There is the massive Story Mode, the bonus Challenge Mode with 100 battles to complete, Survival Mode, Tournament Mode, the regular VS Mode and of course Online Mode. That's a a lot of things to clear. There is also an almost obsurd amount of collectables to unlock and purchase from Titles for your online Ninja Card to Ultimate Jutsu Demonstrations. The game contains 89 (correct me if I'm wrong) playable characters with only a few available as support only, as well as several characters having different costumes. Not counting same movelist, different costumes that seven versions of Sasuke to play as, rejoice Uchiha fans. It will take a while to unlock every character mind you but that can be done by either playing and earning money or clearing the entirety of the massive story mode. So if you don't like running through the sometimes tedious boss battles and the like, just hop into VS mode and beat the crap out of your friends. Which brings us to the biggest problem - I didn't say the game was perfect.-- Multiplayer --The game does a decent job of balancing the massive roster but at the end of the day, some characters are just down right overpowered and cheap. Which can be a problem unless you happen to have mastered the game and the other person hasn't. Roughly 60% of the matches you play online will either be against the ultimate form of Naruto, Minato or Itachi and there's a reason for that. Not that the cheap characters are unbeatable but unless you're also a high tier character prepare to have an annoyingly difficult fight; oh Itachi your crows will haunt my nightmares. Of course this being said it's not the end of the world by any means. If your fighting your friends or just playing for fun it probably won't bother you and overpowered characters is something you should be expecting going into a fighter with such a massive roster that isn't aiming to be a serious competition game. Virtua Fighter this is not.****-- Multiplayer Section 2 --**** Scroll to the comments section to for transmission error fix.Another key thing I have to draw attention to is something that has been completely ""broken"" about this game since launch: Transmission Error's. For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a disconnection error that occurs in most matches played online, example: I have played roughly 350 matches online, completing only 120 of them. While Namco-Bandai has assured us they are working on it, it has been present since launch and still isn't fixed. They have released a NA only patch for the game that, to it's credit did work somewhat, but instead of getting disconnected in some games we are presented with a slow down kind of lag and even then, sometimes are disconnected anyways. Assuming they do, at some point fix the issue the game will be downright fantastic but until then, the loyal fan base is left raging every match until you fight someone 30 times because it doesn't disconnect you for once.-- Final Thoughts --All in all it's not a perfect game and until they sort out the transmission errors in the online portion, it will be broken for those seeking to use it. However, it still retains a fighting experience that you simply can't get somewhere else. Trying to end an epic battle with an Ultimate Jutsu is so much fun and that terrible moment when you chakra dash right into someone elses costing you the match, leaving you yelling out curses; barely coming out of a match on top thanks to a well timed awakening and realizing you lost by 1/8th a heath bar to Rock Lee and you didn't land a hit on him. Moments like these make you forget about the shortcomings of the game.If your looking for a solid fighter pick it up and prepare to lose the next few weeks of your life, and bring some friends. If your looking for a competitive fighting experience, best to wait till the fix the online before investing. But either way, buy it at some point, it's worth the money.			"

												This game is really good. The fights are well done, the art is perfect. The gameplay is fluid, the controls are responsive as they should be (XBOX Controller). The story inside this game is really long and perfectly told to the user (a bit different from the anime/manga though). There is one downside in this game, the multiplayer feature. Until now i couldn't play it online against anyone without lag. Maybe the reason is because i live on Brazil and there isn't anyone here with this game but i don't know for sure.I'm a big of naruto and i'm not disappointed by this game. 5 stars.			"

												This is greatly Recommended to fans of Naruto but for those who are looking for an in-depth fighting mechanics this ""might"" not be for you.The game is fairly easy to figure out.Ofcourse lore is good coz it's ""NARUTO"" and this one has a bit of a different ending.Fair Selection of characters(there are also characters with costume).In ratings this is fair, a good amount of pvp, and finishing story mode and voila, you're done.

												For each 1hour of gameplay, 45minutes is used for cinematics and 15min for fighting. Between the fights there's so much talking you can easily cook a dinner and still get bored. So if you remember what happened in the anime just skip all cinematics and you'll be better off.Still, fighting and graphics are top-notch, not to mention the fact that this is practically the only proper anime based game on the PC. Would buy again.			"

												I really love this game, ive been playing naruto games since play station and absolutely love this game! the story is interesting (even after reading the managa and all 530+ episodes XD #nolive) but I did have some problems with the game, theres no control settings, youll have to set it up by yourself. i recomend searching for a youtube video to show you. The other problem was that during the campaing sometimes when Im fighting and use ultimate justsu the game would crash. for example when shikamaru had to fight hidan and a requirement was to kill him wit ultimate justsu, every time i used it the game would crash. but i gave up and the next day i played it didnt crash for some reason.  but besides those little problems the game is good so far.

												When i original saw the trailer for this game, i thought it was a very action/adventure/fighting packed game type, boy i was complete wrong.You can divide this game in 2 parts, the story side and the vs side.The story side obviously let you follow trough the story of the anime/manga, starting after the nagato/pain saga, returning from time to time to the 9 tails incident in the leaf 16 years before. However, this is the cool part and the sad one at the same moment. The game (if you can call it that way) has no adventure side, you follow the story in a cinematic/dialogue type, with little to no gameplay (the gameplay limits from going from 1 screen to another, and no more than 3, and this is from time to time), then, after a while, after watching a cinematic or reading the dialiogues, a confrontation between characters will happen, mostly the same fights that happened in the anime/manga. This is your gameplay, a small fight, then you go back to the cinematics/dialogues.The sad part is that you get so little gampleay that you feel ripped off your money, however, the fighting mechanics, as basic as some button mashing can be, are quite fun, specially if you have teammates with you, which help you in battle (support characters ala mvsc), from time to time you will find some quicktime events, not actually difficult, but they might take you by surprise, since there are not that many.  Yesterday, i was ""Playing"" chapter 4, i watched 40 minute cinematic after a 5  minute fight.The cool part is that if you have not watched that part of the story, you will catch up, and if you have, it doesnt matter, the game looks gorgeous, the art design is beautiful, the animation is very fluid, vivid colors, it is breath taking  watching the cinematics and the quick actions, i cant say the same about the english dub, but the original languaje is great.The soundtrack is allright, while the main theme of this game is a very quiet/slow song, though beautiful, it does not reflect what we are used to hear in the anime. The soundtrack is good, dont get me wrong, but it lacks the punch of songs such as rising the fighting spirit, the jiraiya theme or even the orochimaru theme, the soundtrack here does not stand out, but it does set the mood for the scene in turn. (<--- Scene, geez, im reviewing a game, never expected to say that)The controls are basic. hit, kunai, cover, kawamiri no jutsu, chakra charge, jump/dash and support buttons, not much to do there in matter of combos, just mash the b button several times and you will do a 10-12 hit combo, the cancel mechanic allows you to hit more times, but again, mashing the b button. The controller works, but its very simple.Graphics. As i mentioned before, i cannot complain about the graphics, since the game looks awesome, however, the native resolution (1280 x 720) did not managed to stress my old radeon 3870, when i tried to get more juice from the graphics, i increased them to 1440 x 900 (MAX). My card couldnt handle tomb raider at that resolution, in this game nothing changed, nothing at all, is as if i never changed the resolution in the first place.The controller. Although the controls work as intended, the problem is the support, i dont own a console nor a 360 controller, the game did not accepted my generic usb controller (first game that does that, never had an issue). So i had to play with my keyboard, which was very annoying to set up, allow me to explain.When you open the game, a menu appears, you can launch the game, customize your controls, change graphics/audio. The keyboard binding is blank by default, the first time i logged in, i couldnt do anything at all, no up/down, no back, no exit, no controller detected, i had to alt+f4.Then, i rebinded some keys (coudlnt tell what they do) and launch the game, after the first fight, i figured out some actions, i wanted to rebind to my liking now that i knew what was going on, but i couldnt do it with the rebinding options ingame, since some of the keys i was planning to use were not binded first in the pre launch menu, i had to close game to rebind (again)Then, after i was playing for a while, the first sequence appeared, i binded a,s,z,x,space,ctrl,q,w,e,r, the 4 arrows, i know what each key do, i can manage without a problem, but the quick action was requesting to press the x -yy-b-a. i do not own a 360 controller, i dont know what is the action of those buttons, why they cant add a quick action with your current binding? why does it have to be a 360 controller layout despite you are playing with a keyboard? It is not hard to change, i have seen this type of notification changes in some games for windows, why this one cant?  Seriously, the controller issue is so annoying and extremely confusing if you are not used to an xboc controller. But to be fair, once you are able to set up the thing, the controller works as intended, nothing extraordinary, it just works fine, very responsive.the versus side is self explanatory, 1v1, either pvp, pvc, or any combination, single match or team match (team match is a single match, but you have some support ala mvsc after a timer fills up). It has a ton of characters, and i mean A LOT, you cant complain about diversity, however, the gameplay for each character is very similar (at least the ones i have tried), but again, there isnt much to do when the controllers are so simplistic, the gameplay is fun though, and i believe that most will get this game just for this mode, where you can actually play.so, summing all up. Campaign has little to no gameplay, its the anime with better graphics,, Visually awesome, very bad controller configuration, soundtrack allright, fun vs mode.I recommend it, however, be careful, you are paying 40 bucks to watch the anime in super hd and play for some minutes (which IMO is worth it), if you are looking for a game packed with action/fighting/adventure this is not your game.

So far so good, seems the game had a lot of problems which was fixed right before I bought the game though.I have played The Naruto series since the PS2's first release and of all of the Naruto games I've played so far, THIS is my Favorite of all time and therefore I recommend this to any and all Naruto fans.

												Another great continuation of storm series. This game brings some interesting additions to combat system which makes the game far more enjoyable and less frustriating while playing online against move spammers. There hardly is any noticable graphical change between this and previous part. But nevertheless its an amazing game that will keep you occupied for hours. The storyline is very touching if you are fan of the series otherwise it might seem very stretched and over dramatic at places. The Tailed beast fights are rather dull and camera angles are sometimes problematic. The boss fights are as epci as always giving you the feel like you are controlling the main character. I recommend this game to anyone who likes Naruto storm series, this game is very enjoyable and will keep you busy for hours.side notes:On weaker machines or laptops this game tends to lag when in local player vs player mode,no problem if you use anything with i3 + processor or higher(pc/laptop only related)Playing on keyboard is not the best but this is probably for any fighter game I strongly recommend a xbox360 controller for pc users.

												Naruto, Magical Girl Storm 3 is Bandai's third attempt to convince people that they make games. The story follows the series' main protagonist, Ten-ten, in her quest to find the ten-thousand miscelaneous shuriken in order to defeat the great evil plaguing the land with her magical Ten-Thousand Shuriken Storm technique...and miss with every single one. Follow Ten-ten's adventure as she learns that truth, love, and friendship are completely meaningless if you can't hit the broad side of a barn. Cyber Connect once again proves that games are not about gameplay or story; they're about cutscenes. Witness beautiful, repetitive cutscenes brought to life with awkward dialogue in a trite, convoluted story occasionally interspersed with single button combat occasionally interspersed with pointless quick time events occasionally interspersed with more cutscenes. See The incredibly lengthy cutscenes that make you question, ""Wasn't I in the middle of a boss fight?"" Enjoy multiplayer's many beloved series characters, except the only one you care about. Experience the experience that would make Hideo Kojima cringe at the blatant attempt to make a movie. Naruto Magical Girl Storm 3, are you enka rapper enough? (No, you are not.)			"

												GOOD :) This is an AMAZING GAME! Even if you don't like naruto or anime isn't your thing in general then you shouldn't be disheartened because you'll still definitely enjoy the game. The fighting style is very good and unique and you can do some pretty sick moves. The story line is very detailed and not hard at all to understand (Although you should probably read or find out what's happened in the anime before the game's storyline. The game is awesome and a lot better than a lot of the other naruto games in the series, because they have improved the graphics a lot and you can do team ultimate finishers too. Compared to the normal ninja storm 3, full burst has some really amazing graphics in comparison and they have done a very good job of improving the game. They have added new cutscenes and about 100 more missions for the player to complete after completing the main story. BAD :( The developers are still trying to bring out several different updates for the game becuase online doesn't work very well, its playable but it glitches a lot. Secondly it's highly recommended to use a gamepad, or you can still use the 'ol keyboard but a mouse isn't compatible with the game (which really fudgin sucks!)Finally, they have bought out some new characters that weren't in the other games but they should keep some of the old ones too.

												This game is one of the best fighting/ anime games so far. There are lots of characters to play with and they all have a unique style so the gamplay is endless. Campaign:It follows the actual anime and it has enough side missions to spend time on after the main story has ended. These extra stories also unluck new pictures, substitution items, etc... even a survival mode where you can train your skills with your favourite characters. Online:Though there are a lot of idiotic persons out there, who find it funny to just camp and counter/ spam and be irritating, there are also players who want to have a great battle with you. These guys will maybe give you a hard time but with them you will be able to really learn the basics. Also the internet connection/ lag can occur quit often, though you will quickly find someone that doesnt lag and hey just add them to your friends list. I have got quite a couple active non-lagging players who I can play regularly with. Overall an amazing game, just find the right good-minded jplayers who are willing to help you and play fair and this game will keep you buzy for a long time.  "

												I've spent countless Hours on this game on the 360 and I expect to do even more so on the pc version. So far so good, seems the game had a lot of problems which was fixed right before I bought the game though.I have played The Naruto series since the PS2's first release and of all of the Naruto games I've played so far, THIS is my Favorite of all time and therefore I recommend this to any and all Naruto fans.

												The Story for the game is really cool. The cutscenes are amazing. I cant believe how much effort the creators have put into the dialogue, it seems endless. The gameplay is fun but the only thing is that is missing is mroe AWAKENINGS. Thats probably the coolest thing about the naruto franchise. Main menu is very limited. The game is limiting the player to only Ultimate Adventure, Online Battle and Free Battle(Offline Battles). THE MAIN THING that ticks me off about this game is that IT IS CAPPED TO 30 FPS. 60 FPS atleast, but 30 only. Thats trash.The roster is pretty big and each character has their own unique abilities and costumes. THE cutscenes are pretty long. Servers are alwasys crap for South Africans.7.5/10----30 FPS simulator			"

												I am not a Naruto fan and a friend pushed me to get this game. To be honest, I f'in love this game. This is the kinda battle system I always wanted in a Dragon Ball Z fighter but never got. It is very quick, and takes some learning, but you can come up with some amazing combos that keep the gameplay interesting. I recommend this for the huge fun factor.			"

												The truth? I was super hyped for this game. FINALLY, a Naruto game came to PC! And since i don't owe any consoles (except for a PS2), i was over-excited to finally skip the Dolphin's Wii emulatons; the PSP imitations, and play it for real. At first, i thought it would be great, since i didn't expect to play online. And boy, was i right about that.I do'nt have any console controllers, but i managed to make my way through with the keyboard (i literally imitated Mister Sheen: WINNING!), and i felt great until i had pretty much unlocked everything. It soonly started to get boring on SP, so i tried MP. A sad thought crossed my mind after seeing the game have a bad transmission. But still, i could just keep playing with bots, so it was a very small setback.What keeps my addicted until this day, is a very simple, and perhaps unexpected thing: The Community.But not the raging quitters, the trolls, the spammers, or the IA Abusers (Neji, i'm looking at you). It was the modders. Modders like ""wajinshu"" in youtube, doing the first few mods for the game. Mostly Texmods, but sonly started the character swaps. Typhonua, who made some of the best swaps, not leaving much to be missed about it. Ultimate OmbuStorm for his awesome moveset mods, and many others. So yes, i'm stuck in this game, FOREVER, not because of the internet. Not because of most players. Because it's my favorite anime. Because it's worth it. And although it is a bit over-priced, i can't help it but be thankful for the guys who managed to mod it so much, everything is now accessible to us. Literally, EVERYTHING. Goku costume, Hokage Costumes, new Movesets, New Rosters. There's been thousands of mods, many of which are great, and that's what has been keeping me in here all this time.If you're a big Naruto fan, i'm sure you'll like to buy this.If you can't afford it, then i think i know what you'll end up doing. Or already did ;)			"

												Note: I am only about 10 hours in on PC, and most of this review is based on my 360 experiences. This game is a great way to experience the second part of the Shippuden series without all of the filler, and is a great game to play if you want a single player fighting game experience. The only downside is that there are Deidara spammers online, so finding a good lobby takes a while. For thirty bucks, it is worth it and I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this game over Revolution, because that game doesn't even have a ""real"" campaign. 9/10, my second favorite fighting game next to Smash.

												Although one may think only Naruto fans would enjoy this game, I actually think the opposite.  This is an all around fantastic fighter, appealing more to the casual fighter.  If you're a hardcore Street Fighter or Tekken fan, this probably wouldn't appeal to you, becase the roster is extreeeemly unbalanced.  It looks ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, plays very smoothly, fun story mode for the fans, and mutiplayer is a blast.  A/5.			"

												People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define ""reality"". But what does it mean to be ""correct"" or ""true""? Merely vague concepts ... their ""reality"" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs? There probably isn't any meaning in life. Perhaps you can find something interesting to do while you are alive. Like how you found that flower. Like how I found this game.The next generation of naruto games will always surpass the previous one. It's one of the never-ending cycles in life.If you want to play this game, despise it, hate it, and live in an unsightly way... Run, and cling to life, and then some day, when you have the same eyes as I do, maybe just go and hit that play button.10/10 Believe It!			"

												I've played the others on console and was waiting for this on PC and got it for 10 bucks during a valentine's day sale and would have paid 24 bucks gladly (40% off at time of writing). It's very fun if you are into the series or the fighting mechanic, which is quite unique (I hate typical fighting-genre games, but I love this combat system.) It was great for catching up on the series without actually watching them as ain't nobody got time for dat, though I'd recommend a controller as the keyboard and mouse controls might be jarring; you also have to make your own keybinds since they have no default! The game adds a new feature for fans of the older ones where you are fighting a group of enemies instead of just one (thought I've only seen this once) and a ""branching"" type system which determines what happens and how difficult it is, but doesn't seem to change much.Overall, if you don't have a controller, I'd stay away; if you like Naruto or the combat, then you should buy it if you can, but you might be able to find as good a deal as I did if you wait.

The controller is alright if you either have a ps3 or Xbox controller.I don't recommend playing with a keyboard because it will make the gameplay very hard.The main problem is multiplayer, The Transmittion error.

												Breaks the mold of usual Naruto fighting games with some nice 360 degree combat in which you can actually use tactics *le gasp*. But seriously, the single player mode is pretty good, even if it is a railroad of cutscenes, limited environments outside of battle and scripted fights every now and then. The combat makes up for all it's flaws in my opinion and is well worth a look if you are into Naruto stuffs or just want a colourful fight-em-up.			"

												An exellent naruto game for fans and people who are interested in a kick back and relax type of fighter. Online is screwed on the pc version which sucks but will eventually get fixed. NOTE: eventually.			"

												Breaks the mold of usual Naruto fighting games with some nice 360 degree combat in which you can actually use tactics *le gasp*. But seriously, the single player mode is pretty good, even if it is a railroad of cutscenes, limited environments outside of battle and scripted fights every now and then. The combat makes up for all it's flaws in my opinion and is well worth a look if you are into Naruto stuffs or just want a colourful fight-em-up.			"

												Great game, horribly horrifying PC port. Its just so bad the fps´s, even though having the recommended requirements.If its wasnt for the HUGE fps drop in story mode cause in free mode its a lot smother this game would be the♥♥♥♥♥♥ :D Like great game mechanics and fast paced movement and attacks, sweet looking graphics and a good handful of naruto characters.But of course in terms of gameplay and number of characters Naruto Shippudent Storm Revolution is way better than this game but Naruto Shippudent Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst wins in the important part which is telling the story through nice cinematics and with quick time events and the choices you make in the game.Heres what you gotta know this game strong points are the story telling and quick time events and having a good gameplay mechanics and a good handful of characters PROBLEM IS it has a terrible fps drop despite meeting the requirements.

												I would only recommend this game to fans of the Naruto manga & anime. Otherwise you be at a complete loss when it comes to the story in this game. Now the fighting mechanics are awesome, it's super easy to pull bad♥♥♥♥♥combo's off, and the animations of some moves are badass. It's not a complex system but that's just the way I like it.  There are also tons of stuff to do after you finshed the campaign like, tournaments [with special settings], challenge missions, online battles, ninja timeline [let's you play all the previous battles from the manga/anime]. The only complaint I have about this game are the cutscenes. Some cutscenes can take over ten minutes or more, that's a bit too long if you ask me, but luckily you can skip them all.			"

												Overall this game is extremely good from a standpoint of how fun it is, when it works. With ongoing issues coming up with the server, in put lag, the still not yet defeated transmission errors,  and in my opinion a faulty connection system. This game is one of my favorites even along side all these issues, and within the month I've had it, my play time has surpassed everything  except Dota 2. Passing Borderlands 2, Terraria, and Skyrim. This game is extremely fun, and fluid fighting game who defines itself in it's own personal touch. Regardless of having a single 'attacking' ability this game still manages to maintain a decently high skill cap whereas you won't see a player who is obviously more inexperienced than you taking games off of you for silly things, while it is usually the case that doesn't disregard the fact that it is easily possible. Along with the the fun gameplay comes obnoxious mechanics that have extremely low skill cap and can remove  a lot of the fun from the match, with awakenings like susanoo and fuu to obnoxious characters with Instant awakening resets like Asuma or Neji. In the end, i'll recieve more anguish from losing an obviously won match to a silly awakening or such than dominating a strong playe.While this game has it's issues with server and silly low skill cap easily accessible mechanics, I still recommend this game due to, while being short, maintaining an extremely fun story line and when working fun  multiplayer combat. I feel if CC2 provides proper patching this game could be more than just 'good'. ^^			"

												It may seem I don't have many hours in this game, but offline I have completed most of my game expirence this is one of my favorite or one of the best games ever in the fighting genre! The Story is amazing it includes a load of flash backs and background stories one being how Naruto was born or how he and Sasuke were aquatinces. Its an amazing game, I'm almost done with it, I might update this review later when I finish the game but as of now ( Chapter 6 ) were the war begins. Its amazing. I recommend it to anyone especially on sale! I feel so lucky that I was gifted this game from one of my best friends :D Ty. I rate this game from 1-10 so far as of Ch. 6 a 9/10			"

												I'd like to establish that I'm not a Naruto fan— I couldn't careless about the series.Now, in Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 the story is presented in a way that those who don't follow the manga or anime could still enjoy it. Action packed quick time events will keep your attention laced into the game in between fast-paced battles. Amazing sound tracks that fit right into the atmosphere will allow you to easily be absorbed into the atmosphere; the mixture of visual and auditory elements that compliment each other gives this game a great mark in the ""artistically inclined"" department. If you enjoy the general artistic anime style Naruto brings then this game is a must.If you enjoy the series then this game is a must.If you enjoy using spectacular over-the-top moves then this game is a must.The following are pros and cons to the game.Pros:Fantastic artic presentationOne of the few anime[ish] games on steamGreat musicOver the top movesFast pacedMany characters to chose fromMany things to unlockConsThe melee system could've been given a bit more attention.The online battles may be filled with spamming, but there is a very helpful guide on how to beat those simpletons  LINK HERE.

												Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is a great fighter, once it finally clicks. When you start the story nothing is explained and you start with a pretty hectic battle, which can rather easily be won with just some button mashing. After that comes a frustratingly long battle if you have no idea what you're doing. It took me over 40 minutes to finally beat this enemy, and by that time I understood the controls slightly better. When I was halfway into the game I was still figuring things out. It would've been nice if there was some sort of tutorial; the loading screens show moves and tips but half of the time they disappear way too quickly to properly read them. As I said, it's a great fighter with amazing visuals and cinematics (although they're a bit too long) and a bit of (linear) freedom where you can accept sidequests, find 'secrets', eat food to heal your crew and buy items that you can use during your battles.Battles are usually relatively easy and if they're not the checkpoints seem rather limited. It took me several tries to finish the last battle, with is actually pretty long (10-20 minutes). All because it didn't have enough checkpoints. The easier battles had more checkpoints, but weren't usually needed. I thought that was a bit weird... Could be me, though.The camera can also get in the way at times, but thankfully you can swing it the other way with the press of a button. Simple enough, but still noteworthy.Unfortunately, I had to skip most of the cinematics (they're uncountable, there are so many). Why ? I've never seen a single episode of this show, I have only heard of it. It's not a very newbie friendly game if you're new to the show or the game. I normally watch all cinematics but I didn't understand any of it. There are so many characters and the storyline seems to be all over the place, especially at the beginning of the game. I do know that you'll be skipping at least three cinematics every 5 minutes. They just keep coming, it's unbelievable. I don't mean this in a negative way; other fighters should take note ;) I just wish I had seen some of the episodes to know what it's all about. Behind all of the cinematics there's still enough gameplay to keep you occupied for at least a good 10 hours. Don't skip any of the movies and you can add several hours to that number. Even after finishing the game you can still finish your active sidequests, or accept new ones/ones that you hadn't found yet.The visuals are amazing. I guess the game looks (and sounds) practically the same as the TV show. Most of the times I couldn't figure out if I was watching gameplay or a cinematic. It all works very fluently, and looks amazing. Some of the QTE battles are just gorgeous ! It's just a shame that all of this is capped to 30FPS, which is absolutely noticeable when you're not fighting, but running around in the environments.In the end Naruto really impressed me. A lot. It just took about one hour to figure it out. It's a fun and solid game with amazing graphics, and if you love fighters, or Naruto, this game is a must. More please.[Rating: 79/100]			"

												Ok this is not a game for everyone. If you do not watch Naruto i bet that you will be having loads of fun with the great gameplay but the story will be a mess for you as it picks up just in the middle if it.But as a simple figher its the most fun i had in ages and for those that worry about the 30 fps lock i will say that the game feels so much better then i expected and i usualy have a big problem with low fps.

												Before anythingYes I like this game and yes I am still going to play it and start playing more online.But I can not say I would pay $40 for this.Yes I got this game on sale and I think it is worth the $25Graphics - Great for the style of the game, ColorfulUI - Simple, Artistic, Easy to use.Sound - Have good headset/speakers and it sounds amazingControls - Great (With controler dont know about KB havnt used)Gameplay - Easy, Fast, interactive in game cutscenesPlayable Characters - Way to many there are what 80 characters to chose from in the game not to mention almost all them have different outfits.Story - Well I havn't watched much of the TV show so I can't really say. But the story wasn't to bad explaned things as i kept playing the game. You can sometimes chose 2 different out comes in some parts of the story. World - You can Free roam but you dont really use it much until you beat the game. I feel it was just added in the game. Lots of linear areas and lots of small one to so constant load run for 5 secs then load the next area.Multiplayer - Yes, Custimizable profile (cards), Leaderboards and ranking systemBugs? - Well the game has been running perfect for me so no bugs atmFun? - Fighting yes, Story yes (sometimes for me), Me having to run to the next area no in the terrible Free roaming system no (thank god it only takes like 30 secs to run to the next area tho).

												Having followed the series since it was released i was really excited to play this on PC. The game is heavily reliant on closed fights and could have done with a more open, free flowing enviroment. All in all i did enjoy it and is a must for a Naruto fan, but found my self rushing through it in hope of more open and more engaging gameplay.Postivites:> The fights are amazing and relevant to each character.> Great character set.> Plenty of game time.Negatives:> If you know the series the cut scenes can be painful.> Depth of gameplay lacks.> Left wanting more free-roaming gameplay.7/10.

												If you're a big-time Naruto fan and you're looking to buy this as your first Naruto game then I'd definately get it. The story is really fun and the combat is very addicting. You'll enjoy playing as all the different characters and checking out all the jutsu. The online is somewhat broken right now because of connection issues but you can still find people where you don't lag. I'd definately get the second controller out and play with a friend if you can. *NOTE THAT YOU NEED A WIRED XBOX CONTROLLER TO BE ABLE TO PLAY*The downside is that you can start to get bored of this game quickly depending on who you are. The game might not be worth the original $40. I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it.You should get at least 30 hours out of it. If you're really addicted to it then that number can go way higher.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥est Naruto game EVER. Forced cut scenes that make you pactically watch the entire nauruto manga as opposed to PLAY the game, Oversized bosses that the camera can't even focus on the toes let alone see what move it's doing. ffs. I hate this crap so much. this can't even be considered a game seriously.			"

												I can't believe I've put 40 hours. Into a Naruto game. Even if you don't like Naruto, this is still a great, great, great fighting game. Suggest using a controller if you got one, makes it a lot more enjoyable. (joytokey was a good program for controller use.) Highly recommended if you like fighting games. Most of the characters really have a unique feel to them, a really great figher.			"

												This game is amazing! Any Naruto or Anime/Manga fan has to get this game! The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is addictive and the story is great! The cutscenes are long but tell the story very clearly. The chapters are really fun to play and replay! Also, there are LOADS of characters to play as including Part 1 Naruto (younger Naruto)! I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun anime game!			"

For me this game was 95 % (the 5 % was for the bugs when the game came out).Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												If you're a big-time Naruto fan and you're looking to buy this as your first Naruto game then I'd definately get it. The story is really fun and the combat is very addicting. You'll enjoy playing as all the different characters and checking out all the jutsu. The online is somewhat broken right now because of connection issues but you can still find people where you don't lag. I'd definately get the second controller out and play with a friend if you can. *NOTE THAT YOU NEED A WIRED XBOX CONTROLLER TO BE ABLE TO PLAY*The downside is that you can start to get bored of this game quickly depending on who you are. The game might not be worth the original $40. I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it.You should get at least 30 hours out of it. If you're really addicted to it then that number can go way higher.			"

The game will, however, probably be more interesting if you understand the story.Great game, but don't buy it without a PC gamepad.14/10			"

												Having followed the series since it was released i was really excited to play this on PC. The game is heavily reliant on closed fights and could have done with a more open, free flowing enviroment. All in all i did enjoy it and is a must for a Naruto fan, but found my self rushing through it in hope of more open and more engaging gameplay.Postivites:> The fights are amazing and relevant to each character.> Great character set.> Plenty of game time.Negatives:> If you know the series the cut scenes can be painful.> Depth of gameplay lacks.> Left wanting more free-roaming gameplay.7/10.

												No idea why so many complain that it is a poor port to PC.....To me the 30fps is not a big issue at all....I am using an extremely high end gaming machine and have no problems with the frame rates whatsoever....It runs perfectly fine...smooth as silk...and i don't see how ramping up the frame rates would help at all....Read up that some people have problem running this game using AMD processor, you can skip this game if you are not able to run it, but if you can run this game. Not playing it would be one of your biggest regret...Playing it using a Xbox 360 controller and it is one of the best fighting games i have played for a long time considering that i have played tons of fighting games before. There are tons of characters to choose from. The main campaign is awesome and captivating. I have no problem with the online battles as well. Seem like it is so much better after their patch. All in all, this is one game i don't mind paying full price if need be.			"

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is, in typical fighting game tradition, an updated version of of Ninja Storm 3. I'll start by saying that that I have not played that game, my point of comparison is the 2nd game.Combat consists on either 1 on 1 or team on team (1 character and 2 assists) fighting on a 3D plane. The offensive game consists of performing simple attack combos based on a single button and tilt, a guard breaking throw move, throwing and useing various items, and activating special finishing moves by charging up. On the defensive end the options are movement, blocking, and specific to the series Substitution Jutsu which avoid an attack and place the player behind his oppenent. The Substitution has four uses that recharge over time. In low level play this perhaps dumbs down the combat to the player who attacks first on equal substitutions coming out out with a combo but I'll leave that discussion to hardcore players.Performance wise the game leaves much to be desired. While it is colorful and good-looking for the most part, the lack of graphical options is disappointing. The game is locked at 30 fps, which seems a poor descision for a 3D fighter. These point to little care being put into the PC port. Coming from Ninja Storm 2 the story mode is huge improvement. Fans of the series will welcome how long and detailed it goes, though sometimes the cutscenes are long.  Having read the series since being as young teenager I've really lost interest in the series, reading weekly as a habit rather than a desire. That being said the game was able to bring emotions to some scenes that the manga failed to do for me. To me that is something very special and a spectacular success. Some story battles have extra moments activated by performing certain actions and performing QTEs. In the context of the story mode this was actually pretty interesting.Playing a bit online did not show a comunity as active as I thought it would be. As with any fighting game, coming in a few months later left me completely out of the meta, getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by everyone playing as the 4th Hokage. The lag in game is TERRIBLE. But honestly anime based games are not serious fighters, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to play with friends. If you like the series and have people to play with, get the game. Everyone else might benefit from a demo to see if its for them.			"

												I'm going to start with what I feel would be the negative parts of the game, and then end with what I liked.It's ironic when a Naruto game has filler, but a forgiveable amount, the actual anime is so full of unneeded garbage it's ridiculous. Please show the emotional and plot bulding flash backs, and get to fighting. Them standing around talking every 2-5 minutes is too much.Not to mention the actual traveling and ""find"" system was completely useless. I chose Legendary(hardest difficulty) and never used a shop, or used any ryo after getting the one achievement. There was no need for it. You'd have to be a kid, or really bad at fighting games to have to use items all the time. Not to mention it isn't even a battle requirement, ever. You could get by just from spamming ninjutsu and substitute.Too many cut scenes, it felt like work to get through the cutscenes to the content. It was like 5-10 minute cutsene, 1 minute battle,  another cutscene.Sad part is I need to replay it to unlock all the achieves. Not going to. The things they want are damn near impossible. Why I say that isn't even a matter of skill, or being bad at the game. The fighting mechanics themselves and some of the battles you just can't do what they ask. ie: 6 vs 2 battle, legendary, can't block forever, you will eventually get caught by some random spam of ninjutsu that you can't block, and it's a fight for health all the way through. Unless there is an item that magically makes you have 2 more HP bars or something. If the mechanics don't get you, the camera will. Many times the camera just pans inside my character or is at an angle I can't see anything and a bunch of them with guard break/get me caught up in a bunch of crap.I did like however when they worked plot into the actual fight. I hated standing around listening about what they're going to do. Unlocking more emotional parts, etc. It was really fun to play the action sequences.They mixed free roam into it, it looked nice, almost like you were running around in a real anime, but really fell short to previous games made in terms of map size, exploration, and items.There is many hours of content here, took me quite awhile to beat it completely. I would say maybe 10-13hrs of gameplay on your first play through. At a certain point I wished the game would finally end, the bits of filler in it from the show of them talking for ridiculously long times about the same thing between different characters probably made it longer than it should be, same as the show.As far as Naruto games go, I would probably give it 5/10. -Tried something different and were very creative in terms of UI and story presentation.- Very good artwork/textures, it was very fluid and felt like I was playing the show.- Easy to understand system, becomes pretty fluid by the time you end the game.- Captured the emotions of the anime really well.- Quirky- Had a bit too much talking and I felt bored pretty quickly at certain areas of the game.- Sounds/music didn't seem all that great, some audio glitches here and there. (Most of the time I didn't even notice their was music at all. If it had some original OST theme music in there, I must of missed it.)- While the free roam was a nice thing to have, I don't feel it was necessary, and I think it was thrown in ""just because.""Would I recommend it? Yes. Do Ithink it's worth what I paid for it? About 80-90%, it should of been about $5-$10 less.			"

												A must have for Naruto fans! Story mode spans from post-Pain vs Naruto fight until Tobi's mask breaks off albeit with non-canon ending. Some scenes from the manga are missing, but the storytelling still touches your heart and explain characters and stories perfectly even for people who never watched/read Naruto. 10/10 Story, Ten/Ten Gameplay. Get Storm 4 after you finish this game. It will continue the story until the ending of Naruto!			"

												Naruto Storm 3 stands alike, following the tradition of previous Storm games, has the gameplay mechanics you might like or may not like. But otherwise, the story telling this game achieves is excellent, the GRAPHICS are strong in this one. But beware this game may not follow the storyline of the actual Cannon Naruto Manga/Anime itself at some point. But overall this game is a must for any Fan.Online experiance is Average.Overall, I would recommend this game!			"

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is, in typical fighting game tradition, an updated version of of Ninja Storm 3. I'll start by saying that that I have not played that game, my point of comparison is the 2nd game.Combat consists on either 1 on 1 or team on team (1 character and 2 assists) fighting on a 3D plane. The offensive game consists of performing simple attack combos based on a single button and tilt, a guard breaking throw move, throwing and useing various items, and activating special finishing moves by charging up. On the defensive end the options are movement, blocking, and specific to the series Substitution Jutsu which avoid an attack and place the player behind his oppenent. The Substitution has four uses that recharge over time. In low level play this perhaps dumbs down the combat to the player who attacks first on equal substitutions coming out out with a combo but I'll leave that discussion to hardcore players.Performance wise the game leaves much to be desired. While it is colorful and good-looking for the most part, the lack of graphical options is disappointing. The game is locked at 30 fps, which seems a poor descision for a 3D fighter. These point to little care being put into the PC port. Coming from Ninja Storm 2 the story mode is huge improvement. Fans of the series will welcome how long and detailed it goes, though sometimes the cutscenes are long.  Having read the series since being as young teenager I've really lost interest in the series, reading weekly as a habit rather than a desire. That being said the game was able to bring emotions to some scenes that the manga failed to do for me. To me that is something very special and a spectacular success. Some story battles have extra moments activated by performing certain actions and performing QTEs. In the context of the story mode this was actually pretty interesting.Playing a bit online did not show a comunity as active as I thought it would be. As with any fighting game, coming in a few months later left me completely out of the meta, getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me by everyone playing as the 4th Hokage. The lag in game is TERRIBLE. But honestly anime based games are not serious fighters, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to play with friends. If you like the series and have people to play with, get the game. Everyone else might benefit from a demo to see if its for them.			"

												One of the few fighting games I've ever been able to stand, and enjoy to a great length since the PlayStation 1. Follows closesly along the lines of the Anime, and if you intend to follow along and haven't seen it up to date, I suggest watching before playing, as the cinematics closely follow the Anime/Manga itself with some variants. It provides great gameplay, though I'm not too strong at fighting games myself, each fight feels balanced and fair; as if right in my grasp when I fail, just simple mistakes. Fighting friends in tournaments is a must try, especially if youre able to grab two controllers and play in the same room. I don't suggest mouse and keyboard, though it is viable and works well, a controller just feels more natural for this type of game.			"

This review will mainly focus on the campaign.tl;dr: Really fun fighting parts, boring walking parts, long cuntscenes that will give you the feels.  Capped at 30FPS, and a bad port in general.  However I still recommend this game.Naruto Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst's ""game play"" consists of 4 main parts.  First off, you have the fighting.  The fighting is really quite fun, it's action packed, and requires you to quickly learn the combos and be able to pull them off quickly.  There are also quick-time events within some of these fights, but it's not that common.Secondly, we have the walking... This part is kind of boring, you just walk to where you're supposed to be going, and you can pick up small loot from some plants and stuff on the way.  You can also talk to some people and buy from the shop.  Yuu can't use your ninja dash here, and all you can really do is jump, so I don't like this bit.Thirdly, you have the cutscenes.  There are two kinds of cutscenes, you have the ones where you press ""A"" after each speech bubble, I don't think this part was part of the anime, it's just filler to add more to the game (don't quote me on that though).  Then you have the proper important storyline cutscenes, where you just sit back and watch.  This part is exactly like the anime, but remade with the game engine (so it's not as pretty), and it lasts a long time, longer than the other type of cutscene (so grab some popcorn!).  I really like this part, as living the through the anime so long after this part was aired is quite nice.The game is good in the story progression, because you aren't always limited to fighting with the same character all the time, so it keeps it interesting.The arena gamemode where you pick a two characters to fight is really fun, each character has multiple outfits, which come with different movesets and combos, making it really fun.  For some reason the girls all come with bikini outfits o_O *nosebleed* ...  Jiraiya will be pleased!  You unlock these characters and their respective outfits as you go along, but I believe that quite a few characters are already there as I can't remember unlocking so many!Overall, this is a really, really bad port.  It's capped at 30FPS, has loading times for EVERYTHING, due to this being on PC,  they could have loaded a bit more of the world for God sake, not just this tiny little area!  There are plenty of invisible walls, it has weird saving mechanics, and the graphics on character is shockingly bad, tbh, I would have preferred it to have similar fighting mechanics, but on a more pixel art-based 2D world, and then focused more art talent into the cutscenes.  I really do recommend this game if you like the anime, because I love it, and I love the fighting in this game (despite being 30FPS locked.  Play with a controller if you can, and prepare to not actually play much.  This game is more of an anime, where watching and playing are not quite half and half, but I don't mind, as the fighting is incredibly fun in my opinion.Buy this game (or revolution) if you miss the anime!  And feel free to ask me any questions about the game at any time, I am glad to be of assistance if you are stuck, or are unsure of what something in the game is.			"

												UNS3 is a strong fighter in it's own right, but also a good pick for people like me who more often than not, just don't enjoy fighters. This game has a very Beat-em' up feel to it.. it's also very simple by nature, with simple controls, combos and easy to perform moves. With that said, it has enough depth in the way that you can use those simple moves and turn it into a truly exciting game, full of satisfaction and devious trickery.This game shines most in it's multiplayer. The best way to experience this game would be locally, with a mate or seven. Failing that, you can of course take to the online mode. The netcode looks like it needs work but disconnects are a thing of the past- the real beast to worry about is latency. Fighting any friend further than my own state (Western Australia) resulted in anywhere between a few milliseconds to half a second of latency, with those in my state being as responsive as a local match. Unfortunately, and this is likely due to poor Australian internet but it's still worth noting, playing any friend overseas was unplayably laggy, resulting in only frustration for both players. It kind of draws from the game, but it's more of an issue for us here. When you do get connected, it is undoubtedly the most fun part of the game.That is of course not to say the single player doesn't excel too, oh it does. One of the best stories in a fighting game in thanks to the rich and interesting world provided by the Naruto franchise. The story itself takes place in the same arc the currently-airing anime does at time of release, the Fourth Great Ninja War. The story is solid, it has many moments that will blow your mind and a lot of them are fully playable. Each fight is as memorable as the last, nothing feels too forced or unnecessary and the pace is set nicely too, with the exception of an almost hour-long scene that just sucks the life out of the middle of the game for a while. If I were to pick some nits I'd say that the characters are a bit too stiff and they don't move during dialogue unless it's a big scripted cutscene, but when things get good, they get fantastic. Even flashbacks are implemented into story fights as you play, giving you some GREAT perspective. Some of the story is very simpified, and it focuses more on the Main characters than the Anime does, leaving out some very interesting and emotionally impacful backstory.. but it does the job. It teaches you how to play, offers hours of entertainment and will make you excited for the franchise all over again. Sadly, the ending is a little different to what happens in canon Naruto, likely to avoid spoiler territory for the anime, and thus is a little unsatisfying. It'd be nice to have gotten that little surprise at the end- for that, I highly urge you to watch the anime, the person behind that mask.. ooh! Amazing.For a Console port, it has it's issues. There's a lack of tweakable options.. you're given a choice of resolution and Anti-Aliasing and that's about it. With that said.... the game runs very smoothly, even at it's locked 30 Frames Per Second, and the Anti-Aliasing does it's job well, there's a very noticable difference and the quality is greatly improved over it's console counterparts, especially in just how smooth and clear the lines are, it helps solidify the feeling this is an Anime. It doesn't really ""Feel"" like a port, if that makes sense- while you're playing it, it looks great, sounds great and controls great while running smoother than butter on any decent machine.With all that said, I'd definitely recommend you give it a shot. It's got plenty of hours in store for you and is certainly a blast with friends. It's the definitive version of the game and I'm very happy it came to PC.I'll give you guys a hint for when you start playing.. don't rely on your subs too much. It's easy to think spamming them will win you a fight but if you learn to play while conserving them and recharging often, you will dominate your friends. The Chakra dash is your best friend!			"

												Not a fan of fighting games, even a little.  That said, this is more like a action-strategy brawler than a fighting game.  It's all about breaking down defenses and taking advantage when your opponent is open.  Aside from the game giving you very few hints on most of the awesome stuff you can pull off (I plan on doing a little homework on it myself), it's so much fun.  For gameplay, 10/10, I played for fifteen minutes and this game went on my favorites.			"

												As a fan of Fighting games, I've reviewed the staples of the genre. From Soul Caliber, Tekken and Virtua Fighter to the more over the top Street Fighter, Guilty Gear and BlazBlue. I even tried Power Stone on the Sega Dreamcast! But these Naruto games always breath new life in a genre that too often falls into a rut of button mashing or flimsy AI, and takes the fighting genre in a new direction. With Full Burst, there is an excellent story, epic boss battles and 100% controller support. The fighting mechanics, the visual style, and the wide range of music and sounds help this game stand out from its siblings. I don't want to spoil any story related items but It's a well written and voiced story coupled with an excellent online mode and offline multiplayer. If you can get it on sale, its replayability makes it worth the money alone, not too mention that theres upwards of 100 characters in game to fight with and against. 10/10 Would chakra again.			"

												Recommended for Naruto fans. If you're not a Naruto fan, but you're looking for a good Beat 'Em Up! game then maybe give this game a try. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 has no default controls for the keyboard, you'll have to manually set every corresponding key to the controller controls, HOWEVER you can search up various setups other players have put up which can make it alot more fluid to play. If you have a controller yourself however, then I'd recommend you'd use that. The story is based off the Naruto anime so if you don't watch Naruto, you may find the story a bit confusing as it skips some important details.			"

												It's pretty much the perfect Naruto experience.it even makes you sit and wait through a lot of scenes you don't need or want, just like the series :DPros:  - fights are epic and feel true to Naruto - tons of characters and chances to customize your fighting style - voice over is pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥if you stay with the Japanese, the english dub is pretty lifeless - it looks pretty enough and brings Naruto to life quite well - so. many. events.  - pretty cool cutscenes (with all those Ninjas on screen of course one of them is cutting onions)Cons: - barely any options in the settings - some parts of the narration will test your patience. having skipped the 50th or more ""..."" manually will drive you      bonkers - loading times. there's many - rather stupid side 'quests'I'm enjoying it massively and would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the Naruto series (and doesn't own any of the later iterations) or any lover of Beat'em Ups (but be patient. it takes a while to get to the fights) "

												This is a great game : The combat is good and if that doesnt get you the cinama scene will it had me crying 2 times and a game doesnt do that to me often( And no it wasnt that the grafics in fact they are very good, it was the story)...BUT... One c*** thing .....Who makes a game where you cant even play right without a Controller remote i had to spend a extra 500 to get the remote!I recommend this for all fighting gamers (preverably those with controlers)  you will play this all day!

												The last Naruto Ultimate Ninja game I played was 3 on the ps2. I have enjoyed the series quite a bit, as it is one of my favorite 3d fighting game series to date. Now, for this one in particular, the game is very good. Unfortunately the port is not. My biggest gripes are no video options beyond anti-aliasing, screen size, v-sync, or windowed mode, the game is locked at 30 fps with no option in configs to up it to 60, and the online is extremely laggy if you can even find an opponent, which you won't. Also, while you can play with the keyboard, it is not recommended as the port was designed with controllers in mind. On the upside, the story is good. Now, I haven't kept up in the series for awhile so I had no clue what was going on, I was enjoying the ride it took me on. Characters are unlocked for multiplayer as you proceed, and there are plenty to unlock along the way. The actual gameplay is solid. You have a very simple combat style, which one button for melee, a button for ranged, block, dodge (if you have the chakra), awakenings (second forms/power ups) for most of the character, and every character has a ninjutsu and ultimate jutsu to choose from. The characters play very differently. I have found my favorites already, but it's fun to go and play all of the characters as I unlock them to see what they do. Although, if you get sick of playing against bots, you will need some actual friends. Overall, the game is great but it could have been a much better port. 7/10			"

												Fantastic game overall, but make sure you have a controller or be prepared for unbound keyboard controls. There is a guide on Steam about a good keyboard lay-out I use, but that doesn't really help this port's case. Again, the game itself is quite epic, as is the story, but the controls are a slight issue.			"

Some scenes from the manga are missing, but the storytelling still touches your heart and explain characters and stories perfectly even for people who never watched/read Naruto. 10/10 Story, Ten/Ten Gameplay. Get Storm 4 after you finish this game. It will continue the story until the ending of Naruto!			"

												Ninja storm three does a few things right, and a few things wrong. Personally, I found it highly enjoyable. The fights are beautifully animated and are accurately described as ""easy to learn, hard to master."" Though there are many cutscenes, I never found them obtrusive as quicktime events tended to be woven in most of them. If you really want to play a good naruto fighting game for once, and you're not a console player, I highly recommend this game.However, I did have some serious complaints. The game is poorly optimized to work on the PC, and personally, the game runs abysmally on my system, with entire fights taking place in slow motion with the audio sync of the japanese wire-fu movies of yore. Some people might not experience this issue, but I did, so I'm making note of it. Secondly, the online part of the game is utterly dysfunctional. Online, most players can expect 2/3 online matches to disconnect before anything really happens due to server-related issues. It's incredibly frustrating, and while the developers have promised improvement, we have so far seen only one patch that did not fix the issue. In short, if you don't care about the multiplayer much, and don't mind tinkering with your system to get the game to run as it would on a console, you'll probably have a blast with this game. However, if you wanted to play online against other people and/or you're still running a system similiar to mine (I'm running XP) you'll probably feel it's a waste of your money.*EDIT*In recent patches, the online segment of the game has actually been fixed... More or less. It's functional now, more often than not, and while not perfect, the multiplayer of the game is still very enjoyable.			"

												I think this game is fun if you consider it good enough without playing multiplayer (Which is the reason I got it in the first place). Transmissions errors are all I have to say about online. The single player is phenominal and a cinematic beauty (though I miss Pain saying ""Shinra Tensei"" in Japanese). The final battle is extremely challenging and so are the challenge missions (obviously). Its a game I recommend, just don't expect a patch...EVER.

												I'm going to start with what I feel would be the negative parts of the game, and then end with what I liked.It's ironic when a Naruto game has filler, but a forgiveable amount, the actual anime is so full of unneeded garbage it's ridiculous. Please show the emotional and plot bulding flash backs, and get to fighting. Them standing around talking every 2-5 minutes is too much.Not to mention the actual traveling and ""find"" system was completely useless. I chose Legendary(hardest difficulty) and never used a shop, or used any ryo after getting the one achievement. There was no need for it. You'd have to be a kid, or really bad at fighting games to have to use items all the time. Not to mention it isn't even a battle requirement, ever. You could get by just from spamming ninjutsu and substitute.Too many cut scenes, it felt like work to get through the cutscenes to the content. It was like 5-10 minute cutsene, 1 minute battle,  another cutscene.Sad part is I need to replay it to unlock all the achieves. Not going to. The things they want are damn near impossible. Why I say that isn't even a matter of skill, or being bad at the game. The fighting mechanics themselves and some of the battles you just can't do what they ask. ie: 6 vs 2 battle, legendary, can't block forever, you will eventually get caught by some random spam of ninjutsu that you can't block, and it's a fight for health all the way through. Unless there is an item that magically makes you have 2 more HP bars or something. If the mechanics don't get you, the camera will. Many times the camera just pans inside my character or is at an angle I can't see anything and a bunch of them with guard break/get me caught up in a bunch of crap.I did like however when they worked plot into the actual fight. I hated standing around listening about what they're going to do. Unlocking more emotional parts, etc. It was really fun to play the action sequences.They mixed free roam into it, it looked nice, almost like you were running around in a real anime, but really fell short to previous games made in terms of map size, exploration, and items.There is many hours of content here, took me quite awhile to beat it completely. I would say maybe 10-13hrs of gameplay on your first play through. At a certain point I wished the game would finally end, the bits of filler in it from the show of them talking for ridiculously long times about the same thing between different characters probably made it longer than it should be, same as the show.As far as Naruto games go, I would probably give it 5/10. -Tried something different and were very creative in terms of UI and story presentation.- Very good artwork/textures, it was very fluid and felt like I was playing the show.- Easy to understand system, becomes pretty fluid by the time you end the game.- Captured the emotions of the anime really well.- Quirky- Had a bit too much talking and I felt bored pretty quickly at certain areas of the game.- Sounds/music didn't seem all that great, some audio glitches here and there. (Most of the time I didn't even notice their was music at all. If it had some original OST theme music in there, I must of missed it.)- While the free roam was a nice thing to have, I don't feel it was necessary, and I think it was thrown in ""just because.""Would I recommend it? Yes. Do Ithink it's worth what I paid for it? About 80-90%, it should of been about $5-$10 less.			"

I played other naruto games similar to this on the PSP and the PS2 but i haven't played them in a while and playing this was pretty fun.

												Full Burst is a remaster of the original Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 which was released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 a while back, the improvements in the remaster are obviously visable and do make a difference. First the game is fully in 60 FPS which is important if you have some experience with other fighters like Tekken and/or Street Fighter since it's completly different to a 30 FPS game on console. Also the graphics look alot better with better effects and the better cutscenes look gorgeous especially when Kurama attacks the Hidden Leaf Village at the beginning of the game with all it's fire and bloom effects it just looks very good. The Storyline is a mix of flashback events like the attack on the Hidden Leaf Village but most of the story is set in the 4th Great Ninja War with it ending at the fight with Obito. Now the fact that they didn't include the whole story is pretty dumb considering the Manga was pretty much finished before this game was released and they didn't include the ending of the manga/anime in the game is just a means for creating another Sequel is a completly different story, but I digress.The fighting itself is awesome in my opinion on par with games like Tekken or Street Fighter, feeling-wise but also skill-wise, obviously Street Fighter is more oriented to competetive gamers than casuals but it still feels like you have alot of possibility of learning and skill involvement. The fighting features a Jutsu System which we've seen since the dawn of this series and also a Ultimate Jutsu System which is a Nerdgasm for the Fans of the original Manga/Anime. To see such Techniques as the Tengai Shinsei used by Madara and also Sasuke/Madaras/Itachis Susanoo is just awesome.Also the Soundtrack which is featured here is actually pretty good, if you watched the Anime it doesn't really feature a Soundtrack which acompanies emotional scenes but the game actually uses it's soundtrack to make emotional scenes even more emotional.It is a very good game for fans of the Anime but also for fans of other Fighters who had no experience what so ever with the Anime or Manga. But I advise to watch the Anime since the game features alot of big, crucial spoilers (which is expected).			"

												Incredibly bad port, Darksouls level kind of port. Game looks pretty, but tries to extend beyond what its meant to be. If you're a Naruto fan, and you have a great computer, go for it 100%. Otherwise avoid like the black plague. And I may be wrong, but the JP voices do not match the JP anime voices. I have no clue about the English ones.			"

												A really nice fighting game, with extended content as for story mode and character cast. The story centers on the anime right after the battle with Pain, voices are available in both japanese and english, directly from the tv series. All cinemas are in real time, not pre-rendered crap, and you can even compare both the episodes with the cutscenes from the game, which look fairly identical. The fighting style it's pretty much a 3D ""smash brothers"" like gameplay, you have fairly simple way of performing special attacks, a block button and you can move freely over the arena with smooth animations and details for each character, very fast paced fights and anybody can play it without problem.Overall, it's a nice game, specially for Naruto fans.

												I came to this game looking for something where I can dip in here and there to have a bit of fun. What I got was much more than that, providing a game that appeals whether you have an interest in the anime/manga or not. NS:UNS3FB contains the awesome drop in and play experience I wanted, providing a large pool of characters which all have their unique traits but the control setup makes them easy to adjust to. It also backs this up with substantial single player modes, ensuring that I put in quite a number of hours exploring everything the game had to offer.The battle system forgos the usual 1 on 1 fighting style for a behind character more open battle system. Control inputs are quite simple but still offer quite a wide variety of options when fighting, most of which tie into the chakra meter which you have to recharge during battle. Choosing when to unleash that ultimate jutsu or skilfully using a substitute to escape a powerful attack is great fun. Unfortunately the camera has some odd quirks, especially if you get designated as player 2.You can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com] "

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is perhaps the most extreme example yet of Namco Bandai's attempt to appeal to the converted and only to the converted. Here's a game not simply for any old Naruto fan, but for Naruto fans who are completely up to date with the story and characters as they currently exist in the anime/manga episodes and are seeking a new way of experiencing previously explored plotlines. If you're not up to date, then not only are you going to struggle enormously with the story as depicted in the game's early stages, but you're going to ruin what you've not yet seen of the TV series. Unfortunately, due to gameplay that is as unwieldy and bloated as its title, Full Burst is not an acceptable way to get yourself up to date with this franchise.			"

												What could be a fun game ruined by a really bad port.I'm not really a fan of the Naruto Manga/Anime but I always enjoyed the games, for some reason Naruto (as well as DBZ) games always seemed to range from decent to top notch. So I saw this game on sale, and I decided to pick it up.I can tell it's not a bad game, but holy hell it's a very bad port. Let us make a list on important features it's missing-No Graphic Options other than Screen Size (made the game nearly unplayable for me).-Game has no PC controls, you have to make them yourself.-Even if you put them in, the game still shows the Xbox control promps.I heard it was a bad port, but...not this bad.

												Let me start out by saying this is a good game, it is decent. I would recomend it, but I can not because of a couple of fatal bugs and annoyances. First, the entire game plays at around 75% full speed, which is annoying, but you can get used two. Second, there is like over 30 hours of cutscenes, over 50% of the loading times is to load another cutscene, and for people like me that like to 100% games, there's an achievement for not skipping any cutscenes in Campaign. I did not get this game to watch some anime. While I like it, its not great. Third, and this is by far the worst, there is a fatal bug in the final battle, which causes the entire game to crash. Nearing the end of the battle there is a quicktime event, it asks you to press ""A"", and then it crashes. Many people have told the developers about this problem, but they ignore it. After battling for half an hour, when you start it up again, you have to do the entire battle over again, only to have it crash again. There's also an achievement for beating the final boss..... So, yeah. You know how the best thing to do in a game (the most rewarding to a gamer) is to defeat the final boss? I never got that satisfaction. Thanks to YouTube, though, for letting me know how it ends. I now know that this is not the final battle, and now I can say a full thanks, Naruto, for wasting over 2 hours of my life (tried fighting it 4 times, crashed all times), on a battle made to look awesome, which ends in a crappy quicktime event, and ends up with (spoiler alert) the main bad guy getting away.

												As a Naruto fan, I have to say: there's just too many cutscenes. If the story wasn't about naruto, I'd never play this. You barely get to fight 3 minutes before you have to wait 20min worth of cutscenes to play again. Also, so many useless lines! Producers need to learn from Valve how to tell a story without interrupting the game all the time. Also, the game has pretty much nothing extra compared to the manga or the anime, so no bonus story. And  you have to play storymode if you want to unlock every other character, so you have no choice. You need to go through what's bad about this game before you get to enjoy it. And they probably don't give a damn about it, since it sells easily after the story is already successful. Only buy this if it's on sale, or else it's wasted money. It's a fun game on PvP, but the storymode is a complete desaster.			"

												As someone who played some of the previous Ninja STORM titles, ""Full Burst"" takes two steps forward and one step backward... all the while having a deadweight called ""online mode"" clamped down on its ankle. Gameplay is broken into three parts - story mode, versus mode and online mode. Here are some highlights and lowlights for each mode.Story Mode Highlights- Multiple battles with new characters- Boss battles with quicktime events continue to be visually stunning- Has a little bit of a ""choose your adventure"" vibe to the storyStory Mode Lowlights- Story telling continues to be weak in distribution - subtitles are boring and most of the cinematics involve scrolling stillshots- Fights can get tedious - there's only so much variation you can do in this game- Final few boss modes are incredibly frustrating as poor camera angles ruin the fun---Versus Mode Highlights- The real star of the game, more playable characters than ever- Action continues to be fast-paced, great art direction- Adding cinematics on ultimate skill takedowns adds a bit of flair to fights- Challenge mode is pretty fun in a mindless sort of wayVersus Mode Lowlights- Several characters are carry overs from the previous title, making their skills outdated in comparison to story mode progression- Some characters missing from story mode for no reason- Balancing issues, certain characters standard attacks can hit you even if you spam log--Online Mode Highlights- It allows you to play with people onlineOnline Mode Lowlights- Net code is absolutely terrible. Ridiculous input delay makes the game nearly unplayable.- Very low online population. The people who do play are veterans with hundreds of hours - you will get wiped.- Items are not standardized and reflect larger balancing issues. --Overall, I can't recommend buying this game with the next one coming out next month. Unless you REALLY want to play some Naruto goodness right away, hold off for the next iteration which will have three times more characters and some real development on the versus mode side. But don't hold your breath for better online - this is clearly not a priority. "

If your answer was why would I ever say that then this game is probably not for you.  Overall it's a pretty meh fighting game that obviously relies on being Naruto.  I'd give it a 7/10....

												It's a good game gameplay wise, but Naruto as the main character is just too unfathomably stupid. Also, the personalties of the characters are too off base to real life.In real life confronting a world leaderto tell them to change their mind then fighting them would not make them respect you, it would make them declare war on the place you represent. That's why I find the fight he has with the Raikage so unbelievable. Even if the Raikage doesn't respect Naruto, how the hell did he not declare war on the leaf village when a prominent member attacked him?*Sigh*Still, despite this I like the fighting mechanics and the general gameplay. Just the story annoys me. Though it applies to the anime and manga as well.			"

												I've spent the last 3 hours trying to fix a sound issue that, while not game breaking (thus far anyways, I've barely played due to trying to fix this), causes most game music to stop and restart in very short (3-10 seconds) intervals, while some audio dialogue and effects do work and others dont, without any discernable pattern. I may yet find a fix to this, and I've not seen any topics online that seem to deal with this problem as I've described it (plenty of other issues though), but I do not recommend anyone risking their money on this faulty product. Thank god I got it on a throwaway sale.			"

												A simplistic fighting game that takes the more casual gamer approach.The singleplayer campaign is very fun and a vast improvement of the earlier singleplayer games of Ultimate Ninja Storm. There is no need for such things as grinding or a crap load of side quests (there are some but I did them all in over an hour or two). The game is seemingly easy all the way through the single player, tho the two last bosses were really challenging to me (and by two, I mean the secret boss once you finished the singleplayer).  The multiplayer aspect is a fun, casual fighting game style that is very easy to get into and being able to pull of quite a bit. This is the biggest reason you should get the game. I've had plenty of fun moments in the multiplayer even tho at some times it feels like ""whoever substitute blocks first wins"". But once you played it a bit you should learn how to counter act substitution blocking. Such as timing in a support move or using a jutsu depending on your character.The awakening mode may seem overpowered and sometimes it certainly gives a ridiculous advantage. However this can be remedied by using support characters and keeping a distance. Since a lot of the ""powerful"" awakening modes makes the characters ridiculously huge.The visuals are pleasing to the eye, the fighting is smooth and the game over all feels polished and done well. I only once got a bug out of the hundreds of fights I've had.Would recommend to anyone who enjoys fighting games, advanced players or rookies alike.			"

												Faithfully tells the story of the anime from after the end of the Pain arc through the Great Ninja War.  The plot part of the game can be nailed in less than ten hours; then the game goes into ""free roaming"" mode, which is essentially RPG-lite.For fans of the anime who don't mind revisiting the plot (or who stopped watching at the end of Pain arc), it's amusing enough.  The combat is largely satisfying, if nothing too original or ground-breaking.There's at least one boss-fight that is a terrible exception though - where the combat design seems to have taken a jump back 16 years:  Instead of a fun fight, instead you're stuck repeating the same ultimate move again and again and again to chip down an enemy's ridiculously over-large health bar - while your attacks are inexplicably♥♥♥♥♥♥weak for the first time in the game.  The game instantly stops being fun at that point and becomes a massive chore where you've got to memorise attack patterns and slowly grind away like it's a game out of the late 90s.The RPG elements aren't great - it's cool walking around the Hidden Leaf, etc, but the world's pretty small and most of the quests involve wandering around the same areas blindly until you stumble over such-and-such an item.  Some of the quests are unclear about what you're supposed to do - which makes it feel even more aimless.Also refuses to give you quests all at the same time - literally forcing you to retrace your steps for absolutely no reason other than to pad the game's play-time by a tedious extra 10 hours.The gameplay is pretty fun on the whole, and it's cool to revist the anime; but there's questionable depth to it, and the franchise seems to be rendering older entries obsolete with each sequel, making it of questionable value to spend time exploring every odd corner of the game, etc.For people completely new to the anime, this isn't the best place to start.  You'd be better off streaming Naruto anime online; then move on to streaming Naruto Shippuden before moving onwards.  It's not that the plot is hard to follow, or anything, just that there's hundreds and hundreds of episodes of the anime that cover plot before this game is set - and a lot of the backstory simply isn't covered in this game.On the other hand, if you just want a quick silly anime-themed 3D fighter to mess around with - then you might find you like the setting enough to go back and check out the anime instead.Generally, I'd say steer clear of this game unless it's ridiculously cheap and you literally have nothing better to do.  And be ready to drop it as soon as it becomes a drag, as there's a lot of content that is even more boring than the time wasted unlocking it.I'd suggest using a gamepad to play this game (I use a generic gamepad with X360CE and it works flawlessly); as a 3D fighter it uses both thumb-sticks as well as a D-pad simultaneously, so a fight-stick won't be optimal.  I gather that players using the keyboard are enjoying the game fine though, so YMMV.			"

												The game is fine until you get to one of the bosses at the end. Literally 30 seconds away from killing the boss, the game freezes in the exact same spot for a lot of people. Apparently it freezes there if you don't have an Nvidia graphics card. It's really frustrating because you cant finish the game without it and the last save is like 4 fights ago so if you want to try it again you have to play like 30 minutes just to get back to the crash spot. I played throught it like 5 times trying to fix the crash but no luck.			"

												For the first Naruto game on PC, Namco and Cyberconnect 2 obviously took the last one. This game has what every Naruto fan would want. Good graphics = Check, Huge Roster = Check, Gigantic Story Mode = Check, Simple but fun battle system = Check. The game let you control Naruto's story after Pain is defeated : The village is under rebuilding, Sasuke is still missing and everything is not rainbows and sunshine in the leaf village. Meanwhile Tobi from Akatsuki sides with Kabuto to capture the last two hosts, Naruto and a certain Killer Bee. After Generations, CC2 did once again a great job with the story mode, putting back epic bosses battles and dramatic long cutscenes. CC2 also did some changes to the battle system, two awakening systems and some addons to the support system. The PC version also gets better graphics, up to 1080p with some AA. The only downside is the lack of optimization and the poor controls ( If you don't own a Xbox360 controller for Windows. ). The game includes almost every DLC costumes of the console version and adds up the Uchiha Vs Sage Kabuto from the Full Burst DLC.			"

												This game already simply amazing when it came out. Here's is what's good about this game:◘ Amazing Story but went different from the actual show(Naruto Shippuden) still amazing.◘ Beautiful 3D Graphics, I tip my hat to you CyberConnect 2 from not failing at this from the first game especially.◘ Good cutscenes.◘ So many more playable characters than NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM Generations.◘ Awesome music.◘ Fairly easy to learn the combos and fighting style of each character.◘ Fair ranking system.◘ After the story has ended, you're able to roam free around the shinobi world along with more missions, requests, and survival.◘ Multiplayer is better than previous games.The only thing I can really not like about this game is the community but I'm not surprised and you shouldn't be either if you have played the rest. But you'll find that only sometimes you'll find worthy opponents to beat fairly and actually enjoy the match.I'm still going to give it a 10/10. ☼			"

												The game is fine until you get to one of the bosses at the end. Literally 30 seconds away from killing the boss, the game freezes in the exact same spot for a lot of people. Apparently it freezes there if you don't have an Nvidia graphics card. It's really frustrating because you cant finish the game without it and the last save is like 4 fights ago so if you want to try it again you have to play like 30 minutes just to get back to the crash spot. I played throught it like 5 times trying to fix the crash but no luck.			"

												สำหรับเกมนี้เป็นเกม Naruto ภาคแรกที่ผมได้ลองเล่นใน PC เลยครับ จัดว่าสนุกมากๆ ระบบการต่อสู้ก็ใช้เวลาในการศึกษาไม่นานมาก สามารถทำคอมโบได้รัวๆถ้าคนเล่นเริ่มชำนาญมากๆแล้ว ในส่วนของเนื้อเรื่องนั้น ก็จะอ้างอิงส่วนใหญ่มาจากการ์ตูนครับ สำหรับคนที่ไม่เคยดูการ์ตูนมาก่อนเลยก็อาจจะมีงงๆบ้างในบางจุด แต่คนที่เคยดูมาก่อนแล้ว ก็จะรู้เข้าใจในเนื้อเรื่องและสนุกไปกับมันได้มากกว่าน่ะครับ เกมนี้ทำให้ผมถึงกับต้องกลับไปย้อนดูการ์ตูนตอนเก่าๆเลยล่ะครับ 5555 ผมเองก็อาจจะไม่ใช่แฟนพันธุ์แท้นะครับ แต่ผมคิดว่าเกมนี้เป็นเกมที่ดีมากๆเกมนึงเลย =w=bคะแนนที่ผมให้ : 8.5/10 (ความเห็นส่วนตัวนะครับ)			"

												Great battle simulation game for the naruto shippuden television series, kind of a mortal combat sort of thing, if you have watched anything to do with naruto or naruto shippuden, i suggest you get this game. Though if you are not very far into the shippuden series, the story mode in the game could potentially spoil it for you, and online can sometimes be difficult to play with friends and people in far regions, but other than that, the free battle mode is excellent, you can choose your own fights and play over 100 different challenge matches if you want to, even organise tournaments. This is a fantastic game and i highly recommend it.			"

												As a Naruto fan, this pleased me in various ways. It's a solid and fun fighting game that you can play locally with friends, or take the brawl online. It looks stunning thanks to the graphical revamp that came with Full Burst. Single Player mode also lets you catch up on the story and experience it hands on with massive battles that'll keep you at the edge of your seat(or couch in my case). Can't forget to mention how happy I am to see the series test the waters on the PC platform. This game is a must buy to all Naruto and anime fans alike, and those who love fighting games.			"

I want to watch the story, but not in 50 minute incriments with no way to save your progress in the cutscenes. Honestly, this is the only horrendous thing about the game. Everything else works decently well, but my gosh, if the cutscenes were any longer I think I would just pass out from exhaustion.EDIT: Literally, sat there, playing the story mode for about 2 hours straight without a single save point. I have human needs. Like walking, breathing, and living.			"

												Man this is alot of fun. I been playing through the story mainly which has walk around areas similar to that of the Final Fantasy ones and minor RPG elements. The battles are of course the meat of the game. The cinematics are spectacular and while there is QTEs they don't bother me as much and are never really out of place. IF you are a Naruto fan in any way you will love this game. But even if you arent its still got a very fluid and addictive battle system while being very unique to other fighting games. Personally I missed out on alot of episodes in the latter series but I'm still enjoying the game very much so far. The price is maybe just a tad high but even so it is a VERY polished and well done game. Another thing I'm unsure about is how it controls with keyboard and mouse as I been playing it with a controller. I think either way you will like one this alot!			"

												While the quality of this game in general is very good and I want to play it, I am getting sick to death of lazy♥♥♥♥♥console ports you know a game is a console port when they don't even bother providing proper tutorials and controls for a keyboard/mouse. All you'd need to do is make up some jpegs or some kind of keyboard layout for everybody to see.This is a negative review on principle, don't buy this game unless you're willing to shell out more than £10 for a decent Xbox 360 controller on top of that. If they're going to be so lazy about these ports they may as well provide free PC controllers when you buy the game.

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 throws you into one of Naruto lore's most titanic battles right from the start. Without any preamble you find yourself clashing with the 20-story-tall Nine-Tailed Demon Fox as he ravages Naruto's home village. Except it isn't Naruto's home village, because he hasn't been born yet. Because this is, at last, the series' cataclysmic battle from the past that's been teased for years, but never fully shown before. It's a great first impression, and it sets the pace for the best Ultimate Ninja Storm to date....And you're flung straight into it. First as Naruto's father, who must face off against the masked mastermind controlling the gigantic beast, and then as the Third Hokage in a breathtaking, intense battle that's fought leaping from rooftop to rooftop, circling around this monstrously large terror, coordinating with fellow ninja to hold the creature at bay. This series has pushed its visual spectacle to new heights with every installment, but it’s in moments like this that UNS3 proves to be the most epic and most fanservice-packed.When you’ve finally managed to take down the Demon Fox, there’s no chance to catch your breath – because you’re then flung right back to Naruto's dad, still in the middle of his own fight. UNS3 bounces around like this dynamically. You can be halfway through a major clash, then the focus will shift to another battlefield or point in time and have you fight a second, simultaneous fight before circling you back around to your starting point. It's a brilliant break from tradition that constantly keeps your attention focused and your energy up. It could've gone wrong and been distracting, but since each instance is interwoven with the storyline and serves a plot-advancing purpose, I never felt like I was bounced around for no reason.For the most part, this is the same Ninja Storm combat as before – just a bit faster. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3's feels as if the controls have gotten tighter and more responsive, which was appreciated as I ran, dodged, and teleported my way around each 3D battleground trying to gain a positional advantage over my opponent. Some mechanics introduced in earlier installments have been tweaked, too, like the fact that you can now enter your character's ""Awakened"" state without waiting until their health bar has been depleted to the edge of death.Things are a bit easier, too. UNS3's difficulty settings seem muted, as few fights will offer a true challenge to anyone who's bested any of the earlier games. The most elite players will have to seek out high-level opponents online, because the AI won't keep up with you.At some points during the story, UNS3 offers some confusing decisions about which of two paths you want to follow. They're presented as a choice between the ""Legend"" path or the ""Hero"" path, but aren't both of those good things? I suppose being a ""Legend"" is more epic than just being a plain old ""Hero,"" but it's odd phrasing – and it's made even more perplexing because you earn either Legend Points or Hero Points for picking one over the other, and the distinction between those is never adequately explained.Experimenting with picking different story paths does open up unique cutscenes and fights not previously seen on the cartoon, though, so the confusion is worth enduring. In the opening clash against the Nine-Tailed Fox, for instance, you get to witness Choza Akimichi grow to Godzilla-like proportions and bodyslam the 20-story beast. So it's worth experimenting with, at least.Other than that, as with the earlier Ultimate Ninja Storm games, this one sticks pretty close to retelling the cartoon's plots point for point. Those decision moments are your opportunity to deviate a bit, which keeps things from being a total retread. You’re ultimately funneled back to the core timeline after having witnessed the extra, side content, so the decisions are never too earth-shattering – you can’t end up picking a path where Naruto dies or anything like that.Some fans will no doubt take issue with the story's ending in this installment, as it's non-canonical and probably not a reflection of what will be seen in the show. Alternate story paths diverging from the events of older episodes are fun ""what if?"" scenarios worth taking a look at. But when UNS3 starts projecting out past the scope of currently aired TV episodes and currently published manga to invent its own vision of Naruto's future, the waters get a little choppy.One area that disappointed was the limited exploration in story mode – we're teased with free-roaming areas every once in awhile, but they never amount to much and you're quickly shuffling back into watching the next sequence of cutscenes. Also: do we really need all Fuu the Insect Girl as a playable character? We have over 80 now – it's probably safe to stop scraping the bottom of that barrel.Even if the difficulty skews toward the easy side, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 speeds up combat with more responsive controls, and the visual spectacle of it all is more stunning than ever. Just as importantly, maintaining critical emotional connections to the story, even amidst all the chaos and explosions, overrides my concerns about non-canon story choices and lets us have fun with ""what if"" scenarios. Ultimate Ninja Storm's reputation as Naruto's most consistently enjoyable game series is safe.			"

												I am personally not a fighting game fan, so this is more of for the casual gamer.I have so much fun with Naruto titles, it's just a mixture of the lore, I am a fan of Naruto, and the cool gameplay mechanics that make this game amazing. I have not played the campaign other than the first level (avoiding spoilers since I'm still on Part I of the series) but it is a lot of fun. The boss battles have cool elements that make you feel like you're not just smashing away on the B button within a certain window. Cinematic fighting scenes in the battle keep the battles fresh and exciting.Since I don't know much terminology for a fighting game, I'll just end it here. I rate this game a 9/10 and would definitely recommend to any fans of the Naruto series.			"

												tl;dr I give this game a 6/10. If you are a huge fan of naruto be sure to pick it up, but if you're not you might want to buy something else instead. First let's talk about the story and animation of the game. I really enjoyed the animation sequences and story mode, because it was like watching the anime but in cell-shaded 3D graphics. I have never watched the episodes that this game was based off of, and it made it that much more enjoyable because it caught me up to speed. That being said, the plot was a little too predictable for me and boring at times. The gameplay of this game is OK. It feels kind of like a generic action game, but it has a chakra system and combo system which adds some depth. The kunai throwing does not seem to have any use. The time it takes to throw the kunai is time you could be using to close the gap on the opponent, and the damage the kunai does is so little that it's not even worth it. There are some issues with the combo system though, mainly that there is always going to be one combo that does the most damage and is usable in every situation. To avoid this they should have made multiple top-damage combos that are each used in different situations. The UI and title screen could use some work, and I also had some issues getting the game to run at a proper frame rate. It had nothing to do with my hardware, but with the default settings that the game had. I would say that even though the game is good, the port of the game was very sloppy.I give this game a 6/10. It is an above average game, but does not score higher than a 6 because of its bland combo system and port issues.			"

												This game is something else, I'm having mixed feelings about the gameplay and multiplayerSingleplayer/Campaign: The Single player is alright, however the AI are easy to defeat, I feel like there is no challange to them, maybe its just me.Campaign has almost the original story behind the anime, except you miss out on most of the battles like Danzo VS Sasuke and a couple of others, it begins after Pain destroyed Konohagakure, leaving the village to repair itself, by then Naruto has set out to the five kage summit, on the way there he meets various amounts of people along with you playing most of themUltimate ninja storm 3 offers a unique combat system when you are not fighting One v One, I call it target switching where you're fighting a group of weak AI, sometimes the game will through ""bossess"" which do heavy attacks and are tougher. During the combat there will be a quick option to press A if you're using the controller, no Idea what it is for keyboard, pressing A allows you to jump inbetween targets, getting rid of them faster.Multiplayer/AI Multiplayer: The main thing fighting games are made for is multiplayer, the soul key so players can go head to head, in Naruto, I must say some of the characters are a little unbalanced but that is expected because each and over one of them are differently skilled.Some of them can be slow attacking, most of them are usually ranged and occasionally you'll have the close up fighters like Might-Guy, Rock Lee, Killer Bee, and Ay (Raikage).During the multiplayer experience most of the players will more than likely spam jutsu, this is acceptable because most fighting games are like this.There are loads of tactics, timing, and coordination with your partner (which I'll get to soon).There is another mode which allows you to pick 2 or 1 teamate, specifically from the collection of characters.Your teamate has 3 roles he/she can be, Attack, Guard, and BalancedAlthough the character have many ways to describe each role, EXAMPLE: I choose gaara with guard because in the anime he uses his ""Great Defense"" sand as his defense, or hinata because she has the trigrams thingy which allows her to deflect enemies and projectiles(((AI MULTIPLAYER))):AI multiplayer is playing by yourself with bots, although not recommened because of how boring it can be by yourself, but practice makes perfect :)Training against bots with unlimited health is ideal, there are tons of options in which you can choose to mix up your gameplay.Thats all, so so far I rate this game a 8/10Thanks~ Zambie			"

												Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 throws you into one of Naruto lore's most titanic battles right from the start. Without any preamble you find yourself clashing with the 20-story-tall Nine-Tailed Demon Fox as he ravages Naruto's home village. Except it isn't Naruto's home village, because he hasn't been born yet. Because this is, at last, the series' cataclysmic battle from the past that's been teased for years, but never fully shown before. It's a great first impression, and it sets the pace for the best Ultimate Ninja Storm to date....And you're flung straight into it. First as Naruto's father, who must face off against the masked mastermind controlling the gigantic beast, and then as the Third Hokage in a breathtaking, intense battle that's fought leaping from rooftop to rooftop, circling around this monstrously large terror, coordinating with fellow ninja to hold the creature at bay. This series has pushed its visual spectacle to new heights with every installment, but it’s in moments like this that UNS3 proves to be the most epic and most fanservice-packed.When you’ve finally managed to take down the Demon Fox, there’s no chance to catch your breath – because you’re then flung right back to Naruto's dad, still in the middle of his own fight. UNS3 bounces around like this dynamically. You can be halfway through a major clash, then the focus will shift to another battlefield or point in time and have you fight a second, simultaneous fight before circling you back around to your starting point. It's a brilliant break from tradition that constantly keeps your attention focused and your energy up. It could've gone wrong and been distracting, but since each instance is interwoven with the storyline and serves a plot-advancing purpose, I never felt like I was bounced around for no reason.For the most part, this is the same Ninja Storm combat as before – just a bit faster. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3's feels as if the controls have gotten tighter and more responsive, which was appreciated as I ran, dodged, and teleported my way around each 3D battleground trying to gain a positional advantage over my opponent. Some mechanics introduced in earlier installments have been tweaked, too, like the fact that you can now enter your character's ""Awakened"" state without waiting until their health bar has been depleted to the edge of death.Things are a bit easier, too. UNS3's difficulty settings seem muted, as few fights will offer a true challenge to anyone who's bested any of the earlier games. The most elite players will have to seek out high-level opponents online, because the AI won't keep up with you.At some points during the story, UNS3 offers some confusing decisions about which of two paths you want to follow. They're presented as a choice between the ""Legend"" path or the ""Hero"" path, but aren't both of those good things? I suppose being a ""Legend"" is more epic than just being a plain old ""Hero,"" but it's odd phrasing – and it's made even more perplexing because you earn either Legend Points or Hero Points for picking one over the other, and the distinction between those is never adequately explained.Experimenting with picking different story paths does open up unique cutscenes and fights not previously seen on the cartoon, though, so the confusion is worth enduring. In the opening clash against the Nine-Tailed Fox, for instance, you get to witness Choza Akimichi grow to Godzilla-like proportions and bodyslam the 20-story beast. So it's worth experimenting with, at least.Other than that, as with the earlier Ultimate Ninja Storm games, this one sticks pretty close to retelling the cartoon's plots point for point. Those decision moments are your opportunity to deviate a bit, which keeps things from being a total retread. You’re ultimately funneled back to the core timeline after having witnessed the extra, side content, so the decisions are never too earth-shattering – you can’t end up picking a path where Naruto dies or anything like that.Some fans will no doubt take issue with the story's ending in this installment, as it's non-canonical and probably not a reflection of what will be seen in the show. Alternate story paths diverging from the events of older episodes are fun ""what if?"" scenarios worth taking a look at. But when UNS3 starts projecting out past the scope of currently aired TV episodes and currently published manga to invent its own vision of Naruto's future, the waters get a little choppy.One area that disappointed was the limited exploration in story mode – we're teased with free-roaming areas every once in awhile, but they never amount to much and you're quickly shuffling back into watching the next sequence of cutscenes. Also: do we really need all Fuu the Insect Girl as a playable character? We have over 80 now – it's probably safe to stop scraping the bottom of that barrel.Even if the difficulty skews toward the easy side, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 speeds up combat with more responsive controls, and the visual spectacle of it all is more stunning than ever. Just as importantly, maintaining critical emotional connections to the story, even amidst all the chaos and explosions, overrides my concerns about non-canon story choices and lets us have fun with ""what if"" scenarios. Ultimate Ninja Storm's reputation as Naruto's most consistently enjoyable game series is safe.			"

												I am personally not a fighting game fan, so this is more of for the casual gamer.I have so much fun with Naruto titles, it's just a mixture of the lore, I am a fan of Naruto, and the cool gameplay mechanics that make this game amazing. I have not played the campaign other than the first level (avoiding spoilers since I'm still on Part I of the series) but it is a lot of fun. The boss battles have cool elements that make you feel like you're not just smashing away on the B button within a certain window. Cinematic fighting scenes in the battle keep the battles fresh and exciting.Since I don't know much terminology for a fighting game, I'll just end it here. I rate this game a 9/10 and would definitely recommend to any fans of the Naruto series.			"

												I'm a huge naruto fan and i must say that even though this is a great game you have to be careful what you do or it'll crash. Note: that not everyone has this problem but in the unfortunate event that you do 1. Never! and i stress never use Shikamaru's ultimate, and if you are playing online pray that your oppenent doesn't use it, or the game will crash 2. the fight between the 5 kage and madara towards the very end of it will crash which sucks because then you cant finish the story, but you can still unlock the rest of the characters in the one free battle mode. So why do i recommend this game? Because given that it crashes in a few spots it is still a solid entry into a solid series, BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!			"

												It's an odd feeling enjoying a game only until you get good at it. The main fighting part of the game becomes repedetive quite quickly as the AI demands you pull no punches and rely on the same unblockable moves and counters in order to progress. The re-imagined scenes from the anime are spot on and the animations (on the most part) are smooth and responsive while actually playing the game.It's not a perfect game by far but, for me at least, it was well worth it's sale price... I'm afraid I didnt have the time or inclination to try its online vs options so I can't comment on that.7/10			"

												To all of the people who say you can't play with keyboard, yes you can. Well, at least I can. The ""Keyboard"" config is at the bottom of the controller configuration list on startup.I absolutely love this game, and I love the Ultimate Ninja Storm Series. I bought 2, 3, Revolution, and 4. I honestly wish I had a PS3 to play Ultimate Ninja Storm 1.Having Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, I have to say that there isn't VERY much to the story mode. Sure, they added Adventure, but it really isn't the same. Playing UNS:3 is great, and this is a perfect example of what Revolution could have been(They got rid of a story mode for Ultimate Ninja Tournament. It wasn't a bad mode, just a bad move.) Sure, I guess it had that Mecha Naruto story, but that was literally Ultimate Ninja Tournament with extra battles in the end.So, if you want a PERFECT game of the Ultimate Ninja series, I recommend Ultimate Ninja Storm 3. If you want less than perfect, yet still very enjoyable, get Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. If you want, ""What exactly in the f*** were you thinking?"", yet okay then get Ultimate Ninja Storm: Revolution.			"

												By the time you finish this game, you will have spent more then $200-300 on ice cream and kleenex, because boiiii, lemme tell ya somethin. This, Game, Is, Goooood. If you're a fan of the series, you'll be fighting the urge to unleash that tsunami of tears building up behind them eyes, as you fight your way through every heavily narrated and story-rich chapter. Fun gameplay, and pretty good graphics. I do however recommend a controller for this game. If you can get over that, this game is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Espetacular jogo baseado no ótimo anime Naruto Shippuden! Você vai conhecer a história do jogo desde seus primórdios e acompanhar o decorrer do anime desde a vitória de Naruto contra Pain até antes da revelação da face do mascarado ""Madara"" durante a Terceiro Guerra Ninja (o jogo não mostra quem está por trás, mas vc já sabe, né?)! São quase centenas de personagens destraváveis para jogar, o modo história é muito legal e as batalhas são muito fluídas, com personagens com os mais variados tipos de habilidade e estratégias de combates. Isso com um controle muito simples de se usar. Enfim, excelente jogo de luta e ação, recomendado para todos os fãs da série Naruto Shippuden!			"

												This game is a extremly nice addiction to the storyline for all fans of masashi kishimoto´s Naruto,especcialy if you are into turnament like fighting games.The graphics of this are ok and every character has a own attackset, there are also multible outfits for most characters.Huge plus u can fight outside the storymode with a good set of characcters (also with up to 2 support characters).If you are used to play with a controler it helps here, because it tooks a few hours to get the controls right on the keyboard,(you have to set the keybindings manually bevore starting to play, but can change it later so experiment a bit).Also try to test the different combos for the characters in the training mode to get a hint of the capabilities and weaknesses of the characters.Positive:+ Good story addition to the known Naruto plot [Epiloge is the Attack of the Kyuubi :3]+ Graphic acceptable, nealry no glitchines and the armature (character skeleton) looks well set.+ Mulitble characters to play with in Singlebattle, Turnament -> also online+ Price is ok, would have bought it for more ^^+ The AI ist to dump and can be trouble (if you enable all moves/attacks/etc. for them).+ Extermly nice Bossfight with Kurama ^^Negative:- Keyboardcontrols needs some time to addjust, will give you a handycap in onlineplay against experienced controller players, but it is possible to finish the games with the best grade.- Onlineplay can be a bit glitchy, thanks to laggs, but it doesnt really reduce the fun ^^- Some translations of the subtitles are not really accurate, so i switches to english and the spoken language to japan.   (nice if you are used to watch the anime with eng subs ^^)Recommendation: Watch the trailers and if you like this kind of games BUY IT!			"

												This game is a extremly nice addiction to the storyline for all fans of masashi kishimoto´s Naruto,especcialy if you are into turnament like fighting games.The graphics of this are ok and every character has a own attackset, there are also multible outfits for most characters.Huge plus u can fight outside the storymode with a good set of characcters (also with up to 2 support characters).If you are used to play with a controler it helps here, because it tooks a few hours to get the controls right on the keyboard,(you have to set the keybindings manually bevore starting to play, but can change it later so experiment a bit).Also try to test the different combos for the characters in the training mode to get a hint of the capabilities and weaknesses of the characters.Positive:+ Good story addition to the known Naruto plot [Epiloge is the Attack of the Kyuubi :3]+ Graphic acceptable, nealry no glitchines and the armature (character skeleton) looks well set.+ Mulitble characters to play with in Singlebattle, Turnament -> also online+ Price is ok, would have bought it for more ^^+ The AI ist to dump and can be trouble (if you enable all moves/attacks/etc. for them).+ Extermly nice Bossfight with Kurama ^^Negative:- Keyboardcontrols needs some time to addjust, will give you a handycap in onlineplay against experienced controller players, but it is possible to finish the games with the best grade.- Onlineplay can be a bit glitchy, thanks to laggs, but it doesnt really reduce the fun ^^- Some translations of the subtitles are not really accurate, so i switches to english and the spoken language to japan.   (nice if you are used to watch the anime with eng subs ^^)Recommendation: Watch the trailers and if you like this kind of games BUY IT!			"

												I'm very surprised by the effectiveness of the storytelling of this game. I don't much care for Naruto, the anime. I'm merely a game collector and decided to give this game a try one day randomly. I found my eyes glued to the screen during many of the cinematics. It was all very impactful. The music, animation, voice acting-- all brilliant.If you have even the slightest interest in Naruto, even if you dislike the series for its episodic nature, this is perhaps the best way to experience the story unfold.

												I really wasn't expecting much from this game I only have it because a friend gave it to me and I felt obligated to play it, but I'm glad I did because the game is actually a lot of fun.I don't like the anime, so I really don't think I have any kind of bias supporting it at all. This is probably why I am getting sick of the story mode right now since the cut-scenes can drag on for quite a while and I found myself skipping them a lot when I got the general jist of what the scene was about (sometimes even before that) and I would sometimes lose the context of a curtain fight.But this IS a fighting game so the story isn't important what is important is the fighting system and I really like it. It's quite unique from other fighting games I've played and still manages to keep a kind of ""easy to learn, hard to master"" element. Most of the characters are pretty ballenced, except for the ones that have very fast acting far-ranged moves (like the exploding birds from what-his-face) that make fighting them with another character a real chore when it requires a lot more skill to beat someone who's just spamming the X button all day that is just as strong as special attacks, but doesn't use any energy for some reason. I wish the game had a few more options though, it's basically a boring story mode, or fight other people online. With the amount of resorces the delveopers put into the story mode I feel like they could have toned it down a little to allow room for other features.But I digress, the fighting system was enough fun for me to sink more then 10 hours into the game, I just feel like the game could have used at least one other feature instead of another 3 hours of cut-scenes for the story mode.

												I'm a huge naruto fan and i must say that even though this is a great game you have to be careful what you do or it'll crash. Note: that not everyone has this problem but in the unfortunate event that you do 1. Never! and i stress never use Shikamaru's ultimate, and if you are playing online pray that your oppenent doesn't use it, or the game will crash 2. the fight between the 5 kage and madara towards the very end of it will crash which sucks because then you cant finish the story, but you can still unlock the rest of the characters in the one free battle mode. So why do i recommend this game? Because given that it crashes in a few spots it is still a solid entry into a solid series, BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!			"

												A Very Nice Anime Game.The Fighting is not too complicate to control and give the Feeling of Awesomeness like the Anime.Totally playable with Keyboard, (Key bind setting in the launcher) But Controllers are recommended. (I play with Keyboard All this time)Hours of Story Mode (~80% watching ~20% playing) Then Exploring the world afterwards, collect the history pages and Fight battles of the past. There are Some QTE in Story mode that rewards Special Cutscenes during the story gameplay.Some of the story battle might feels a bit lacking something (like the Beasts fight)Also There's [Online Play] to test your Ninja skills Online. (Havn't try it much yet)And Free Fight mode where you can fight Locally or fight with A.I. or just Practice.Overall I think This game is worth its cost. Totally.Edit : PS. I've never read or Watch Naruto before playing this game. (of course i've seen it sometimes) But after playing this game I feel like i want to.			"

												It's an odd feeling enjoying a game only until you get good at it. The main fighting part of the game becomes repedetive quite quickly as the AI demands you pull no punches and rely on the same unblockable moves and counters in order to progress. The re-imagined scenes from the anime are spot on and the animations (on the most part) are smooth and responsive while actually playing the game.It's not a perfect game by far but, for me at least, it was well worth it's sale price... I'm afraid I didnt have the time or inclination to try its online vs options so I can't comment on that.7/10			"

												I'm not a fan of Naruto. In fact, I'm generally annoyed by the characters and contrived plot. I am, however, a huge fan of developer CyberConnect2, the creators of the Dot Hack series, Asura's Wrath, and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle. As far as cel-shading, animation, and action goes, CC2 are the best at it. And this shines even in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3.It took me around 10 hours to complete the single player story. Aside from a little walking around, you get huge battles that are so jaw-droppingly awesome that the only other developers I can think of who'd pull it off is Platinum. If you don't like Naruto like me, that's okay because you can just skip all of the cutscenes. Boss fights are replayable as soon as you complete them, which is a major plus if you love revisiting epic parts of the game without starting from the beginning of the story mode.As far as ports go, this is just the console version slapped on to the PC. Meaning you get no graphics options other than resolution and v-sync. It's not a broken PC port, it's a very solid port that will definitely run as long as your computer meets the specs.			"

												Firstly: The game is hardlocked at 30 fps. This would be no major issue if you reached the 30 fps mark all the time but unfortunately you don't. The funny thing is, if you got a high- or mid-end system you're most likely going to be stuck at 15-20 fps. This cannot be altered unless you use some 3rd-party tools to stress your gpu, e.g. ""Heavyload"".My Hardware: CPU ~ i5 4670k @ 3,4 GHzGPU ~ R9 290 @ 4GB VRAM8 GB Ram Secondly: You barely have any gfx options. What you get is: resolution, aspect ratio, vsync, supersampling and that's it.Lastly: The sound options consist of: music volume and speech volume. This would be no major issue either if the sound-fx wouldn't be so ridiculously loud.Conclusion: The Pc-Port of this game is absolutely atrocious. I can't get myself to recommend it in any way. Even if you're a hardcore Naruto fan I'd recommend you to stay away. These are all issues I discovered while ""playing"" the game for 1 hour. There might be more I didn't discover yet. So be prepared if you decide to buy it nonetheless.Edit: One of the Amd Beta Drivers seemed to resolve the 15-20 fps lock issue. The performance in singleplayer is very poor regardless.And don't expect to play this game on dedicated servers, it's peer-to-peer all the way.			"

												The PvP is really nice. Yet Single Player campaign is booooooring and totally desynchronized with Japanese voices. The effect is you waiting for the animation to be finished after you've read the subs and listened to the dialogue. If you watched the anime, you can always skip and the game turns into series of battles with useless walking around the map from time to time. Oh! And the anime cinematics are circa 70% of the game if not more!The only reasons for you to buy the game can be:- you're the fan of the series and want to fight with friends- the game is on a huge saleIf you want to know the story, just watch the anime instead.

												Great game, tons of characters. Not going to get too in depth, but I've played a few other Naruto games on the 360 and PS3 and this one is my favorite. Only complaints would be that the open-world aspect is too limited and doesn't feel very ninja-like at all, and the online matchmaking is kind of empty as of now. Hopefully the popularity will grow, as it is a great fighting game.			"

												This port is all-around dreadful. The game is hard locked at 30 fps with slow-down problems when multiple supports are on screen. Online is the most abysmal experience in any fighting game to date due to lag, slow down, and more transition errors you can count even with max strength connections. The only saving grace is the story mode (warning the storm games have their own continuity). The aftermath of the story mode has the most interesting side stories to date in the series. In terms of boss fight quality, I'd say most are above storm 1 but not quite storm 2 quality, the others are of lower quality to storm 1 or around the quality of the kakazu fight. Unfortunatley none of the fights are of pain quality animation from storm 2, but tsunade vs madara does attempt to give pain a run for his money. If you’re getting it to experience a slightly altered timeline from the anime and manga, then go ahead and buy it. If you actually looking for a fighting game than no. The characters are horribly balanced, and the net code for online is worst I’ve seen in a long time. In the end I can’t recommend any storm game past 2 which did everything, with exception of the story after match, just better go play that, or play a good fighting game like naruto storm 1, mk 9, injustice, or street fighter 4. P.S only fights I felt they really messed up on were konan vs madara and naruto, itachi, and bee vs nagato they were really underwelming in comparison to their annime counterparts. Also why the hell was gaara a boss fight if they wern't going to do anything with him.			"

												It's a damn shame that a game so good such as this one has to be down voted by me for one and only one reason, the storymode bug that crashes the game. The first one was with Shikamaru's Ultimate Jutsu, everytime I used it the game would just shut down on me, I coped with it and beat that battle without using it, now I'm at the final battle with Madara and the QTE crashes the game. It's been a year, why isn't this fixed? I'm disappointed.			"

												This game looks good, gives great atmosphere and excellent music, but the battle system is not well designed.  Battles are very fast, some moves are over powered.  The battle either ends quickly with enermies spaming attack you, or you spaming attack the enermies.  I was hoping for something like FF Dissidia, I know its's unfair to compare two games which have different styles, but this game is not for me.			"

												Good game but the community is absolutely gone. I've tried over the course of 3 days to find people to play with, searching in every region in the world, and nothing. I found one game in these three days and it was somene turning on and off their internet so it kept disconnecting and reconnecting. I couldn't even pause and quit.Shame because it's a fun game, and with the humble bundle you'd think there'd be a resurgence of players but it doesnt look like it. Really upsettting because I already beat the hardest tournament, and I want to test my skills against a real player.			"

 I have played enough of this game, and I think Its time to write review about it.  I recommend this game for all fighting genre lovers!  Lets start with good things: + Amazing Storyline, If you don't want to watch anime, you will understand what happened in hundreds of episodes just by playing this game, Of course some things are changed in Naruto Storm 3 Story compared to the original Anime.+ Great Graphics, If you enable SuperSampling on 2X, The game Is gorgeous.+ A lot of Playable Characters.+ Adventure Mode(In story mode) Is really enjoyable, There are a lots of missions to keep you busy.+ Online mode, You can fight against your friends, or someone who you don't know.+ All dlcs are In this package, Simply you purchase the base game, And you have all dlcs.+ Uchiha brothers story Is Implanted, To unlock It you have to do few tasks which takes time, But In the end, It does worth it. Now the bad things: - Online mode has few problems.- 30fps lock- Adventure mode might get boring for you, Because mostly you go from point A, to point B.- It would be nice to have locked support characters as playable characters.- Cutscenes are long, But It Isn't con for me, For most people It should be.- There are lots of unnecessary loading pauses.- Some of the characters hasn't been updated since Storm 2.- Sometimes camera bugs out.- Sometimes you will notice glitches.Overall I recommend this game for fighting genre lovers, And mostly for Anime: Naruto Shippuden watchers. I rate It 8/10 and recommend buying this on sale, Because last game of Storm franchise arrived already, and If you watch Anime: Naruto Shippuden, You may think storyline Is kinda outdated compared to the current anime storyline.

												Must buy....really solid game.....EDIT: I started playing this game again, (When I wrote the review, I only played about 5% of the story) and I have to say im just completely blown away from the polish, story, music, and last but not last gameplay. This game just might move into my top 10 stories of all time for video games. I have no idea about nartuo, I honestly thought it was a little kids series....but its not. The story in this game is just simply amazing, the voices (I listen in jap) are amazing graphics and effects I would assume are just like the show. Its just so well done. I wish I was a fan of the show I would be going nuts over this game.The QTEs....Ive never seen QTE work so well in a video game....this game makes me want to do more QTE. Its just sooooo epic....the system it uses is perfect as well....the better you do....you unlock a secert part of the cutscene....so even if you suck...you dont have to restart or anything (i think, i never failed the qte so im not sure). They just did it right when it comes to QTE.The story....wow...moved me in ways i dont feel comfortable talking about on steam :PThe story combined with the AAA music just makes your emotions go insane....its really remarkable!Just a great game....I will make sure to purchase all further nartuo titles.....also going to look into the TV series....

												Sorry for my spelling, puncuation, and lack of sentence flow in advance. This is my first  review.Naruto Shippuden UNS3 Full Burst is a outstanding game for both Naruto fans (like myself) and for the avid fighting game fan (like myself). Think Street Fighter with a few more mechanics and a whole hell of a lot of chacters to choose from. To the not Naruto fan. I do highly advise you get this game *on sale*; if you don't care for the cut scenes; you can skip them by hitting start. Just play the game and I promise you, if you are a fan of fighting games (Tekken, Street Fighter, Killer Instinct, SNK vs Capcom,etc) you will adore this game.  For the on the fence Naruto fan, I can not express this enough BUY THIS GAME! *Espically on sale* Not only is the actually gameplay outstanding, the cutscenes and the Secret Events will definatley invoke some good ol Naruto memories *DEH FEELS*. I just finished Kakashi vs Edo Tensei Zabuza , I can remeber sitting on the couch as a youngsteer and watching little tibits of that episode as if it were yesterday. (80% of the Zabuza and Haku arc). ANNNNNNYWAY its a outstanding game that everyone should at least try. If you like fighting games but, if you don't thats cool to. Remeber you can skip the lengthy cutscenes (and trust me there are a few) by hitting the start button.  "

												The story is amazing! One of the best stories I was fortuitous to play. This game is quite expensive but I managed to get this game for about $8.00! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a good story to play. The local multiplayer is also marvelous! My brother and I played this game and it was so entertaining we could play the game till 12 pm the next day! My personal favorite is Naruto's cowboy skin that makes him look like McCree from Overwatch. Some cons of the game were as follows:1. V-Sync was making the game so much harder to run2. Controller settings are weirdBut overall I would say this is one of the best games I have ever played in a long time and would highly recommend it to anyone especially when it is on sale!			"

												Note: Don't buy this game at full price. Yeah, I know, I received this product for free but still.. it isn't really worth it considering how long the game has been out imo. [+/-] Overall, This game is alright. If you're a big fan of naruto like me you'll obviously enjoy this game. The main storyline doesn't offer much to be honest, But the battles are incredibly fullfilling which make up for the lack of content this game has. (Even with DLC it's still pretty lackluster). [-] The Combat is very straight forward but rather monotonous. You'll pretty much be mashing the B button the entire time while occasionally pressing the x button to throw a shuriken and Y to rebuild chakra. You're only given about (4)? different types of combos you can do by tilting the stick in different directions but other than that the combat isn't very flavorful. [+] The visual effects in the game are surely a treat. Flashy Ninjutsu, Huge explosions, Climactic Cutscenes, Y'know things to surely get you pumpin' and hyped up during your gameplay. Which is a plus! [+] The roster is quite expansive which is great. This allows for much variety especially when playing online.. IF THE ONLINE PLAY WAS ACTUALLY STABLE THOUGH. [-] Um..Yeah the online play is truly abysmal in the PC version of storm. Which definitely left a bad taste in my mouth since the 'Ultimate Adventure Mode' doesn't offer much. It lowers the amount of replayability greatly. ):<This game gets a 7/10 from me though. - Meh story mode (Awful free roam, little to no Interaction with NPCs, Extremely Linear)- Entertaining battles but with boring mechanics.- A great roster.- Nearly unplayable online mode.Written By: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dereden/ "

Posted: January 21, 2014
												I picked up this title when it was released on Steam, partially for my significant other, who is a Naruto fan, and partially for myself, as a fan of the games.  For the record, let me start off by saying that I feel the manga is only so-so, and that I hate the anime.  Let that generate whatever feelings you want going into this, because I have always been a fan of the games.Namco Bandai and Cyber Connect 2 teamed up to bring a part of the Naruto Shippuden world in this action/adventure title.  The game sort of feels like playing any one of the Tales games, but has a few unique elements to it that set it apart.  The combat system is very simplified, clearly intended for children to be able to pick up and button mash to be able to make it through the beginning parts of the game and develop the skill of pushing buttons with purpose as they play through it.  This works out for adults too because the game has no real tutorial mode, not for how to fight at any rate, and the moves list is very rudimentary.  Combats are smooth, however, due to this lack of complication.  You can get out of combos with the substitution technique, which many newer arcade fighters could benefit from some way to get out of a stun lock, but the characters get stuck in combos easily once you start them, so the only way to protect yourself in some situations is that technique.  Buttons aren't particularly hard to reach or remember, though it is a little awkward at first.  Notably, I have not tried the keyboard controls for the game at this point, only the xbox360 controller I use on my pc.  Local multiplayer, of course, is a nice feature.  The game appears to support up to 8 controllers, from what I can tell, but I'm not entirely certain on that.  I know for certain that it does four controllers, which is useful for the built in tournament system put in the game.As for the story mode, Bandai delivers, much like they do with the Tales series.  If I did have any complaint on this part of the game, it would be that you don't have enough influence over the events like you do in a true rpg.  You'll be spending up to a half an hour through some cut-scene sequences, but the scenes are beautifully done and give a lot of consolidated insight into the events that take place throughout the animation series in a much more concise manner.  For those of you not wanting to sit through dozens of filler episodes with the characters monologuing or screaming an entire episode as they power up their ultimate attack that will actually go off two or three episodes later, then this is the way you want to experience the Naruto story and world.  For the rest of you, I'm sure you have no trouble tracking down the anime episodes to watch through at your leisure.  The ability to explore the world would be more interesting with more to do in the world, but I won't say that the game is bad by the lack of stuff to do.  It is, at its core, the same thing that the Naruto anime is...a fight show, and it does it far better than the anime does.   While I tend to avoid games from other media like movies and whatnot, this game stands out with masterfully rendered cutscenes that look like they were taken straight out of the animation, but are actually simply redone with the 3D models of the characters in the game.  The voice acting for the English side is the same as the US releases, so the performances are at least consistent.  If you like that, there you go.  For those of you that prefer the Japanese voices, Bandai was awesome enough to leave the original Japanese voice sets in the game, so you can experience it with the higher quality performance of the original voice actors from Japan.  At $40 on steam, the game is pricy, but less expensive than other arcade battlers and comes with a robust cast of characters, costumes, and hours of gameplay.  I highly recommend this title to not only fans of the anime, but people who aren't fans of the the series, but like a good fight game.  It is well done, and offers a lot that many other games could learn from.Update:  I just tried playing the game online for the first time and had severe problems with being disconnected over and over again.  This is something that will need to be fixed, as the game is just about unplayable online right now.			"

												Naruto and Sasu♥♥♥♥ fight against pein and madora while tobe n kabupo are being all ""Plot and feels no Jutus"" and Naruuto was like ""Fox man, give me your energy"" and the fox man is like ""♥♥♥♥♥you naruuuto, Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!"" and Naruuuuto is like ""Ermergawd there is a war going on"" and Naruuuuuto and Wasp go on the fight in the war against Fadora and Kobe saying ""My name is Naruuuuuto Uchiha and I FIGHT THE POWA"" and Homie and Dora were like ""No, the too of you are two awesome"" and then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ending happens where Steve Tarada ♥♥♥♥s off since the 5 Cage are better than some zombie that isnt a zombie yet and Sasugay and Itchy are busy fighting Snake man where snake man is like ""sssss my♥♥♥♥♥♥is a python"" and Nick Fury is ""No ♥♥♥♥ing snakes on my ♥♥♥♥ing ninja world"" and Attachy did some izanagi BS from the Japanese mythos you find on wikipedia and dragon boy is trapped in some deus ex machina BS that Tite Trollbo  wrote when he was aizen.All in all a good game but the 30fps diminishes my boner for Naruuuuuuuto Naruuuuuuuuto/10			"

												If you like the most generic and sloppy inconsistant story. A cast of characters ranging from Generic shoenen females; Crawwwling in my skin, I am darkness reincarnate. With crazzzy superpowers like a ability to ♥♥♥♥ing drop da bomb and go full on nuke your♥♥♥♥♥action. This might be the game for you. There are many things great about it, it actually has a pretty damn good fighting system. One of my favorite things is about it is how the equivalent to America in the game is ran by a a Hot sexy blone with some damn good size♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't let your little brother near the game when she is in that baithing suit your controller will be a sticky mess if he was left alone playing too long. Needless to say it does have its drawbacks. Like a subpar internet matching connection. I was actually happier when I didn't find a match and save my♥♥♥♥♥from getting kicked by the only guy online who had over 1500 wins and sub 100 losses. The devs at least give updates and the large cast of characters may get updated for free. They try and keep them well balanced ontop of it, Well as long as your not a scrub. But I am sure you know how it feels to be if you are from the PC MASTER RACE. All in all I give it a 7/10, it is pretty good  worth it if it goes on sale.			"

												first of all i watched naruto anime until now and i have all the previous Naruto games on ps2 and ps3 so i am a big naruto video game fan but that doesnt mean i am gonna give it 10/10 because of that and i am reviewing this so i could get a steam achievment :)Story:Since i wath the anime i skiped all of the cinematics they are not as interesting as in anime,subtitles are made for english language not japanesse  so the words are much simplier and the writing is a little dull like its made for a lot younger audience but anyway it explains the story well.There are a lot cinematics,a lot more than in  previous naruto storm games,you dont have to watch the anime to play this but youl have to play previous storm games because you are gonna be confused.Story wise the story is stupid but its not bandai namcos fault its the manga writer fault and i am not taking this in the account since the manga cant be changed.Graphics:This is not so good pc port,it only has options for resolution and anti anialising(supersampling in this case),so yeah not very good and its 30fps like on consoles.But it  runs solidly,i didnt encounter any bugs or so.Graphics are pretty,animation is amazing,now it character move more fluently than any naruto game before, and are much better than on consoles,but only if you max it out  the difference is big though, but of course its gonna look better becase it has 1080p support.GameplayThis is not the best naruto game thought in terms of improvments and new stuff The gameplay is completely the same as naruto ultimate ninja storm generations.Although it has little improvment over storm 2 and generation but this is the first naruto game on pc so not gonna count that much.The game has amazing quick time events with beautifull animation so those fights look much better than in anime obviously.Those quick time events happen in some major boss fight and are the main reason for me that i play the story,without them i would be little boring.There are side missons after the story and they add many hours to the game(but they are repetitive and not so interesting),there are also mods like survival which you have to unlock it through story,there is a tournament,free battle obviously and a 100 missions for which you get 10 wallpapers.There are over 70 characters or someting,and that is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Battles are interesting cause you can choose your main character with one or two support characters.You have 4 combos,ninjutsu,ultimate jutsu and awakenings(on some charaters you can awakened them at any time).I wont into details cause you have to wathc the gameplay. Online gameplay:If you are now buying these to play online and if you have xbox 360 or ps3 then you should choose the console version.The reason for that is cause  there are like 20 ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYERS NOW,i even remeber all of their ♥♥♥♥ing names,on consoles there are much more and much more variaton between players.Also you better have a good internet for this cause it will lag as ♥♥♥♥.If it works well and if there are players it is interesting.There are 1000 ninja info cars which are used to display your online profile and there are titles cause you cant write on info cards for yourself so you have to use the maid titles in the game sound:japanesse is better than english language at least in my opinion and i am sure many people think like thisVerdict:i reccomend this game,its a great game,story last if you wath the cinematics about 10 hours but if you dont,you can finish it in about 7 hours,with missons it last 17 hours,it ads  lot of hours and there are mods like survival which you have to unlock it,and there is also a tourneament and a 100 missions for a  wallpaper, so the game lasts 30+ hours if you want to complete 100%,my final grade would be 8/10 which is a great,if this wasnt a first storm game i would give it probably a 7/10 :D "

												As someone who never got  into the Naruto series, this is a very fun game. The fighting mechanics are very simple and fluid and the gameplay modes are fun. Many people say its a bad port but it runs well on my system, never dipping under 60fps. Before picking this game up, i highly recommend buying a xbox controller due to it being a console port. Overall this is an amazing fighting game that i plan on playing a lot. 9/10			"

												Been playing this game for a while and haven't even been bothered playing the story mode as much, mainly because I owned it on the PS3 (not Full Burst though, just the original one). Since I owned it on the PS3 I just been playing Versus on there and instead of bothering doing the extra boss fight on the PC version. But once I got rid of my PS3 version one, I started playing on the PC version..You're playing as Naruto (duh..), as you play through NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst story mode, you'll come across epic boss fights with quick time event which makes it even better. As well with the music placed within the background during the fight.NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst, story mode has many cut scenes and barely any fights. Like you could walk between 1-2 area and then a cut scene will activate if you're still doing the story mode and have not beaten it yet. But it'll be worth it because you'll get to know more about Naruto Shippuden (If you have not seen the anime on where the game is base off.) As well, get ready to get to have urges to cry! Naruto Shippuden story mode has quite of bits of moment that gets you to have urges to cry. Including the extra final boss fight, where Sasuke and Itachi face of against Sage Kabuto who claims to be a god. But he is kinda of unbeatable so during the match is basically just stalling Kabuto for Itachi could just cast a visual jutsu which keeps on looping the battle in Kabuto's eyes over and over endlessly. Overall about the story, everything else in NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 3 Full Burst is amazing, the Art, Combat and Story Mode.			"

												A warning to anyone thinking of buying this game: This game requires an Xbox controller to play. Valve once again fail to mention that this is a shoddy console port from Namco Bandai, like all of their other PC games seem to be, and is practically unplayable without a controlller.Edit: Also, I forgot to mention that this game has the annoying feature of needing you to walk around between fights. I'd prefer just Mortal Kombat style, but it forces you to walk around places with bad camera angles.Not only that, but you don't regain health for each new fight. So if you run out of health items, you get stuck getting one-shotted at the next fight.			"

												The best anime fighter i've had the pleasure to play the productions values are incredible the game looke incredible the story mode starts from just after the pain fight and ends further then the anime (though i believe a few of the endings of the battles are changed. couple of things to note; Controller is essential but that should be obvious given that it's a fighting game. second: The game is locked at 30fps again for neccessity to keep the flashy ultimate jutsu's and everything looking smooth. Third: The graphics settings are fairly mediocre though it does scale nicely depending on your rig you have no control of the settings apart from the resolution and if you want AA 2X or off. All that being said this is a fantastic port it runs beautifully on Windows 7 and 8.1 and i look forward to putting many more hours in :)			"

												The graphical fidelity and the overall efficiency of this game on PCs is amazing. This is a very well made port of an already super-polished video game. Game's design is modeled after the anime, and at most point it looks infinitely better than the anime. It looks downright beautiful. However, compliments have to end here.The story mode, in my opinion, is too close to the anime. Cutscenes between playable segments, although beautifully animated, sometimes even last longer than your average episode of the anime. If you don't have any prior information about Naruto lore, this game will not be able to ease you in, and in fact will bore and confuse you further. The playable modes in the story mode switch between open-world mode, fighting mode and QTE segments in more climactic fights. The open world mode is incredibly shallow, not much to do other than finding obviously placed loot and talking to NPCS; not sure why they even bothered making it. After finishing the story mode, the entire map is open to explore, but all the newly opened quests feel like a huge time sink. The huge chunk of the playable segments is fighting and it is done alright. There is a branching path system that doesn't really do all that much but it's good that it is there. All fights do try to introduce little quirks to them, which is nice because all characters feel pretty much the same when it comes to control them, thus it would be very boring to go from fight to fight if it wasn't for little differences every once in a while. The QTE segments aren't too long or annoying, but they're problematic as in every other game. The animated segments are done brilliantly but as you are only focused on button prompts, the player doesn't get much chance to really enjoy them. The story mode takes around 10-12 hours to complete but if you skip all the cutscenes I envision it taking you not more than 3-4 hours. There are sometimes hours of playtime between save points so beware. Overall, don't play the story mode unless you have an entire day to waste.The other two modes are Offline and Online battles. Every character plays the same, and only differentiating factor between them is how they use their super moves. Every character gets only two super moves and one ""Awakening"" mode (which might bestow the character one or two more highly damaging moves). These facts all do in fact hinder the borderline immense character selection.If you have no interest in Naruto, don't get it. If you have, you're better off with waiting for a sale. It does not offer either a liberating open world experience like the Naruto games on XBOX360, nor it does offer a highly sophisticated fighting game experience. However, the game is gorgeous and stays true to the original material.			"

												6/10Obviously a game for Naruto fans and Naruto fans alone. It's quite clearly a 'movie' license type game, which should instantly let you know what to expect: not a great deal of depth or care and in general a rushed game that has the paint job but not all the soul. Does that make it a bad game? Not at all, but definitely not worth full price. I was lucky enough to pick it up on a 50% off deal, which I still felt was expensive for its end result, but probably fair in the grand scheme of things. Definitely do not pick up at full price unless you're a die-hard fan that wants to feel slightly more connected to the style of fighting and theme.Does the game feel like you're playing the series?To a point, the fights are generally supremely easy (with and without controller (though controller is highly recommended)) and the AI never serves up anything too challenging. The fights that have certain conditions or handicaps are more challenging and fun, but they're few and far between. Multiplayer is naturally more challenging but it is peer-to-peer, so it's not as precise or as rewarding as server-based dueling. And if you pick up the game at this late stage you can expect to be ganked thoroughly throughout. Is the plot any good?Well, it's effectively the abridged version of the anime series. So it cuts and chops pieces with vigor or adds in random fights/conclusions where they don't belong. On top of that it's not really a good tribute to the anime series either, as it gives no or very little attempt to re-create scenes and scenarios in their accurate setting. This means that you'll often have long (and I mean long) cutscenes in a barren environment when, by comparison, in the anime, it's in a city or special setting that accentuates the emotion. There is also zero lip-synching, which always serves as a giant distraction. As a port, is it infuriating?Keyboard user? Yes. Gameplay methodology and movement? Yes. It's strictly for conoles this game, and the PC port was to drive profit from a select group of Naruto fans. Can you still suceed with a keyboard though? Yes, the fights are never too difficult and with enough time keyboard is just as good as the controller; but if you try multiplayer you're looking at a very strict handicap. I love Naruto, but I'm unsure about buying the game; what would you say?I was in the same position, and whilst I had a bit of fun with the game; it didn't live up to expectation. As stated earlier: it is, effectively, a movie-title game; which inherently means the paint job is there but the care and soul isn't. If you've got money to spend then sure you might as well buy it and have some fun with it... But if you're on a budget or would rather save the money, then I would not recommend it to you. It's not a full Naruto experience and game design is on the slim side with elements that exist for little to no reason. I wouldn't say it's a game for the median age of most Naruto watchers (16-25), but rather a game for casuals or under 16s that don't really know any better. Conclusion:If you're on a console, then yes I would say get this game. It's meant to be played with friends and fans of the series rather than independantly or online. The game holds more value in that lens. But on the pc, a naturally solo experience, it falls flat thanks to slim game design, pitifully easy AI, and a general lack of care and soul.			"

												Great game for a Naruto fan and the game isn't too long but isn't too short. This game is one of my favorite games because of the length of the game and the intensity.

												Disclaimer:I won't bother much with graphics, sound or gameplay for this review.I first played Naruto Shippuden UNS3FB on PS3 years back and as a fan that has watched the whole anime brand, as well as read the whole manga (more than once) I liked the game. Graphics were nice and close enough to the anime to get the same immersion... But let's skip my remembering the PS3 Version, since this review regards the cluster♥♥♥♥ of an abomination which calls itself a PC game. to keep it short and simple:On the 4 machines I tried to run this abomination, none worked. Well it did kinda work. But if I got 30 FPS for a few seconds I was a very happy man. The game tended to stay between 5 and 15 FPS. That's about it. Tried it on every new machine I had available and none worked. Don't know how many PC I need to try to get this thing running. I will try again and again, because: I paid for it and sadly didn't know about refund back then. My only recommondation is this: If you have a PS3 and generally like the genre, get it. It's fun to play for a while.If you have a PC: Try to get info if your hardware runs this piece of ... something - if you won't get any, assume it won't run properly. And I am rather sure, that my rig is quite somewhat above the hardware requirements.			"

												Great game in some aspects, not so much in many others. For starters if you don't have quiet the beastly computer don't even bother trying to play. I'm talking like you can play the 2013 tomb raider at the completely maxed settings kind of beastly. If you do then I hope your a dedicated fan cause your going to be dealing with a lot of typical anime to game issues. For starters you will be forced to run through an ""open world"" that is really just a bunch of small areas that you run through with linked load screen after load screen, until you finally get to a cutscene. When you finally do get to combat its either a normal fight like if you fought your friends, or one of the main story fights with reaction commands and amazing graphics. Why every story fight isn't like that at this point I don't know. Realistically I have been hoping to see the cinematic reactions appear in the versus modes for this game. Anyway so with a story that should have been like the first budokai (cutscene, fight, cutscene, repeat) this game took a different approach and tryed to let you ""free roam"" the world of naruto. Also about halfway through the game it introduces a rather annoying system where you will have to fight multiple enemies in the free roam even though your combat is basically no different than it normally is, with the exception of a bunch of moves locked out, and some replaced with almost cheezy reaction attacks. At the end that can become completely ridiculous forcing you to fight multiple bosses by yourself with no real advantage on your side as these coms beat away at you with boss level hp, infinite teleportation abilities, and complicated stacked ai programming that lets them combine their individual attacks into confusing patterns that you'll find yourself beating your head against the wall trying to never figure out. By the time you get to the last boss you feel tired of the whole system almost, and then your in for the most grueling back to back to back to back to back fight that you'll die and have to start aaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllll the way from the beginning of those encounters over, and over, and over. In the end you settle for cheap surfire tactics, struggle through the story to get all the characters, and enjoy replaying the few high res fights with reaction cinematics that the game has. Some of which you will have to do those really annoying parts to be able to play again. So in the end I have to say if your a super dedicated fan with a powerhouse gaming computer then struggle through and enjoy what you have but overall this game was a huge letdown with slightly polished graphics to the original and no change to the overall gameplay dinamic to make it more friendly to players and fun overall. Oh another thing... god this is getting long, the online is massivly problamatic, I've never gotten a game to work, and I have a 1.5 mbps connection, which should be more than sufficient.			"

												Boring and too easy after you figure out ""how the ai works"" and with the fact that the Online Multiplayer isnt/doesnt work.  It becomes a ""not worth it"" type of title. (DETAILS WHY)this game is essentially an easier version of DBZ Budikai.  if you dont know what i mean by that let me explain.  (using an xbox360 controller) B is your primary attack....A is to jump....Y is to charge your chakra....and X is to throw stuff.   On top of that you have 2 buttons that pretty much ""break"" the game.   The block and Substitution buttons.   Block blocks...no big deal and you can hold it all day long...it blocks EVERY attack in front of you.   Substitution however is even worse.   if they do get you in a combo that is chained and you cant get out of....you can use this button to ""combo break"" them and avoid it completely .... which can be used to counter ""ultra"" them as well.    in which case if used against the computer...will most always beat them.    This means that you can sit back...charge your ultra bar up to the max... blokc and avoid any kunai thrown at you...substitute out of their combos,,,,and then ULTRA MOVE them ..... repeatedly.  This worked so well as a strat that the game immediatly got boring.....really....really fast.Part 2:  The translations are horrible.  The voice acting is worse (and far different save for naruto) than the english dub.....and there are WAY too many cut scenes for ""a fighting game"" to even bother with.  I love the anime, I love fighting games like DBZ Budikai..... but when they try to simplifiy it even further than that..screw up something as simple as the story..make you sit through HOURS of cut scenes before the next fight....AND carry over your health bar to EACH fight (of which you just buy and eat ramen between to replenish it) .....as well as ""try"" to throw in an RPG element.  You just get too many things the game trys to be. What i wish it was:   A fighting game.  If its a fighting game...KEEP IT A FIGHTING GAME.     If you want to make it an RPG where you can collect people to your party and turn base fight.  DO THAT.... dont mix the two and try to hide it behind a fighitng system thats ""barely"" better than FF13-3 lightning returns. I dont quit many games,   But when i do....i try to warn others about it as much as possible.   This is one of them.			"

												I absolutely regret buying this game.  Before you even play the game, it requires you to bind an entire Xbox controller to your keyboard buttons.  This includes both of the analog sticks and the directional pad.  There's ten attack buttons and a dozen movement buttons you have to bind and it makes things needlessly complicated.  Also, the game likes to crash.			"

												This game has an amazing story following the manga, however I need to stress that this game is NOT for everyone. This game in Story mode is 99% cutscene and 1% battle. If spamming the skip key and long cut scene isn't for you, this game isn't your cup of tea. The free battle mode is what makes this game awesome, with alot of playstyles and combos you can do it sure is what made me appreciate this game and if your a naruto fan, all of your favorite characters are in this game too! However in it's current state, online battle is really laggy and honestly unplayable from where I'm from.(Singapore)But then again the story mode's boss battles are really buggy as the camera angles are REALLY bad. The keyboard configuration took me an hour to set up and it took even longer to find the right keys to bind, so make sure to get a gamepad/controller for the game to function smoothly. If you're getting this game without a gamepad/controller, it isn't worth the full $50 you would need time to adjust to the controls. Overall I would not reccomend this game unless you're a real diehard naruto fan that loves the naruto storyline as the game would not appeal to non fans as it does not explain the full naruto universe and it only includes a part of it. With the game requiring a controller to function well and will certainly not appeal to the vast majority of players.			"

												On Pc I Wouldnt recommend it because the controls for a keyboard is extremely difficult and if you have an xbox controller it might work but a ps3 controller your gonna have to download stuff that might give you viruses so no i do not recommend this game			"

												i owned this and all the previous ninja storm games before it came to PC and perfected each one.i highly recommend this game on the following conditions.1) you have a 360 game pad2) You are up to date with the naruto anime/manga3) you can deal with a 30 fps lock4) and most importantly you are thinking to buy this game for its story mode mainly since online mode doesnt work properly .

												First, this game is for Naruto fans only.  Do not buy if you don't get a rock hard boner from hearing anything about Naruto. Now my review.  Wow.  This game is hot garbage.  The one on one battles aren't too bad at times.  A bit repetitious but you get used to the mechanics eventually.  The story is a bit boring as you just run the gauntlet of point A to point B (when the game allows it) then a battle.  99% of the game(?) has turned into me pressing start and skipping.  I really wanted to finish the game but once I got to the end, it's just a huge clusterf***.  What should have been a good idea was quickly filled with rage quit inducing moment.  Breaking the rules of the game so the antagonists get special treatment and powerups is fine if it calls for it, but when you're fighting multiple enemies and your in game camera starts shooting all over the place like Michael J. Fox shooting the Blair Witch combined with Cloverfield and you have no clue where you're at.  The in-battle cutscenes are super-f***ing annoying, where I skipped almost every other cutscene in the game, this makes me sit through 10 minutes of still framed shots with voice over.  Not too mention some a$$hat's bright idea it was to keep your health down when you progress in the story.  Immersive, right?  No, because the only way to reheal it is too go to the one ramen restaurant in the game to heal.  You can't access the health packs in your inventory, no that's stupid.  Not too mention in the final fights when you're fighting 10 story tall monsters, which should be the fun climactic battle of the game, sh*ts it's pants like a 4 year old eating Mexican food.  The developers hid fine little details on how to fight in the battles, which is interesting and can prove to be a fun mechanic, but quickly turns into that time your uncle wanted to play ""wrestling"".  Plus the item system is basically throwing a single tomato into a salad.  Yeah, it's there but it feels like it doesn't belong and there should be more with it.  I'm thinking way too much into this. Your time would be better spent to just go on youtube and watch someone else play it cause this is not worth the time.  I guess I'll just uninstall it and let it gather electronic dust in my Steam library.			"

												This game is not what is used to be, the multiplayer doesnt work properly: there are none players to play, and the few ones always have bad connection. Playing against the computer is boring, and the story also boring. If you are a kid who likes the anime, buy this game, but if you like it for the gameplay, go buy the most recent one, i learned this the hard way.			"

												Do not buy this game. We were promised multiplayer, which is why most of us bought the game. Sure, the story mode is fun, but only for like 20hours MAX! The multiplayer is what most of us wanted to play. But nope, the game doesn't work online. It's been quite a time, but still no proper patch to fix multiplayer.Please do not buy this game, you are better off drawing on ur money or wiping your♥♥♥♥♥with it.			"

												Let me begin this review by stating that I do not watch chinese cartoons.This game disguises itself as a cool chinese cartoon fighter game but the real intentions of the devs behind creating this game were to create a truly sensational wank bank.I cannot progress past the character select screen until I am completely empty and my johnson rubbed till it is raw. The moment I selected Hinata and browsed through her swimsuit costume to her hooker costume, my sperm was no longer my own. That was only one character. I had worn my johnson down to a stub once I got to Sakura-chan.This game puts a whole new meaning behind ""Full Burst"".			"

												A garbage console port, locked at 30fps. The health system is dumb as it can completely ruin your save file if you progress into a boss battle with low health and run out of healing items. I'm an hour into the game and I've already had my save ruined by losing to much health and having to beat a boss with like 5% health at the start. WTF kind of game design is this when there seems to be no way of quitting a boss battle and going back to a safe zone/shop for supplies and healing before trying again. Garbage game. I'll stick to watching the anime.			"

												Mediocre fighting game. I can't recommend this game unless you're a die-hard Naruto fan. 4/10Pros+ Plenty of characters+ Decent combat+ Tells the Naruto story pretty decently (and without fillers!)Cons- Playing the campaign is a bit annoying, because of the useless wandering between different quests.- Online multiplayer is unplayable and therefore unpopulated. It can take a long while before you actually get a match.- Special attacks are overpowered.- Unplayable unless you have a controller- Loading screens and the main menu take a really long time to load and react (and I have a beast of a computer...)

												This is a really great game, I would definitly recommend this game who loves nartos anime. The graphics are good but not great. But the whole story and the adventure is amazing. Also if you like fighting your freinds then this would be a great game for you becuase it doesnt matter who you are in game you can beat the other person. its all about skils and timming. This has been one of my favortie games.			"

												For this review i would like to point out right away that i won't be rating this game on story since i'm really not a big fan of their writing in general and find the overal series just too over lived. So instead for the story rating , ill just rate this game adventuremode presentation.well off with the review shall we             The whole reason i got this game is because of the fighting. I was curious on how the game worked and to my surprise it really simple, but not in a bad way. How simple you say? 1 button melee and 1 button projectile.  to do specials you have to tap the chakira button once or twice depending on what level of skill you want to use, though each character has only 2 skills  along with very own awakening skills. every character has a unique effect while in awakening state. If your in team fight you can use the top buttons  to throw an asist attack at your enemy. The D-pad eneble you to use utility item fixed to that character. One more thing, chakara can used to charge your other buttons like  jumping to attack cancel to dash toward enemy ot backup or for your projectile attacks. mainly in every fight your goal is to weardown the enemy by making them give out to using their replacement counter. When you get attacked the shoulder bottton can let you sway from the attack and pop you behind the enemy to avoid getting hit from counter either one tme your attack bottons so that you don't keep mashing the attack while the enemy is just laughing at your back. The retaliation aganst a replacement counter is the chakara+jump for dash cancel into the enemy stagger hiim before he makes his counter debut so you can compleat the combo. each player start with four and in an amount of time they will regenerate but each time you use replacement, you temperarly stop the regeneration.the game easy to pick up and play just from looking at the not so complicated move set since every character has an identical button press. They control well but often at times of combat trying to keep a combo or chain just feel odd and fixed. some knock up skill cant be chained with your combo even when it's evident that you are in range of an attack.The system works for what it is but people who like the creat their own combo and discover intricate combos and tricks won't particularly like this mechanic though.            Alright off to the ultimate adventure section. You wana know how good the story mode is. mostly piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Theres a segments where your running around talking to people and finding challenges BUT most of the challenges and sub quest are up after the adventure mode is finished and most of the area you visit feels empty with noone to talk to or interact with except for random item loot on the floor. Though some of the epic fights actaully change the mechanic to make some fight feel dynamic which can be kinda cool. But for something like the final fight being so under powering other then naruto's  shuringan spam. and the 9 tails. The final fight don't feel too epic at all. The adventure mode is to be desired.                 Compleating quest fights or doing hard made give you money and what do you buy with money? Heath potion and over price utility items like explotive shuriken. They never seem nessesary so i pass all the level with flying colors without them, so really the only thing you use money for is unlockables.  This is where im going to talk about content.Unlockable are laughably easy to 100%  since you almost unlock all extra content right from the first play through. Characters however are unlocked just from being in a fight scene in adventure mode. Theres no secret character just all layed out for us. as soony uo beat adventure mode, you have all the characters. Great.......no secrets, but having all 80 characters man thats allot for fighting game, but here really got quantity over quality since some of the character really lack identity or feel unique. But as all content goes atleast the music is able to keep up. The music scores are still strong in the series so yea.  thank you for that.THe thing that i can say for the game is it's graphical envirment and character models are really nicely mode. keep true to the 2 counterpart.             all in all this game is game isn't super terrible just some lost of potential. It's still fun playing the game , but in the long run it's to be desired since the game will run dry in like a half a week. this game get's a 2(1/2) stars out of 5. Never get this at full price.			"

												A brilliant fighter, but only fun if you get a controller. that said, with the controller, potentially my favorite fighting game ever? the story is the same as the anime, and the art is gorgeous. I'm not sure what i can say is bad about this game. the game mechanics are nearly flawless with the exception of some op characters, but im just nitpicking at that point. all the characters are beatable someway, just some are better vs others in different ways. tl;dr, you need an xbox controller and if you have/get one (i bought one simply for this game) this will be one of the best fighting games you've ever played.

												Even though walking through the campaign map is as boring as it ever was, the combat system is more smooth than previous entries. There are more fighting and less quick time events, which make it a more challenging game. The graphics are amazing, not in a technical aspect, but because the design nails the design of the manga/anime. It really looks like you're playing the manga. Someone would probably criticize the vast amount of cut scenes, but I don't mind. You really get into the story that way.			"

												Unplayable on certain GPU's. Worked fine on my Radeon HD 6950 1GB, but with my much newer, much better Radeon R9 290 4GB, it is almost completely unplayable. From what I've gathered online, the game is so badly optimized, it's not compatible with clock speeds that are too high. There are work arounds, but they can wear down, or even damage your GPU, and shorten its lifespan. I wouldn't hold out hope for a patch either. If you want to get it, try looking around the web if your GPU is compatible.			"

												Beautiful, follows the story exactly, epic, comedic, and my favorite Naruto game by far. On PC there is controller support but I am currently playing with the keyboard, which is a little complicated at first, but if you set the controls up right you get used to it. There is a crashing problem in Free Play Mode, not sure whats up with that, but an absoulutly amazing game ^_^			"

												If you are a fan of Naruto this is the game for you. It is honestly a better experiance of the the plot than the anime. Gameplay is solid and boss fights feel great. Nothing has really changed about these games since the last entries into the franchise so only buy if you care about the series or is a first time purchase.			"

												Great game. Lots of annoying bits during the story where you have to learn a new mechanic for one fight and never use it again, and it suffers from far-too-long segments talking about Naruto's ninja way and flashing back to things we've already seen multiple times, like everything Naruto, but the core gameplay is incredibly fast paced and fun. A decent successor to the original Ultimate Ninja series. I wish they'd kept it to 2D, but it's great for what it is.			"

												I originally played this on the PS3, but it was available on steam and all of my friends play on pc so I got it. This port is well done and runs more smoothly than the console version did for me. I'm a fan of basic combat games with large player rosters, so this was a perfect game for me.			"

												I almost rated this a game as ""Not Recommended."" That's because some questionable design decisions marred the experience. However, at the end of the day the actual game part of the game is interesting enough to warrant a purchase, especially if you're a fan of Naruto.  So, I'll start with what's bad.  Basically, any part of the single player that isn't fighting (with the exception of the final boss battle. ) Full disclosure: I've been reading Naruto for over 10 years, but I stopped watching the anime at episode 60. It was at that point that I noticed the anime's tendency to draw things out unnecessarily. A manga can be read in a couple minutes, and the anime has the habit of stretching that couple of minutes to half an hour. It makes the experience feel bloated, and that unfortunately is how the single player feels as well.   Through at least 80% of the single player you are, essentially, watching the anime. Yes, it plays out with the game's models, and has a fidelity that arguably surpasses the anime, but it still takes too long to get to anything interesting. The second problem this game has is when the game gives you control outside of fighting. Too often, you are put in a small area, go forward a couple of steps, and a cut scene starts. Even Hideo Kojima would call this♥♥♥♥♥♥excessive. Any part where you were ""exploring"" was entirely uncessary and could have been removed from the game. Thirdly, the final boss fight is a poorly designed piece of schlock that prioritizes spectacle over playability. Without spoiling too much, the final fight happens over a large area where you can barely see your character and are fighting multiple enemies at once. The fight is grandiose, and fun to look at, but it's still not worth the frustration. You'll get through it, realizing that this was so poorly designed the designers put in multiple checkpoints during the fight, and allow you to refill your health completely and try again if you die. Nowhere else in the game does this happen. It's if they are admitting ""we made this to look cool, and for no other reason.""Finally, and here's the real kicker. You HAVE to play through this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to unlock characters. If Capcom can figure out that forcing players to unlock characters in fighting games is stupid. Other studios don't have any excuse.Ultimately (heh) what makes this game good is its fighting mechanics. They do a good job interpretting the fiction and are basically a continuation of the mechanics introduced in the arguably superior Ultimate Ninja. However the twist is that this takes place on a 3D plane and looks way way better. The fighting isn't mechanically complex, but it is strategically satisfying. Fighting games are based entirely around the idea of ""what I can do vs what the opponent can do."" and playing a technical fighting game at a higher level involves a lot of mind games.  This game allows casual players, who don't have the time or the wherewithal to learn 1 frame links and juggles, a chance to play in this manner. You will be thinking ""is it better to use substitution, or to block"" , ""should I attack or throw"" , ""should I use a jutsu"" , etc. It is this fact alone that saves the game. It makes multiplayer* battles so much fun.If this game is between 0 - 15 dollars, it's worth the purchase for an average gamer who wants a fighting game that doesn't require a significant time investment. If it's 15 - 30 dollars it's worth the purchase for a fan of Naruto who is a fan of fighting games.* I have  not tried the online multiplayer, my connection is generally too poor for online fighting games. However, I did test it with a local 2nd player, and was surprised at how this improved my opinion of the game.			"

												Dafinaitly a great for if ur a fan of the series. The Story Mode provides in depth plot line of the show itself. This game in particular takes place in what i remember as the 3 sesion of the naruto shippuden series. If this game is lacking anything it deffinetly IS NOT;Epic Fights, plotline, cinimatics, currency, items, companions, amaizing Vs. Mode, Team Battles, online battles, Challange mode (for the very skilled players), Original japanese audio and lots of amaizing charicters with unique and powerfull abilities and skills to use to your advantage in a battle. which also makes the storymode very much worth it. But remember, This is a fighting game. so when i tell you that, ""yes there will be alot of cutscenes, but the will be packed full of edge of ur seat suspence, drama action, evil, good, world domination, the ninja world fighting back. you truly see the 4Th Great Ninja War unfold chapter by chapter. and every key, epic fight stages ""The Player"" as one of the Fighters.The one flaw was that it could use an update or 2 so that people can adjust the graphic settings more than just the resolution. that way the players with i3's and lower can play smoothly. i have an i3 and for some reason it didnt like lag or crash. it just played at a slight slow motion. like a lil more than half speed. that made it a lil hard to get used to considering its a fast pased ninja fighter hahafor that reason i as a fan give this game a 9.0 (its got all the story and epic boss fights. but the overall slowness of the game is ""such a draaag"" (ppl who know the show know the reference haha xD)As a gamer i give this game a 7.8 (if u dont really know the show, the story will make not alot of sense at all xD its like the 100th naruto game xD haha jokes obviously but u get the point. there would be alot of catching up to do.. but if u just wana f*** SH** Up as a beast A** ninja then this game will give u hours of fun.thank u and enjoy-i			"

												Unplayable on certain GPU's. Worked fine on my Radeon HD 6950 1GB, but with my much newer, much better Radeon R9 290 4GB, it is almost completely unplayable. From what I've gathered online, the game is so badly optimized, it's not compatible with clock speeds that are too high. There are work arounds, but they can wear down, or even damage your GPU, and shorten its lifespan. I wouldn't hold out hope for a patch either. If you want to get it, try looking around the web if your GPU is compatible.			"

												If you're a fan of Naruto and in the mood for some over the top craziness, this is the game for you. While not very challenging at all, the game does keep you engadged with some really cool reinterpretations straight from the anime/manga, accompanied by cutscenes and quicktime events. The battle system itself is very straight forward and easy to learn, though it's a shame that none of the AI opponents never really challenge you, which can make an otherwise awesome mechanic feel a little stale. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is unplayable, with de-syncs that stop the match every 2-3 seconds. That being said though, the local multiplayer is tons of fun, and where you can really experiment and mess around with the combat system.This is a great game for any naruto fan that wants to go back through the story, though with a little bit more interactivity, or for anyone looking for a great local multiplayer fighting game.

												Okay I luckily got this game on a 50% discount, and it would have been an amazing deal if it weren't for a few issues. Namely there are game breaking bugs that prevent not only the completion of the game, but also causes the game to crash by simply having a character complete a move. This game would have been great if it wasn't for that. Literally my only other complaint is that the settings doesn't have an effects volume part. The story mode is fun and interesting but still follows the manga/anime plot (luckily i've read it so I know what happens after the bug) and the combat is pretty good too. Unfortunately for me, my favorite character is almost unplayable, since his ultimate attack crashes the game if it hits. Certain forms of Naruto might also crash the game, and you cannot complete the story mode because (towards the very end of the battle I might add) the Five Kage battle against Madara causes the game to crash at the exact same unavoidable point in the fight. Therefore I cannot legitamately unlock every character, at least not without grinding money in practice games. Only play this if you are devoted to the franchise, and even then be warned that your favorite characters might just be unplayable. I just wish I could get my 20 bucks back. I realize this is simply a bad port to PC, and that the actual game is extremely fun, but it is very dissapointing that these bugs would be allowed to exist, regardless of circumstance. Its the same as if the Hadouken crashed Street Fighter, or every time you do a Fatality with Scorpion in Mortal Kombat the system shuts off. Now this doesn't happen for everyone, but apparently its a common bug for this game, as looking specifically for this bug to fix it yielded many results and none that fixed it. It is still fun, and as long as I don't use those characters it works fine, but I am severely disappointed that, regardless of the franchise or the love I have for it, something as severe as these bugs and issues would exist, and go unfixed for so long.

The keyboard controls are impossible.  The game wants you to not only enter keys for left, right, up, and down, but also upleft, upright, downleft, and downright.  It also wants keys to be entered for depressing the xbox thumbsticks.  It simply cannot be played on a keyboard.  I just feel that there should be a disclaimer for this game that even if you meet the system requirements, you will not be able to play unless you feel like dropping $50 on a microsoft controller.

												I can't really recommend this game.  First of all, it's a terrible port - they put zero effort into making this work on PC.  There aren't even default keyboard controls.  You can set keyboard controls (only before the game launches, though - you can't set keyboard controls in-game), but as with most fighting games, you're better off just getting a controller (which IS mapped by default).  The default controls themselves are awful - what I expected to be the block button was actually attack, what I expected to be attack was actually throwing a kunai, etc.  It was a little easier and actually playable once I remapped them, but still, I have to knock the game for having a default control scheme that makes absolutely no sense.Second, the game has no practice mode, nor any basic tutorial.  It puts you right into a fight without telling you ANYTHING about how to play the game.  I took a few hits in the first fight before I even figured out how to move (for me, it was actually the D-Pad for movement, not the left thumbstick like the game says).  If you've played one of these before and are already comfortable with their control scheme, this probably won't bother you as you'll already know what does what.  If this is your first Ultimate Ninja Storm game, though, you will be basically be moving and fighting like a toddler while your opponents smack you around effortlessly until you can figure out what's going on.Third, the tutorials you DO get are confusing.  They'll tell you about all these hidden things you can unlock if you do certain things, but they rarely tells you how to do the certain things you need to do to unlock the hidden stuff.  As a result, you'll usually miss the hidden stuff.  Feedback is equally confusing.  It'll say you need to win a fight with at least 40% health as a bonus condition, but the post-fight scoreboard never makes it clear if you've actually done that.Fourth, the story mode makes you win fights that the character you're playing as is supposed to LOSE.  I personally hate that, because it doesn't fit with the story and makes no sense.  I also don't particularly care for the game inventing fights that never took place, but I understand that they need to drag out the gameplay to a certain number of hours.  I would prefer that they stuck to the story religiously in the story mode and then did all these extra fights in a separate 'What if?' mode.Fifth, the story mode saves your characters' health from their previous fights going into the next one.  Sometimes this makes sense, but it usually doesn't.  The game makes you use a health item to restore your character's health so that you have a fair fight.  I don't like having to pay extra just to be at my best for a fight.  That's lame.Sixth, the game doesn't have all of the English voice actors and they didn't even bother to sync up the English lines to the characters' mouths.  Cutscenes look like old Japanese B movies where you hear a character speaking, and then, entire SECONDS after he's done, his character's mouth starts moving.  I could play along with that for real actors or even a cartoon, because to fix it would require a lot of work.  These are CGI models, though.  You can easily make them do whatever you want, so NOT lipsynching the dialogue in the English version is pure laziness.			"

												Bought it on steam after finding out it had a PC release. Fun game. Highly recommended to own an Xbox 360 controller for Windows for optimal gameplay (becomes indistinguishable playing on a console then, which is best for a fighting game anyways).Large character list and fun combat are good points for the game. A low hardware requirement is also enjoyed, allowing me to run the game from my laptop with only Intel HD graphics.			"

Take part in the 4th Great Ninja War or face your friends online to show the who's the boss.			"

												A brilliant fighter, but only fun if you get a controller. that said, with the controller, potentially my favorite fighting game ever? the story is the same as the anime, and the art is gorgeous. I'm not sure what i can say is bad about this game. the game mechanics are nearly flawless with the exception of some op characters, but im just nitpicking at that point. all the characters are beatable someway, just some are better vs others in different ways. tl;dr, you need an xbox controller and if you have/get one (i bought one simply for this game) this will be one of the best fighting games you've ever played.

												Even though walking through the campaign map is as boring as it ever was, the combat system is more smooth than previous entries. There are more fighting and less quick time events, which make it a more challenging game. The graphics are amazing, not in a technical aspect, but because the design nails the design of the manga/anime. It really looks like you're playing the manga. Someone would probably criticize the vast amount of cut scenes, but I don't mind. You really get into the story that way.			"

												The game itself is amazing!  I borrowed it from a friend for the PS3 so I was stoked when I could have my own copy on Steam.  But regardless of its epicness, there is a major problem with the graphics and fps.  To get to the point, its super laggy and slow!  I've been trying to find various fixes online for it, but they should really patch it up so its better integrated for pc.  And my laptop can run Skyrim, BF3/4, and Bioshock Infinite, so I have no idea why this game is having a hard time.  Of course, I might just be underestimating the game's graphical needs.  I also did not like that I really should use a controller to play it (though I should have expected it) cause I actually don't have a wired xbox 360 controller, or an adapter for my wireless one :P but you could still format your keyboard as a controller so that wasn't as big of a deal.  Overall, I loved the game, but I hate how much has to be done before you can actually play it on the pc.			"

												PROS: Absolutely spectacular. Cannot recommend highly enough. There's a wealth of depth in the combat system if you care to learn it, but you can also get remarkably far and do remarkably cool things just mashing buttons haphazardly. The story mode is fleshed out superbly with an absolutely staggering amount of voicework from the original Japanese actors (warning, you have to turn Japanese on -- it defaults to the horrendous English actors). So far, I haven't tried VS. mode, but I've unlocked what appear to be an absolute plethora of characters to play. There's also an Online VS. mode which is cool.CONS: The only thing I really dislike about the game is the parts where you're walking around through the village, or through forests, or deserts in an RPG style fashion. The maps are positively gorgeous, and there are hidden treasures to find, but the sluggish speed at which the characters run in these areas really feels awkward with the lightning fast gameplay of the battles and what we've come to know from the show/manga. In battle, Naruto and friends bolt around at amazing speeds we'd expect from ninja -- in the RPG traveling parts, they like... JOG LAZILY. It's really off-putting, and I know it's a weird complaint because the meat of the game is really the fighting, but if I had to pick one complaint about the game, it'd be this.EDIT: A month later, I have to add another con about the game. I am above average at fighting games. I personally found the game's campaign difficult, but never infuriating to the point where I wanted to stop playing. Some fights felt a little cheesy, but never truly unfair. And when there was a DECISION battle, I always took the Legendary (more difficult) route. Toward the very end of the game, there is a Legendary DECISION that, as far as I can tell, is pretty much impossible to beat. There are four-to-five Jinchuuriki ninja beating on you simultaneously. And it'd be one thing if you could perform combos on one of them, but the OTHERS hit and interrupt you -- while you're in the middle of a combo. Just a really stupid fight. I'll admit I'm probably not good enough at the game to beat this particular fight on Legendary, but I never had a real issue with any of the Legendary challenges until this one -- and the gap in difficulty is just absolutely absurd.The game is currently 40% off. I'll admit I had trouble swallowing the $40 price tag, but I've wanted it since it released 6 months ago and I patiently waited until it was on sale. I have to say, if I'd known the game was this good, I would have had NO problem paying full price.Disclaimer: I have to admit, I am a very avid fan of the show and the manga. The game is probably a heck of a lot less exciting if you have never watched it, but I can tell you with confidence that it is still an exceptionally deep and mechanically sound game with gorgeous graphics and the BEST story mode I have ever played in a fighting game.OVERALL: 8/10.

												First of all, this review comes from a fan of the series and a fan of PCs, so imagine how happy I'm to be able to play this on my computer.I'll just point out some CONs on the Port (and not the game) I found while playing it, the rest is pure gold:- 30 FPS cap, although it's expected for an action/adventure PC game to NOT have a fps cap (at least not a game like Dust for example who it's physics engine is based on the 30fps), this cap doesn't make it unplayable at all and I only noticed on the open areas where you can move around the camera freely, so not that bad.- Low Res Shadows, the resolution of shadows are really poor, making me lose the ""anime experience"" from time to time. The 3D models and cell shading on the other hand were wonderfully implemented.- Low Res Textures, the game represents almost everything as 3D polygons on characters, but the little things that are represented with textures really make the experience off again, like the clouds on the Akatsuki cape when close up.Despite of that, and just because I'm a really graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, the game is marvellous, the effects and animations are epic, never seen a game like this, and the fightings are all filled with action, reflexes and whatnot, and they represented the anime story very well for a video game.Buy it!

												Crazy fun fighting game. The gameplay is smooth and fast-paced, though not very deep.

This game should do the trick, it picks up a bit before the ninja war. It looks beautiful.The game has many characters to try and unlock, gameplay is pretty fun, try to get it with a friend so then you can play with eachother as you unlock characters.It's got great cinematic fights. Once you get the combat, it's intuitive and fun. Not the best, strategy wise, but it's not lacking either. If you want to satisfy your inner weeaboo I say you should go for it.			"

												By far the most extensive naruto game I have ever owned and played. It is extremely faithful to the series in both combat and cutscenes. I'm fairly certain this game has the largest character roster of any of its predecessors. Combat is more strategic than aggro this time around as you have to calculate when is the best time to use an assist or rush in least you be punished with an ultimate special right to the face. This game's greatest feature hands down is the story mode. My only disappointment is the offline battle soundtrack, there seems to be none or very little selection when playing against the cpu or friends but it doesn't detour from the game. Perfect 10/10 must have for a fan of the series.			"

												The game itself is miraculous. The game looks really sweet with PC AA, AF and various graphical effects.It covers the prologue (Minato VS Tobi and the Attack by the nine-tails), and Shippuden up to some point during the great war.There's two downsides. Firstly, if you're going to use a keyboard, you're binding your keyboard buttons to the actions of a Xbox controller, so W = Arrow Up, K = Y button, etc. I recommend using some sort of controller.Also, the game's locked to 30fps, which makes it feel slightly unresponsive and sluggish, but if you can get past that, it's well worth it.

Single player of this game is more about story, than playing. But who cares, this game is great. Multiplayer is really good too. For anybody, who likes Naruto and he/she consider buing it, I can just say: BUY IT!! For Naruto fans is this game ""must have game"".			"

												As a person that hates the Anime for it's lazy and awfully told story line with it's horrid pacing, I really, really, enjoy this game. The story is actually better told here than in the show, and even handles some scenes better than the original since, well, the creators actually knew how to handle the length of the cutscenes. The story itself though is right smack in the middle of everything else though so if you don't know what's been happening from the story from the previous games/anime, the game will not be slowing down to tell you. The game also ends halfway through the biggest fight in the entire series, because, you know, sequals. The gameplay however is surprisingly fun however, it's a basic fighting game formula for half of it, with the one character you have control of fighting off against another, and the other half sort of a hack & slash where you beat on enemies until they die. It's not a difficult game, the only parts that can be called 'hard' are more to a lack of understanding of the mechanics when it throws you into a character/form you haven't handled before (the 9 tails mode at the end was particuliarly annoying.), and this only breeds frustration instead of interesting challenge. The game looks very nice with it's art style, and sounds nice as well. The game performance isn't particuliarly demanding although it certainly wasn't optimized the best for PC, it being a console game and all. The menu's are just really, really, really, bad. Like, really REALLY bad. Theres a loading screen for almost every menu you try to access, and these menu's are unacceptably long for what you're trying to get to. Trying to do a 1vs1 Battle? From the main menu, go to ""Quick Battle"". Loading screen. From that menu, select the game mode you want. Loading Screen. Pick your character. Loading screen, sometimes 2! There are even loading screens for getting to the timeline in this game.  Do yourself a favour if you're not planning to pay attention to the story and turn the voices from English to Japanese for non cringe voice acting. And bring a 360 controller.			"

												This game has great gameplay, visuals and soundtrack but fails to stand out amongst other games of the same series. Many of the charecters feel similar to each other and sometimes combos and ninjutsus are just flashy reskins of their other counterparts  (rasengan, lariat, chidori, raikiri, etc.)The fighting feels good, It's fluid and responsive. Every hit that lands really feels like it hit. When in awakened mode you really feel like you're gaining more power and creating a gap between you and your opponent. Some things are a bit irritating though. Ultimate jutsus take so long to execute even my grandmother has the reflexes to block or evade them. When your block gets broken you stay stunned for way too long. Some of the stages are too big.The story mode is garbage. Sure it has nice visuals but everything feels hollow and empty. There are a bunch of sidequests which include running around the empty world picking up small amounts of money till you get to the fighting part. You beat the fighting part and do a bunch of walking again. Rinse and repeat. This goes for the story mode as well. Walking around the world just to get to the next fight is boring since there isn't anything to explore or experience, it's like waiting in a line and watching a slideshow till you get to the thing you are waiting for. For the price tag of 30€ it's not worth it.+nice visuals, soundtrack and gameplay+it's a Naruto game +good fighting-story mode empty -some things are unbalanced-bad pc port-characters all feel the same -waiting,so much waiting-price			"

												The game is fun overall, and the only complaints I have with it is the AI. It's way too easy on normal VS mode, so using Awakening forms that are dependant on you losing a certain amount of HP is often pointless, and you must suck on purpose to get to use them. Those are the fun bits, come on! Make the AI have different levels of difficulty on VS mode. There is a special mission mode which will set battle conditions, but the only ones that are fun are those who have much more HP so you can feel like it's a challenge instead of a chore to win.Tl;dr:Great and fun game except for poor AI and VS battles.Make the AI better and let us customize the VS battle condition with HP, Strenght, Speed, Chakra, etc			"

												The fighting is smooth and flashy, the special moves are super epic and powerful. The art style is awesome, it's all great, but there are some performance issues. And there are sooooo many characters to pick from, such as Naruto (Duh, but there are many variations of Naruto, Sage, Pts, and so on), Sauske, Orochimaru, and even Madara Uchiha the legend himself! Sage Kabuto fights a lot like Orochimaru too! It's not bad, just not as refreshing as I thought it would be from normal Kabuto. I picked it up for $20 on sale and I think it's worth just that.PC port is rubbish though, use a gamepad, if possible PS3 because it was cleary designed for that, Xbox 360 isn't bad though. In short, pick this game up if you're a fan of fighting games or the story of Naruto!			"

From what I've gathered online, the game is so badly optimized, it's not compatible with clock speeds that are too high. There are work arounds, but they can wear down, or even damage your GPU, and shorten its lifespan. I wouldn't hold out hope for a patch either. If you want to get it, try looking around the web if your GPU is compatible.			"

												A very good and interesting game, I would reccommend this to any who wish to have a fun time trying to use combos and an ultimate ability to destroy their opponent. The Game is fun all around, however Shino is too overpowered as a COM and also the moves you have and can use are limited.			"

												I've really been enjoying this game, I read the Naruto manga but I had been getting kind of lost with the World Ninja War arc stuff but I haven't wanted to read it again or watch the anime (since that takes so long) so this was a much better way of going back over the story so I could understand what's going on now in the plot.My main problem with the game is that the animation in cutscenes does not sync up to the voice acting at all (in english or japanese) which is particularly weird because sound effects do match up. Basically you end up hearing everything the character says, then you wait for the animation to show them saying it, and then the next character speaks which makes cutscenes way longer than necessary (and they would be pretty long regardless)			"

												I've played this game for almost 7 hours on record and I have only got past the prologue and the first 3 chapters of the game. There is a total of 10 chapters + Prologue for the campaign which allows you to relive the Naruto Shippuden story from the anime. It starts right after Tendo Pain/Nagato destroys the Hidden Leaf Village up until Naruto fights ""Madara Uchiha""/Tobi. There are also 2 other modes called Free Battle and Online Battle(self explanatory). This is the most recent in the Ultimate Ninja Storm franchise as of this review and as an added bonus you get all the DLC along with it. Can't wait for the next instalment ""Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution"".			"

I'm really excited for the NUNS4 coming out later in the year. I was a bit dissapointed in the online match making as it is completely dead everytime I'm on, but I don't mind playing solo.

												Not only is the game itself worth it for ANY Naruto fan (simply because of how well done it is).But if you buy it on PC, you get to run it in 1080p (or any res you like, 1440p, 4k, etc), you get anti-aliasing, and you get to run it at 60 FPS which makes the experience so much better.Not to mention because it's ""Full Burst"", you also get all the beautifully re-done cutscenes, all the ""DLC"" skins for every character, and you get the extra character of Dragon Sage Kabuto + a whole new chapter (the Kabuto vs Uchiha brothers fight).10/10 worth, especially if you get it on sale (which Steam is awesome enough to put it on all the time). I got it when it was half off around June 3rd for a mid-week madness sale, 20 bucks is SO worth for this game.			"

												An underestimated game that doesn't get the credit and popularity it deserves. This has one of the best fighting mechanics in game, and the cutscenes are very long, deep, and plentiful in plot. They've added lots of original content as well to spice up some of the greater emotional scenes, like Kushina's death. Roster for the game is huge and the online play is alive and kicking well without many cheaters. This is a game that needs to go in everyone's collection if you're a fan of the franchise. If you're simply a fan of fighting games then this is a must have simply for the VS and Online play since the mechanics are so great, and it's VERY fast-paced. The graphics and cutscenes got a huge facelift and upgrade from the previous version of this game, and the PC version's visuals are out of this world. Best damn Naruto game you will ever play. Probably the best anime-based game as well.			"

												PROS: Absolutely spectacular. Cannot recommend highly enough. There's a wealth of depth in the combat system if you care to learn it, but you can also get remarkably far and do remarkably cool things just mashing buttons haphazardly. The story mode is fleshed out superbly with an absolutely staggering amount of voicework from the original Japanese actors (warning, you have to turn Japanese on -- it defaults to the horrendous English actors). So far, I haven't tried VS. mode, but I've unlocked what appear to be an absolute plethora of characters to play. There's also an Online VS. mode which is cool.CONS: The only thing I really dislike about the game is the parts where you're walking around through the village, or through forests, or deserts in an RPG style fashion. The maps are positively gorgeous, and there are hidden treasures to find, but the sluggish speed at which the characters run in these areas really feels awkward with the lightning fast gameplay of the battles and what we've come to know from the show/manga. In battle, Naruto and friends bolt around at amazing speeds we'd expect from ninja -- in the RPG traveling parts, they like... JOG LAZILY. It's really off-putting, and I know it's a weird complaint because the meat of the game is really the fighting, but if I had to pick one complaint about the game, it'd be this.EDIT: A month later, I have to add another con about the game. I am above average at fighting games. I personally found the game's campaign difficult, but never infuriating to the point where I wanted to stop playing. Some fights felt a little cheesy, but never truly unfair. And when there was a DECISION battle, I always took the Legendary (more difficult) route. Toward the very end of the game, there is a Legendary DECISION that, as far as I can tell, is pretty much impossible to beat. There are four-to-five Jinchuuriki ninja beating on you simultaneously. And it'd be one thing if you could perform combos on one of them, but the OTHERS hit and interrupt you -- while you're in the middle of a combo. Just a really stupid fight. I'll admit I'm probably not good enough at the game to beat this particular fight on Legendary, but I never had a real issue with any of the Legendary challenges until this one -- and the gap in difficulty is just absolutely absurd.The game is currently 40% off. I'll admit I had trouble swallowing the $40 price tag, but I've wanted it since it released 6 months ago and I patiently waited until it was on sale. I have to say, if I'd known the game was this good, I would have had NO problem paying full price.Disclaimer: I have to admit, I am a very avid fan of the show and the manga. The game is probably a heck of a lot less exciting if you have never watched it, but I can tell you with confidence that it is still an exceptionally deep and mechanically sound game with gorgeous graphics and the BEST story mode I have ever played in a fighting game.OVERALL: 8/10.

I've laughed, I've swore and yes even cried a bit (no joke) and I am not even done the story mode!The craziest part is that I've only ever read the 1st 3 mangas so I don't know much about the story but I can pick up whats happening from the basics that I know. It's not as free roaming as Rise of Ninja but I have not come across a story this amazing in a long time.Pros:Amazing StoryCool bonus scene features to unlockLOTS of characters (even swimsuitwear for the girls hahah)Good animationsControls are easily managable (within time) Cons:Kind of have to learn to fight through loading menu tips. It takes a few fights of gettin your butt kicked to start understanding the controls. Sometimes there are long cutscenes (amazing and rewarding cut scenes, but long)I would highly suggest getting this game but probably on sale I got it for around 8$ but I'd easily pay 30$ but thats only because I love fighting games with solid stories and different characters			"

Also it's new hardware and a fresh new install of windows. A crappy port of a great game.Edit. I realized that no matter what resolution you use run at 16:9. Changing the aspect ration just messes things up and changing the resolution seems to change the aspect ration appropriately. Why they put the aspect ratio thing in when all it does is cause a glitch is beyond me.			"

												This game is awesome! I absolutely enjoy playing this game it is well worth the money to buy this game especially if you are a fan of the anime. The game is pretty much you going through the story and fighting through all the events that take place in naruto about half way into the anime which is much more fun that i make it out to be. There is a wide variety of gameplay settings  which i am sure everyone would enjoy. There are even more game modes outside of story mode should keep you occupied for a while. If you are a huge fan of fighting games i recommend you purchase this game. If you are a fan of fighting games and watch the anime then this game is a MUST HAVE! LIKE BUY IT RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW!!			"

												This is a game for Naruto fans, and only that. It is a good fighting game, but it lacks complexity. For Naruto fans this doesnt matter because it has all the most badass characters and all the cool abilities.So I'll give 2 scores:Naruto Fan: 9/10 (I give it a 9 because it could be more complex)Not Naruto Fan: 6.5/10 (for a guy like this, the game it's just another fighting game)			"

Fighting mechanics and modes are present for those looking for a Naruto Fighting game.  Prefer this over its terrible rehashing found in Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution.  If you have to choose between the two, be happy this one is cheaper than its newer sibling.			"

												To begin, I'm not much of a Naruto fan. Certainly, the series has its merits, but as of yet I've never properly delved into it. All I've seen is the first episode, though I'm fine with taking spoilers and things I don't yet understand in stride.To continue, this game is amazing.Apart from SSB, this is probably the only fighting game I have ever played. The animations are very smooth- the level of detail is nigh impeccable. It has some excellent scenery, from a sunset at the beach to the dark green gloom of ancient ruins. The combat works well, though rather simple. I do kind of wish that they had integrated a similar satisfaction in pulling off team finishers as they did with the ultimate jutsu of each character, since they're harder to pull off. The story is nicely done in the drama department (hit me in the feels more than once), though I kind of wish there was a way to get at some of the backstory- even just including something to read as an option in the menu would have sufficed. My only major complaint with the plot, however, is that the ""branching choices"" don't seem to really branch out. Basically it all comes down to how much content you want to deal with in one sitting. It's not bad, but it would have been nice to see greater diversity.That's about it- NUNS 3 is a beautiful game that runs surprisingly well. I'm not certain that it's worth full price, but I got it on sale for about eight bucks, which is definitely money well spent. Worth experiencing.			"

Don't regret it so farA normal gamer would say that this is not their best game bought, but for a Naruto enthusiast like me, it's one of the best games I could have. Pros Hidden Content  Recreate Epic Battles Great, Great, Great Story Mode Make Impossible Battles Happen  Quality is great Very Responsive Controlls  Logitech Controllers Friendly Lots of Content besides the Story ModeCons Online Mode Is Dead Unbalanced (Deidara, Temari, and ranged ninjas can spam ranged skills with no chakra cost) RING OUT - Not really a con, but I don't agree that a ninja can lose like that, if you watch Naruto you will agree with me, but I understand they wanted a different win metaOverall it's a good game, worth it (even if you don't watch Naruto)			"

												If you love Naruto or you are looking for a fighting game with very nice story telling I recommend all of the Naruto games so far. The games are great in following the anime series and luckily they put focus on the main plot. The visuals fit perfectly and you are able to enjoy this game on japanese. In terms of the fighting itself especially versus others players I wouldn't recommend it. On one side you got plenty of characters to choose from and fighting in 3rd person is a cool experience as well. But on the other side there is way too little variation between the fighters or movesets. Compared to Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and Tekken you get bored too fast and don't see any point to put much effort in getting better or train a special character. I would have loved environment interaction on the battlefield. For example playing hide and seek in the woods or destroying certain objects with your special moves. Maybe there is more to come in the future. To sum it up, great game for Naruto fans but uninteresting for fighting game lovers only.			"

												Do you like visual novels pretending to be a fighting game?Do you like 30fps and a combat system that is half dynamic action button presses?Do you like watching the loading icon more than playing the actual game?Do you really really really like NarutoIf yes to any of these then this game is for you. I had never played any of the other games in the series but I figured It would be somewhat like mortal kombat, where the characters change as the story progresses. If only it had been more like mortal kombat. If you can manage to bear through the first hour or so of the game it starts to pick up...but what the hell is with the load times, sometimes it feels like the game is mocking you for wanting to, you know, actually play.here is a breakdown of how the game plays.loading screen/cutscene/loding/cutscene/loading/cutscene(yes you can skip them for the most part, however most dont have a dialog skip option so you have to wait for everyone to finish talking)/loading/pre battle planning/FIGHT/loading cutscene/cutscene/loading/walk naruto from one side of the path to the other/loading/loading loading.......I mean come on. Its more of an acion rpg/visual novel than a fighter. which is fine but when you have to load 3 seperate cutscenes before a fight it gets stupid, add on to that you have to load a (free world type) area where you just walk from one side of the screen to the other then it goes back to loading you might as well be putting in seperate disks for each fight, It feels like FFVII level of loading situations.TLDR: loading screen/10			"

												No sound effects or master volume reduction options for this game. That makes it a lot worse. Overall it is a good game if you like Naruto universe, but the lack of the option to reduce the volume makes it unplayable for me. As an addition, I have to say that not even the sound mixer reduces the game volume for me.			"

												This game is awesome! I absolutely enjoy playing this game it is well worth the money to buy this game especially if you are a fan of the anime. The game is pretty much you going through the story and fighting through all the events that take place in naruto about half way into the anime which is much more fun that i make it out to be. There is a wide variety of gameplay settings  which i am sure everyone would enjoy. There are even more game modes outside of story mode should keep you occupied for a while. If you are a huge fan of fighting games i recommend you purchase this game. If you are a fan of fighting games and watch the anime then this game is a MUST HAVE! LIKE BUY IT RIGHT NOW IF YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW!!			"

												it is the best naruto game i played so far. i payed 7.50 Euro for it and its worth probably way more so paying the original price is fine. Pro- a huge character pool- a good amount of story and story fights- gameplay mechanics is easy and feels great with a controller (just as on consoles)- feels easy to play so also guess fine for minors- it does not force you to win online fights for anything :PCon- to some it may feel to easy to obtain S Ranks (nearly S ranked all so far without even trying)- did not have any to me (so far)i give it an honest 10/10best naruto game played so far as said			"

												Great game, but could be better.The only 2 things that are bothering me, are Loading Screens,and unnecessary ""free world"".Example: Cutscene where you are running towards the battle, but then you control the character for like 10 s and looses the whole momentum, and then the cutscene where he runs like a ninja :).Fights are awesome, but still it could be a lot better. I would reccommend it if you are a fan of Naruto series or if it is on sale. I would recommend you to wait for UNS4. But an enjoyable experience.			"

												My Review:+ Fun Gameplay+ Great storyline+ Huge range of characters+ Tons to do after you complete the main story (took me about 40 hours to complete the main story and the missions)+ Nice graphic style+ Great music (especially in the Prologue)- Some cutscenes are longer than neccessary - There are only two graphics options - resolution and 2x SSAA- 30 FPS cap- The keyboard controls are awful, I strongly reccomend playing with a xbox 360 controller- Online matches are terrible. Every second you get a nice 'transmitting' message and your game will freeze. Overall, the game is definately worth buying if your a fan of Naruto. If you want to avoid spoilers, watch up to the Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax arc. This game does go on sale quite often, so I sugget waiting until then to buy it.			"

												Great game if you like fighting games and anime (specifically, Naruto). Animation work and graphical style is superb! The story mode doesn't have much new if you have been keeping up with the anime, but it still a blast to play through, and there is a post-story with some sidequests that is fun, if repetitive. Fun online play, even though it doesn't have PC-level multiplayer systems thanks to this being a console port with stupid typical ""matchmaking"" shenanigans. SP 9/10, MP 7/10 due to matchmaking issues and apparent lack of online players (which may be due to a bug?).			"

												The aspect that sets this game apart from other casual fighters (specifically Dragon Ball games) is the fact that each character has a unique moveset, combos, and fighting style, and each battle is unique. It's true that it's easy to simply beat an opponent into a corner in only a few counts, but it's also easy yet somewhat challenging to create a visually aesthetic battle. Definitely reccommended.

(I say this in the most positive way possible)I grew disillusioned with Naruto as the series continued to progress years ago... the anime was chock full of awful filler episodes and keeping updated with the manga became a pain since translators long since abandoned the idea of cleaning up their pages and needlessly insert more fan-art in their entries than actual genuine pages so as such it totally broke the flow of reading a story. This is the best way to experience Naruto without tearing your hair out, the graphics are simple but stylish and the combat is fast and flows comfortably (once you figure it out since the 3rd entry doesn't really provide a tutorial despite being the first entry on PC).Unfortunately however, since this is the 3rd game. The storymode continues on from Storm 2 and since they weren't released for PC you will need to either to have experienced the story so far in another way or risk being overwhelmed and lost in what is going on between the different villiages.Nevertheless, this is a solid game and I home CC2 have the decency to find time to backport Storm 1 and 2.

												The Real Anime FeelI have been a fan of anime for quite some time. Sitting down and exposing yourself to a world of unrestrained possibilities represented through a drawn medium has a certain allure that is irresistible to me. However over the years I have become jaded to games that take on the Anime theme and try to incorporate the style of entertainment into a game. It always just ends up being too gamey, and not flashy enough. I watch anime for the ridiculous fights, and the huge explosions. Both of which are hard to make believable in a fighting game.Quicktime events are littered throughout boss fights and act toenhance combat with impressive sequences and a reactive mini-game.Not that you can't animate them and put a visualization of them in a game. There is just something about the combination of lighting, sound, and color that is very difficult to translate from anime to video game. There are many a Budokai games that in my opinion have failed at this over the years, and left me with a sour taste for games based on anime.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm by developer CyberConnect 2 tackled this problem and succeeded quite impressively. Every moment you are fighting feels like a moment from the anime, every move you perform feels like it's just the right speed and power. In the beginning combat was so fast that I was mashing the 8 buttons semi-randomly to attempt to keep up. After a while though fighting became fluid and a very satisfying dance between opponents. The fluid motion broken up by staccato flashy ""ninjutsu"" and ultimate moves that are just as satisfying to pull off as the combat is.The combat itself is very simple. It breaks down to what amounts to a 6 way rock-paper-scissors where the clash of each move is weighed against your opponents and there is a definite advantage given to the winner. The movements are so fast that you have to anticipate what the enemy is about to do in order to gain the upper hand. This leads to a good amount of luck involved in getting the win. There are ways to mitigate the advantages or disadvantages you find yourself in with items and instant teleports which negate the last you took. Combined all these mean that there is a quick learning curve and a low ceiling. The combat is fun and semi-skill based but the real show stopper is the cinematic element that the game presents during each fight.Recreating your favorite fights feels like you arereally stepping into the shoes of your favorite hero/villain.I can't stress enough how much of a treat fighting with your favorite characters is. And there are plenty of characters to choose from. All of them introduced in one way or another in the story mode. This mode is well flushed out and has a lot of the same quirky characteristics of the anime, but doesn't quite go overboard and make things unbelievable. The story mode sticks to the more real and easily presentable scenes and keeps the pace moving quickly from fight to fight. In the end it is just a showcase for many of the characters and fighting modes that are really where the game shines.Really that is what Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm does best. It blends all the great elements of a good game and focuses them into just the one thing, great looking fights between giants. Sound, lighting, blur, animation all serve to enhance this one great aspect of the game. All other things that fall by the way side no longer matter because all you want to do is feel the rush of the next stunning battle. I can forgive a clumsy story/world mode and confusing menu system because it's just so much fun to hop into fight after fight with different teams of ninja to duke it out online and with your friends.Even though story mode isn't that great it still is very pretty.So if you end up picking this series up don't look forward to a great story. Don't look for a wonderfully constructed world to wander around in. Hop into some fights and throw some ultimate moves and get that adrenaline pumping from the insane semi-casual combat. It's easy to get into and fun as hell.You'll like this game if: You enjoy anime and you want to relive some larger than life battles with explosions and a multitude of characters all sporting different abilities. Be warned, a clumsy and short 12 hour story mode will unlock all the characters and get you well versed in the combat. It is well worth it to get into the game.

												Graphics are beautiful, runs rather nicely. Action is very fluid and entertaining. Not to mention it's on sale right now for only 7.50...If you're a fan of the Naruto series and have followed it, you may or may not enjoy the long and often cinematics compared to the fighting.If you've enjoyed Naruto games in the past, this one will blow you away...The only downside i could think of is the Keybindings for Keyboard controls are fun to figure out, but once you get the idea down you'll be fine. If you pickup a controller you'll be breezing through the Story in no time. Then again there's always online matches...First online match:-Deidara as the enemy, 1000 battle points worth of fights. Great! This should be a fun battle right?-Spams the SAME move over and over until my health is gone.10/10 would get spammed again for the sake of pretty explosions.			"

Retracts from the action on screen because your paying attention to a small section of the screen :(			"

It has an immense amount of cutscene and focuses on the developement of characters and story. There is parts of fighting that is extremely fun and not many running instances. This is a very good game that isnt too intense (besides the story :P... ) The multiplayers battles add you to have extra time experiencing the Naruto life.9/10 -IGN			"

I was always curious about the naruto games and I bought it. It is really fun, I recommend it to every Naruto fan. The combat mecanics is different from other fighting games like Street Fighter or Tekken. It brings a change of scenery. Having fun so far. Only con that I find, is the amount of dialogue and cutscenes. I know it follows the story, but I don't want to watch a visual novel.  "

												First of all, this review comes from a fan of the series and a fan of PCs, so imagine how happy I'm to be able to play this on my computer.I'll just point out some CONs on the Port (and not the game) I found while playing it, the rest is pure gold:- 30 FPS cap, although it's expected for an action/adventure PC game to NOT have a fps cap (at least not a game like Dust for example who it's physics engine is based on the 30fps), this cap doesn't make it unplayable at all and I only noticed on the open areas where you can move around the camera freely, so not that bad.- Low Res Shadows, the resolution of shadows are really poor, making me lose the ""anime experience"" from time to time. The 3D models and cell shading on the other hand were wonderfully implemented.- Low Res Textures, the game represents almost everything as 3D polygons on characters, but the little things that are represented with textures really make the experience off again, like the clouds on the Akatsuki cape when close up.Despite of that, and just because I'm a really graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, the game is marvellous, the effects and animations are epic, never seen a game like this, and the fightings are all filled with action, reflexes and whatnot, and they represented the anime story very well for a video game.Buy it!

There are a few missions where you have to farm stuff, but even for that there is ""something"" to still make it fun. Takes about 3-5 days of gameplay to earn all achievements. I used to play this on Xbox back in the days. Now I recently bought it again and only a few missions and achievements left. 3 days in so far, this is absolutely a great game of it´s genre. 9.5/10-Zaptios Aqualios			"

												pros:narutoits like watching the series, except you control the characterscons:camera and control may be awkwardfps capped to 30 (not really an issue)recommended for those who play naruto uzumaki chronicles and ultimate ninja on ps2. its a mixture of both and it is good, except for the cameraforgot to mention, every ultimate technique is different in range, damage and speed for every character. silly tobi is good to troll with bots/players			"

												A fun game if you are a fan of the anime series. There is a lot going on this game and there is so much to do in it such as side events and doing challenging missions to earn more items.10/10 for me but the multiplayer still needs a bit more fixing to do but overall great game. "

												This game is kinda awesome,but the controller support sucks.Who would play a game like this on a keyboard really?Suicidal perhaps!?Anyways,only way I found to use a controller is by using X padder.Kinda throws multiplayer functions out the window unless you can run multiple Xpadder instances that can tell each controller apart from one another.I do recommend this it is a decent fighter,and the content is awesome by standard of Naruto fans.But,be aware of the lack of controller support which is none.Controller functions will have to be a DIY.

												A great game that represents the anime very well in its story telling and combat style, this is also a refreshing fighter unique to any other style of fighter.For fans of the anime this is a must and for new comers this is a great way of getting to speed with the story as it ignores fillers and condenses the story into its vital segments.

												I played NS UNS 2 on PS3 and was fascinated by how long a game, which is technically not bringing much changes to the gameplay, can be played (nonstop?!).So when UNS3FB was available for less than 10€, I just HAD to purchase it! And I've not since regretted buying it!When I first wanted to start playing, I was irritated, I have no controller for PC and there are no standard settings for playing with keyboard, so the first thing you gotta do is configurate your keybindings.When I started playing then, I was surprised how ""normal"" the difficulty was (thought it would be hell without controller).Fights are (so far) not hard to win, but that's gonna change for sure later (at least I'll/you'll have problems with S-Ranks).There are slight changes in the gameplay though (e.g. no items usable without a fight, only way to replenish health is either Ichiraku or bentos).Well, all in all I am happy I took the chance to play it for not much money, though eventually I would pay the full price now (if I hadn't used that opportunity)			"

												If you like anime, Naruto, button masher and cel shader, grab this one!Campaign is a very nice story adaption and not too hard. Playing it through unlocks all characters, too (takes less than 30h if you watch all scenes and hunt for rank S). But for unlocking, MP will work, too, as every fight rewards you with some money and unlocking works by gaining total amount X for each character and outfit.Multiplayer works good: local 2 player, turnament mode for up to 8 player, online battles and is relativerly good balanced so far.Fighting style is the most important, at least for me:You don't have to remember tons of combos like in Tekken or Mortal combat; there are some general combos working for every character and if you have your favourite, there are 3-4 more for each character; but you don't loose just because you don't know them by heart. Most of the time you 'just' have to react fast and correct instead of hammering 10-varying-button-combos.That makes it also a nice alternative for party games like Smash Brothers since it's relatively easy to learn, only mastering takes some time.

												First off, this game is not for you if you're not interested in Naruto.Story mode is decent. It gets boring sometimes, but it's overall very interesting, mostly fun to play, and sometimes even emotional. I (kind of) cried twice playing this game. That came close to the record set by KH2, which means it's pretty emotional. It's also more or less 99% canonical (except for the last few sequences) , which is a great improvement over earlier Naruto games.The combat's... well, pretty good. I didn't play any previous versions of Storm so I have nothing to compare to, but the battle mode is fun except that it will get boring if you play with the AI all the time. The freeroaming bandits are more often annoying than anything else.It's a tad overpriced, but overall worth it. I f you're a Naruto fan, put it in your wishlist and get it during a sale.			"

I have spent in this game like...180 hours or kind of. If you like fighting 3D videogames as DBZ or you follow Naruto series, this game worth.A good amount of characters, a accurate story and a nice ost.

LOTS of characters (around 70-80 playable), many maps with unique features, many combos, overall moves, special character-unique moves and ultimate moves.There's nothing that I can think of that is bad with this game.When I heard about the next ""Naruto Shippuden"" game being released, I didn't even hesitate about pre-purchasing it.And what about you reading this review?

												This is a great game for any Naruto fan. It has a nice graphical style, and very cinematic battles. But the game has many flaws, mainly its combat system. The combat in this game lacks depth, though the community has addapted and made some creative strategies with support characters and combos. Also the cutscenes are VERY long, you'll spend 75% of the time at least watching cutscenes, you can skip them but they are important for the story. There are over 80 characters to pick from but they are pretty much the same mechanically, except for a few that stand out. Still, the story mode is fun, and it has online multiplayer with a ranking.			"

												This game has great gameplay, visuals and soundtrack but fails to stand out amongst other games of the same series. Many of the charecters feel similar to each other and sometimes combos and ninjutsus are just flashy reskins of their other counterparts  (rasengan, lariat, chidori, raikiri, etc.)The fighting feels good, It's fluid and responsive. Every hit that lands really feels like it hit. When in awakened mode you really feel like you're gaining more power and creating a gap between you and your opponent. Some things are a bit irritating though. Ultimate jutsus take so long to execute even my grandmother has the reflexes to block or evade them. When your block gets broken you stay stunned for way too long. Some of the stages are too big.The story mode is garbage. Sure it has nice visuals but everything feels hollow and empty. There are a bunch of sidequests which include running around the empty world picking up small amounts of money till you get to the fighting part. You beat the fighting part and do a bunch of walking again. Rinse and repeat. This goes for the story mode as well. Walking around the world just to get to the next fight is boring since there isn't anything to explore or experience, it's like waiting in a line and watching a slideshow till you get to the thing you are waiting for. For the price tag of 30€ it's not worth it.+nice visuals, soundtrack and gameplay+it's a Naruto game +good fighting-story mode empty -some things are unbalanced-bad pc port-characters all feel the same -waiting,so much waiting-price			"

												As a person that hates the Anime for it's lazy and awfully told story line with it's horrid pacing, I really, really, enjoy this game. The story is actually better told here than in the show, and even handles some scenes better than the original since, well, the creators actually knew how to handle the length of the cutscenes. The story itself though is right smack in the middle of everything else though so if you don't know what's been happening from the story from the previous games/anime, the game will not be slowing down to tell you. The game also ends halfway through the biggest fight in the entire series, because, you know, sequals. The gameplay however is surprisingly fun however, it's a basic fighting game formula for half of it, with the one character you have control of fighting off against another, and the other half sort of a hack & slash where you beat on enemies until they die. It's not a difficult game, the only parts that can be called 'hard' are more to a lack of understanding of the mechanics when it throws you into a character/form you haven't handled before (the 9 tails mode at the end was particuliarly annoying.), and this only breeds frustration instead of interesting challenge. The game looks very nice with it's art style, and sounds nice as well. The game performance isn't particuliarly demanding although it certainly wasn't optimized the best for PC, it being a console game and all. The menu's are just really, really, really, bad. Like, really REALLY bad. Theres a loading screen for almost every menu you try to access, and these menu's are unacceptably long for what you're trying to get to. Trying to do a 1vs1 Battle? From the main menu, go to ""Quick Battle"". Loading screen. From that menu, select the game mode you want. Loading Screen. Pick your character. Loading screen, sometimes 2! There are even loading screens for getting to the timeline in this game.  Do yourself a favour if you're not planning to pay attention to the story and turn the voices from English to Japanese for non cringe voice acting. And bring a 360 controller.			"

												This game is great. I was really scared of this PC port. The PC ports for these kinds of games tend to be terrible. This PC port was well optimized. The extensive multiplayer options are very well done. I feel satisfied with the options I have available to me in multiplayer.The story mode is awesome and the story very well follows the story from the anime. It does deviate from the anime story in a few small ways here and there. Except the last chapter. It deviates from the original story in a few big ways. This game having steam cloud is crucial. I use it very often. It is great to be able to go to your friends house and have your complete roster and not have to play thru the game to unlock everyone.			"

												this was a joke btw ill give it my reall review. uns3fb is a good action game that takes you into the naruto world. the game is not a good thing if you want to get into the serize because they leave out allot from the original anime. now here are my complants, the online is really bad, theres a glitch when you join an invite your keybord dosent work, and the game itself is just too easy. and even though the game didnt tell you about the bigest twist in the anime it did pretty good (ok theres a serpise in the anime that shocks everyone when naruto is fighting this guy,this guy in the anime is the final boss but they never reviled the surpise in the game and that was a big let down). i give full burst a 7/10 only because it was too easy of a game and btw the english vocies are BAD you will want to play this game with japeniss vocing and english subs			"

												Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, in my humble opinion, is a really fun game with a few flaws keeping it from greatness. As an avid fan of the series both manga and anime, I decided to pick this game up after doing some research on it, and have been very pleased. Disclaimer: This is my first ever Gamefaqs review; you have been warnedGraphics: 9/10I think that the game is just beautiful! The character models are all rendered and match their anime counterparts nicely. While the graphics don't look exactly like the anime, I think thats a good thing. because it looks like a video game instead.As you fight through the story, you will face a wide variety of characters, fight huge bosses, and you will get to visit a multitude of iconic locations from the series. Not one time in my playthrough did I say ""well that doesn't look very good."" The color, scenery, and vividness of the game really do an excellent job of capturing the Naruto Universe that we all know and love. Even the opening menus have a great amount of detail put into them.Another big part of this game is the large, large, LARGE amount of cutscenes and action sequences, and I believe that they all look fantastic! There are massive explosions, high paced action, and gripping story moments that are all captured very well within the games engine. However, there is at least one major fault, and its mainly because the game can get a little big for its britches sometimes. I don't think I experienced this at all throughout the story, but when playing in tournaments or online, if multiple jutsus and teammates start getting called, the game does have framerate issues. This is the sole reason this portion doesn't get a 10 from me.Story: 8/10Now, if we are just talking Naruto as the manga, I would personally give this a 10; but we're not, we are talking about Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 the game, and it does have some setbacks.The game follows the story immediatley after Naruto's confrontation with Pain, and continues up almost to where the manga is currently. The main form of story progression is through cutscenes, which there are a ton of! Not that that is bad though. One cutscene in particular lasts at least 30 minutes, but it does a wonderful job of getting you immmersed in the story and if you are invested in the series (like me) you may even find yoursef shedding a tear or two! How many times can you say a video game has done that to you before?My biggest qualm with the story has to do with the so called ""Ultimate Decisions"" you make throughout the game, as they really don't do anything to effect the way that the plot unfolds. I think that in theory it was a good idea, but basically all it does is ramp up the difficulty (slightly) on certain missions. UNS3 is not a difficult game to begin with, and I would have rather seen two different endings than come to the same road at the end for some additional replay value.The story also expects you to already know what is going on, so if you are on the fence about getting this and don't know your Naruto lore study it up or you will not have a clue about what's going on.Sound: 8/10Not much to say here. I thought that the music fit the mood for the game very nicely. Sad moments had soft piano keys playing in the background, and intense moments revved it up the way you would expect a Naruto game to. Everything in between was pleasant to listen to, it's just... it wasn't the original soundtrack. As much attention to detail as was put into everything else, I really wish they had gone ahead and gotten it, because you just can't replace it. I guess there were some copyright issues preventing its use.Gameplay: 8/10A cast of over 80 characters unite for some seriously over the top action that you can take on in the story mode, locally with friends, or online against the rest of the world! This game is so much fun to play! So why does it get an eight instead of 10, I will explain. One downside is the very limited free roam that is offered. I almost thought why even include it, but it does open up from otherwise linear paths after you have completed the story. Basically sometimes you will watch a cutscene, then get sent to free roam. After running a short ways you will then enter another cutscene or battle. There is really not much to it other than that. You can talk to NPC's and there are a few sidequest offered, but they really didn't seem worth it to me unless you are going for all of the trophies. It is mainly just a means to an end to get you to the next battle. And that is where the meat of the game is anyway, the battles.The game has both single and team battles. Single being just you as your character of choice (or who is currently the story character), while team battle allows you to pick one or two support characters to help you. The combat is fast paced, but never too difficult to follow, with exceptions being online sometimes. You primarily attack with the circle button, or B button if you are on Xbox, and have three varying combos you can perform by just pressing circle and using the analog stick. Triangle is your chakra load button, X is jump, and square is the shuriken button. You have basic, and chakra loaded moves that you can execute by pressing the chakra button followed by a different command. This is how you execute your jutsu and ultimate jutsu attacks. You can also block by holding R2, though it can be broken, and you can use a substitution jutsu by pressing L2 while being attacked.There are a variety of cancels that you can perform when executing attacks that will allow you to create your own, flashier combos, and add some depth to the gameplay. The most common of these is the Chakra Dash Cancel (CDC). Basically, while comboing or doing another action, you can press triangle and then X immediatly after to cancel whatever you were currently doing. These cancels are what really add the tactical aspects to battles, as well as providing ways to score big damage if you know what your doing.All that being said, you will have a blast playing through the story mode, but you may experience frustration if you try to take the game online.For me, it has mainly been connection issues. Lag is very, very abusable in this game. I cannot tell you how many times I have eaten a jutsu because the game read one extra circle press. Basically, when you are fighting someone online you need to conserve your chakra and your substitution jutsus more than anything. Play well, make the other guy run out of substitutes, and then punish them with big damage, thats how its supposed to go. However, get into a room with a little bit of input lag, and your read on when your opponent is going to substitue turns into a Rasengan Barrage because instead of being able to block or chakra cancel, the game said you hit attack again. It is playable though, and playing in rooms with little lag is a lot of fun. Winning against a good opponent is a very rewarding experience, not to mention you get to do all with your favorite Naruto characters! Both ranked and player matches are offered, as well as a tournament mode that I haven't gotten to try yet, but has a variety of different rules.I would also have liked for this game to have been made with a more competitive aspect to it rather than almost strictly fanservice and casual. There is a skill aspect to it, some players are simply going to be better than you should you pick up the game, but there are some mechanics, like awakenings, that I do not like. Awakenings are very powerful ""super modes"" that characters can enter. Don't get me wrong, they look AWESOME and make you feel like a boss when you use them, but they need to go IMO. You could be playing the match of your life, and have your opponent down to half a bar left, but if they manage to get their awakening off they could easily turn the tide back in their favor, and I do not like mechanics that reward players for getting beaten. Instant awakening			"

												If you are a fan of the anime then you'll love this game. The graphics are amazing and mirror the anime quite well but with its own unique flair. The gameplay mechanics are crisp and incredibly well done. The voices are perfect and the game does a very good job follwing the main storyline but hardcore fans will notice a few details left out here and there but overall you can't go wrong with this game. The multiplayer was recently fixed for most everyone so you can rejoice in that.If you love Naruto, you'll love this game. Plain and simple. Get it!			"

												I hate the show because of it's pacing and dropped the series entirely. But since I've played this game, it's the exact opposite. I just wish Combat didn't devolve into who uses up their Subsitution Move first loses in terms of Multiplayer. But other than that, the game in terms of story is pretty good given the series. I still hate the characters Naruto and Sasuke, nothing will ever change that.			"

												For a fan of the Naruto series this game is excellent, it tells the story brilliantly with fully voice acted (Japanese and English) cutscenes throughout which is very impressive considering the amount of dialogue and cutscenes in the game. It is mostly faithful to the anime and manga (with the exception of the final fight which I assume was changed to give the game a climactic ending opposed to just continuing as the anime does). However, there is a huge amount of assumed knowledge about the series. The story of this game cannot be fully appreciated unless you have seen a good amount of Shippuden and in places it references things that happened in the original series without bothering to give you a reminder or fill in those who havnt seen it. The story often takes presidence over gameplay with quicktime events mid-fight with actions representing the fights in the anime.The combat is what you would expect from an anime spectacle fighter, with alot of charging up attacks, cinematic grapples and finishers. If you enjoy this type of fighting game, then this is one of the best. However, the powers of individual characters seem to be faithful to the series as opposed to being fairly balanced for online multiplayer. For example Madara with annihalate characters like Sakura with ease (however its not nearly as bad as older Dragonball Z games where some characters could 1-shot others).Overall, for a fan of the Naruto series this game is excellent. However, if you're the type of person to skip cutscenes, dont bother as this game isn't affraid of throwing 40 minute cutscenes your way (not an exageration, the Minato/Kushina flashback midway through the game is around 40 minutes long). The story took me 12 hours to complete including the full burst Kabuto fights, 7-8 hours of which is cutscenes. Regardless, the free-battles and multi-player have so far given me an additional 6 hours and counting.			"

												This game has great gameplay, visuals and soundtrack but fails to stand out amongst other games of the same series. Many of the charecters feel similar to each other and sometimes combos and ninjutsus are just flashy reskins of their other counterparts  (rasengan, lariat, chidori, raikiri, etc.)The fighting feels good, It's fluid and responsive. Every hit that lands really feels like it hit. When in awakened mode you really feel like you're gaining more power and creating a gap between you and your opponent. Some things are a bit irritating though. Ultimate jutsus take so long to execute even my grandmother has the reflexes to block or evade them. When your block gets broken you stay stunned for way too long. Some of the stages are too big.The story mode is garbage. Sure it has nice visuals but everything feels hollow and empty. There are a bunch of sidequests which include running around the empty world picking up small amounts of money till you get to the fighting part. You beat the fighting part and do a bunch of walking again. Rinse and repeat. This goes for the story mode as well. Walking around the world just to get to the next fight is boring since there isn't anything to explore or experience, it's like waiting in a line and watching a slideshow till you get to the thing you are waiting for. For the price tag of 30€ it's not worth it.+nice visuals, soundtrack and gameplay+it's a Naruto game +good fighting-story mode empty -some things are unbalanced-bad pc port-characters all feel the same -waiting,so much waiting-price			"

												The Real Anime FeelI have been a fan of anime for quite some time. Sitting down and exposing yourself to a world of unrestrained possibilities represented through a drawn medium has a certain allure that is irresistible to me. However over the years I have become jaded to games that take on the Anime theme and try to incorporate the style of entertainment into a game. It always just ends up being too gamey, and not flashy enough. I watch anime for the ridiculous fights, and the huge explosions. Both of which are hard to make believable in a fighting game.Quicktime events are littered throughout boss fights and act toenhance combat with impressive sequences and a reactive mini-game.Not that you can't animate them and put a visualization of them in a game. There is just something about the combination of lighting, sound, and color that is very difficult to translate from anime to video game. There are many a Budokai games that in my opinion have failed at this over the years, and left me with a sour taste for games based on anime.Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm by developer CyberConnect 2 tackled this problem and succeeded quite impressively. Every moment you are fighting feels like a moment from the anime, every move you perform feels like it's just the right speed and power. In the beginning combat was so fast that I was mashing the 8 buttons semi-randomly to attempt to keep up. After a while though fighting became fluid and a very satisfying dance between opponents. The fluid motion broken up by staccato flashy ""ninjutsu"" and ultimate moves that are just as satisfying to pull off as the combat is.The combat itself is very simple. It breaks down to what amounts to a 6 way rock-paper-scissors where the clash of each move is weighed against your opponents and there is a definite advantage given to the winner. The movements are so fast that you have to anticipate what the enemy is about to do in order to gain the upper hand. This leads to a good amount of luck involved in getting the win. There are ways to mitigate the advantages or disadvantages you find yourself in with items and instant teleports which negate the last you took. Combined all these mean that there is a quick learning curve and a low ceiling. The combat is fun and semi-skill based but the real show stopper is the cinematic element that the game presents during each fight.Recreating your favorite fights feels like you arereally stepping into the shoes of your favorite hero/villain.I can't stress enough how much of a treat fighting with your favorite characters is. And there are plenty of characters to choose from. All of them introduced in one way or another in the story mode. This mode is well flushed out and has a lot of the same quirky characteristics of the anime, but doesn't quite go overboard and make things unbelievable. The story mode sticks to the more real and easily presentable scenes and keeps the pace moving quickly from fight to fight. In the end it is just a showcase for many of the characters and fighting modes that are really where the game shines.Really that is what Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm does best. It blends all the great elements of a good game and focuses them into just the one thing, great looking fights between giants. Sound, lighting, blur, animation all serve to enhance this one great aspect of the game. All other things that fall by the way side no longer matter because all you want to do is feel the rush of the next stunning battle. I can forgive a clumsy story/world mode and confusing menu system because it's just so much fun to hop into fight after fight with different teams of ninja to duke it out online and with your friends.Even though story mode isn't that great it still is very pretty.So if you end up picking this series up don't look forward to a great story. Don't look for a wonderfully constructed world to wander around in. Hop into some fights and throw some ultimate moves and get that adrenaline pumping from the insane semi-casual combat. It's easy to get into and fun as hell.You'll like this game if: You enjoy anime and you want to relive some larger than life battles with explosions and a multitude of characters all sporting different abilities. Be warned, a clumsy and short 12 hour story mode will unlock all the characters and get you well versed in the combat. It is well worth it to get into the game.

												- In short: A surprisingly good and robust game!- Extended version: I wasn't sure what to expect from this title. I bought it during the summer sale, for the sake of having at least one actual anime-title in my library. I started it, because it actually went beyond the constant recycling of the older content,but once I started the game I was surprised by how nice it plays (provided you own a gamepad) and how...fun the game is.The story provides good variety in terms of combat, letting you play with various characters ""as the story happened."",so you're not stuck with just naruto, nor are you allowed to pick a character of your own. You have to play with the hand you're dealt...and that's a good thing.Aside from the standard combat, there are also deviations, giving you epic set pieces when you are fighting a boss (like the 9-tails, for example) or you can be pitted against multiple enemies at once.The variety in combat style is a great way to change the pace and it keeps you interested.Then there are the Simon-says button-matching sequences which - contrary to how it usually tend to work - are actually quite awesome: if you mess up, you die; you do a decent job, you pass; you do a good job, you even get a little extra.The computer AI also deserves some praise. Usually you can set the difficulty yourself, but this time you either deal with it, or pick the less-dangerous option when available. Regardless, the AI can be quite tricky at times, giving even seasoned gamers a run for their money.My main problem with this game is that there are also collectibles of sorts. As such, you are granted the freedom to roam about between each fight, which pulls you away from the story. As you are essentially watching the anime you are suddenly put back in the shoes of whichever character you are controlling, simply running from A to B in order to progress, picking up a hand-full of cash along the way.I understand this is done in order to grant people the sense they have the ability to roam about and to get their achievements, but you are not all that free, nor does it feel like a truly relevant ""system"". You really ARE just running from A to B. but even then, I suppose it can be forgiven.Aside from the story there are you classic Vs. battles again the AI, another person sitting next to you, or even someone sitting on the other side of the internet. Duke it out in a tournament style, or just a 1-on-1 match with the ability to have helper characters or not. Sporting a massive roster (the majority of which are various ""modes"" of characters and characters for the sake of nostalgia) there is plenty to go about and some of the characters truly feel unique in terms of maneuvrability. Some of the characters are true long-distance fighters, whilst others come to live in some classic CQC.As far as visual presentation goes: I tip my hat.While you can still clearly see the difference between the actual anime and the game...the game comes damn close to the real thing. Vibrant, flashy colors and a true sense of over-the-top-ness makes for a lush and pleasing presentation that'll leave you wanting for more.The music left no real lingering impression on me, but it feel Naruto-esque, if anything.All in all: if you are a fan of the anime and have been pondering whether or not to get this game: I suggest you give this a try...you might be in for a pleasant surprise.I'd say the same for someone ignorant to this series, but you really do fall right in the middle of things and there are strong references to the anime, aside from the fact that this game closely follows the actual manga/anime (if that makes sense)If you ARE in fact a newcomer...perhaps read into the events prior to this title and try this game regardless.

I really like how much they put on the story of naruto on this game, and the boss fight like the ninetales (kurama) was really well done.if you are really a naruto fan is a Must buy!..............but I am still waiting that steam put a game of one piece on steam jaajajaajajjajajajaaj xd			"

												All anime games should follow this as an example. The story is amazing, the graphics look great, and the controls are perfect. I am glad that we finally got this series on PC. 10/10 worth every penny, one of the most fun games I have played.The only gripe I have with it is that if you use 7.1 sound as I do you will not hear any voiceovers at all. I have to switch to stereo every time I play it, but that is minor. Hopefully the next one has 7.1 support as well.			"

												Amazing game. Solid single player with again more upgrades compared to the older versions, and ofcourse pc quality graphics.The online seems to work smoothly ofcourse connecting to people who have a slow ISP will need more time to pick a character and load a map.As for combat itself, theres 4 keys. Melee / Ranged / Chakra / Dash.But its not as simple as that. chakra+melee = special / chakra chakra melee = ultimate and so on, you can combine chakra activations with attacks and movement.Also you can combine movements with attacks like holding down while tapping melee will result in a diffrent combo this will make your oponents timing on defending harder.And each character has a special ranged/melee combo wich can be accesed with forward forward melee how it is followed up depends on character you are usingMinor downside for me personally is that in single player fights some finishing moves involve buttons to be pressed in time or mashed wich distracts from the amazing jawdropping scenes running in the back.(sadly they have done this as long as ive played ultimate ninja games)			"

												Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, in my humble opinion, is a really fun game with a few flaws keeping it from greatness. As an avid fan of the series both manga and anime, I decided to pick this game up after doing some research on it, and have been very pleased. Disclaimer: This is my first ever Gamefaqs review; you have been warnedGraphics: 9/10I think that the game is just beautiful! The character models are all rendered and match their anime counterparts nicely. While the graphics don't look exactly like the anime, I think thats a good thing. because it looks like a video game instead.As you fight through the story, you will face a wide variety of characters, fight huge bosses, and you will get to visit a multitude of iconic locations from the series. Not one time in my playthrough did I say ""well that doesn't look very good."" The color, scenery, and vividness of the game really do an excellent job of capturing the Naruto Universe that we all know and love. Even the opening menus have a great amount of detail put into them.Another big part of this game is the large, large, LARGE amount of cutscenes and action sequences, and I believe that they all look fantastic! There are massive explosions, high paced action, and gripping story moments that are all captured very well within the games engine. However, there is at least one major fault, and its mainly because the game can get a little big for its britches sometimes. I don't think I experienced this at all throughout the story, but when playing in tournaments or online, if multiple jutsus and teammates start getting called, the game does have framerate issues. This is the sole reason this portion doesn't get a 10 from me.Story: 8/10Now, if we are just talking Naruto as the manga, I would personally give this a 10; but we're not, we are talking about Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 the game, and it does have some setbacks.The game follows the story immediatley after Naruto's confrontation with Pain, and continues up almost to where the manga is currently. The main form of story progression is through cutscenes, which there are a ton of! Not that that is bad though. One cutscene in particular lasts at least 30 minutes, but it does a wonderful job of getting you immmersed in the story and if you are invested in the series (like me) you may even find yoursef shedding a tear or two! How many times can you say a video game has done that to you before?My biggest qualm with the story has to do with the so called ""Ultimate Decisions"" you make throughout the game, as they really don't do anything to effect the way that the plot unfolds. I think that in theory it was a good idea, but basically all it does is ramp up the difficulty (slightly) on certain missions. UNS3 is not a difficult game to begin with, and I would have rather seen two different endings than come to the same road at the end for some additional replay value.The story also expects you to already know what is going on, so if you are on the fence about getting this and don't know your Naruto lore study it up or you will not have a clue about what's going on.Sound: 8/10Not much to say here. I thought that the music fit the mood for the game very nicely. Sad moments had soft piano keys playing in the background, and intense moments revved it up the way you would expect a Naruto game to. Everything in between was pleasant to listen to, it's just... it wasn't the original soundtrack. As much attention to detail as was put into everything else, I really wish they had gone ahead and gotten it, because you just can't replace it. I guess there were some copyright issues preventing its use.Gameplay: 8/10A cast of over 80 characters unite for some seriously over the top action that you can take on in the story mode, locally with friends, or online against the rest of the world! This game is so much fun to play! So why does it get an eight instead of 10, I will explain. One downside is the very limited free roam that is offered. I almost thought why even include it, but it does open up from otherwise linear paths after you have completed the story. Basically sometimes you will watch a cutscene, then get sent to free roam. After running a short ways you will then enter another cutscene or battle. There is really not much to it other than that. You can talk to NPC's and there are a few sidequest offered, but they really didn't seem worth it to me unless you are going for all of the trophies. It is mainly just a means to an end to get you to the next battle. And that is where the meat of the game is anyway, the battles.The game has both single and team battles. Single being just you as your character of choice (or who is currently the story character), while team battle allows you to pick one or two support characters to help you. The combat is fast paced, but never too difficult to follow, with exceptions being online sometimes. You primarily attack with the circle button, or B button if you are on Xbox, and have three varying combos you can perform by just pressing circle and using the analog stick. Triangle is your chakra load button, X is jump, and square is the shuriken button. You have basic, and chakra loaded moves that you can execute by pressing the chakra button followed by a different command. This is how you execute your jutsu and ultimate jutsu attacks. You can also block by holding R2, though it can be broken, and you can use a substitution jutsu by pressing L2 while being attacked.There are a variety of cancels that you can perform when executing attacks that will allow you to create your own, flashier combos, and add some depth to the gameplay. The most common of these is the Chakra Dash Cancel (CDC). Basically, while comboing or doing another action, you can press triangle and then X immediatly after to cancel whatever you were currently doing. These cancels are what really add the tactical aspects to battles, as well as providing ways to score big damage if you know what your doing.All that being said, you will have a blast playing through the story mode, but you may experience frustration if you try to take the game online.For me, it has mainly been connection issues. Lag is very, very abusable in this game. I cannot tell you how many times I have eaten a jutsu because the game read one extra circle press. Basically, when you are fighting someone online you need to conserve your chakra and your substitution jutsus more than anything. Play well, make the other guy run out of substitutes, and then punish them with big damage, thats how its supposed to go. However, get into a room with a little bit of input lag, and your read on when your opponent is going to substitue turns into a Rasengan Barrage because instead of being able to block or chakra cancel, the game said you hit attack again. It is playable though, and playing in rooms with little lag is a lot of fun. Winning against a good opponent is a very rewarding experience, not to mention you get to do all with your favorite Naruto characters! Both ranked and player matches are offered, as well as a tournament mode that I haven't gotten to try yet, but has a variety of different rules.I would also have liked for this game to have been made with a more competitive aspect to it rather than almost strictly fanservice and casual. There is a skill aspect to it, some players are simply going to be better than you should you pick up the game, but there are some mechanics, like awakenings, that I do not like. Awakenings are very powerful ""super modes"" that characters can enter. Don't get me wrong, they look AWESOME and make you feel like a boss when you use them, but they need to go IMO. You could be playing the match of your life, and have your opponent down to half a bar left, but if they manage to get their awakening off they could easily turn the tide back in their favor, and I do not like mechanics that reward players for getting beaten. Instant awakening			"

												If you are a fan of the anime then you'll love this game. The graphics are amazing and mirror the anime quite well but with its own unique flair. The gameplay mechanics are crisp and incredibly well done. The voices are perfect and the game does a very good job follwing the main storyline but hardcore fans will notice a few details left out here and there but overall you can't go wrong with this game. The multiplayer was recently fixed for most everyone so you can rejoice in that.If you love Naruto, you'll love this game. Plain and simple. Get it!			"

												This is a really great game, I would definitly recommend this game who loves nartos anime. The graphics are good but not great. But the whole story and the adventure is amazing. Also if you like fighting your freinds then this would be a great game for you becuase it doesnt matter who you are in game you can beat the other person. its all about skils and timming. This has been one of my favortie games.			"

												I have all the Storm games for my PS3 and many of the other series like Ultimate Ninja for PS2... Storm 3 Full Burst for the PC is really nice, they packed all dlc and made an upgrade to the animations. The story mode is by far the best so far with some epic fights that make me wish they would add similar modes to the single player such has scenarios etc. Regardless it's fun to play. The game is not without flaws tough, like most Storm games the devs always add new features but remove others that were pretty much spot on, we can see this on the new Storm: Revolution, with this in mind all the Storm games had something great about them and something that was missing, i'm still waiting for my ""Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi 3"" of Naruto if you know what i mean, over 100 characters all playable and unique, dozens of maps, may more combos and supers and most of all a freaking decent character roster... Why do all Storm games have a nonsensical character roster, the amount of Narutos and Sasukes the game has doesn't mean they are all  different characters -_- make a decent sub-menu were you choose the version you want, don't make 3 lines of Narutos and each with other different versions of himself cause that makes no sense.

												If you are just starting to watch the Anime Dont play the story line. Since it will spoil the half of the anime and manga for anyone wanting to watch it! Other than that little thing, I recommend you buy it and play only againts bots or people online! Its a great game has lots of moves and tons of action and excitement. If you are a hardcore naruto fan i recommend you save your money to buy this game on sale so you can buy the newest one!But if your up to date on episodes than play the story line and see how different or how similar it is from the anime and manga. Or if you dont care if it spoils the anime because you dont watch it and people just say its a really good game then just play the damn story line, since you wont take any time out of your life to put some effort into watching the anime and reading for once.

Gamepad is recommended cos it's fighting game and it's easier this way. Basically, get comfortable in bed, take gamepad and enjoy. There are alot cut scenes where they speak so it's like wathcing anime :DGraphic is amazing, sound and story as well. Game is now on discount so grab while u can.			"

I read other reviews complaining of video quality but I am running the game at 1920 x 1200 in full screen with vsync and 2X sampling with very smooth gameplay and video sequences. Many other steam users got over 40 hours of gameplay and I'm sure I will too.			"

												I can recommend it - but *only* if you do not mind to handle inventory and item stuff - which for me is too much micromanagement. After losing health in a fight, you *will* have to manually refill it yourself.I expected something a little bit different.The story and atmosphere is great. Seeing the Konoha universe from this very new, dynamic and 3D perspective is great. But the missing game mechanics introduction and all-text tips and tutorials (that take you out of the interactive game and 3d display - really suck.Knowing a bit about technology and thinking about usability, I think it could have been a lot better as well. I want to play, and I am impatient in that matter - when the saving takes pretty long, and it then shows a ""saved"" notification for another 1.5 seconds - that's so unecessary, and for me frustrating (yeah, you can call it nitpicking. I’m that nitpicky and thoughtful about my products as well.).What I would have wanted, is this game but with an in-game interactive tutorial, and without shopping and items, searching for money on the ground and very selectively placed, destructable debris.A game that let’s you play the action and free-roaming sections and has great cutscenes, but does not take you out of the action through text boxes, too much introductory information (game mechanics seem too complex). And I certainly do not want to manage an inventory, and have to refresh my health through buying meals and items to drink.You can absolutely see that it is a port from a console game. Fixed, low max FPS, few settings, unnecessarily long loading times. It does seem perfectly playable though. So it is a port of not much effort, but very reasonable - stable and performant.Sadly, I stopped playing because of the aforementioned item system. I am at a fight where I would have to heal and probably know a bit more game mechanics - but I just want to actually play the game, and not be forced to go back.			"

												So.... I used to be a Naruto watcher. I loved Naruto... Naruto was my introduction to the anime world in my early teen years. So I'm biast. UN Storm is amazing in so many ways. 1. Its visually stricking.This game has such a great looking over-world. When you're Naruto walking in the Hidden Leaf Village, theres kids catching bugs, people socializing, and dogs running around... it's one of the most dynamic over-worlds I've ever experienced. Its not just NPC's standing in groups with dialog above them, it's like a real world.2. The gameplay.Its ALSO visually stricking! and I think that's one of the most important things about a fighting game. A bad looking fighting game to me, is a bad game. Visuals are a very important thing to me where skill isn't the most prevelent part of the game. Theres at most 3 combos, 2 ninjutsu, 1 throw, black and evade like in any fighting game, but the simplicity of the game itself is its own strength. This game very well could be the gateway drug to fighting games. 3. The story.Oh god... so nestalgic. I've never finished watching Naruto because I started watching other anime and Naruto was over 150 episodes... I didn't have time to lock down on one anime and plus TOONAMI ENDED ON CARTOON NETWORK WHICH CAUSED ME TO HAVE SEVERE NIGHT TERRORS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. Finally playing through this game and seeing the end of Naruto Shippuden was very.. very nestalgic. I almost shed a tear. Almost. Its a good game. and its only 10 dollars. If you have any affinity to the Naruto franchise, you owe it to yourself to own and play this game, even if you've finished the anime. "

												The only way I recommend this game is if you are a die-hard Naruto fan (have watched/read/played the story up to this point) and have either played previous games in this series before or are up for a bit of reading and experimenting with controls.That said, here are the reasons I do not recommend this game to everyone else:NS:UNS3FB (even as a acronym it's a mouthful) is a fighting game with three modes: Story, which picks up around book 50 of the Naruto manga, after the attack on Konoha (um, the second one) and goes to the heat of the Fourth Great Ninja War. From what I have heard, the game actually makes up its own ending to this, which will probably cause confusion when the fourth game in the series comes around, but I'm not concerned with that.See, this game is not a game for beginners, and this is my greatest beef with it. There are no tutorials in story mode. There are just about 25 dialogue boxes that display tips for the game - and you can't even access the start menu to view them until after the first few battles! So yes, if you haven't played the previous games (which are not on Steam currently) prepare to experiment a bit. Even then, you may get the feeling of missing out on things, watering down the experience. As I understand the battle system right now, it's only okay. There are items you can use... but that's not really my play style. Plus there are a TON of them to unlock, so I just ignore them completely. I've never needed any of them yet.This brand of xenophobia towards newbies continues with the story itself. No explanations are given for past events, nor is any glossary given for the Naruto lexicon that has built up over the past 10+ years. There is a timeline that allows you to view key events from before the game, but I am halfway into story mode and have not yet unlocked a single one of those events.And the cutscenes. Yikes. I haven't compared them, but the story mode likely covers most, if not all scenes from the manga. This means a lot of content, nearly all voiced and paced accordingly. The story has its moments, yes (Naruto meeting his mother in Chapter 4 had me tear up, honestly), but you will come to realize quickly that you will spend around 4/5ths of your time in story mode watching cutscenes and the rest actually controlling your character. It gives Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus a run for its money. Each chapter roughly consists of about 5 1-3 minute stages... and then an hour's worth of scenes. This is odd. Other Naruto games have managed story better - I'm thinking of the early Clash of Ninjas, and maybe even the original Ultimate Ninja games, although I remember those less. I've finally wised up and started skipping scenes.There is an overworld, or should I say a collection of straight paths which try to resemble an overworld. Besides Konoha, which you only spend a bit of time in, the overworld portions seem pointless, and are basically only hubs in which to shop and save your game before going to your next fight - menus could have done them equally as well.There are thousands of collectibles to buy, but most of these are titles and still images you can use to spruce up your ninja info card for online play. Unless you are a absolutely hardcore completionist, you'll probably just buy the ones you want and get on with it. If you can find them - ever try navigating a drop-down style menu with 1000 options? You're going to.The second mode is simply free battle. It's straightforward. Naruto Shippuden has a large roster (around 100 off the top of my head), and you'll probably find your favorites here. Many have alternate costumes/forms which may or may not be considered separate characters. Most of the characters have to be unlocked from story mode, though. For Full Burst there is also a 100-mission mission mode. I've heard gripes that not every character from Story mode is playable, but with a good-sized roster already, I have no problem with that.The third mode is online play. I have not tested this, but I assume it plays more or less akin to Free Battle. With other people. And there's rankings.I remember seeing a screenshot in a magazine for the first Storm game long ago and being blown away by how true to the anime it looked. Here, backgrounds look good, but character outlines ruin the setup a bit, I think. Still decent, though.SUMMARY: Unforgiving to beginners in controls or story, and catering to fans moreso than newcomers, NS:UNS3FB is ok, but fails to stand up to the great fighter games, or even other Naruto games.

												This game seriously surprised me in how much I loved it. The game is an adventure fighting game. There are some RPG elements as well. The combat is pretty easy to get a grasp on but it has really great game feel. As you progress through the story mode you play as a wide variety of characters each with vastly different fighting styles. The main mechanic of the game is that all the fighting moves are performed with the same simple button combinations, but each attack for the different characters has different effects, ranges, and even uses. It is interesting.The main story mode take a good while to get through especially if you watch all the cut scenes. I'd say at least 10-12 hours. The story is the only problem with the game. If you are not familiar with the world of Naruto you will be lost here. This game features more characters than Game of Thrones and you will only know their significance if you have watched the Anime to some extent. I know I quit watching the show around episode 100, I knew who most of the characters were but a lot of the politics and newer characters went over my head. Still it is an interesting story, and well acted and extremely well animated. The game looks just like the show it is amazing at times.			"

												This game is awesome. I previously owned the Full Burst 1 for PS3, and I love to see how they improved the gameplay since then. Limited Substution (although easier to use), different roles for support characters and Awakening Mode changing your size and power makes every battle a single experience to be enjoyed. Love the new Online Battle feature as well.The story mode has some exciting action scenes and is really fun to play. They changed a few things from the manga version, but it doesn't ruin it for those who didn't read it. I would rate 10/10 for this game.			"

												I gotta say, I am *really* enjoying this game so far.  The fighting style is a lot of fun.  A few negatives though.  First, there's virtually no tutorial.  I spent a lot of time button mashing, and really it's a while in til you get to the opportunity to just play with the buttons to figure out what is going on with easy enemies.  There is a manual though, and I just found it out...I recommend reading it!  The other negative is that this relies pretty heavily on prior knowledge of the Naruto world.  Unfortunately, I don't have a very large understanding of the world as a whole, but remember some highlights from the manga/anime.  I'm still in the dark regarding what's going on half the time, and who is who.  This game goes under the assumption you know about the naruto world.  Still, this game is one of the most fun games I've played on the computer in some time.			"

From what I've gathered online, the game is so badly optimized, it's not compatible with clock speeds that are too high. There are work arounds, but they can wear down, or even damage your GPU, and shorten its lifespan. I wouldn't hold out hope for a patch either. If you want to get it, try looking around the web if your GPU is compatible.			"

												If somebody told me last year that I would not only play this game, but own it; I would have laughed in their face. You see, I'm not an avid Naruto fan. In fact, I find the idea idiotic. Ninjas that run around screaming their attacks while wearing bright and revealing clothing? Not very appealing to me (Most anime isn't). However, I was introduced to this game on the PS3 by a roommate of mine. He knew I liked games like Soul Calibur and Super Smash Bros, so he told me I HAD to try this. Well, here I am, six months later, owning it on the PC. The gameplay is probably one of the best systems for a fighting game and the controls are superb when using an Xbox controller. The graphics are beautiful and clear. However, because of the impressive visuals, you're going to need a pretty good PC to run this well. The gameplay works like an extremely fast paced and more strategic yet simplified version of Soul Calibur. There is no confusing button combonations to destroy your opponent, but instead all attacks are keyed to one button while pressing a different button a different amount of times changes what kind of attack you do. The story is alright (Like I said, not a fan of the series), and the voice acting is not anything to be impressed by (Rather painful in places). However, the one terrible and good thing about the game is the cutscenes. It plays like a movie when you aren't interacting. Sometimes it is enjoyable to watch; other times it drags out way too long. Another negative is the online multiplayer. From my understanding, it used to be worse than it is already. The only thing that gets in the way is the connection signals. The rounds lag from beginning to end and it is very difficult to actually find a person to fight. Once you do find someone who doesn't lag and is willing to fight, you tend to stay with that guy and keep fighting him rather than try finding another person.The only bug I have encountered in this game is one that could be considered a major annoyance. It tends to crash during local multiplayer battles. At the menu, choosing characters, sometimes even in the battle itself, the game crashes and shuts down. There is a fix however: play it in windowed mode. It does not really detract from game play and keeps it from crashing.All in all, I give a positive review of a game I thought I would never play. The gods of video games and anime must have conspired to create a video game of an anime I despise and make it as amazing as possible so I would get it. Get this game when it goes on sale (because it definitely will). I got it a few months after being ported to the PC and got it for $5 instead of $55; total steal!9/10			"

												Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes(Aren't you being a little one-sided here?) NO F@CK YOU!As a fighting game NSUNS3FB is pretty, fluid, and fun. Some characters are over powered, but none are non-playable bad.Short and sweet review: Love Nartuo? Get this game. Love fighters? Consider this game. Hate Naruto and Fighters? Please stop reading this review~ <3This one gets a 9/10 from me. Minus one point for most high skill matches turning into who can out chakra dash the other. "

												Being a fan of the 'Clash of Ninja' series I was really excited to play this Ninja storm series mainly because its on computer. Although this game has the best story i've seen in a ""fighting"" game and its also very well polished I do find myself dissapointed in the combat mechanics.You only have 1 ninjutsu and 1 ultimate ninjutsu per charecter. Along with a simple combo system I tend to get bored of each charecter quickly. Instead of quailty ninja with a variety of abilites they made a lot of the same ninja but with alternate  2 ninjutsu's for a overall higher number of ninja on the box. Theres about 4 or 5 different Naruto's and Sauske's to choose from all being about the same just 1 or 2 different abilities and costume. Also theres no 2v2 or survival mode. Huge dissapointment if you have friends over. Your only option is to fight against your friend you can never fight WITH them like in Clash of Ninja. The main reasons this game is better then Clash is for its Story mode and how it runs perfect on my computer. The Wii can't run a Naruto game without slowing down from the graphics, maybe the Wii-U could do it. I'm going to finish this game mainly for the story but i've yet to find a ninja I like to play more then one battle at a time =\			"

												I played NS UNS 2 on PS3 and was fascinated by how long a game, which is technically not bringing much changes to the gameplay, can be played (nonstop?!).So when UNS3FB was available for less than 10€, I just HAD to purchase it! And I've not since regretted buying it!When I first wanted to start playing, I was irritated, I have no controller for PC and there are no standard settings for playing with keyboard, so the first thing you gotta do is configurate your keybindings.When I started playing then, I was surprised how ""normal"" the difficulty was (thought it would be hell without controller).Fights are (so far) not hard to win, but that's gonna change for sure later (at least I'll/you'll have problems with S-Ranks).There are slight changes in the gameplay though (e.g. no items usable without a fight, only way to replenish health is either Ichiraku or bentos).Well, all in all I am happy I took the chance to play it for not much money, though eventually I would pay the full price now (if I hadn't used that opportunity)			"

												Very Impressive!!! I was skeptical at first because it was based on XBox, but controls can be easily configured the way you like them. Very fast gameplay, and very rewarding. Adventure mode ties me right into the story, and i have had a lot of fun so far. As a note, i still recommend a controller for 2 player.			"

												A ton of characters, a non-stop action story that remains faithful to the manga and the boss battles are to die for.Although a flawed game with a lot of port problems that you won't see while playing in a console you'll instantly get sucked to the universe of this great franchise.If you're a Naruto fan or you're looking for a different fighting game then you're in for a treat.Better when played with mates, online or wandering the different villages on adventure mode.

												The game is beautiful. The animations, backgrounds, colors, everything. Its a lot better than Naruto fighters of the past and has a HUGE roster of characters. Each fighter feels different too, which to me is important in fighting games. The story mode is fun, its just kind of annoying how it doesn't really ask you to save or give you a break after fights/cutscenes. Somtimes I want to stop playing, but the story mode just continues without notice. Overall, solid, fun game and highly recommended!			"

												Hora, shinobi!That game is really awesome for people, that likes Tekken like games.And you will enjoy even more, if you are watching a anime Naruto Shippuden.It's Naruto's story line after epic fight with Naruto and Pain, to another awesome and epic fight with Naruto and Tobi.I'd really enjoyed a QiuckTime Events :) That's the most epic part of game. Of course, if you want to see fight your favorite's Shinobi, you can use Free Battle.For me, it's 9/10. But i am fan of Naruto so you have to decide by your own.			"

												Graphics are beautiful, runs rather nicely. Action is very fluid and entertaining. Not to mention it's on sale right now for only 7.50...If you're a fan of the Naruto series and have followed it, you may or may not enjoy the long and often cinematics compared to the fighting.If you've enjoyed Naruto games in the past, this one will blow you away...The only downside i could think of is the Keybindings for Keyboard controls are fun to figure out, but once you get the idea down you'll be fine. If you pickup a controller you'll be breezing through the Story in no time. Then again there's always online matches...First online match:-Deidara as the enemy, 1000 battle points worth of fights. Great! This should be a fun battle right?-Spams the SAME move over and over until my health is gone.10/10 would get spammed again for the sake of pretty explosions.			"

Pro- a huge character pool- a good amount of story and story fights- gameplay mechanics is easy and feels great with a controller (just as on consoles)- feels easy to play so also guess fine for minors- it does not force you to win online fights for anything :PCon- to some it may feel to easy to obtain S Ranks (nearly S ranked all so far without even trying)- did not have any to me (so far)i give it an honest 10/10best naruto game played so far as said			"

Some spoilers may be shown hereFirst of all, this game has an awesome storyline, however a lot of it is made up of cutscenes. If you think of it as watching TV, it's alright. The battling and the camera angles are perfect. The free battling is a lot of fun. I'm currently  halfway through versing Tobi, the 7 Jinchuriki and the Taile Beasts, which I think is pretty hard for 1 health bar. The online play needs some fixing as it is really laggy, even when I try doing it right next to another computer. This kind of takes away from the fun atmosphere of multi-player. But is there any difference between 3 and Full Burst? I don't really think there is. Overall, it's a great and addictive game, but I'd price it at maybe $15-$25, I'm not sure it's worth the full $40.			"

												I don't like Naruto. I am not a big fighting game fan. I only bought it because it was on sale.... and I don't regret it for once o.o.Pros:-The story was very cohesive and actually well paced (i know...story in a fighting game. Who would have thought).  I actually enjoyed the story -The controls are surprizingly good if you use the controller. - Somewhat of an open world feeling. I guess after you beat story mode, you can walk around the ninja world and do side quests (some which are very entertaining)Cons: -if you are an hardcore fighting gamer you might be disappointed. No tricky combos. Plays more like Super smash brothers. -cut scenes can go on forever-no real tutorial so you just have to figure out how to do a lot of the actions yourself (tips in the loading screens help)Don't judge this game by the title.

												Let me preface this review by saying I do not watch this or any Chinese cartoons, but from what I can gather through the story is that it's an animated version of Brokeback Mountain where there is too many characters with very colourful magical spells. Also, ignore the few number of hours I've spent on the game because I played it on a friend's PS3. By ""played"" I mean marathoning the entire story in a night.-----------------------------------------------As much as I can't stomach the whole ""power of friendship"" vibe present in this game, I can't deny that the story wasn't awesome despite the absolute disregard for the laws of motion and absence of gravity. You'll have fun in the campaigns as long as you don't ask too many questions and just accept the convoluted rainbow of homo-erotic references and tentacles as a cornerstone of any game coming out of Japan. You essentially rescind all rights to question the content of the game upon reading its title. Seriously, just read that title to yourself out loud.There's about 80 characters you can play as, most of them in the versus mode, the online matching which I haven't tried, but if the local versus is anything to go by it's a lot of fun to absolutely pummel the fecal matter out of your opponent with your magic spells.A steal when on sale.

There is plenty of opportunities to get really cool screenshots for display on your profile. The controlls are smooth and really easy to get the hang of. I can't say anything bad about this game honestly. if you haven't seen the naruto shippuden series then i suggest you watch up to at least episode 47 to get a sense of what the story is like and then you will understand the game a little bit better. but overall perfect game. 10/10			"

												Great game, buy it on♥♥♥♥♥for the best price. Regardless, the pvp system is great except for the fact that 99% of players are in EU so they lag a tad bit and dealing with lag in this game is horrendous. Other than that, awesome game totally recommend buying it			"

												As first, I want to say, that I really love Naruto series. It is, in my opinion, best anime. And that is the reason, why I bought this game. Single player of this game is more about story, than playing. But who cares, this game is great. Multiplayer is really good too. For anybody, who likes Naruto and he/she consider buing it, I can just say: BUY IT!! For Naruto fans is this game ""must have game"".			"

												My favorite fighting game experience since budokai tenkaichi 3. The art style, the tie in to the anime, the fantastic gameplay that both makes you feel like a supreme badass, and constantly reminds you that there are planty fighters out their that can kick your lilly a**, it all comes together to make this the best Naruto game to date, and the story puts it farther ahead than its successor as well. While the following game had many improvements, new mechanics, and many new fighters, it lacked in story. Still, I recommend both!			"

												Unless you have a gamepad, do not buy this game. It's absolutely terrible you have to set your own keyboard controls and it's not ported very well. It's just a pain, when I play in the game if I press too many keys at once on the keyboard it just presses them in random order and sometimes randomly opens the menu. It's like when I play against a CPU I'm the CPU, it's ridiculous. Would not recommend.			"

												I bought this game to provide a summarised version of the events that took place during Shippuden. I found the anime took too long to progress with the main timeline, with 5 minute pauses of soliloquy which the manga managed to deal with in one page. This game does provide the core moments of Naruto with no filler ""episodes"", the only filler in this game could be the exploration aspect which seems a bit pointless, even collecting the items scattered across the area does not assist with battle which provides many points to purchase items. The battles are brilliantly orchestrated and animated. The fighting aspects/gameplay took me a while to grasp because this was my first Naruto game although after using the ""substitute"" feature the game is not that hard and often too simple but there are great battles here and they are really really well implemented, perhaps more exciting and intriguing than the anime. I would recommend this game to fans who have missed out on the Shippuden series and to fans who enjoyed the series and would like to relive the battles. I did feel unfufilled after completeing the campaign because of the many story elements left open. It would be great if they provided the option to play as the ""bad"" guys. I got a bit tired of the Naruto philosophy of peace and friendship because this is Shonen Jump after all, its very simplistic philosophy and its meant to promote some sort of sociatal norm of parenting, friendship, ""why do you fight?"", ""to protect"", ""bleh"", and side steps most of this arguments and tries to simplify some of it which made me wonder why I watch Naruto in the first place perhaps I want more from the relationship between Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. I am not really interested in the other characters and therefore this anime just seems to be deviating from what makes it special....but anyway great game, pick it up if its on special but its more an interactive story than game but with great fights....really great fights "

												It's Just fun. I personally haven't even cared for naruto games since about what... Clash of ninja...  But this... It feels like someone took Dragonball Z Threw it on the floor and then smashed it with a gutted One Peice grand adventure.As far as battling goes, It's your run or the mill kaiblast spam enabled fighter where you can either sweat it out with actual skill or 200 Million volts amal virtually the whole game. It does feel less enabled to do that seeing as the moves are very easy to do and a flick of the stick an change to varying combos. So it is very VERY easy to look and enjoy the game visually without buggering about specific moves or getting traped into a bind or ai that refuses to stop spamming you into the dirt. It's just fun. And it's sad that is the easiest way I can describe this game.Just like most of the dragonball z series games, the game will give you the story while you play, though Naruto feels exponentially more immersive as to give you the mood and air of the moment while also letting you play, something that most attention to detail games like mass effect or such manage to so while you're playing. (or I really need to play newer games because a lot of newer games are just doing things right.) Nonetheless, instead of the normal something is about to happen here is what it is and a small flashback as to why, like sonic games and such. This game gives more of an RPG like place in the game, letting you observe details and characters from the beginning, and actively letting you use them, accompanied with allies who may have also been present. Long story short... It is really a great experience to be had.Experience wise. The potential and overall delivery of the game is probably the best part to me. The menus and interface, the overworld and different types of battles as well as a grand sum of characters does very well as a fan service  as well as a new game. Mob battles feel very much akin to games like dynasty warriors but multiplied by classic beat em ups. Small chechpointed areas and a fun way to see how your characters would work against everyone who isn't really a hero. It's beautifully presented, plays very smooth, and shows what the games can really become at any time provided people either ask for it or beg for a mod. It's hard to explain, But when you see two main characters and two assist characters on stage, it seems to really put up for some actual team battles. (Don't know if they exist) All in all, It's surely a good time and plays as good as it looks creative. Shoot me in the foot though, as I wish whoever is pushing the art for borderlands would flip a few tables over here, because I'm almost too sure that the series could look like a tearfully joyous creation provided their models went through some other sort of process... You know... where bloom isn't a thing? But I know that that will probably never happen and if it did... I'd need to get some depends. No points against it at all for that, or anything for that matter.I reccomend it for anyone who likes naruto or fighting games, open movement 3d fighting games to be specific, who also wanted to have rpg elements and unlockables along with scattered goodies that seperate it from normal fighting games.

												The fourth Storm game in the Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm series, a dynamic and intense 3D fighting game set in the Naruto Universe as the name suggests, this game is purely made for the fans of the show and manga. It is faithful to both and has a large amount of characers to choose from and has beautiful cutscenes that top even the anime itself, thanks to it's visually impressive graphics. Though it's not without it's problems.The Story:The game begins with the Nine Tails demon fox attack on the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha) and you get to play as memorable ninja like the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze and the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi. If these names sound unfamiliar to you then you haven't seen the show and thus won't really appreciate what this game has to offer, for it's story though it does attempt to bring newcomers in with the first mission fighting the tailed beast in an epic boss battle in the Leaf Village. After that the game fast forwards to a more recent timeline where our hero Naruto is renowned as the Hero of the village for defeating Pain in the previous game and has earnt everyone's respect. The game continues to tell the story in a open world-ish style where the player controls the characters and explores the world completing main story missions that contain very nicely done cutscenes, alot of talking and with some fights in between which really will please the Naruto fans with it's narrative newcomers will most likely be confused though, despite this the story mode is one of the best features in this game for me anyway.Gameplay:Naruto Storm 3 is a fighting game with many mechanics involved you can attack with strings of combos at the push of a button and moving the analogue stick (if your using a controller which is reccommended) up or down, you will get a different combo. You can use chakra to perform jutsu's and ultimate jutsu's which are flashy and over the top and is faithful to the characters, chakra can be used for dashing and enchancing shuriken throws.You can team up with two other support characters in team matches if you get tired of the single matches and this opens up new gameplay strategies, you can select what role your support characters can be such as support, defense and attack type. Each member can be summoned out and attack the opponent or called upon during a combo dash attack, once the team gauge is completely filled though you can perform a team ultimate jutsu combo, you can pick characters that work in a team in the show or completely make up your own team as there are loads to choose from. Although most of the characters use the same formula just with a different skin, each one has their own personal movesets and fighting style, making this game incredibly easy to just pick up and play which might turn off some professional fighting gamers.The boss battles are definitley a highlight in this game as they are both exciting and visually appealing it really shows how much time and effort the developers have put in to make these memorable fights epic, they even add some of their own cinematic fights in the game, such as extending the Naruto and Sasuke fight when they've reunited after Sasuke killed Danzo. The fights cutscenes are mostly QTE's but you do actually fight them like a normal match and the QTE's appear in certain moments of the fight, you are graded when completing the boss battles and it's satisfying to get an S rank on everyone of them.Another mode within the story campaign is the Mob battles which are similar to the Dynasty Warrior games, at certain points in the story mode you fight a mob of enemies and try to reach the goal this is an interesting element to the series, but the moments are short lived and there isn't that many which is dissapointing,.One last thing that Namco Bandai have added is the Ultimate Decision mode which allows the player to select decisions in the story, choosing Hero will result in an easier fight but with less rewards and experience to level up your item slots however Legend will have a harder fight but will have better rewards. The outcome doesn't matter that much but the fights themselves will change accordingly like in the Nine Tails attack you can choose to fight the Masked Man as Minato first, or fight the Nine Tails instead. Graphics: Naruto Storm games are known for having impressive and stunning visuals for it's graphics this really shows during the cutscenes, they aren't animated in fact they are full 3D models that are very detailed that contrast well with the colourful environments during the battles. Although the map is mostly scenery and window dressing even after the map has been blown up by Naruto's Tailed Beast Bomb ultimate jutsu, it even shows an explosion during the scene and somehow the environment remains untouched in future I would like a more dynamic battlefield,Sound:The music in this game although decent isn't very memorable I couldn't tell you what my favourite tracks were as I can with Payday 2, it's mostly repeated songs during fights and aren't very entertaining mostly piano symphonies if your into that kind of thing, which isn't to say it's bad just that you won't be downloading the soundtrack at anytime. Voice acting in English is fairly well done though I highly suggest playing Japanese voices. The sound effects themselves are great Naruto's Rasengan sounds like a Rasengan, Sasuke's Chidori sounds like how it should be you get the idea.Overall Naruto fans will love the story mode and the wide variety of familiar characters to choose from the game isn't completely up to date with the manga but it finishes off fairly close to where the anime left off at a certain point. I decided to review this game as the manga is ending within 5 weeks I hope you all enjoyed my review and will consider getting into the series, as it has it's action, comedy, interesting characters and some deep messages within for you to experience.Pros+Good storymode +Faithful visuals+Lots of characters +Many game modes +Easy to pick up and playCons- Laggy frame rate (though patch has improved it)- Hard to find a online game- Might put off fans of fighting games such as Street Fighter or Tekken for it's simpleness - Optimisation could be better			"

												Note: This review is only based on how good of a game it is in terms of it being good, not on it's money value.  I'm a veteran fan(sort of), I played Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Generation.  This game surpasses it by a long shot. The story mode was 10/10.  It recreated all those emotional anime scenes with the game engine.  With beautiful visuals and graphics.  The music and the scenery had me feel like I was in the game and I was important to the story and the protection of the Hidden Leaf Village.  The free roam portion during the main story is cool.  Not much to say but that it's a nice factor.  Nothing really special about it.  One thing I liked were the very very challening fights when you picked Legend as the outcome.  I liked a good challenge and yeah I would die sometimes but it was a lot of fun.  The VS mode is back with a tiny upgrades.  It's more balanced then prevous titles like Generations.  The fighting style is unique.  It's not perfect to being fair 100% but it's close.  A huge roster of characters.  People say that they gave us characters that nobody even cares about.  That's not true, their fighting styles are all cool to try out.  The online was good.  Tournament was so much fun!  You could watch the battles of other players when it's not your turn.  The random battle conditions make it intense.  But some battle conditions just mean spam the ultimate jutsu until it lands and you win instantly.  I give this game a 10/10.  Beautiful game.  Only problems I've encountered is that sometimes the online can be laggy.  Just some minor problems with the net code is all.			"

												If you're a fan of Naruto and in the mood for some over the top craziness, this is the game for you. While not very challenging at all, the game does keep you engadged with some really cool reinterpretations straight from the anime/manga, accompanied by cutscenes and quicktime events. The battle system itself is very straight forward and easy to learn, though it's a shame that none of the AI opponents never really challenge you, which can make an otherwise awesome mechanic feel a little stale. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is unplayable, with de-syncs that stop the match every 2-3 seconds. That being said though, the local multiplayer is tons of fun, and where you can really experiment and mess around with the combat system.This is a great game for any naruto fan that wants to go back through the story, though with a little bit more interactivity, or for anyone looking for a great local multiplayer fighting game.

												I was very happy to see this released on Steam, I have not played a Naruto game since 2008-9ish so my memories of these games are them having moderately hard controls but as soon I picked up my controller I was able to figure out the controls in less than a minute, which for someone who isnt good at fighting games is a big plus. The story it self is pretty solid and true to the anime except for the ending, for obvious reasons. The graphics for this game are great and fit the game very well, the cutscenes are recreated scenes from teh anime using the games engine which alone was worth the money for this game. I would recommend this game to any Naruto fan or even any fan of fighting games.			"

I'd advise plowing through the story(skipping cutscenes if you want) to unlock the characters so you can have a variety of them to play with. Combat, while simple, is fun.Fans of Naruto:     A majority of cutscenes are skippable, the characters have a variety of costumes and there is plenty to unlock.			"

												This is a great game for any Naruto fan. It has a nice graphical style, and very cinematic battles. But the game has many flaws, mainly its combat system. The combat in this game lacks depth, though the community has addapted and made some creative strategies with support characters and combos. Also the cutscenes are VERY long, you'll spend 75% of the time at least watching cutscenes, you can skip them but they are important for the story. There are over 80 characters to pick from but they are pretty much the same mechanically, except for a few that stand out. Still, the story mode is fun, and it has online multiplayer with a ranking.			"

												Just like the normal version on Xbox 360/PS3, it is essentially the same game. However, there are many small changes. The first one I noticed was having almost every chracter unlocked from the get-go (normally you have to unlock the majority of them through Adventure Mode) But hey, it saves a lot of time. Story Mode was exactly the same save for a few changes in scenery and dialogue. Definitely a lot more like the Anime than the original game. Obviously if you're a fan of Naruto, you will most likely like this game. The fighting mechanics are pretty neat (though there are spammers online so watch out) and the Ultimate Jutsu moves are just beautiful. Very good game indeed; I just wish they went farther into the storyline. But hey, that's what the next game ""Ninja Storm Revolution"" is for, right?8/10			"

												this is a very fun game but i will say this for spoilers that don't play this until you have ether wathched the anime or read the manga or play ultimate ninja storm 1 and 2 now the game is very fun as i said before and the controls are very good with a controler i don't know about the key board controls because i used my ps3 contrloer to play this.one of the game problems is that during the final fight when you spoilers get to play as the nine tails that is the only time you get to play as himalso as you might expect the english dub is very good and there is also the original japanise audio if you do not like the dub now the story of the game contiuse where strom 2 left of after the fight with pain and covers some of the 4th grate ninja war and i personaly as someone who likes naruto think that they did a good job representing the war also there is a vast roster of playable ninja just to name a few naruto saskue kakashi and madara and my personal favreat dadara in conclusion it is a vary fun game that is worth the time of any naruto fan and if you don't mind not knowing what is going on for none naruto fas too also i appologis for my speling			"

												Awesome game! Even if you don't watch Naruto or aren't even an anime watcher, this game is a must-have for melee/action gamers. With this game, you can accustom yourself to a character (or a set of characters), master him/her, and show him/her off in online battle. Unlike traditional combat games such as Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, this game makes action sequences more simple and complex at the same time. Instead of playing in the 2D format of the aforementioned games with specific button-pushing combos, this game offers combo diversity without having to remember a ton of sequences. In this game, you can just repeatedly press the melee button and choose which direction you want to send your opponent to, and it should send them flying off to the desired direction. Moreover, this game allows you to utilize the expense of special attack energy (in this case chakra). This chakra allows players to gather up energy and expend it in a variety of ways: ninjutsu (special attack), dash, strong shuriken throws, and etc. Manipulating energy in this fashion allows for more complex gameplay, whereas others games would force players to spam attacks in order to win a game. This and many other facets of the gameplay make this game a must-buy.			"

You have pretty much the same like the last few parts. Talk sequences can be skipped, but if you try to watch them it takes very long because the talking takes very long. Fights are the same like the last games. More Characters, new skills and new animations. Well done. Recommended.			"

												By far the most extensive naruto game I have ever owned and played. It is extremely faithful to the series in both combat and cutscenes. I'm fairly certain this game has the largest character roster of any of its predecessors. Combat is more strategic than aggro this time around as you have to calculate when is the best time to use an assist or rush in least you be punished with an ultimate special right to the face. This game's greatest feature hands down is the story mode. My only disappointment is the offline battle soundtrack, there seems to be none or very little selection when playing against the cpu or friends but it doesn't detour from the game. Perfect 10/10 must have for a fan of the series.			"

I really like how much they put on the story of naruto on this game, and the boss fight like the ninetales (kurama) was really well done.if you are really a naruto fan is a Must buy!..............but I am still waiting that steam put a game of one piece on steam jaajajaajajjajajajaaj xd			"

												Amazing game. Solid single player with again more upgrades compared to the older versions, and ofcourse pc quality graphics.The online seems to work smoothly ofcourse connecting to people who have a slow ISP will need more time to pick a character and load a map.As for combat itself, theres 4 keys. Melee / Ranged / Chakra / Dash.But its not as simple as that. chakra+melee = special / chakra chakra melee = ultimate and so on, you can combine chakra activations with attacks and movement.Also you can combine movements with attacks like holding down while tapping melee will result in a diffrent combo this will make your oponents timing on defending harder.And each character has a special ranged/melee combo wich can be accesed with forward forward melee how it is followed up depends on character you are usingMinor downside for me personally is that in single player fights some finishing moves involve buttons to be pressed in time or mashed wich distracts from the amazing jawdropping scenes running in the back.(sadly they have done this as long as ive played ultimate ninja games)			"

												Let me preface this review by saying I do not watch this or any Chinese cartoons, but from what I can gather through the story is that it's an animated version of Brokeback Mountain where there is too many characters with very colourful magical spells. Also, ignore the few number of hours I've spent on the game because I played it on a friend's PS3. By ""played"" I mean marathoning the entire story in a night.-----------------------------------------------As much as I can't stomach the whole ""power of friendship"" vibe present in this game, I can't deny that the story wasn't awesome despite the absolute disregard for the laws of motion and absence of gravity. You'll have fun in the campaigns as long as you don't ask too many questions and just accept the convoluted rainbow of homo-erotic references and tentacles as a cornerstone of any game coming out of Japan. You essentially rescind all rights to question the content of the game upon reading its title. Seriously, just read that title to yourself out loud.There's about 80 characters you can play as, most of them in the versus mode, the online matching which I haven't tried, but if the local versus is anything to go by it's a lot of fun to absolutely pummel the fecal matter out of your opponent with your magic spells.A steal when on sale.

												The Game was great although I miss the old features from previous storm games where you could for example walk on walls.			"

												Hi players and fans of anime and game like Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is just perfect and the Naruto series I'm glad it was on sale for little money and therefore memos reason to give a dislike to put it like nothing else deserves and therefore Japanese the games are the most in my 100% and it has perfekní story.

												Haven't played it that much yet, but I'm rather surprised on how smoothly it runs on my PC, considering its amazing graphics. Storyline is great (so far), pretty much like watching the anime in a (sometimes) different perspective with some bonus scenes.Looking great, totally not disapointed, will totally spent a few more hours on this. Probabily more than a few.			"

												I don't know if this is just me or anyone else but when I play story mode the final chapter Tsunade vs. Madara when its goes to the button mashing part,there is a certain part that makes my computer crash and also if I use Shikamaru Ultimate Justu the computer crashes -.-But other than that this game is pretty fun I wish there wasn't as much cut-scenes though			"

												Fun as ♥♥♥♥, do not regret buying at all.Gets a bit grind-y and cutscene-y at times, but real tears were wept during both the confrontation between Sasuke and Naruto (strange, because I hate Sasuke with a passion) and the reunion with Kushina (where I actually had to take a break overnight the first time I hit it because too many feels).Story mode is kind of ehhh, I get that fighting games tend to be pretty railroady (especially when there's already an established canon) but handing down an S-rank♥♥♥♥♥whupping only to get a cutscene of the recipient brushing you off gets real old real fast.Other than that, my only gripes were that there weren't enough mob battles, and the only real ones were from Sasuke's POV (who I, as mentioned previously, despise utterly) and Darui's (who really gives a ♥♥♥♥ about Darui?) which was on a time limit to boot.

												I was pleasantly surprised with this game, apart from a few annoyances in the story mode, and also now with Ninja Storm 4 being out, most people will be playing that multiplayer, so maybe you won't find random people to easily to play this with. But overall it was a good experience for me, and I felt it was worth it.Pros------- Decent combat system which is fun to master.- QTE Scenes from the story mode were the best part of the game.- Good transfer of the anime plot to a fighting game experience.- Lots of extra stuff in the game, especially the ability to do the historic fights from the previous games.Cons------- Game is split up into tons of loading screens.- Not a great port from console to pc overall, with bugs and performance issues.- Some frustrating moments in story mode that can't be skipped when redo-ing ""Seventails"" -_-- Interlude running sections between areas feel pointless.

												Until the developer adds the need for a controller to play this, I won't recomend this to any of my friends. I'm sure it's a good game and looks fun, but the controls are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed in this. AND YES! Before anyone tries to reply to me, I DID change the damn controls and they STILL pop up only as Xbox or the Steam Controller buttons.			"

												Worst camera angles ever, When I was fighting the tailed beasts you could barely even make out if i was hitting them or if they were hitting me. Also, two tailed beasts would attack at the same time so you would no time to dodge. In the end the game has poor fighting mechanics and camera angles which puts you in a disadvantage when trying to enjoy the game. P.S. the flying f*cking tailed beast is the cancerousest one of em all.			"
