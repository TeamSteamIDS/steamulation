												Meh. Let me be the first non lazy person to write a bad review. This game was for a dollar the first 1-2 hours it came out on steam. Devloper decided to make it free-to-play, possibly to introduce more people into this game, for future buying of the next episodes. Everyone with a high point-n-click games standards may avoid this without further reading. Everything in the game is a HUGE BORE. Story is really nothing special to keep you playing. Characters are so uninspired. The art style is dull. Humour is very lacking. Everything else is too simple. Like, flash-game-style simple.  I know this game is indie, and you can't have high expectations on this type of genre, but i've seen games better than this on flash-portals for free. This game is free too, but you will have to pay for future episodes (possibly). So i don't see a point of this being on steam, maybe on the mobile store, but not here. Steam is turning into another google play very quickly, but that doesn't mean you've got to help him suffer. Have mercy.			"

												Terrible game. The voices were terribly done, and the main character complains too much. There are some moments where you really do need to use hints, like when you have to talk to the bad tempered guard and ask him ""What's with you"" 3x - Come on, how are we supposed to know that his response is going to change after asking the same question multiple times? Well atleast most of the characters in this chapter don't have different responses. The voice of the girl is really cheesy and annoying, and the guard voices are terrible too, especially the ""Muscular guard"". Also, the game takes too long to get around, there should be a run option or something to speed up movement. If you want a game that's like this but is a lot better - try The Silent Age on iPhone or Android. Hopefully the next chapters of this game will be decent, but this game was just awful.			"

												This game was ok, i've only started playing Point&Click games, so i can't compare it to much. It was the same, click on everything to see what it is, talk to people you meet, put items in an inventory & use them to interact with other items or parts of the enviroment (you know, the same stuff as usual).The story is pretty simple, you wake-up under guard in a hospital, with a minor case of amnesia. The aim of this episode is (as the title sugests) to escape. The writting was good, with a (very) few ok jokes.This was a very short game, i finished it in about 1hr, but i had fun the whole time. I'll get the 2nd Episode if it's on sale, just to see what happens next.I'll re-play it to get the ""Finish Game Twice"" achievement, & then i'll have another 100% Perfect GameConsidering this game is free, i don't think there's much reason not to play it. It's a small download & the game is finished quickly & is fun. Enjoy. "

												Although it's free, this game is short...and boring.You awake not knowing where you are. Alright, now what? There are no immediate clues as to what you should do at any point in the game. If you aren't used to thinking outside the box, then this game will give you a problem. The constant, ""Hey, are you there?"" after standing still for 10 seconds waiting for a hint was annoying. The voices weren't that great, either - they all sound computer generated. Although, according to the credits, different people played each character. The main character doesn't give many clues to what you have to do, either - he just says, ""Why?"" or, ""Umm...no."" or, ""I don't think I need that."" If you don't know that you have to throw the newspaper in the garbage can, grab some leather and matches, and start a fire, then you're stuck standing there until you can use your next hint. Fortunately, you only have to wait 2.5 minutes in between each one. But, as I said before, the constant, ""Hey, are you there?"" is annoying.Also, the storyline - it is intriguing as to what happened to the city and why/how he lost his memory, but the game doesn't give you any clues to that, even after completing it. Yes, it is the first chapter, and yes, I know more will probably be revealed in future chapters, and that is why much isn't revealed, but after finishing the game and still not knowing close to anything, I really have no desire to play the future chapters, especially if they are as bland as this one. I know you can't expect too much from the point & click genre, but this looks like it was made more than two years ago. The artwork is pretty bland, even for a two dimensional game, and I got tired of looking at it after a while.If you keep the audio in the default settings, you're likely to notice that there are times when the music is way too loud when characters are talking. However this can be adjusted in the settings menu.If you're looking for a short game to pass some time, then this will keep you entertained for a bit. But if you're looking for an intriguing game that will always keep you on your toes, with good artwork and sound, then this isn't for you.One final thing....why is hypnotizing a rat an achievement? It does absolutely nothing to help you progress in any way. Just why.I'm sure someone will completely disagree with me and everything I said, but this is a review, and so it is my opinion. If the next installments are the same as this, I definitely won't be playing them, although I'll probably give the next one a try just to see. TL;DR - bad art, bad voices, too short, no clues for what to do next, bland storylineEDIT: I noticed the second chapter is available, however it isn't free. I would never pay for it especially considering how uninteresting the first chapter was. So going off of that I won't be trying it.			"

												The best word to summarise this game is ""amateurish"". While it's ok at its core, I can't recommend it while respecting your time, because it doesn't add anything to the genre while failing on some basic levels: The English voice acting is bad. And I mean really bad. It's literally the worst I've ever heard in my life. It's so bad that it's funny. They actually made the game worse by adding this content. This shouldn't be considered a show stopper, as you can just disable it, and I've recommended adventure games without voice acting before. But it's the first thing you'll notice and it does taint the experience unless you turn it off. Unfortunately, you'll be falling back on dialogue which is not much more believable than the voice acting. People just don't talk that way. There is also some English translation weirdness, but it's relatively minor. The UI breaks de facto adventure gaming standards. You have to double click to open a verb dial. You can also double click to navigate to the next screen, so single click is literally not needed in the game, making me wonder why they didn't just use single click everywhere, like virtually all other adventure games. This takes some getting used to. Breaking convention for no good reason is one thing, but breaking it while making things more awkard suggests no thought was given to this at all. Another example: rather than spacebar to highlight hotspots, the shortcut is ctrl-tab. CTRL-TAB! Fortunately there's also a button on the toolbar to do this, so no biggie. For the most part, the puzzle design is pretty good, but this is undermined by some classic design shortcomings: (a) One puzzle requires asking the same person the same question 3x until his answer changes. (b) Often, you won't be able to interact with an object until you examine it first, so I found myself trying [use] then [examine], and walking away fruitless, when [examine] then [use] would have produced a result. (c) The game suffers from the character having to learn things the player may already have thought of before an action can be taken, and it feels a bit patronising being forced to jump through hoops to do what you intended all along. The industry has long since moved on from these very oldschool design choices, as they increase the likeliness of needing a walkthrough to complete the game while adding no enjoyment, and it's disappointing to see them return in a modern game. On one playthrough (there is an achievement for completing the game twice; the only reason anyone would), an item I needed to complete the game never appeared in the inventory. This game is only 1 hour long, and that's a pretty horrid bug. Another time I was massive and walking on the ceiling, but exiting the screen fixed that.I guess to be fair I should speak to Reversion chapter 1's good points: The puzzles are generally interesting (though frequently undermined as summarised above). The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some humour including breaking the fourth wall. The art is decent enough, and suits the games often comical tone (but your walk animation is kinda amateur/hilarious). It's free (but it's really only a demo for the proceeding commercial chapters, and chapter 2 has a worse community rating than this). I honestly can't think of anything else. Does music which is just passable enough to not get on my nerves as it loops every 55 seconds count as a positve? What the hell, it does now. "

												Very simple game which even though it is very cheap, is far far far too short. Theres an achievement to complete it in under 4 hours....my first play though took minutes. Seems like the game may be good eventually, but, this installment is very short. As far as the game itself goes, its not too bad. If you like point and clicks it will occupy you for 20mins.			"

												I played A LOT of point and click adventures back in their glory days and even play some now and then. This game is bad. I know is free, but it is really bad.I can't stand the voice acting, is so terrible I had to mute to keep playing.The game is too slow one can get bored after the first couple of minutes, and the gameplay, inventory handling and plot didn't help at all. The game is short, but I'm glad it is, really.I think the developer should remove the voices, really, just remove it. They should also use a ""run"" feature to help speed the gameplay a bit and improve the gameplay mechanics.I can't recommend this game, but maybe will play episode 2 if they improve it.			"

												Ignore the fact that I actually beat this game twice. 1. I felt like getting all the achievements on a game. 2. The game is very short and free. and 3. Sometimes I am just in a masochistic mood. :p  Unless you are super bored or want to punish yourself, you should avoid this game. One of the main problems is the voice acting. It's SO bad that is was actually painful to listen to. And the story isn't much better. It doesn't make a lot of sense and I didn't find it interesting at all. Add in the fact that the game is short and when you finish it, you don't feel satisfied since it's ""to be continued"", and it's really not worth it. I'm sure they made it free so you'd 'purchase' the second one to find out what happens next. There is NO way I am spending any money on the sequel and to be honest, even if the second one is also free, unless it gets better reviews from people than this one, I'll pass.			"

												This is a nice (and very short) point'n'click adventure. Some pleasent music and graphics = atmosphere. More animations on ""events"" would be nice. The puzzles are pretty easy, but not bad.The game has kind of a silly feeling and also somehow feels unfinished (maybe it is the dialog and the easy puzzles), but it was a good exprerience though.I hope the episode 2 is not as bad as the reviews say. Anyway, I hopefully won't be paying 5,95e for it.. as that is too much for a short game like this. At least this one was free of charge. Got me a bit hooked on story.			"

The guy also moves reaaaaally slow and its annoying. For free game this is alright but I don't know if i would pay that much for the second chapter when this was not that interesting. I'll buy the second one if it is in really good sale but never for price it now has.Recommend only because it is free and you loose nothing. Don't pay for this.			"

												Nice graphics, lousy voice acting, and absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game system. Does the developer not have any idea how other point-n-click adventure games work?Examples of what I mean:1) Your character has to walk up to any object before he will comment on it, regardless of whether your chosen action is ""look"" or ""interact"". Such a completely pointless waste of time! This is made extra irritating by the fact that your character walks slower than a snail and there is absolutely no way to control walking speed!2) Why make your character walk if the walking animation is ugly-looking as hell?! He actually ""overlaps"" the doctor when he walks towards him! Even 8-bit pixel adventure games have better walking animation!3) To look at or use any active object in the playing screen, you have to double-click on that object, wait for that object's menu to pop up, then select ""look"" or ""interact"". As if the double-clicking isn't bad enough, each time you double-click, your character starts to walk towards the object, even though you haven't selected an action to perform and may not ultimately select one! Bearing in mind how ugly-looking and painfully SLOW the walking is (see point #2 above), this just makes doing simple things like looking at stuff a painstaking, tedious affair.I just didn't have the patience for this one. I would suggest that the developer look at and play other good adventure games, then follow their example in terms of controls and interactivity.			"

												Oh those amnesia stories…how much I loath them. To me, those storylines are a total copout of trying to tell a suspenseful plot by ‘discovering’ your past. Yet some have done a reasonable job like Stalker and XIII. This game Reversion – The Escape is a difficult one to state whether this amnesia copout plotline holds up as it forms part of a trilogy. Being the first one, there’s not much to say as your main goal is to escape the hospital and because it only last one hour, its best-selling point is that it’s free, and there’s nothing wrong with that unless you want to continue on with the saga then you have to pay for them (I think it’s around $AUD 6 each).The game plays out as your typical point and click adventure game. Double left click to get the menu where you can talk / grab or examine or right click to access your inventory. You can also join items by dragging / dropping two items to make a third and some items are simply red herrings. So there’s nothing new presented here as far as adventure games are concerned.The puzzles presented are not challenging at all as the clues are quite obvious. Examples like ‘…for the moment’ triggers that you are missing some sort of action and so forth. Also there’s not a lot happening as it plays on one event leads on to another so you won’t be juggling many puzzles in one go. Thankfully the puzzles are all logical so it shouldn’t be too difficult to resolve them. Just examine and talk to everyone and you cannot fail.The game advertises that it plays homage to the old school adventure games. You can see this via the visuals as it all renders in 2D and actually does look nice. The character’s walking animation are quite stiff however you won’t be suffering from pixel hunting here. The musical scores are very pleasant to hear with sombre scores when doing some investigations and the title screen has an upbeat tempo. Sometimes I wonder if the game is an afterthought from the music itself. The voice acting is pretty decent too yet it has its odd moments of that ‘emotionless’ speech however nothing to cringe about.Because this game is free, you cannot argue how good / bad it is however because it forms part of a trilogy, I guess you can say you are getting an entrée before the main course. Yet the strongest feature for any adventure game is its storytelling however there’s nothing really thrilling about this one. If developers 3f interactive can pull it off with the next two and increase the length, then it would be a decent purchase overall. However time will tell if this is the case and as for me, the game wasn’t thrilling at all yet enjoyable enough to finish it off with all sixteen achievements earned.5 / 10			"

												First of all the game is free.It is a point & click game.Relaxing game, no stress (except if you are going for the achievments, some of them can be tricky)Graphics are cool, the game has its own style of characters and art. The only thing that I would like to say is that when you try to ""use"" an item or go to your inventory and then do something with the items can sometimes be a little hard to figure out. Its not a big problem though. You will get easily used to it.There are 16 achievments in total. All of them are relatively easy to obtain. I wouldnt say that its ""too hidden"". Some can ofcourse be tricky, but they are pretty cool and clever as well.Like I said earlier: It is Free to Play, and in my opinion the game is fun just like 77% of the other steam reviews posted.It is definitely one of the better Point & Click games out there.Dont hesitate, go download it, grab a soda or whatever you prefer and play.

												A wonky little point and click adventure dating into the whole 'World Meets Disaster by 2015' theories. Though it's concept is solid and it's gamplay very to the point. Enough so that the content is decently full of options and the exploration is somewhat ranged. For a first chapter it does its job of presenting a series potentially worth playing for the more diehard story orient people. However, the experience itself speaks contrary, as I felt like this was something I should have been playing five or more years ago. Back when my prepubescent self was still a thing. It's just one of those games where it has good foundation but is lacking a certain something.Three out of five Sedated Syringes for this game.I feel like it could have been a whole lot more I'm just not sure what exactly.

												I'm usually not overly picky about things and even if I think a game is bad I can find a few redeeming things about the experience--however this was not the case for this game. I did not enjoy it at all; in my opinion everything seemed to drag, the storyline was uninteresting, and to make matters worse the voice overs were so horribly done and corny that I couldn't take anything seriously (though I am speaking only for the English version). I understand that this is a free game, however I've seen and played better free games than this. My only reasoning for playing this game ever again will be for the achievements.			"

												I'm afraid I can't be totally objective, but here I go.This is the demo of a game, which is great because it is free, like most demos. After playing this one -as a demo- I would totally buy the rest of the game... BUT only if Chapter 2 isn't as short as this one.What I liked about this gamedemo (besides the beautiful Buenos Aires):The Argentinian mood: we don't really get to see the city of Buenos Aires (other than a glimpse of the Obelisc at the end), but the tango-inspired music and the Argentinian accent in the Spanish version are perfect. I haven't played the other languages, but even the casual cockyness of the characters is very Buenos Aires.The illustrations are nice and simple.The voice acting was quite good (again, I can only vouch for the Spanish version), with the participation of a well known Argentinian actor. Only a line here and there sounded a bit forced, but in general it was great, sounded natural and authentic. EXCEPT for the laughter. The two characters who laughed were awful at it, at least in Spanish.The little bits of humor, including Argentina as World Champion for the 6th time, which made me laugh in pain.There isn't pixel-hunting for that one item that kind of mimics with its background and gets you stuck in the game for ages. There aren't ridiculous combinations of items. Things are pretty logical.What I didn't like about this gamedemo:The gameplay becomes somewhat annoying. To interact with anything/anyone, you have to double-click on it, rather than the usual single click, and then decide if you want to look, use/take or speak.The only reason the gameplay doesn't get to be too annoying is that it's over before you get annoyed. However, if I consider it a demo, that's fine.All the puzzles are ""inventory based"" or just a series of actions, like asking more questions or using X on Y. These are all quite easy to figure out in this game. That's not so bad, but in the end it's not very challenging.All in all, I recommend anyone who likes classic point-and-click games to try this demo. I enjoyed it and now I'm curious about the rest.

Not too difficult, you have a tips system if you get stuck and every stage have a ""radar"" where you can see all the clickable items.The story seems ok, you are inside a hospital with the military services and you don't remember anything. And your first objective, is search a way out of the hospital.As it says, this ""chapter"" it's free. However you must to pay 5,99 for the next chapter of the game. And if it's short like this, I don't know if it's a nice buy (5,99 for one hour of game?). Anyways, I think I'll give a try to the second chapter.			"

												It's free, for the version without trading card drops, or else I wouldn't recommend it. The game system is very poorly designed: basically, you need to double-click something and choose what function to enact with it, walking slowly over to it, to do anything. This tends to get rather tedious, to a far greater extent than most such games, but fortunately the game is short enough to make such bearable. Also, the voice acting is particularly bad too. It has a sequel, which costs money, but I'm not sure yet if that one is any better. Still, for a free point-and-click game, it's not too bad. No game-breaking glitches that I could find (though there are some minor ones), a functional and logical puzzle system, and a simple and short, but coherent, story.			"

It's short and also easy to get 100% achievements on (if you are into that). The voice acting gets the job done but isn't memorable. Same goes for the sounds and music.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone and here are a few of the reasons:- The puzzles don't make any sense - there's no indication about what you are supposed to do next, so you spend all the time clicking objects around the room randomly, picking them up for a later use, without having a clue how they fit in the story. I must say that this is the first game I've played for which I needed to check a guide at almost every step.- Sometimes you need to repeat the same action several times until it unlocks the next step - which I find very annoying.- The mouse cursor doesn't change when you hover an object of interest or a person to talk to them. There are options to inspect objects, take them and talk to persons but those are enabled only if you click the right item.-  The inventory is opened in a separate window that covers almost entirely the game area. Every time you need to use an item from the inventory, you need to select the item, close the screen and only after that use the object with the desired target. I consider this to be a very bad design decision since the objects that are ment to be used together (from the inventory or from the scene) need to be visible all the time. - There is no option to skip the dialogues.On a positive note, it's a short game (around 1h of game play) with very easy achievements - in a single walkthrough you can collect all the achievements except one (that requires a second play through); although keep in  mind that some of them are known to be bugged. Nevertheless it's a very easy game to max out for the achievement collectors.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												Reversion is a science-fiction Point&Click Adventure Game developed by the indie 3f interactive. Inspired by classics of the genre. You will be propelled to a desolate future, robbed of your memories and looking desperately for a clue to understanding your predicament. Well, you're in a hospital, woke up facing an ugly doctor, a redhead woman, a broken window and a terribly voiced set of guards. You can't remember anything, but they tell you there's a civil war back in 2015, but you're at 2035. Did I get it right?VERDICT:The Good:- I like Point & Click games especially, horror ones.The Bad:-Voice acting (Except that hefty guard.)-That thing that plays in the settings says: ''Wala si, si.Wala si, si.'' I don't think that's any language. Serously, why would you annoy your players?-Gets very irritating when played over and over again.The Ugly:-The protagonist looks like my classmate. But I am not saying my classmate is ugly. :P A simple game, recommended to those people who want a random small-sized game to play. BUT Not recommended if you look for a very wise game. You'll have to be wise in order not to use the hint button and analyze stuff by yourself depending upon the story.3/10. "

												The Escape (1st Chapter) is a very short, point and click game. I tend to enjoy these games the most, however this has been one of my least favorite. The story behind it is very basic and knowing your next move is far too obvious. Only good thing I can scavenge from this was; 1) Easy to get a the Completed Game if you're an ""achievement hunter"". 2) Quickly beaten. Graphics was not horrible for the kind of game it was, but I must say; they walked quite oddly. Story was basic. Meaning it was a common idea and could easily be made up by nearly anyone as long as they had some kind of brain in them.Honestly, it was so short, that there is not much more to go on about.  "

												I'm unsure if half the people giving this game thumbs up reviews are high on something, or just have exceptionally low standards for free games. Yes, I am well aware that this game is FREE, and that I shouldn't look a gifthorse in a mouth, but being free doesnt give a game a free ride on being horribly put together.Almost everything about this game is horrible, from it's voice acting, to its length, to its uninteresting puzzles that involve you asking the same question multiple times until the answer changes. Let's also not forget it's incredibly bad dialogue that just adds even more horribleness to the voice acting. There is a bit of good about this game, other than it being a freebie. You can get achievements rather easily, and the artwork of the game, although cartoony,  doesnt make me want to rip my retinas out with a spoon. That's about all this game has going for it.Don't believe me? Play it yourself and see.			"

												This is one chapter of 6, the first one is free and the rest you have to pay for to get the full experience. From what I have seen there is only one other episode currently released (2/6 episodes out). The point and click element of the game works well, and its pretty much the standard of how they play out. The item combinations make sense, and shouldn't stop you for to long. Some bits of dialogue or options should be taken out however when you complete certain sequences because at that point it becomes pointless.Example: Distracting the doctor after getting the sedative from the closet is the only time you need that option. What is weird in the example is that you do not need to distract him from the syringe however when it comes to the vial you require it. Why is it that you can steal a doctor item right in front of him thats on the tray, he does not react. When you go to the back to open the closet, open it and want to take a vial you suddenly stop because you suspect he will catch you. Seems rather inconsistent.Treat this game as a demo of how the rest of the game will play out (chapters) and see if the story is interesting enough to warrant purchasing or downloading the rest of the chapters.

												I wish I had a 'maybe' option for recommending.On one side, the graphics weren't too bad (but I'm not a big graphics critic) and the plot seems stable, if a bit lacking at this point. Voice acting is hit-and-miss- some voices are a bit annoying. I'd keep a guide on hand- a low point is you have to think pretty far out of the box to get around. At one point, you have to bother someone a few times before you have the clues to move on. Length is another low point- this chapter is pretty short; including guide-searching, I beat the game in about an hour.Would I play the next chapter? If they give it some tweaks, I would. As it stands now, it's a decent time-killer, but a paperweight afterward.			"

												Reversion - The Escape is a pretty simple game. It's a point and click where you have to double-click and get the options of Taking, Examining, and Talking to the person or obect you selected. The story is easy to understand; your Christan, a man who wakes up in a hospital with no memory of what happened and why you are there. You go around collecting items to help you (and your new partner Victoria) escape. It's okay for the first Chaptes, but it doesn't take long to easily get through it. My first playthrough never got me far since I was confused, so I restarted and took less than an hour for the second try.I don't really recommend this unless you like short, point-and-click games.

												A nice point and click game. The game took me less than an hour to beat, most of the things you gotta do are common sense and are things anyone would do if you were in the guys situation. For a free to play short game the game was well worth my time and i was able to get easy achievements!			"

												Whilst the game is short (you can finish it in about an hour) it's quite good considering that it is free. Be aware that you will have to put up with very simple tasks, so-so voice acting and some dodgy animations. There are certainly far better adventure games out there but not everything can be Monkey Island.If you want a quick, free game and can overlook some problems then this isn't a bad addition to your collection.

												I never played point&click games except as minigames. This review is written based on personal bias. I tried it out just for the sake of trying it... and didn't enjoy it.My main points for this review:- dialogue is crap.- Game feels a bit childish. (mainly due to dialogue being... crap.)- the ""puzzles"" are almost not solvable without hints.- You can use hints, but there's a cool-down. So you're basically just doing random stuff until you can use hints again.- There are no guidelines to what you are supposed to be doing. AT ALL.- Does not feel like a sci-fi game at all. It just happens in 2035.- Main character is kinda cocky.- Graphics are... okay, I guess? It's drawn, no real 3D here. Must be personal preference. I don't like it.I wouldn't advise playing it, I didn't particularly enjoy it. But that doesn't neccessarily have to apply to everyone. :)			"

												I don't reccomend buying this but if you get it for free, like one episode of it is now, go for it, it's not exactly fun, but you get a couple of achievements, and that's nice. Because even if you don't like it, you get those from it so it doesn't feel like you've wasted the whole time you were playing it.The voice acting is grating, but you can get around it by turning off the sound and putting on some subtitles. One other annoying thing was that there were so many interactable objects that did nothing (the broken window on the ground, etc.) that I thought could be used to actually do something. I mean, in point and click games, usually if you have the option to use something, it's because you need to use it, but there were a lot of things it implied you could more than look at but never could do anything with (or the cables in the toilet stall). That and having to wait for a hint made me feel like I was playing a facebook game. Also the hints don't recharge if you've switched tabs, which again is annoying. I'm pretty rubbish at point and click games so it might just be me that needed all those hints anyway. Which meant a lot of the time I was just clicking randomly, trying to kill time while I waited for the next hint to become available. Also if you're re-playing it for an achievement, you're gonna wish the text was skipable faster. "

												I nearly fell asleep playing this. The first thing you'll notice is the horrible voice acting. The acting is so rigid, it makes you wanna bang your head against a wall. Secondly, most of the puzzles are not intuitive at all and you'll often waste your time waiting till you can press the ""Use Hint"" button since for some reason it needs a cooldown timer.There's nothing special about this game. The art isn't spectacular, the gameplay isn't innovative, the audio isn't augasmic. This makes the pace of the game extremely slow and you do not want to waste your time on this.			"

												Simple, free and so far bug free (at least here)However, I wonder why is this in the Free to Play category though since I'm just getting to play the escape part.Unless the other upcoming chapters are also free I think this feels more like a demo.Perhaps I missed something because the other reviews read like they played the whole game.But for a few hours of little brain exercise it's good enough, sure the voices are a bit off, but come on, it's an Indie game.You seriously expect Samuel J. or Nicole K. to do the voices here? The reason they're a bit off is I think these were done completely seperate from the entire game with people just reading the lines and not have the actual scene in front of them so they can tweak their voice to match the situation a bit more.However, if the devs are going to make more of these games they will learn from the experience.It seems the bulk of players here are just too spoiled, I grew up playing i.e. Another World and the Beneath the steel sky.Still some of the all time favorites and both of them certainly had their quirks.

												For a free Point and Click game... This is rubbish and I would totally not recommend wasting your time on this.There are limited positives that I can think of including the following...Positives:♦ Relatively Easy♦ Short♦ Easy to 100% Achievements♦ FreeNow onto the long list of negatives which would deter anyone with half a brain from playing this game...Negatives:♦ Storyline isn't intreguing and well thought of♦ No replay value♦ A lot of repetitive talking ♦ Characters are lame♦ Not funny at all♦ Voice Overs are all similar♦  Chatting with someone is annoying as chosen options don't dissapear after choosing one♦ Controls are not the best♦ Alt Tabbing caused game to black screen upon re-opening and I couldn't close the game without restarting (Windows 8.1 x64bit Nvidia GeForce GTX 670MX)♦ Relative annoying to figure out what to do, as story is poorly written♦ No replay value♦ No incentive to play the next chapter (Why would you pay $6 for something that is terrible?)♦ Graphics are cartoonish to an extentOverall, in my opinion, only play this game if you want an easy 100% complete game. There is nothing else to look forward to whilst playing this and if you alt tab like I did, it'll most likely crash and you'll have to re-start your system. Not worth the time even though it's free. If you must play this, don't expect anything.Overall, I'd rate this 0.5/5!PS: Don't even think about paying $6 for the 2nd Chapter... it's a rip off and I can think of 100 games under $10 that'd be more worth your money and time.

It's not horrible in the sense that there is no story; however, the voice acting is robotic, the game isn't challenging at all, it's short, and the achievements are too easy to get (I'm one of those achievement hunters, so I was disappointed throughout).The game is aesthetically pleasing for the most part, if you can ignore the glitches where your character ends up floating above someone's head if you double-click to get the options instead of holding the left click. This would be an okay game for a child between the ages 5-9, but if you're looking for a game that is fun to play then you should probably look elsewhere.			"

												I've played it for 2 hours... an hour and a half the first time, using the hints nearly all the time, and a half hour the second time, using no hints. The game is not intuitive at all. Also, there seems to be only one way to successfully finish the chapter. Nothing else seems to work. The dialogue is contrived, monotonous, and repetative. Also, unless you do things in a certain order, you won't succeed. 3FInteractive should have had multiple ways to finish the story, with varying levels of success/completion, and have that affect what's available/doable for the next chapter. Hopefully some of these things will be fixed or at least changed for the next chapter, assuming they release one. I get the feeling that this game is an english translation from spanish or some other foreign language, and that's why so many players are finding fault with the storyline, handling of the characters, and the gameplay. I believe they should have ramped it up for the initial chapter, dazzled us with innovation, and had us on the edge of our seats to find out what happens next. They really missed the boat if this was meant to introduce us to future installments. To use a fishing analogy... there was very little bait for us to bite, and no hook to reel us in.			"

YES if you want a game with walking dead style gameplay get it now and support these people this game is amazing the voice acting is ok and the art is pretty cool.please support these people to make chapter 2 and to make more games like this, this is the most fun i've had on a game like this in a while			"

												1st: It is only a demo. The following parts will cost you 6 bucks each. 2nd: Keep in mind that there are tons of better adventures out there, for less money.3rd: This is work in progress and an indie game. It's not close to be finished and never might be. So only invest in the other parts if you can stand cliffhanger for a long time, because every chapter seems to end with one.+ Professional dubbing...- ... that seems slightly out of place, mainly because there are no proper background noises. Developer is using  a really annoying background music, it is not befitting the mood/atmosphere. + Nicely drawn pictures...- ... that are soullessly animated. + Most objects/npcs have 3 different ways to interact with: talk to, look at, and take/use...- ... but most of the time you don't need all that options for the game. Clicking them is not entertaining and you have got to use double click, to open the interaction menue. + Most riddles have different stages, which need a variety of items or input from other npcs...- ...sadly you won't get any feedback at all on how to use your items or how to interact with static objects or persons.  + There is a hint option...- ... with a cooldown.Conclusion: This fraction of a game is quite boring. That is quite harsh, bearing in mind that this first chapter is used as advertisment for the steep priced other parts. You'll probably need more time to download it, than to play it through. Imho there are two good types of adventures: The funny ones and the ones with tension/ a deep story. This on lacks the entertaining fun, the monumental narrative and an satisfying ending. The developers should have done their homework, before charging 6 bucks per following episode.  61/100  for this foiled attempt.			"

												I think its great that point and click adventure games have been offering up pieces of there story in a free intro chapter, I think it really opens up the game to a new audience. I enjoyed Reversion - The Escape (chapter 1) and look forward to hearing news on future chapters. The Escape is a short intro chapter, I doubt it will take you long to complete. I finished my playthrough in just under an hour, and then went back to fool around with stuff I may have missed. I think overall you should definitely try the game, even if this would be your ""first"" point and click adventure game. At the time of this review, the game was free on Steam, I dont know if that will change in the future so you should grab it asap.			"

												Reversion is inspired by the classic Adventures games but will you want to play this game ? In Reversion you play as Christian. You wake up in a hospital with no memories what so ever. You know that its a war in Buenos Aires and the year is 2035. You find out that youre locked in the hospital and you have to escape the soldiers that keep you locked up. So how is Reversion ? Its quite decent if you can look past its flaws. Now for the pros. The game art looks great and the writing is quite charming. The puzzles are simple and quite easy to figure out. The game also has funny jokes in it and also a pretty good soundtrack. The game also has a few flaws. Even though the game has simple puzzles there are also a few illogical ones too. The game also has abysmal Voice Acting which sounds weird. The game has a few bugs that ruin the game they need to fix as soon as possible. And also the game is FREE only the first episode. Overall Reversion Episode 1 is a decent game and i can see myself buying the second episode. I give Reversion The Escape a 7/10			"

												This game's art is mediocre to bad, story is very ""up in the air"" and doesn't envolve the player. Music didn't catch my attention, either. Not to mention the awkward moments of complete silence. Puzzles are either bland or don't make sense. There are a lot of interactive objets that seem promising, but end up being red herrings.To sum it all up, it doesn't seem like an ""Episode 1"" in a series, but a poorly made demo. Even though it's free to play, I wouldn't recommend it. It's just a waste of time.By the way, I've played a second time (I'm an achiement hoarder, I admit) in Portuguese and I have to tell the translation is just one of the worst I've ever seen. It was probably done using a machine translation like Google and it wasn't even revised.Definitely not a way to present an episode 1 if you want to make a game series. At least they were decent enough not to charge anything for it.			"

Reversion - The Escape is a point-and-click adventure game that involves solving puzzles to progress the story.  Puzzles are satisfactory and are fair with a few moments that are cryptic.  It was also once free, but is now priced at $1...kinda makes things awkward when you got this game when it was free, though.  o_o;;Pros:Easy 100% achievements.Decent attempt at a point-and-click game (Feels like a point-and-click from the early 90's).Short (Should take an hour or two.  Then the second run about 15-30 minutes)Cons:Story is kinda' meh and kinda' feels forced.Another amnesia protagonist.  (Sure, even I have an amnesia protagonist myself, but at least that's blunt trauma...)Voice-acting is below par, but what you'd normally expect from some Point-and-click titles.An Argentinian story.  (Nothing against Argentina, just....South America doesn't interest me personally.  At least have a fictional area with English signs for localization's sake.)It's really not too shabby.  A few nitpicks, but really not bad.  Now that it's priced at $1, you might want to either wait for a sale/discount.  Alternatively, you can fork over $1 to enjoy the title.  To be honest, it felt better when this title was free.7/10  A pretty nice shot at a point-and-click.			"

												I love bad dubbing; kung fu films, anime, Shogun Assassin is a favorite. However there is 'so good it's bad' and then there's 'so bad it's boring, grating and I must mute'. Reversion is the latter.It's possible this lost a lot in translation but from my experience the tiny bit of story was a disjointed mess. Perhaps this was a student project, in which case well done. But as a professional product on Steam it falls short.Even as a free game I can only recommend this to achievement hunters.			"

												The Escape is the first part of an episodic series and is being offered for free shareware-style to introduce people to the series.  Unfortunately the game is pretty low quality as adventure games go in just about every aspect.  The art's pretty mediocre, the voice acting is terrible, the writing leaves a lot to be desired, and the puzzles are confusing (though that isn't exactly out of the ordinary for adventure games.)  The game is also extremely short and can be completed in half an hour if you don't have too much trouble figuring out the puzzles or use a guide.Overall, there's not really anything to recommend here.  Perhaps episode 2 will be better but this poor introduction won't convince many people to buy it.			"

Vis-a-vis the voices I've not heard anything this bad in an absolute age as the voices and script on this are worse than any daytime soap you'd care to think off. Really stilted voices make you thinkg of wooden acting and sets that wobble when doors/windows are opened and closed [on the verge of collapsing if used to vigorously].

												I was looking through Free to Play and found Reversion. A point and click game that reminded me of a very old game were you are stranded and have no idea whats up, there is a hint system if you are lost, as I was. And there are small bits here and there that tell me these devs put some thought into exploration. It seems like there will be more episodes in the same story, and with the way it (story) is told, there are too many untied knots to stop here. It is short and this was good for me, it was free! The animation seems a bit makeshift, remember this is not crysis 4 or the next-gen game by EA, which arent that good anyways and cost much money. If you are looking to take your mind off the real world and solve a puzzle, this is it.			"

												First, lets start with the Negatives:Voices: Everyone except the main chracter (who is a little annoying, but I personally like it) is bad. The girl has little to none emotion, the military dudes sound aweful, in particular the muscular guard. He sounds like an cheerful intern, not some buff, thugish soldier. The doctor was passable, but thats it.The gameplay: Some of the parts are comepletly impossiable without hints. For example, why would I think to use the fire extisher to knock out a guard? Why would I ask the bad-tempered dude what his problem was 3 times?!Speed: Other than double clicking to instantly move, the main chracter seems to like walk very slowly  , which can be annoying late in the game.Size: This game took me a half hour to finish. I Know this is your first chaper, and its free to boot, but couldn;t have added a little more content?And now for the good.Story: Intriguing. Why did this happen? Why has the city fallen apart? If this were a normal civil war, wouldn;t the city be in better shape? The amnesiac is typical fare, but the fate of the city is certinly a good start.Music: While loud at times, it was prett atmospheric and fit the story well. Its not particulry amazing, but it does its job, and well.Art: Cartoony, friendly, and well done. This Game's Design is defintly one of its strong suits.The end result: A far too short game with flaws, but in its defense, it the 1st part of a new project by indie developers. One does not have to work hard to give them some slack, and with said slack this was a fun and thougly enjoyable half hour. Yes, it was short, but I think this was a more of a testing of the waters to see if anyone was truly interested in this game, and it deserves some attention. And for pete's sake , its free! And when if they iron out the flaws I mentioned, it will definitly be worth spending money on (provided they don't ask too high a price, and that's a mistake anyone can make).			"

												This game... My God this game is so clunky, confusing and unhelpful. The voice acting lacked any emotion or conviction. I had to use the hint system more than relying on instincts and knowledge. You're not allowed to solve things out of order. I felt that it could be good but the flaws are glaring. It was also super short and the story kept too much from you. I really hope that the episodes following this one abhold the point and click adventure genre better than this one did. If you want jaw-clenching frustration and bad humor, try it. Otherwise, leave it be. Just because it's free, doesn't mean it's worth it.			"

A point and click game that reminded me of a very old game were you are stranded and have no idea whats up, there is a hint system if you are lost, as I was. And there are small bits here and there that tell me these devs put some thought into exploration. It seems like there will be more episodes in the same story, and with the way it (story) is told, there are too many untied knots to stop here. It is short and this was good for me, it was free! The animation seems a bit makeshift, remember this is not crysis 4 or the next-gen game by EA, which arent that good anyways and cost much money. If you are looking to take your mind off the real world and solve a puzzle, this is it.			"

												Not bad, but definitely not something I would pay for. I found the voice acting annoying, so I turned off all voices near the start of the game.Also, some sections of puzzles seem a bit extraneous. Like the fact that I have to click on a person's name (next to a picture of a key) on a sheet of paper to realize ""Oh, this person has a key!"", and hence advance the game by opening up dialogue choices. I can SEE that the person has a key; don't take me for a blind idiot.Far too many places one can click on, but most of those places merely provide flavourtext and are not related to the story.Person walks WAY too slowly. If it were presented in 1st-person mode (like the Submachine series or ALMOST EVERY OTHER ESCAPE GAME), it would be a vast improvement.Far too short for a game I need to download. This would do much better on a Flash game site, like Kongregate.In any case, as others have mentioned, the only reason I downloaded it was because it was free. If it had even cost 50 cents, I likely wouldn't have bought it based on the reviews, and I don't regret the decision to not buy it if it had cost money.			"

												Worst voice acting ever...And the puzzles or progress don't feel very logical. Clicking -everything- before finding out whether an item can be used is never fun, and that comes form me: a person who loves point-and-click adventures. But if the hint system gives no clue, it's just awful. Sometimes you have to click on something more than once and then get a different result, it's unclear precisely. Also just going back and forth between characters to try and figure out if they will say something slightly different is tedious and should be avoided in gameplay. Take an example to 'The Book of Unwritten Tales' where the same thing happens, but it's always connected to logical progress.Not recommended.			"

												First, lets start with the Negatives:Voices: Everyone except the main chracter (who is a little annoying, but I personally like it) is bad. The girl has little to none emotion, the military dudes sound aweful, in particular the muscular guard. He sounds like an cheerful intern, not some buff, thugish soldier. The doctor was passable, but thats it.The gameplay: Some of the parts are comepletly impossiable without hints. For example, why would I think to use the fire extisher to knock out a guard? Why would I ask the bad-tempered dude what his problem was 3 times?!Speed: Other than double clicking to instantly move, the main chracter seems to like walk very slowly  , which can be annoying late in the game.Size: This game took me a half hour to finish. I Know this is your first chaper, and its free to boot, but couldn;t have added a little more content?And now for the good.Story: Intriguing. Why did this happen? Why has the city fallen apart? If this were a normal civil war, wouldn;t the city be in better shape? The amnesiac is typical fare, but the fate of the city is certinly a good start.Music: While loud at times, it was prett atmospheric and fit the story well. Its not particulry amazing, but it does its job, and well.Art: Cartoony, friendly, and well done. This Game's Design is defintly one of its strong suits.The end result: A far too short game with flaws, but in its defense, it the 1st part of a new project by indie developers. One does not have to work hard to give them some slack, and with said slack this was a fun and thougly enjoyable half hour. Yes, it was short, but I think this was a more of a testing of the waters to see if anyone was truly interested in this game, and it deserves some attention. And for pete's sake , its free! And when if they iron out the flaws I mentioned, it will definitly be worth spending money on (provided they don't ask too high a price, and that's a mistake anyone can make).			"

												This is an awesome throw back to the point&click adventure games, im looking forward to the next chapter. This is a must play for those of loved, ""beneath a Steel Sky"", ""Flight of the Amazon Queen"", ""Monkey Island"", etc.....THe only thing that has got me ""off"" about the game is the voice acting and animations, i cant tell if there trying to replicate the old school style(ie: Delayed gestures, and near monotone voice acting), if this was on purpose, then it just makes this game so much better. If it was on accident then honestly i dont care because it really felt like an old school P/C Adventure game.			"

												Its a point and click adventure game.  What can I say the game is filler.  Its okay at best.  Since its chapter 1 be warned its extremely short.  The english language voice acting is poor.  For what it cost me which is free, its at least worth a try.  It would have been nice if they had kept the steam trading cards included.  But again its a free game.All I can say game wise is I don't Hate it.			"

												My favourite part is how the protagonist regularly says ""Boring!"" in which I agree with him about the game. I know it's free but both the graphics and the English voice acting are very amateurish. Also the 3 minute forced waiting time between hints is frustrating, as I only used that function when I was really stuck which meant waiting a potential full 3 minutes trying randomly clicking at things I already tried before just to pass the time. I had to use the walkthrough for the game, as waiting 3 minutes multiple times got way too boring. Also I know the game will have multiple chapters, but the story is far from getting anywhere (the amount of plot was about as much as reading the first 10 pages of a book) and the thought of similar quality sequels fills me with dread, not excitement. Overall it's a tedious and unrewarding game. Honestly I only played it through (twice!) to get all the Steam achievements for it and be able to finally uninstall it.			"

Solve the riddles in less 4 hours or seconds absolutely without hint or guide. The main player who you will play in has an amnesia. The goal of the game is helping him remind all about things.

												I really don't have anything to add to what has been said already.The game is short and boring with bad voice acting. All the achievements are easily gained in under one hour. This game didn't leave a good impression on me and I will not be buying the next installment.For those who like point-and-click games; there are way better games out there.			"

												Reversion - The Escape is a short but fun point-and-click adventure rpg that will take you down memory lane!  While this game can be beaten in under an hour, the puzzles are challenging and fun.  However, the voice-acting is not particularly impressive in English, but it's better in Spanish (and more fitting considering the setting of the game).			"

												When it comes to point 'n' click, you could do a lot worse than this, but not by far at all. First real thing that comes at you is how bad the voices are. Then it's all very repetitive with the puzzles, as are most games of this genre, but at least in those games it gets you somewhere. Then some are so easy a child could figure it out, then there's parts when you NEED a hint if you want to pass. If you like games of this genre, you can see that this game tried to make something like Sam and Max or Monkey Island, but it didn't nearly pay the full bill. But on a good note, the protagonist is a pretty decent character for this type of game, in fact he reminds me a lot of Don Jonz from Eternam. Besides that and parts of the story, in my opinion this game gets around a 3/10.			"

												This game would be suggestable to new comers of the adventure genre who really don't want to spend five bucks on Myst or Secret of Monkey Island until they know its a worthy investment.As one such new comer, there were some puzzles in the game that took atleast a little thinking out of the box, but not something too far out. However, for the most part, the puzzles are easy to piece together and require little out of the player except for a little bit of short term memory, making the game extremely short (about one hour on the first playthrough, without hints, and twenty minutes on my second). Some of the puzzles are oddly specific, though, requiring you to click on specific things, things that the player can figure out without the narritive aid of the character, which can be irritating.As for the animation and graphics, I kinda liked the visuals, as I liked the emphasis of things on characters, such as a large gut, but it was obvious that the animator had little work when it came to walking, as most of the time, the character slides across the floor. Also, some of the animations just look silly or are just cut out, maybe to spare the animator from animating something a little harder.The voice acting is horrid. The main character has little expression in his voice and after a first playthrough, it grates against your ears, at least in English (the game was made in another country, most likely Argentina, so Spanish would likely sound a lot better).The sound design is pretty alright. There weren't any out of place sounds, and I kinda sorta liked the main menu theme, though it sounds a little out of place at first.Overall, the team could have done a lot more polishing to their game, but I would be willing to pay for another chapter of this series if they stepped it up a notch in all departments. For the modest price of free, and considering that you are intrested, check the game out.			"

												Let me start off by saying, Reversion goes back to the roots of old school point and click adventures, it's a bit like Broken Sword   in a way, style and humour wise. Making the first chapter free2play was a great move by the developers in question, a nice taster, for the beginning episode of the episodic series. All in all, I really enjoyed this episode of Reversion, it had the wittyness, the charm of the characters, and most importantly the fun of the classic point and click genre. I'd whole heartly give this game a rating of 10/10, it's a must for point and click fans everywhere, just brilliant!			"

This looks like a game that could have been easily made in Newgrounds, even in 2012... To be fair, the game had some interesting parts, but completely threw it out due to its lack of story. Anyone can get the 4 hour achievement, unless they slept through the entire game... in which I almost did...			"

												I'd like to recommend this point and click game to anyone who is interested in a little puzzle and story. Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters. As you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck. It's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally. There are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.It depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.  "

												For a free game, it is good, but I don't believe I will play the extra 6eur to play the rest of it. The voices are average at best, the drawings are nothing special, and the movement of the characters is very stiff. I will not comment on the story because this free part unveiled very little of it. Having said all those things, I'm a very big fan of 2d adventure games, and while this is not a masterpiece, I paid nothing to play it, so i feel at the very least I should recomend it to someone who's just casually browsing for a fast casual game to spend some time with.

												Reversion is a point-and-click ""escape"" game (as indicated by the sub-title). If you were around in the dark ages of the internet you're probably more than familiar with these, being the go-to ""hello world"" genre of choice for flash developers. OK, awkwardly phrased intro done, let's get onto the real review. This game is horrible for a veritable smorgasbord of reasons. We'll start with the plot. You play as ""Straight White Male"" (hereafter referred to as SWM), a character completely devoid of personality who wakes up in a hospital room with amnesia. Yes, apparently we're still doing amnesia. After establishing SWM's amnesia we go on to learn that a civil war has broken out and that it is 20 years later than SWM thought it was. Apparently he's a time traveller too or something stupid like that. There's also a doctor, a love interest (sorry, ""woman"") called ""Victoria"" and a soldier, though everyone seems to be avoiding the word ""soldier"". Since I got bored of the game very early on, I'm just going to guess the rest of the plot. SWM and Victoria escape the hospital and join up with ""The Resistance"". Through a series of misadventures they work hard to bring down whatever the other faction is, as Victoria's heart warms to SWM (possibly due to his charismatic blandness), Eventually they kill Hitler or whatever and fall in love.The voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting. Everything is flat and emotionless, the doctor being the worst offender. The pacing of the lines is horrible as well, there's no pause in between them so everything has this weird rushed feel, despite the lines themselves being slowly paced.The dialogue itself is pretty horrendous as well. It's fairly obvious that it wasn't written natively in English : not in itself a bad thing but the translation has been done poorly. There are odd quirks in the subject matter as well, where it is painfully obvious that the characters are speaking around the plot in order to hide information from the player, so that they can find it out later on and be surprised.As far as gameplay goes: it's a traditional point/click escape game. The puzzles don't make any sense so you have to just wander around all the areas at a painfully slow pace, clicking everything and combining everything with everything else. So in that respect it's pretty faithful to the genre.In conclusion, don't.Despite being free, I'd still advise you to spend your money elsewhere.			"

												Reversion is a point and click adventure game where you have trauma induced amnesia, in a post apacolyptic argentina, as far as point and clicks go, this one is average, there is very little freedom you have, but it does require critical thinking, though some actions are questionable.  Otherwise, it is a good game, having to pay for the second chapter is fine, I won't pay for it, the  story is hardly anything to be concerned about, and all of the voice acting in this game is... to put it kindly, kinda off.As far as free games go, it is pretty good, since most of the other free games are massively multiplayer online games, or MMO'sI give it a 6/10, if the second chapter was free perhaps an 8/10 if the second chapter is good too.I especially like the piper achievment, it's definitly the achievment to get if you're not too into getting achievments yourself.

												Yeah this is a great game :) not to mention the fact it's also free, I actually did another speedrun to get the final achievement which took me around 15-20 minutes, but thats because i'd already worked out the mind working puzzles. While it is a little on the short side, you dont find yourself getting let down as it's more of a burst of good fun rather than a dragged out point and click. That being said I wouldnt compare it to Broken sword 1 or 2 (probably my favourite games on PC) But you should definitely give it a go as its completely free, doesnt use much space, and it isnt frustratingly hard but keeps your mind working, especially the paper part ;)			"

												As an avid point-and-click adventure gamer from back in the day, there's a fine line that a developer should not cross. It's obviously to me Reversion - The Escape's language is not primarily english and it was translated, albeit poorly. The logic in the game is hardly intuitive and the puzzles are boring. The game will not run full-screen in a Intel 4400 mobile chipset without ridiculous flickering constantly so it has to be played windowed. The voice acting is absolutely horrible, how did you get a monotone news reporter to play the doctor? It pains me to say this but after struggling to comprehend this poor game for the past half hour, it's going to be deleted and not finished. Why would anyone want to pay money for Part 2 if Part 1 isn't worth finishing?			"

												being one of my few experiences with point and click games its a nice change from the shooters that i usually play.Though it has mediocre voice acting and insanly hard puzzles it equils it out with fun""gameplay"" and hints that make you feel stupid when you use them...overall i enjoyed the game 8/10			"

The GoodAlthough it was no Monkey Island, for a simple cheap point and click I thought the graphics were decent, the story was compelling (I AM curious to find out more) and the gameplay was fun. Most of all, the actions you take all make sense. I've played several point and clicks where you had to mix things or do things that were ridiculous and tooo far fetched...but so far this isn't one of those games.  I'm honestly suprised someone complained that they didn't know what to do from the start. Most of it was pretty intuative for me. I was only REALLY stumped at one part and had to look up a walkthrough. Stupid angry guard.  (I'll add some tips below for those who are interested)The MediocreThe voice acting and script was a little flat...but my native language is English, and I'm thinking that it might sound better in spanish, which is how it was originally intended. With that in mind, I'm pretty happy that they took the time to record an english version and I didnt have to just read what everyone was saying. Don't worry about the translation...the english is fine, everything made sense. It was just...flat..especially compared to more polished (and more expensive) games like Jack Keene, or The Walking Dead. HINTSI've added some hints for parts that were difficult for me. To read the full hint, just hover over the blocked text. I will try not to give a full spoiler, just the best tip I can for the handful of things that took me a little longer to figure out.- Can't figure out what a certain medicine is for?  (Try asking a doctor) - Can't steal something easily?  (Ask someone to distract the doctor) - Can't to get out of the room?  (Give the guard a good excuse!) - Can't get rid of the guard?  (You can still see his feet when in the bathroom) - Can't get to the lobby?  (Make SURE the guard wont move if he wakes up) - Can't get any info from the angry guard?  (Ask him ""what's wrong"" a few times)  Okay...with these hints, you should now have access to all the rooms in the chapter. If you get stuck, find a full walkthrough just for a quick hint to get the game moving. It's better than just giving up on the whole game.			"

												Point-and-click games are usually okay for me, but this one fell far too short from what I expected. First off, it was just that: too short. There's an achievement you get for your profile for finishing the game in less than four hours, but I finished in less than half the time (then again, I think it's for the entire game and not just for this first chapter.). Another thing was how the description said it was ""science-fiction"" but the game itself gave little, if any, indication of any sci-fi element. Maybe we'll see more as we go along, but I wish they'd have given me more than just half a picture with a (mad?) scientist. The graphics were...what can I say? Too simple? Childish? If the main conflict of the game is against an totalitarian, oppressive military government in the middle of dystopian Buenos Aires, don’t hire the guy who makes Team Umizoomi to animate it! Seriously, it looks like something I would read to my little brother after tucking him in bed. There was nothing about the plot that hooked me. Way too generic, way too cliche. Guy wakes up in a hospital with no memory, hospital taken over by insurgents, must escape. The characters are also very generic, uninspired, and sometimes even unrealistic. For example: early in the game, Cristian has to ask Victoria (the redheaded girl) to distract the doctor so he can steal some sedative. She distracts the doctor by pretending her ankle is hurt, but I'll tell you right now that NO REAL DOCTOR will ever believe you if you say, ""Ow. Ow. My ankle is in pain"" in such a monotonous, unfeeling voice. The guards sound way less aggressive than they should be, and Cristian is so uninspired. I know this is just an indie game, but at least you'd put more effort into the voice acting. And what’s with the evil laugh coming from the guards and the little bald guy in the end? If you’re going to go that route, at least put some effort into it. Cristian does some really stupid things for a guy in his situation. Like when he finds the newspaper on the floor and whines about Argentina losing the World Cup. OH COME ON, you’ve been in a coma for twenty years and lost your memory, but when you finally get the chance to read concrete information about what happened while you were unconscious, you only care about soccer scores!?!If you're the type of gamer who likes to find several different ways to solve a problem or objective, this game is NOT for you. There is literally only ONE way to get out of the hospital (which is, SPOILER, climbing down a rope from the room you woke up in), and it makes the game a lot more boring than it could’ve been. I know point-and-click games are sometimes like that, but the game presented itself with so many other options without letting me. I could’ve climbed the bathroom stall and pulled the cords hanging down from the ceiling to turn out the lights and at least get some time to distract the guards, or I could’ve just cut the wires in any of the exposed light switches. I could’ve sedated the other guards with the syringe. I could’ve climbed down the giant tree or the pipes that were right next to the window. I could’ve gotten the other guards to put out the fire while I escaped. You also have to use the hint button a lot because some of the next steps are really obscure. How was I to know that you ask the bad-tempered guard the same question three times before you get a different answer? And as you’re waiting for the next hint to come up, Cristian gets really annoying when he groans, ""Booooring!!"" or ""Are you still there?"" every five seconds. Lastly, there are some parts where I laughed out loud because they were just so RIDICULOUS. Such as when Cristian switches his clothes out with the guard after he knocks him out―one of those folding wardrobe things where people change clothes behind (sorry, the name escapes me) magically appears and disappears when he's done. Also, when he's taping up the guard,   the guard actually looked up and gave him this BIG SMILE like he was having the greatest time in his life. One more thing...why is hypnotizing the rat considered an achievement? Where the heck were you supposed to get the flute, anyway? "

												I didn't expect much from it since it is a single episode, free, point and click, but I would usually hope that a new game would do at least one thing that sets it apart from the rest of its genre. Art is just above a flash game. Story is bland and simple. Voice acting is terrible (I have only heard the english version, and as it is a foreign game I would hope it is better in spanish), and the characters are more flat than their 2D figures. Unless it is improved and made more compelling in the sequels I cannot reccomend it.			"

												I really wanted to play this game, until i choose my native language (Portuguese). I can't believe what i read! In just four beginning phrases there was a lot of mistakes! Really! Did you guys used Google Translator for this game?? What a shame! Or you should put your Brazilian Translator in school again, or maybe he's 4 years old! Per ex, ""Adonde"" word for ""Where"" is the same has ""Adwhere""! It should be ""Onde""! ""Adonde"" doesn't even exist! Maybe you should hire someone from Portugal!			"

												Good gods, both the writing and the voice acting are just painful. The dialogue sounds like it was written and voiced by a robot who studied the English language in bits and pieces and had no idea when and how it was appropriate to put idioms and slang together for a given character, never mind inflection and emotion.

												I feel like a jerk writing a bad review for a game that alot of work was probably put into, but the puzzles were only moderate, the voice acting was terrible, there are just so many things that don't fit the mood in this game. Since you are waking up to a broken world, you'd think it would be more serious, but it's laid out just like a child's game.			"

												If the goal of a first chapter is to get the player interested in buying the rest, then this one has failed. - Every adventure game has at least one obscure puzzle, but there's usually some kind of hint if you think about it long enough. The hint system is a good idea (as is it's time delay), but it seems like it's made the designer reduce the in-game prompting as to what to do next. - There's a few animation glitches where the character ends up on the ceiling. The double click fast travel was a good idea, but I couldn't get it to work reliably.- Hitting the same option 7 times to progress the story is bad design. At least change what the character says so we know we're on the right track. - Context dependant pick ups aren't a bad idea (the medicine was a good one) but when a nessecary item is next to something that we're literally told is useless (like a pile of trash) it's frustrating.- The voices and english are a little off. Since this wasn't originally in English, this isn't something worth marking the game down for, but I think I'd find it better with text only if I played the next part. Lastly, there just isn't enough information on the setting to pique my interest. Something about an explosion and a coup? Everyone seems to avoid telling you things, presumably for the sake of a reveal later on, but the purpose of amnesia characters are to justify the big exposition dumps needed to catch the player up. There just isn't enough there for me to put money in and find out.			"

I think game is ok and dialogues are ok. Please DO remember that this is a Free game.I noticed some lack of translations on hints, and on the final credits for my language (Portuguese), please do fix that.You can easily finish this game within 1 Hour or less.My concearn is that if I purchase the 2nd chapter... will I have another hour to play till I finish this? If so... game is very short... Hope that second chapter is a LOT... longer than this chapter (free version).This information should be on the game, so we know what to expect, because first part was short.Keep up the good work and keep up the development of these games.I recommend this game (at least the free version)			"

												I'd like to recommend this point and click game to anyone who is interested in a little puzzle and story. Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters. As you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck. It's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally. There are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.It depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.  "

												Reversion: Chapter 1, is the first of many chapters in the game series Reversion, by 3f Interactive. In this game you will be taking on the role of a character who has no memory of his past. All he knows is that mysteriously 20 years seem to have disappeared, and he has no idea what his name is. You will find yourself in a hospital that has seen better days, and it appears that there is a group of mercenaries determined to keep you right where you are.Graphically I think this game looks solid. The characters all have that unique feel and look. The cast of people you interact with is small, but that doesn't mean that this game falls flat when it comes to variety. Sure this chapter takes place solely in the hospital and you are only going to be able to interact in eight different scenes, but they are all very well crafted, and they look polished. It is also refreshing to see that you are going to be dealing with characters that are not all the same body type of height. One that I thought was not close to what I would have expected was the voice acting, or should I say the almost monotone variations of voices. It was not the easiest thing to get through, and there was definitely some missing context in some of the conversations. Now I fully understand that this is not a game that was first created for English speaking individuals, and perhaps they didn't have anyone who really knew English grammar all that well, but for an English speaker, it was a bit difficult.The controls were your average mouse adventure game. You are going to click to move, hold the click to find out what type of interactions you can have with what you have chosen (touch, look, talk). The right mouse button opens up your inventory. There's also a button that kind of looks like a radar screen that when clicked upon will highlight all the objects that you can in some shape or form interact with.Alright so lets get into this game, you are a person who knows some stuff, but doesn't know the important stuff, such as name, or the actual year. Something big has happened and the city of Buenos Aires is not only in chaos, but it would appear that there is no true leader. You were found unconscious and were brought in for examination and interrogation. You start the game before the second part. Now knowing that this chapter was free I was not expecting much, and to that end when the first chapter did end at the 45 minute mark, I was a little confused but at the same time I let it slide. There was definitely some depth to the game, there was some combining of items to defeat a puzzle or obstacle, I just wish that there was more to this chapter.So if you are looking to see what those developers outside the US are capable of I would recommend taking a look at this game. If you are looking for an episodic point click adventure game with a strong first chapter, you are going to be left wanting when in one sitting you have already conquered the entire chapter. Sadly because of lack of content I have to give this game a 6.5 out of 10.			"

The game is short, and I expect more chapters will come out.  If you like puzzles, then I don't really see a reason not to give this a shot, especially since it's free.			"

												Boring game! It's like one of those games you used to play as a kid on those free sites and i'd actually rather play one of those. The game has weird logic when it comes to puzzles and you have to go back and forth all te´he time which is super annoying. No Recommendo for me!			"

It's a tad confusing, like the guard part, actually a lot of it was hard to figure out the first time around. I used a hint every time almost, LOL. I beat it three times already to get all the achievements. Wasn't that difficult to do though :) I'd recommend it if you just like to achieve stuff. I'll keep the game around to see the next chapters :)			"

												Although this game - actually it's only the first episode - is for free, I can hardly recommend it for people seeking a traditional point&click adventure.The initial kickoff of the story seems fine and enganging. But the voice acting, linear puzzle solving and the hint system are killing it for me.+ Story could develope some torque (Buenos Aires under military control and the main character has a gap of 10 years in his memories)+ Graphics are decent enough- The voice acting is dreadful- The hint system would not be necessary, if proper dialogues/character replies to actions would have been created & recorded- Puzzles need to be solved mostly in a linear fashionOne may argue, that if the story is done properly one could overlook the other faults. But going by the drive the voice actors developed for their job, I don't expect too much from the follow up episodes anymore.			"

												It obviously had potential, but so did my relationship with a psycho. If only more time was spent on dialogue and translation it would have made it to the ""decent"" level. Some of the lines in this game are so corny they'd make the Pope weep. Controls could be a lot better. Not cancelling every action when you click would be nice, as would being able to skip the walking animation and move right to the next room. Just a standard point and click with the common annoyances that come with them.			"

												I personally really enjoyed this. I thought it was really smart how the makers made this free to play in order to get  it out there, you can't really complain about having to pay for the 2nd part if you hated this. It's FREE, you aren't losing anything. This part is basically setting up parts 2 and 3, it's introducing the cast of main characters, setting the plot and story. The point and click system works fluently and has a very handy hint box on stand by whenever you get stuck. My very first playthrough I used this all the time. 1 thing that bugged me was some of things you had to do, you had to keep selecting the same option in order for the lieutenant to tell you that he had a sore head. Who actually knew to do that 1st time through? Or that you had to burn the paper + the tyre..? I honestly think given the chance, Reversion would really hit home with most people but having to ask straight up for help just to be put in the right direction in order to pass the game is silly. We should have the hint box for easter eggs or secrets.  In all I've become a fan of Reversion, I hope 3f Interactive realease part 3 on Steam. One of my favourite games at the moment.			"

												English translation is poor enough to be annoying, almost unintelligible in a couple of spots. Voice acting is middling with a few glaring oddities (the main character badly mispronounces Buenos Aires at one point-- really?). I was going to excuse this, and switch the game to Spanish to sharpen up my language skills, but this apparently is not an option (at least on linux). It's a shame they dropped the ball here, because I like the music, art, gameplay (and hint system), and direction the story seems to be headed. It's definitely a casual game. This is an extremely short first chapter. It made me want to keep going (just barely), but with the flaws and probable brevity of future chapters, they need to be priced at about $1 for me to continue.			"

There's a built in hint system which is much better than having to go through the net. The feels of old adventure games is certainly here though, BUT the game really lacks polish, A LOT of it. It felt rushed. The game is also very short, since it is only part 1. I highly doubt we'll ever going to see the other parts, seems like part 1 and so on is a trending gimmick nowadays, which is a shame cause the story sets up to be quite intriguing.			"

This looks like a game that could have been easily made in Newgrounds, even in 2012... To be fair, the game had some interesting parts, but completely threw it out due to its lack of story.

												At the moment of writing this review it's ​09.15.2014. And now, at this moment, I'm gonna give the game a thumbs up...Let's first talk about bad stuff, then the good, then I'll try and explain the overall impression and why I've given it positive grade. The game has many things against it - the voice over is bad. The char's are flat and lifeless, and translation is abysmal with lots of non-sequiturs and seemingly butchered meanings, but which uninterrupted went on to voice actors, to sound mixers, to testers. Easily it could have been done far more satisfactory. The graphics are simple and remind me of late 2000s flash animation style. There is no option for full HD resolution. Even in my full HD full screen, there are black borders, the game doesn't scale up. There's not much music, nor sound effects. UI is clunky with option wheel which has to be pressed for a second to open, and no way to change default function (there's only three - look, talk, use/take) and always use the same click for it. But what's good with the game? The setting is unique in more than one way - not just that it's set in Argentina, Buenos Aires, but in the future of the city where some cataclysm devastated the city and supposedly made an independent militia controlled city-state of it. Even in this golden age of indie development, it's extremely rare to experience something which isn't centered in standard circle of western culture in adventure games. It's either some traditional western(ised) setting (say US, New Orleans for Gabriel Knight, Paris for Broken Sword), or some extremely exotic setting like dungeons, far future, or jungle temples. Usually it's completely ignored that there are millions, if not billions of people living in some different urban settings which aren't either New York, or, say, far east. This game allows me to experience different culture. So that's a great plus in my books. The standard adventure gameplay mechanic flows nicely. There is a hint function, so I was never stuck for long. Usage of objects is logical, there's no ""use brick on tin can to squish it open and then use antique wig to gather the tomato sauce""* nonsense, even though actual intentions and objectives could have been expressed better. As said, hints keep the game going nicely. And it's short and sweet having no delusions of grandeur. It's an indie game through and through. More importantly, even with that about shortness said, the sense of mystery and adventure hits the precise spot I had from the days of the Curse of the Monkey IslandTM. I want to explore further, I want to learn the story and the world. I want some answers goshdarnit! Big plus there!But what's the most positive sign, and the reason I've started this review with a date of all things - is the price. The first episode is free on Steam. Second episode is out and I got it in a humble sale. I started playing it, but quickly the same sense of mystery forced me to download this one and find out how the story started. There are lots of negative reviews, here on Steam, but now, at this date, with these conditions, there's no reason why you shouldn't try the first episode. It's an adventure snack. I actually waited for some other game to download and ended playing it till the end in 66 minutes.I remember the time not so long ago people said adventure games are dead. This isn't the game that will singlehandedly save the genre - it's the proof it's actually so much alive that the games are vital enough to develop in non-standard settings and tell non-standard stories from small developing teams who don't even bother to translate their official game blog to english. It is what it is. And, considering the price, yes. You should try it.*NOT an actual example!			"

												I recommend this game, with some caveats ... Recommendation:  BUY IT, or Try it, when its ON SALE/Heavily Discounted.Retro fun!Rating: 3/5 StarsThis game was a brief enjoyable visit down memory lane when I used to play Adventure/Puzzle games back in the 80's.  The interface is a bit cludgy, and the voice dialogue could be better, however I was intrigued by the hints of the story that were revealed.  Once I got used the the interface quirks, the puzzle solving was amusing.I went quite a ways before using my first HINT, but then realized there was no penalty beyond a time delay until the next hint is available and was addicted to the Hint system everytime I hit a speed bump for the rest of the game.  Not a purist, but still easier than going and looking up the walkthrough/cheat guides anyway.I don't like this Pay-by-the-[very short]""Chapter"" model, but they have got to earn their revenue somehow ...

												The voice acting was not very good and the gameplay was hard to follow. There wasn't much to it either. The peices of the story were not put together very well. Would not recommend unless you have too much time on your hands. Very glad that it was free!			"

												Reversion is a point-and-click ""escape"" game (as indicated by the sub-title). If you were around in the dark ages of the internet you're probably more than familiar with these, being the go-to ""hello world"" genre of choice for flash developers. OK, awkwardly phrased intro done, let's get onto the real review. This game is horrible for a veritable smorgasbord of reasons. We'll start with the plot. You play as ""Straight White Male"" (hereafter referred to as SWM), a character completely devoid of personality who wakes up in a hospital room with amnesia. Yes, apparently we're still doing amnesia. After establishing SWM's amnesia we go on to learn that a civil war has broken out and that it is 20 years later than SWM thought it was. Apparently he's a time traveller too or something stupid like that. There's also a doctor, a love interest (sorry, ""woman"") called ""Victoria"" and a soldier, though everyone seems to be avoiding the word ""soldier"". Since I got bored of the game very early on, I'm just going to guess the rest of the plot. SWM and Victoria escape the hospital and join up with ""The Resistance"". Through a series of misadventures they work hard to bring down whatever the other faction is, as Victoria's heart warms to SWM (possibly due to his charismatic blandness), Eventually they kill Hitler or whatever and fall in love.The voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting. Everything is flat and emotionless, the doctor being the worst offender. The pacing of the lines is horrible as well, there's no pause in between them so everything has this weird rushed feel, despite the lines themselves being slowly paced.The dialogue itself is pretty horrendous as well. It's fairly obvious that it wasn't written natively in English : not in itself a bad thing but the translation has been done poorly. There are odd quirks in the subject matter as well, where it is painfully obvious that the characters are speaking around the plot in order to hide information from the player, so that they can find it out later on and be surprised.As far as gameplay goes: it's a traditional point/click escape game. The puzzles don't make any sense so you have to just wander around all the areas at a painfully slow pace, clicking everything and combining everything with everything else. So in that respect it's pretty faithful to the genre.In conclusion, don't.Despite being free, I'd still advise you to spend your money elsewhere.			"

												I'd like to recommend this point and click game to anyone who is interested in a little puzzle and story. Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters. As you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck. It's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally. There are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.It depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.  "

												For a free game, it is good, but I don't believe I will play the extra 6eur to play the rest of it. The voices are average at best, the drawings are nothing special, and the movement of the characters is very stiff. I will not comment on the story because this free part unveiled very little of it. Having said all those things, I'm a very big fan of 2d adventure games, and while this is not a masterpiece, I paid nothing to play it, so i feel at the very least I should recomend it to someone who's just casually browsing for a fast casual game to spend some time with.

												A glorified demo of ""yet another quest"". The visuals are quite a Flash-style - pretty, but the animation is lacking.`Musical themes aren't much to write about, but used well, with some silent moments nicely placed. Control aren't as intuitive, having to double click everything to interact.The thing is, it's a drag. You get to click on stuff and all the usual offer, but there isn't much of motivation to keep pressing on, story doesn't try to excite. The thing that it payes most tribute toward this genre is that you are most often will have no idea what you should do next, with a lot of ""blank"" objects to click on scattered around. At least this game has hint system. Well, the puzzles by themselves make sense, so at least it's not on the ""Russian quests"" level of game design. Can't really complain about free stuff either.Also, those who want to try some other free quest episode should look for Episode 4 of Sam and Max on Steam.			"

												Reversion is a point and click adventure game where you have trauma induced amnesia, in a post apacolyptic argentina, as far as point and clicks go, this one is average, there is very little freedom you have, but it does require critical thinking, though some actions are questionable.  Otherwise, it is a good game, having to pay for the second chapter is fine, I won't pay for it, the  story is hardly anything to be concerned about, and all of the voice acting in this game is... to put it kindly, kinda off.As far as free games go, it is pretty good, since most of the other free games are massively multiplayer online games, or MMO'sI give it a 6/10, if the second chapter was free perhaps an 8/10 if the second chapter is good too.I especially like the piper achievment, it's definitly the achievment to get if you're not too into getting achievments yourself.

I think game is ok and dialogues are ok. Please DO remember that this is a Free game.I noticed some lack of translations on hints, and on the final credits for my language (Portuguese), please do fix that.You can easily finish this game within 1 Hour or less.My concearn is that if I purchase the 2nd chapter... will I have another hour to play till I finish this? If so... game is very short... Hope that second chapter is a LOT... longer than this chapter (free version).This information should be on the game, so we know what to expect, because first part was short.Keep up the good work and keep up the development of these games.I recommend this game (at least the free version)			"

												Now before I go into why I would not recommend this game understand this I love Escape games. I have played so many that I have lost track of just how many I have played.  Now for why I would not recommend this game to anyone who shares the same love as I do for escape games. Now just looking at the story itself is decent, but the face that it is so short is enough to make this game bad. On my frist playthrough of this game it took me maybe 100 minutes where I got all the achivements but two. Then I played it the secound time it only took me 8.Now time for for me to tell you something else why I do not recommend this game. Half the time you don't even know what to click on or let alone even do, because the game does not give you any information on what you need to do next.  Some thing else that makes me not recommend this game is the mostiure radar. The mostiure radar is used for absolutely nothing besides showing you what you can click on.One more reason that I don't like this game is because this is only good for one playthrough.			"

It's alright for a quick little playthrough or if you want some easy to get achievements, and it took me 2.1 hours (as Steam says) to play through it a few times to get all the achievements. Actually, because it's so short, there really isn't much to go on. Personally, for me, it's a forgettable game that could use some fine tuning before I'd even considering paying for the next chapter. TL;DR: It's short, easy to get achievements, and it's a game that is just there. Would not pay for 2nd chapter.			"

Voice acting is very lame, as it seems author didn't do much effort for that matter. Only positive thing i find in this game is mistery about what lies beyond further in story. Maybe hint system can be find helpful sometime,  although removes the challange of beating game proper way.Play this game only for achievements!			"

												I personally really enjoyed this. I thought it was really smart how the makers made this free to play in order to get  it out there, you can't really complain about having to pay for the 2nd part if you hated this. It's FREE, you aren't losing anything. This part is basically setting up parts 2 and 3, it's introducing the cast of main characters, setting the plot and story. The point and click system works fluently and has a very handy hint box on stand by whenever you get stuck. My very first playthrough I used this all the time. 1 thing that bugged me was some of things you had to do, you had to keep selecting the same option in order for the lieutenant to tell you that he had a sore head. Who actually knew to do that 1st time through? Or that you had to burn the paper + the tyre..? I honestly think given the chance, Reversion would really hit home with most people but having to ask straight up for help just to be put in the right direction in order to pass the game is silly. We should have the hint box for easter eggs or secrets.  In all I've become a fan of Reversion, I hope 3f Interactive realease part 3 on Steam. One of my favourite games at the moment.			"

												A boring, forgettable, and poorly translated point-and-click game. You start out the game in the cliche ""amnesa"" gimmic that's so, so common with point-and-click games. The poor translation will be confusing at times, since the creator apparently doesn't know the meaning of ""definitley"" or the difference between a storehouse and a closet. The puzzles alternate from simple to bizzarly obscure. The game expects you to know to do things like ask the same guard the same question several times. I've played better point-and-click flash games online than this. In summary, save yourself some time and don't bother playing this. I know it's free, but it's not even worth the investment of time. There are many other far better free games out there.			"

												English translation is poor enough to be annoying, almost unintelligible in a couple of spots. Voice acting is middling with a few glaring oddities (the main character badly mispronounces Buenos Aires at one point-- really?). I was going to excuse this, and switch the game to Spanish to sharpen up my language skills, but this apparently is not an option (at least on linux). It's a shame they dropped the ball here, because I like the music, art, gameplay (and hint system), and direction the story seems to be headed. It's definitely a casual game. This is an extremely short first chapter. It made me want to keep going (just barely), but with the flaws and probable brevity of future chapters, they need to be priced at about $1 for me to continue.			"

												A boring, forgettable, and poorly translated point-and-click game. You start out the game in the cliche ""amnesa"" gimmic that's so, so common with point-and-click games. The poor translation will be confusing at times, since the creator apparently doesn't know the meaning of ""definitley"" or the difference between a storehouse and a closet. The puzzles alternate from simple to bizzarly obscure. The game expects you to know to do things like ask the same guard the same question several times. I've played better point-and-click flash games online than this. In summary, save yourself some time and don't bother playing this. I know it's free, but it's not even worth the investment of time. There are many other far better free games out there.			"

												it is decent, considering it's free. The puzzles are somewhat easy if you're one of those classic point-n-click veterans. There's a built in hint system which is much better than having to go through the net. The feels of old adventure games is certainly here though, BUT the game really lacks polish, A LOT of it. It felt rushed. The game is also very short, since it is only part 1. I highly doubt we'll ever going to see the other parts, seems like part 1 and so on is a trending gimmick nowadays, which is a shame cause the story sets up to be quite intriguing.			"

												Yeah this is a great game :) not to mention the fact it's also free, I actually did another speedrun to get the final achievement which took me around 15-20 minutes, but thats because i'd already worked out the mind working puzzles. While it is a little on the short side, you dont find yourself getting let down as it's more of a burst of good fun rather than a dragged out point and click. That being said I wouldnt compare it to Broken sword 1 or 2 (probably my favourite games on PC) But you should definitely give it a go as its completely free, doesnt use much space, and it isnt frustratingly hard but keeps your mind working, especially the paper part ;)			"

												As an avid point-and-click adventure gamer from back in the day, there's a fine line that a developer should not cross. It's obviously to me Reversion - The Escape's language is not primarily english and it was translated, albeit poorly. The logic in the game is hardly intuitive and the puzzles are boring. The game will not run full-screen in a Intel 4400 mobile chipset without ridiculous flickering constantly so it has to be played windowed. The voice acting is absolutely horrible, how did you get a monotone news reporter to play the doctor? It pains me to say this but after struggling to comprehend this poor game for the past half hour, it's going to be deleted and not finished. Why would anyone want to pay money for Part 2 if Part 1 isn't worth finishing?			"

												Okay,let's start out by saying,holy crap,does this game live up to its ""old school style game like the oldies"".This game is fun.It makes you have to think.Like what items work with what.                  Theres a segment where you have to figure out wich soldier you areyou have to bring the gaurd in the bathroom to know him out,thats mandatory,but you can also take his clothes so you aren't seen and it is executed brilliantly.One slight problem i had was some of the things you had to do seemed to wierd,like,""wait,how was anyone supposed to think of using this item with this object?""but that only happend a few times.And even though the area you are set in is small,the backtracking doesn't get very old,so it doesn't make you want to shoot yourself.                   another thing this game does well is the voice acting.It's terrible,but that makes it seem like a point-and-click adventure game of ye-old 1983 on the MS-DOS.So yes,i highly recommend this game.                   It has it's flaws here and there,but it makes up for it in charm and the music,that jazzy soundtrack,that is one simple song in every room,but the mixture of the ambiance,and the adding or subtracting of instruments in different rooms makes it wonderful.i give this game a solid rating of 8.5/10.

												Okay this game looked interesting and since I like to play point&click games, I thought why not give a try. Boy am I glad that I did not pay a cent for this game because it would've been a huge waste of money if I'm to be truthful. You start in a broken down, war torn, old hospital as a man who has lost his memory of the passed 25 years and wakes up in the year 2035. There is little insight as to what has happened other than that this war broke out in Buenos Aires and a group of people took over. From there, you must go through a series of challenging but boring tasks to escape the hospital before the General can ""interrogate"" you. However, once you escape the hospital with your fellow patient Victoria....the game ends. That's it. There's no detail as to when the next episode will be out and no new details as to what the heck is even going on in the storyline itself. After playing through the first time, I played through it a second time having known what to do, and found that it took my under five minutes. Quite frankly, I don't even care when the next episode comes out because if this one was any indication as to what the next one will be like, I don't even want to play it. If you're looking for an indepth point&click game with an addicting storyline and beautiful graphics, this game definitely isn't for you. Play at your own risk.			"

												I'd like to recommend this point and click game to anyone who is interested in a little puzzle and story. Obviously this is Chapter 1, and as it's free, you can assume that the other chapters will be priced. This is not so much a problem as Chapter 1 isn't that interesting, but gives you a good idea of the game as a whole, if you'd be willing to purchase the newer chapters. As you go through the first chapter, you're forced to think for yourself to figure out the next move in gameplay, this may be annoying for some, but in this case, there are hints available for those who may be stuck. It's quite a short chapter, but allows a few good achievements and allows you to expand your mind to be a part of the game itself. The story is very intriguing, not much information is given as you play as a guy suffereing from anmesia. This forces you to want more of the game, therefore wanting to purchase the next chapters. However I have not bought the next chapters as I don't see much more being any fun, personally. There are positves and negatives to this game, you have to be less interesting in action, and more interested in story for this to be found fun. I enjoyed the first chapter, but for myself, I wouldn't play it again.It depends on what sort of gameplay you enjoy personally.  "

												I beat this game in literally 40 minutes, which would have been faster if some of the things I had to do were more obvious (the ""talk to the grumpy guard three times"" thing was total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and if the dev thought that was creative, they were wrong). I got all of the achievements very quickly in two full playthroughs and was completely uninterested in the characters due to their flat personalities, the narrator's annoying narcissism, and the obviously bad voice acting (which I waive slightly because the game was made by someone who wasn't English). The plot was alright but way too vague. I guess that's what the next chapter is for, but it didn't seem very clear even with the exposition-spewing doctor.I did enjoy the art style, although the dim colors made it a little unengaging. Overall, the game is alright but not star quality by any standard. I'll only get the next chapter if it becomes Free to Player. Otherwise, I won't continue on the series.			"

												Reversion is a point-and-click ""escape"" game (as indicated by the sub-title). If you were around in the dark ages of the internet you're probably more than familiar with these, being the go-to ""hello world"" genre of choice for flash developers. OK, awkwardly phrased intro done, let's get onto the real review. This game is horrible for a veritable smorgasbord of reasons. We'll start with the plot. You play as ""Straight White Male"" (hereafter referred to as SWM), a character completely devoid of personality who wakes up in a hospital room with amnesia. Yes, apparently we're still doing amnesia. After establishing SWM's amnesia we go on to learn that a civil war has broken out and that it is 20 years later than SWM thought it was. Apparently he's a time traveller too or something stupid like that. There's also a doctor, a love interest (sorry, ""woman"") called ""Victoria"" and a soldier, though everyone seems to be avoiding the word ""soldier"". Since I got bored of the game very early on, I'm just going to guess the rest of the plot. SWM and Victoria escape the hospital and join up with ""The Resistance"". Through a series of misadventures they work hard to bring down whatever the other faction is, as Victoria's heart warms to SWM (possibly due to his charismatic blandness), Eventually they kill Hitler or whatever and fall in love.The voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting. Everything is flat and emotionless, the doctor being the worst offender. The pacing of the lines is horrible as well, there's no pause in between them so everything has this weird rushed feel, despite the lines themselves being slowly paced.The dialogue itself is pretty horrendous as well. It's fairly obvious that it wasn't written natively in English : not in itself a bad thing but the translation has been done poorly. There are odd quirks in the subject matter as well, where it is painfully obvious that the characters are speaking around the plot in order to hide information from the player, so that they can find it out later on and be surprised.As far as gameplay goes: it's a traditional point/click escape game. The puzzles don't make any sense so you have to just wander around all the areas at a painfully slow pace, clicking everything and combining everything with everything else. So in that respect it's pretty faithful to the genre.In conclusion, don't.Despite being free, I'd still advise you to spend your money elsewhere.			"

												Let me start off by saying, Reversion goes back to the roots of old school point and click adventures, it's a bit like Broken Sword   in a way, style and humour wise. Making the first chapter free2play was a great move by the developers in question, a nice taster, for the beginning episode of the episodic series. All in all, I really enjoyed this episode of Reversion, it had the wittyness, the charm of the characters, and most importantly the fun of the classic point and click genre. I'd whole heartly give this game a rating of 10/10, it's a must for point and click fans everywhere, just brilliant!			"

												I'd like to see what comes next, but I'm not *dying* to see what happens in upcoming chapters. Although it's an enjoyable game, I am not sure I would pay to play it nor is it in any way groundbreaking. The potential is there for improvement in upcoming chapters!			"

												This game would be suggestable to new comers of the adventure genre who really don't want to spend five bucks on Myst or Secret of Monkey Island until they know its a worthy investment.As one such new comer, there were some puzzles in the game that took atleast a little thinking out of the box, but not something too far out. However, for the most part, the puzzles are easy to piece together and require little out of the player except for a little bit of short term memory, making the game extremely short (about one hour on the first playthrough, without hints, and twenty minutes on my second). Some of the puzzles are oddly specific, though, requiring you to click on specific things, things that the player can figure out without the narritive aid of the character, which can be irritating.As for the animation and graphics, I kinda liked the visuals, as I liked the emphasis of things on characters, such as a large gut, but it was obvious that the animator had little work when it came to walking, as most of the time, the character slides across the floor. Also, some of the animations just look silly or are just cut out, maybe to spare the animator from animating something a little harder.The voice acting is horrid. The main character has little expression in his voice and after a first playthrough, it grates against your ears, at least in English (the game was made in another country, most likely Argentina, so Spanish would likely sound a lot better).The sound design is pretty alright. There weren't any out of place sounds, and I kinda sorta liked the main menu theme, though it sounds a little out of place at first.Overall, the team could have done a lot more polishing to their game, but I would be willing to pay for another chapter of this series if they stepped it up a notch in all departments. For the modest price of free, and considering that you are intrested, check the game out.			"

I'm not really into games like this but the ""style"" of this game makes it a very different experience from all the others of played! I am REALLY looking forward to buying the 2nd chapter and i reckon it's gonna be all worth the money. I'm confused at how I didn't find this fantastic game before!I give it a 8.5/10!!!!111			"

												Now before I go into why I would not recommend this game understand this I love Escape games. I have played so many that I have lost track of just how many I have played.  Now for why I would not recommend this game to anyone who shares the same love as I do for escape games. Now just looking at the story itself is decent, but the face that it is so short is enough to make this game bad. On my frist playthrough of this game it took me maybe 100 minutes where I got all the achivements but two. Then I played it the secound time it only took me 8.Now time for for me to tell you something else why I do not recommend this game. Half the time you don't even know what to click on or let alone even do, because the game does not give you any information on what you need to do next.  Some thing else that makes me not recommend this game is the mostiure radar. The mostiure radar is used for absolutely nothing besides showing you what you can click on.One more reason that I don't like this game is because this is only good for one playthrough.			"
