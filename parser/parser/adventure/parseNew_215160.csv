												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a 3D point-and-click adventure game set in a fantasy world. The game consists of 5 fairly lengthy chapters, although the last chapter was very short compared to the others. The Steam page says the game has about 20 hours of gameplay, but it only took me about 11 hours. The graphics are pre-rendered in 16:10 aspect ratio, which means that on other aspect ratios there will be black bars on the sides. I have a 16:9 monitor so there were a bit over 1 cm wide black bars on each side of the screen. Aside from that minor issue the graphics are good and the environment looks very detailed. The story is good, although it's a pretty standard fantasy story. You must find a powerful artifact and not let the evil forces get it. The somewhat silly world and the charming characters make the story a lot better. For example there are 2 NPCs playing a fantasy RPG, in which they must fill tax forms and do other mundane real life tasks. The dialogue is also pretty funny and contains several nods to other games like the Monkey Island series.I found the puzzles to be easy and simple. I never really had to look for any items as you could get almost all of them on the first time you entered that area. The interactable hotspots disappeared once you no longer needed them or if you had interacted with them for a couple of times. You also had to interact with everything once before you could pick it up, which I learned pretty quickly. That basically meant that all the hotspots remaining after going through them all would be used in a puzzle. The inventory system made everything even simpler as the game showed a text when you could combine two items. The game is fully voice acted and I thought the voice acting was pretty good. The music wasn't that great, but it was often barely noticeable. There are subtitles available in the game, but they don't show during the few cutscenes the game has. I thought the game was good and recommend playing it, if you like point-and-click games.			"

												Another great point-and-click.What's great about this game is that it's comedy gold. From the dialogue, the references, and the charming story, the game will just make your day even better.			"

												What the hell was I doing in 2012?The Book of Unwritten Tales is an old-school fashioned point-and-click (P&C) adventure which essentially catches you off guard right from the beginning. As the story unfolds from a simple quest in finding and retrieving a secret powerful artefact before the forces of evil in the vein of The Lord of The Rings, its strong and well-written narrative creates this deep and intriguing light-hearted story that always makes you wonder what is going to happen just around the corner. Not only that, but as the story progresses in its artistically breathtaking environments, it genuinely gets better and better throughout its impressively 17+ hours long story. While admittedly it is not the most original story on the surface and some of the animations can break the immersion at times, its rock-solid narration easily makes up for them.To my surprise, the game features some of the best memorable and likeable casts I have seen in a very long time, with plenty of exceptionally written witty humour which mocks (and pays tribute to) almost every single fantasy and video game trope out there, enough for a  handful of genuine laugh-out-loud moments. Whether it is J.R.R. Tolkien’s novels or World of Warcraft, you name it -- the game most likely covers it somewhere. Imposingly, the cast also features excellent voice acting accompanied by a fitting soundtrack when, well, when it feels like playing a soundtrack. What has kept this generation from embracing P&C nowadays could be partially blamed at the inconsistent difficulty-curve caused by illogical and lack of inspiring puzzles in similar games, but The Book of Unwritten Tales fixes almost all of that. The puzzles here are logical and generally easy to solve throughout the game since it encourages you to explore all the hotspots without the game holding your hand along the way. Apart from the second last chapter in particular, the puzzles here should be solved by literally anyone who is willing to explore every single detail out there, and this game has an abundance of small, yet rich, details in places. Plus, there are plenty of interesting (and humorous) dialogues and the hotspots are indeed descriptive. More importantly, there is a constant flow of momentum when solving the puzzles, something I have not seen in many games like this in years, and that is brilliant. There is never that fear of being punished and getting stuck for long periods of time for a poorly implemented puzzle. To my enjoyment, a few of the puzzles were rather genially designed thanks to a character-selection mechanic which allows the player to pick which character they want to perform certain tasks. While most of it comes down ultimately to a specific character being able to perform the certain task, it is a satisfying experience to see everyone working as a group to solve a puzzle, although I strongly feel like this is where the game missed an opportunity to expand on this mechanic. Just when the game seems to hit the nail on the head in every single aspect of a classic P&C adventure game (and beyond?), it drops the ball really heavily just at the end in one of the most abrupt endings I have seen since Dreamfall, without any sense of climactic fulfilment. It is clear that the ending was left open for a sequel, yet it was poorly executed -- causing more questions than answers. The last five minutes, including the final cutscene, felt more like the developers ran out of time and had to release the game as soon as possible, with little time spent on writing a conclusive and plausible ending. It painfully feels like the story ends halfway through the chapter, subconsciously knowing there has to be more. It is rather sad because everything up to this point was meticulously and well executed. You would honestly be surprised by how such ending can instantly change you from an enthralling mood to a pokerface the moment you see the credits rolling. That was very, I repeat, vey underwhelming.Conclusively, The Book of Unwritten Tales is the closest thing to a Monkey Island experience in my book. While it does not blatantly rely on nostalgia and references from past classics to suck you in, in fact, it does have its own charming personality. It basically takes almost everything that worked in the past and improves it, or more fittingly modernising the formula, while still keeping that old-school feel of the golden-era of LucasArts/Sierra games and at least trying to break the status quo set by those classics. I can easily say that this is one the best accomplished modern adventure games I have ever played in a very long time and can also say that it will stand the test of time as far as P&C games are concerned. It just falls slightly short from a masterpiece status thanks to its unjustified ending, but The Book of Unwritten Tales is a prime example of how P&C should be tackled for new and old audiences in times like these where military shooters and other saturated AAA-titles seem to take the spotlight in the media. There is more passion and product value in this than in many titles out there and I am glad I actually got to play this, eventually. What an unforgettable and delightful experience all around.Like I said earlier, what the hell was I doing in 2012? I shall not repeat the same mistake in 2015 when the sequel will be released.			"

Point-and Click Adventure re-vitalised and re-thoughtThe Book of Unwritten Tales was the first game by the German development studio King Art to be released internationally, in 2012. It put this adventure games-developer firmly on the map, and has been praised for adding a unique feel to the classic point-and-click adventure genre.For me it has been a long time since I last played a game like this. Actually, it was only since the adventure games by Telltale Games that I was redrawn into the genre, having played several of the classics many, many years ago (think 90's stuff). While the Telltale concept of adventure games focuses on a new kind of storytelling in combination with some action scenes, King Art completely stays within the boundaries of the classic adventure genre. Literally the only thing that needs to be done to complete this game, is pointing and clicking - the keyboard nor any other action is necessary, apart from pressing ""spacebar"" in order to see which objects are interactable with.While this may feel like a somewhat all too classic an approach for a game in the 2010's, it actually still works pretty well. Of course, just like any moint and click adventure game, The Book of Unwriten Tales has a lot of puzzles, but these don't feel like being tucked onto the game in order to provide a challenge or prolong playtime. The puzzles in this game form an organical part of it: they arise out of the situation, and most (if not all) of them can be solved by just thinking, not by gratuitously pointing and clicking all over the place (so it could as well be called a point and think game).That a classic adventure game like this still works nowadays, is mainly due to the interesting storyline, which drew me into the game pretty quick, helped by the amazingly original and beautiful artwork. The soundtrack too is top-notch and strikes the perfect balance between providing some background music and yet helps in painting each scene. The music even drew me into the game in an emotional way: it helped me to identify with the characters. Even more helpful in this respect is this gorgeous voice-acting, which draws the playable and non-playable characters out as men, women and monsters of flesh and blood (or of bones or anything else).Playing for a large part as the young Welsh gnome Wilbur Weathervane (www - just one of the many small puns) made me identify with this smart an witty character very soon, even more so since young Wilbur looks at life in a refreshing, sometimes naive way. Later in the game other characters come into play as well, providing some welcome contrasts, but it always felt like coming home whenever Wilbur was the one I was in charge of. The game does tend to ""let go"" on this strong point near the end, when Wilbur disappears more or less into the background.While all these qualities help to make a game of good to very good quality, the one element that differentiates The Book of Unwritten Tales from lots of other games, is the humour and even the irony with which the game looks at itself and at the entire world of games. Describing individual scenes from this game is difficult without resorting to spoilers, but when at a point quite early in the game I had to shut down a ""server"" for a ""rpg machine"" in order to rid two side-characters from their ""game-addiction"", I laughed out loud. The entire game is full of these sidekicks at the gaming industry, complete with wondrous quotes and one-liners. When a very depressed Death himself at a certain points says ""This is an adventure game, nobody is supposed to actually die here"", you know you're in for a treat.Besides the poking at different games and genres, The Book of Unwritten Tales also makes fun or rather poses some questions about the entire fantasy-concept. It does so by obvious references to The Lord of the Rings, but also by turning some conventions from the fantasy-genre upside down or inside-out. All in all, this is a game into a lot of thinking has been put, without interfering with the actual fun of playing it. I can only recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone even remotedly interested in adventure games. And for all of you who have forgotten how a classic point-and-click game should look and play like, don't look any further. They don't come any better than this one for the time being.Overall score: 9/10 "

												Solid PnC adventure game. Not the best you'll play, but definitely ranked among the good ones.👍 Nice length (14 hours, no guide)👍 Fun characters👍 Comedy is enternaining enough, has a lot of meta-talk and reference to other games and to general pop culture👍 Puzzles are fun to solve, and there are tons of them👍 Nice cartoonish scenarios👍 3+1 playable characters👍 Full of flavor dialogue👍 Nice system that helps you avoid doing the same thing over and over, removing red herrings after you've dealt with them± Slightly easy (see the note just above this one)± Music is ok, but forgetable± Breaking fourth wall± Story is decent, but just that👎 More moving back and forth than I would've enjoyed👎 A few non-game-breaking bugs (only a few missing dubs, texts, hotspot giving wrong indications, maps only partially functional... nothing big, really)👎 Some characters are bit on the ugly side for my taste			"

												This is not just the better point-and-click game i ever played, but one of the better gaming experiences i had so far. Awesome games like Machinarium are far, far away from The Book of Unwritten Tales. And the story... It's just amazing! It gets better and better while progressing. The final chapter is just... you must see it for yourself!Point-and-click adventurers, RPGs and fantasy worlds lovers must have it! It is full of really funny references of a lot of known worlds like World of Warcraft and Lord of the Rings. Those who are familiarized with this kind of games will just stagger at the screen and probably will find themselves smiling alone while playing.I wanted to see it on a movie, and although i can replay it, i'll miss the delight and freshness of discover it for the rest of my life.

Graphics and Voice acting are top notch for this style of game as well. I see they are making a part two. Cant wait!			"

												La version française suivra après (car jeu mis à jour)As most of the reviews already says, this a great adventure game in the vein of old Lucasart's one. Quite good writing, the scenario is interesting and surprising, the music is nice but you wouldn't notice it most of the time and its main pro is the humor and references during all the game. Regarding the references, it's kind of ""which one you have found, I could tell you how old you are"" as there are plenty from old to new games (adventure, MMORPG...), films etc.Also, while you play, you will have to manage different characters which make the game more interesting. But the game itself is not very hard to go through. Most of the puzzle are quite logical, just to be careful to check if you have interact with all you can see in each area and talk to every actors of the game. A hint, if you couldn't go further, try to speak to everyone you can again.All in all, it is a very nice game I really enjoy to play with and I recommend it to those you like adventure game. The one thing I missed (but finally not so much) is that there is no French option... but the English version is very well made.Update: finally, there is a French version, well not the voice but at least the subtitles which is a good start ;o)---------------------------Version française :Comme la plupart des commentaires en ont fait part, c'est un jeu d'aventure vraiment sympa dans la même veine que ceux de la grande époque Lucasart.L'écriture est bonne, le scénario intéressant et surprenant même, la musique assez sympa même si vous ne la remarquerez pas une partie du temps, et sa principale qualité à ce jeu se trouve au niveau de l'humour et des nombreuses références que l'on peut y trouver. Au niveau de ces derniers cela va des jeux vidéo aussi bien anciens que nouveaux jeux (de type MMORPG, aventure...), films etc.Aussi, sachez qu'un autre intérêt à ce jeu c'est lorsque vous jouer, vous allez diriger plusieurs personnages. Cela dit les casse-têtes ne sont pas très difficiles et assez logiques, il faut juste avoir bien vérifié chaque tableau pour voir si on a rien oublié et aussi ne pas hésiter à parler avec les différents personnages. Un petit truc, si vous êtes coincés, n'hésitez pas à retourner parler à tous les personnages qui vous entourent.En conclusion, c'est vraiment un jeu auquel j'ai pris un grand plaisir à jouer et je le recommande chaudement à ceux qui aiment les jeux d'aventure. La seule petite chose qui me manquait (et encore) c'était la version française. Mais cela est maintenant du passé car il y a les sous-titres en français. Cependant la version anglaise n'est pas très difficile à suivre et peut être un bon exercice pour ceux qui désirent s'améliorer avec la langue de Shakespeare.			"

												I never heard of this game and it was just sitting in my library and at the back of my backlog garthing dust. A random friend recommended it to me and between the 3 games that he picked from my library this one seemed least interesting...I am sure glade I was 100% wrong!!This game is an awesome RPG/Puzzle/Advanture game using multiple characters.A band of advanturers got dragged into a world changing event and chains of events were set in motion! A monster, A gnome, an Elf and a human have to work together to save their magical world.Good 3D rendered animation + great background artwork. The graphics are very well done a very smoothly placed and drawn. Artist did an fantastic job!!The music are few but intriging. Not the best but fits the back ground well.Story conversations are very interesting with a lot easter eggs about other games such as WOW. (3 pieces of copper but no arcanite crystal!!) The Plot is also very well written and interconnected to each other. It does gets a bit confusing at the end and I can feel a bit of rushing the game at the end so it's not perfect.Overall it's a very fun 10-12 hours of game play that you will enjoy!!Really no blood and violents at all so it's not game for everyone.8.7/10 and recommended for every single casual gamers.

												Sharp writing, logical puzzles, great characters, and a meaty 15 hour adventure make The Book of Unwritten Tales a must play for any point and click adventure fan. At times, it almost feels like the Discworld books meets Day of the Tentacle, and that's the highest praise I can offer. I was constantly amused and even laughing out loud during much of the game.Like any game in this genre though, there are some minor rough spots involving items that are difficult to notice/find. Thankfully, this only happened a couple of times during the story, and was far less of an issue than many other games of this type. There was also one puzzle that has you setting waypoints on a map that was extremely obtuse and annoying. Also, be warned that the game does make fun of many fantasy tropes, but it always feels like a sly wink and a nod rather than being cynical or mean-spirited.Despite the minor rough spots, the game was truly a joy to play and highly recommended if you're a fan of the point and click adventure genre, or simply a fan of fantasy comedy like the Discworld series.

												This was a great adventure game. Sadly, the developers abandoned it. There are many graphics and audio incompatibilities across all platforms. These problems have grown over time with newer versions of operating systems and graphics/audio/input drivers. Many users on the forums encountered show stopping bugs/crashes several chapters into the game.I spoke to representatives from KING Art, who said the build system for this game was destroyed, and that there are many third party libraries which the game depends on. The game needs significant development to reintegrate with the latest versions of these dependencies in order to recreate a working build system. They said this is simply not going to happen, and that the bugs will not be fixed.As there is no way to tell if the game will be completable for you, I can't recommend you buy it.			"

												I really enjoyed playing the game. It has clever story and dialogues. I laughed a lot.The four protagonists are adorerable. But not only them. I thrilled with the idea of inverse worlds(you are in a world where you can meet gnomes, dwarves,  dragons etc and humans play a game which takes place in real world ). The riddles were not so difficult. The answers are mostly obvious (you do not have to guess what the creator want me to do). If you have what you need in your inventory then the answer is clear.I strongly recommend it.			"

												I wasn't sure about this at first, as it's a little uneven in the early going, but the longer I played it, the more I enjoyed it. It's a fairly standard fantasy point-and-click adventure, where there's a big bad guy trying to get a powerful magic item, but it has a number of features that make it more entertaining than what you'd expect from such a generic situation.One of the best innovations I've seen in a while is that hotspots will disappear after you've done everything possible with them. That really helps eliminate wasteful backtracking and double-checking of red herrings. You also switch around between three characters, all with totally different personalities and abilities. It's a bit reminiscent of older LucasArts games like Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken. These two features help keep the game moving.The other thing that sets this game apart is its excellent sense of humor. The game walks a fine line between meta-humor and camp while playing with genre tropes and expectations from RPGs and graphical adventure games. Fantasy geeks will appreciate all the jokes referencing other games, books, and movies. The voice acting is also very good, which helps with the delivery of a lot of the humorous lines.The 3D graphics are mostly good, although there is some clipping and other weirdness here and there, and the cutscenes are only fair. Scenes are shown from widely varying angles to allow access to everything you need, which is appreciated.It took me twelve hours to complete, and I feel like I went at a fairly steady pace, so I'd expect 10-15 hours for almost anyone to finish it. Overall, any experienced adventurers will enjoy the game quite a bit, and it's easy to recommend for such folks.			"

												I hate adventures!--- end of review ---Ok, not really. I would love to love them is a better term. But they are so boring.Riddles because someone thought of them. Not because they make sense in the story.Characters which are too cool or smart to be true.Simply said, adventures are not fun.I know of three exceptions currently: Blade Runner - 1997 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_%281997_video_game%29 Culpa Innata - 2007 -  The Book of Unwritten Tales - 2009I played through ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"" in two days, ca. 16 hours (Blade Runner took me 32 hours non stop), and it was fun.Really fun.Sitting in front of your computer and laughing loud out, I don't do that very often.I like the characters, I like the music, I like the voices very much (dragon anyone?) and I REALLY like the riddles.Sometimes I searched for answers in the internet, but somehow I failed to find all but the first riddle. And even that was totally logically, I should have thought a bit longer about it.That is the funny thing here. You don't have to try to combine every item with every other item.Most of the time, you already have an idea what could/should work and just work in that direction.Only sometimes you look at what you have, then you look at the problem, then you say: NO, and try it. The game tells a story, the riddles are not riddles but there are problems in the game and you solve the problems. I hope you get my point? It is less ""oh my god, again a riddle"" and more of ""yes, of course do I need to do that somehow, how""?The game is just great.			"

												Okay let's be clear about this. I am not a fan of point and click advantures and with VERY few exceptions I never have been. I generally think it is a genre that has been dying out with good reason. The recent RASH of the things has done little to change my opinion....and, of course, here it comes, BUT. But the main reason for PnC games generally being more irritating than fun is that they contain puzzles that are not logical. This game is different. Using items is not a case of randomly picking up and trying every damned item with every hotspot or other item but rather a logical process that makes complete sense. Overlay this core fact with an entertaining story and good production values and you actually get a decent game from a much misused genre - and here it is.			"

												4 Feb 2017: First Review (About 17 hours in @ this time, approximately), My personal experience and review: I really, really, really enjoy this type of game..  It serves many purposes for me.  Right now, I'm going through a huge amount of circumstances out of my control (and some within) so I need some serious distraction, and in my case, for a female in her mature years, let's just put it that way. I'm no 20 something any longer but I do still enjoy youthful games, but only if they have some serious brain work.. Sometimes these puzzles seem mundane or what-have-you but they do serve a higher purpose than obvious.  Logic is an important one. Process of elimination. This game gives you that. And exploration. Humor (I love the humor). Different character's perspectives. I enjoy that also. This game keeps my mind going so it's not thinking of my woes, mourning, losing a loved one .... another one....  again.  And the workload I have ahead of me.. The physical care I must tend to. These things can overwhelm me to the point I can't focus on movies, games or anything I'd normally enjoy. Though I must sit up to play this game (it's not on my ipad, lol), I really appreciate the game a lot for helping  me to enter another world, not my own, yet I'm very much a part of it.You can feel that in the game. You get pulled into the story (if you read them) and you can skip (nice when you've already read it a time or two). I like that option there!  Who wants to keep hearing the same things over and over with no ability to bypass it?! This game has that freedom of choice.Some voices aren't the greatest.  Some actions can become tedious as you try to figure it out. Brain foood is what I call that type of game play.The humor :lol: I Love it so far. I think you can see my hours played somewhere around here. This game is satisfying.P&C, HOGs, Adventure, Humor (not in all games but, it is in this one :D) = a very nice relaxing evening.. I turn on my soft lighting, get comfortable and see what they have in store for me next. :)Not everyone enjoys what I like so this is my experience. Performance is good too. (OHHH!! And don't let me forget.. The maps are usable to teleport, as well as being able to click a ""door"" and click again to skip walking. HAHA! Love that! Saving me that precious time! So, if you like what you've read, I think you'll like the game.  Best Wishes..xtsPS. I don't remember if it was a gift. SORRY.. My mind has it's own techinique, it remains out of my control. Apologies.			"

												Very well-made point and click adventure that really sets itself apart from other games in the genre by featuring highly detailed and animated areas as well as great voice acting.Book of Unwritten Tales claims to be full of humor through parodies to well-known fantasy material.  You'll notice more than enough references to Tolkien's Lord of the Ring, plus a bit of Terry Pratchett's Discworld, Harry Power, Indiana Jones, Doctor Who, and of course RPGs or other geekery in general.  I wouldn't say the references are all that humorous, nor are they even a decent attempt at humor.  The vast majority of the jokes are, ""Hey players, look at how we are obviously referencing ______ here!""  The jokes fail to be funny on their own, so if you are not familiar with each and every reference, most of the dialogue will seem to be nothing more than idle chatter.   Even if you are familiar with the references, you probably won't find them funny.The puzzles are not particularly challenging to figure out, especially since you're pretty much guaranteed to succeed so long as you interact with all available objects.  This becomes quite the chore in the larger areas as you have to sit there and listen to the dialogue for every single item on the screen.  You could of course skip the dialogue, but for an adventure game, if you're going to skip the dialogue you may as well not even play the game.  Chapter 4 becomes particularly tedious as you are required to trek back and forth across the map numerous times.  To make that even worse, two of the puzzles can only be solved with trail and error, so you may be making the same trek multiple times.  Pressing the space bar reveals all interaction points in your current area, so it is never a challenge to find everything.  Sadly the use of the space bar is almost a necessity because there is nothing to indicate what you can or can't interact with as you play.This all combines for a game that is okay enough to play in short spurts but not something I'd really want to play for long periods of time.  For a 15+ hour game, this is definitely not a good thing.  I often found myself quickly reading the subtitles so I could click through the dialogue, really doing anything I could to speed the game along.  The game starts off well enough, but by the end I found myself wondering why I even bothered to finish.  Chapter 2 has the best characters and best script.  Chapter 3 is by far the best chapter in the game in terms of puzzles.  After that, though, the game really takes a nose dive on the enjoyment scale.I do not recommend this.			"

												Any game that uses ""In The Hall of The Mountain King"" (from Peer Gynt/composed by Edvard Grieg) as backgound music in a dwarf bar is already right up my alley (so to speak) humor wise.  Of course all the parody lines from classic movies like Platoon, Stars Wars, and Lord of the Rings, plus the whole MMORPG and RPG buffing parodies, a bit of 4th wall breaking and a few omages like Discworld's Death (Terry Pratchett), Raiders of the Lost Ark and Planet of the Apes (the original Charleston Heston version) make this game's blatant to subtle parody humor all that much better.  The game, itself, is even better then its humor. Storyline: Wilbur Weathervane, gnome, wannabe wizard, adventure day-dreamer, sometimes tinkerer, and full time employee at a dwarf bar gets the chance of his lifetime when Mortimer MacGuffin's (gremlim, archaeologist and chronicler) prison cage literally nearly drops on his head and hands him the ONE RING, before ""quest"" tasking him with delivering the ONE RING to the Arch-Mage Allister in Seastone before the Arch-Witch can get it.  Mortimer, the gremlin, who had been ""freed"" by the wood elf, Ivo (incognito Princess and wannabe adventurer) is recaptured and taken to the Arch-Witch, who of course is the cause of the endless war since she wants to rule the world.  Meanwhile, Ivo has also been given a ""quest"" task by Mortimer while she was freeing his cage from the cargo dragon.  Ivo is to find and retrieve a book, which has directions to the amulet of ultimate power, from the gremlin's secret cellar and take it to the Arch-Mage Allister in Seastone.  While all this is happening Munkus, the Arch-Witch's son is hot on the trail of finding the amulet of ultimate power so he can over-throw his mother and be in control of the world instead.    Gameplay: Point and Click adventure with a build and use inventory of items.  The gameplay is easy to follow and the tasks/obstacles are very logical given the circumstances (and people involved).  There are a few objects that are ""well hidden"" but if the gamer thinks for a bit, the object needed is easy to locate. (Careful searching will also accomplish the same task.)  Any encountered character gives clues about the task at hand and the main character will basically tell the the gamer what needs to be done and often times what is needed to accomplish the task.The gamer will eventually play as four different characters, all with their own perspective, personality and knowledge that each character would possess due to their background.  In one area the gamer even has a choice of one of three characters to play, and each character solves the task at hand differently using their natural abilities.   There are 5 chapters total.  During any chapter the gamer might play as a completely different character doing a completely separate task, once another character has finished their objective. There are also places when two (in one place three) characters are available to play at the same time by switching between them.  In these areas one character is capable of performing certain tasks the other character is not.  Also the knowledge each character possesses is clearly seen/heard.  The characters must work as a team to complete the task, and often times need to talk with each other to share knowledge and to trade inventory items.      Overall, wonderful game, superb witty humor and an excellent story of unlikely heroes.  Well worth full price.Note: This is the first of two games and there are DLCs available.			"

												I've bought the game a couple years ago (soon after it was released), but only had the time to play it now.And it was a blast. One of the best adventure games I ever played. It has everything a good game of this genre needs to have: memorable characters, funny conversations, captivating story and logical puzzles. The visuals are nice too, despite some flaws in animation and a few graphical glitches.Quotes from popular culture (LotR, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.) are also funny and are always spot on. The game also  occasionaly breaks the fourth wall and/or makes fun of the gaming industry (level 68 warriors with health potions) and MMORPGs is particular.Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I will definitely be playing Critter Chronicles and The Book of Unwritten Tales 2.			"

												I'll recommend The Book of Unwritten Tales for those that are in the mood for a comedy point and click adventure game. Really, if you are in the mood for something a bit more serious this certainly isn't for you. The amount of reference humor and fourth wall breaking is turned up to the top on this one. At some parts even to the point where it was getting a bit too much for me. But overall the game's charm and cartoony style won me over.The puzzles and tasks were challenging, without turning too hard. It is often needed to go and talk to characters you have already talked to in order to progress, but since this is consistent throughout the entire game, it doesn't feel as out of place, as it could have if it had only been done on a single puzzle.You play as four characters through different parts of the game, and some parts you must switch between multiple characters to use the different strength.All four with different personality, experience in life, and view on the world. The story is very simple, but as one of the supporting cast puts it “The battle between good and evil is never cliché!”			"

												14 solid hours of fantasy adventure goodness. A few polish issues here and there (subtitle errors, animation clipping) but nothing too distracting. Not that this is a game has to worry about immersion anyway. Book of Unwritten Tales knows full well that it's an adventure game and loves to poke the player and itself for laughs.Highlight: Buried Death alive and he quite enjoyed it.			"

Combine a book so good that you never want to end, with puzzles, fun minigames, laughs, art and good music, and add in a bit of magic, you have The Book of Unwritten Tales.			"

												I love this game, it encompasses humor from so many other games. There are touches of The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Sam and Max, Terry Pratchett's ""Death"" character and even a rendering of the tree from a version of 3D Mark.Long review short, you play a gnome who rejoices in the name of Wilbur Weathervane, but unlike other gnomes you have little interest in mechanical inventions. You would much prefer to become a Mage, and study all things magical. You start the game as a kitchen ""assistant"" in a once-popular Dwarven Inn... that was before The War descended upon the population and all of the Dwarves enlisted to go to the battle front... apart from the barman.A deadly artifact has been uncovered in some texts by archaeologist Mortimer McGuffin, an aged Gremlin, which threatens the entire existence of the known world should it ever be found, but before he can warn the Arch Mage in the town, he is kidnapped and held hostage under threat of torture to reveal the location of the artifact.The game starts with Mortimer's rescue, which indirectly introduces Wilbur into the story as well as a gorgeous female elf by the name of Ivodora Eleonora Clarissa, Princess of the Silver Forest Realm. The fate of the world lies upon your, and her, shoulders... and a couple of companions you happen to pick up along the way.From the very beginning, this game portrays a sense of humor that traverses so many levels and borrows from some well respected sources. The one that sticks in my mind is a scene where you meet Death, immediately identified with the well respected Terry Pratchett character when Wilbur asks why he isn't speaking in capital letters... and in case anybody missed it, Death is actually wearing ""fluffy bunny slippers"" which are actually modelled on Max from Sam and Max,There are also not-so-subtle references to Star Wars when Mortimer appears in a hologram to the Arch Mage and tells him that ""he is their only hope"". This game is full of wonderful tongue-in-cheek humor borrowed from some well respected classic sources which fit well with the characters and are delivered perfectly throughout.The puzzles in the game are not difficult... obscure sometimes but not difficult. You just need to stop for a minute, count to ten and re-think a situation, and the answer will come easily to mind. The only thing to mention here is that is is _essential_ to re-visit locations _AND_ to re-click on items you have already looked at previously. Sometimes an object will only reveal a vital clue after you have progressed a plot-line further, even if you have examined it previously, you _will_ need to examine it again later to solve a puzzle somewhere.It is this constant re-visiting of locations which is both a blessing and a curse, however the scenes are beautifully rendered so re-visiting is actually a pleasure, and visits are not too repetitive. Also, thankfully, several forms of ""quick-travel"" have been implemented which really helps as you progress through a chapter.The developers have done a good job of programming the navigation in this game, it is quite polished and is primarily mouse-driven with a minimum of keys required to play, which makes for some fairly quick gameplay when it is needed.Overall I would rate and recommend this game highly, it was a pleasure to play (for me at least) and it had a light air to it which I found refreshing in a steampunk style graphics game. The characters were light and friendly for the most part, even the ""evil"" characters were given a light humorous feel to them.The game rendered just fine for me in 1920x1080 and the sound was really quite pleasant, although the music had to be cranked down a bit to stop it over-riding the speech. Not that the music is unpleasant, the score is quite classical and provides a very pleasant background to the game.There were a couple of in-game sound effects that were not normalised but only a couple, the voices themselves are very well balanced and the variety of accents are actually genuine, being portrayed by genuine voice actors, not impersonators.I would end this review by saying give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised at how easily 8 hours of your life will just sail by without you realising it. This is quite an immersive game despite the simple plot, and if you are new to point-and-click then I would suggest you give this a serious go.			"

												What a marvelous game - a new grand jewel of classic adventure genre. It has good story, sophisticated humor, awesome characters, beautiful soundtrack, etc.The plot is hardly unwritten but it surely is very well told. The evil creature 'Mother' lurks in her heinous tower and tries to get her hands on a special relic with which she could take over the world. Game's 4 main characters get involved to events - whether they want it or not. Becoming from different parts of the world and having diffrent values their paths cross and will eventually become friends. Unlike in some other games of the genre - every playable character of The book of Unwritten Tales' is interesting and I always kept thinking that how they end up. Toast for the talented voice actors!The puzzles are typical point&click. While writing this review no particularly annoying puzzle is reaching my mind - there was however one itchy stealth event at the midway which did not fit in the game so well, but provided some variation perhaps. Some people have claimed that the game is even too easy when pointing the places of interest for player, for example. On the other hand I can quarantee that this is still much more challenging than some of modern adventure games of Telltale.The Book of Unwritten Tales has already proved its potential and the sequel has already been released! So if you have a thing with point&click and like adventure - Don't let this book to be unread! ;)			"

												Personally, I adored this game - and I've taken far too many screenshots of chairs! ;) Amazingly humorous, the female veggie dragon was every inch a breath of fresh air, with her character presenting the modern image of a dragon that wasn't 'terrifying'. More so, she was a dragon whom had become lost in a world of mindless carrying work and was now looking to take on the stereotypical image of the viscious, male dragon. Although now that I think upon it, she did seem like something similar to twilight (a vampire who's not a vampire; a dragon who's not a dragon; do you get the picture, eh?), but her character was certainly amusing enough to ignore this increasingly occuring character aspect in now modern culture.My favourite characters were Nate and Wilbur, I have to say. Nate appealed to me at first because of his rouge appearance and Wibur...well, who isn't intrigued by cute little gnomes with grandpa's. The graphics were simply amazing (from characters' outfits to cutscenes), and I can't fault that one bit. Guillivar's character was particularly entertaining, I found.Honestly, I entirely loved the game - minotaurs are not often represented enough today in culture and, as expressed, although there are some cliches (weeping women, dragon's not being dragons, etc), it was truly a breath of fresh air to play. The ending was perhaps a tad abrupt and could have been made longer, but it was clearly done to leave an opening for a sequel. So, in any case, after playing as Guybrush Threepwood for many, many years, I was looking to experience a new point-and-click, adventure game and I believe I found it :) I can only hope that the sequel that's being planned comes out soon. After all, I want Wilbur's family and that dwarf bartender to see his new outfit ;)			"

												A must-be-played by every adventure point-and-click enthusiast and everybody who wants to be some.This game takes place in a wonderful world, well a fairy world. Where there is magic and dragons and warriors.... and many more. Throughout the game you will control several characters. Depending on the current scene you can control only one or many.There are so many side references to other games, be it single player, multiplayer or even MMOs. Even references to movies can be found.Artwork is very cute. Don't hesitate to buy and play, even if it's not on a big discount. Worth every penny.			"

												These games get nowhere near the attention they deserve. This game, The Critter Chronicles and Unwritten Tales 2 are some of the best adventure games released in years. The production quality is enormous; the art, the animation, the voices and the soundtrack are top notch and the script and the characters are hilarious. The puzzles range from easy to tricky, but usually only if you're unaware of a reference the game is making towards another game or film. If you're a fan of silly adventure games then I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												As someone who’s not normally a fan of point-and-click adventure games I wasn’t particularly excited when I sat down to play The Book of Unwritten Tales - but I got it on sale so I thought “what the heck.” I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While the game follows the general rules of point-and-click adventures - you go from room to room picking up various objects and figuring out how they interact with each other and the enviroment -  what really sells the game is the humor. I find that it’s really hard to make games funny, but The Book of Unwritten Tales succeeds. The key is that the game just doesn’t take itself overly seriously. and the writers feel free to poke fun at it, and wider gaming topics, at will. In addition, the game makes you the think, but none of the puzzles feel unfair. You just have to be willing to spend some time poking around a bit and trying out different things. The whole game only takes about twenty hours to complete.There are certain points where I found particularly small items a little bit harder to find that I felt was fair - and the game doesn’t explain that you can right-click your items to find out more about them - but those are really my only complaints. The game might not be worth the full twenty bucks Steam is currently asking for, but it’s certainly worth picking up on sale!			"

												This is cute, light, and funny. Its not a deep, complex, or thinking game - it could be played by 8 year oldsThere are no decisions to make, and you cannot make an error. Not a puzzle game, and not really a true adventure. If you don't mind the conventions of a point-and-click, then you would enjoy this. The experience is like clicking through a movie, imagine playing the movie 'Shrek' and you have an idea of whether you'll enjoy it or not. The strengths are the voice-acting, the graphics. The comedy is a plus, but not their strongest point. The weakness is that it can still manage to be tedious, and you turn off your brain to play.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a classic Point & Click Adventure. It follows the paths of the gnome Wilbur, the human Nate, the elf Ivo and the Critter on their journey to save the world after the archaeologist Mortimer McGuffin finds a powerful artifact, that can decide the war between the Army of Shadows and the Alliance.The story sounds very clichee, but that is wanted, because the Book of Unwritten Tales is just one big parody of everything that has to do with fantasy, science fiction or adventure movies and is filled with many references to them. Even the music sometimes sound suspiciously close to some of Hollywood´s classics.The design of the game is very good for a Point & Click Adventure and fits the mood of the game very well. The 60 locations all have their own feel to them so that the game does not get boring. The Book of Unwritten Tales also did not fall for the trap, that many Point´n Clicks cannot avoid to step in. There are no annoying and unlogical puzzles. After some thinking everything makes sense, so that you do not have to randomly combine items without a certain goal. All in all the Book of Unwritten Tales was a really nice experience, that took me about thirteen hours to complete.			"

												This is, like, the prime example of why I'd want a ""meh"" button. The game isn't awful. Far from it. The graphics are passable, the voice acting is mostly decent, the music is alright, and the puzzles themselves make enough sense in-universe. The game's got a pretty decent length (maybe too long) and a good amount of humor.But it's just... boring.I will sum up the problem in one single image:https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CHhDACHW8AE47M_.png:largeDo you see this? At the start of the fourth chapter, the current protagonist says this. And this is exactly what happens.You cannot. Be. The. Thing. You. Are. Trying. To. Parody. It just does not work. You have failed as parody if you are doing the exact thing you are mocking. A lot of the game devolves into tedious fetch quests. The story is nothing special. It's a basic ""save the world"" vaguely plot. Fantasy/RPG setting. That's fine. The point is the comedy.And it does succeed there, in some regards. The first chapter is a bit light on it, but the second chapter is just jam-packed with humor and had me playing practically straight through. It kinda comes to a halt when the story intervenes though, but for those two or three hours I had tons of fun with the game. The mage diploma, the real-world MMO, the ""magic"" tricks, the lampshading of death in adventure games... it's all good comedy. It's an interesting world.And then... chapter 3 hits. Where you go through a temple in search of the plot device. No subversions. No real comedy. It's a stretch of the game where nothing really happens except more puzzles. The plot moves forward, sure, but the game has already established at this point that the plot does not matter. Why should I care about the plot. Why should I care about these characters. Wilbur is the only character that's really interesting in any way, and is why the second chapter works so well. Ivo is boring and without any personality whatsoever. Nate is an unlikeable jerk and cements his status as such at the end of the third chapter. Sure, the game calls him out for it too, but. He can be unlikeable to other characters without making him unlikeable to the audience as well.And the real nail in the coffin. After Nate does ""the bad thing"" that makes him so unlikeable... he is the primary controllable character for the rest of the game. You play as Wilbur for two short scenes and Ivo/Critter for one relatively small scene. The rest is him. I do not want to play as the unsympathetic jerk. I actually put the game down for a week at the start of Chapter 4 because I was dreading having to play as Nate. Sure, he spends the rest of the game trying to make up for his mistake, but I don't believe it. I don't feel compelled by it. I don't like him and that's not going to change.It doesn't help that the humor revolving around him isn't as good, nor are the characters he has to interact with. The dead lovers are kinda amusing. The paladin character and especially Nate's attitude towards him are an UTTER TRAVESTY, absolutely disgusting. The buffalo is boring. The Orc brothers are a very basic smart/stupid. The dragon is about the best character met in this chapter, but she comes in only near the end and doesn't do much, we don't see her much. Plus, her animation is pretty horrible and brings down that short section a lot.And then... you get to replay the last section of the fourth chapter from a different perspective, hearing basically no new dialogue, visiting no new locations, and doing very few new puzzles. And then the game... ends. It doesn't even make sense how it ends, either.SPOILER ALERT because I need to have this bit in my review.Why did they need to bring the Earth Pixies to the tower? Why did the other three need to be there alongside Ivo? At that point, all that needed to be done was for Ivo to leave the tower. The artifact wasn't in the chest, so the villains wouldn't have it. There was an easy way for Ivo to leave the tower unnoticed and unharmed. There was no reason for the entire out-of-the-blue pixie invasion and dragon reappearance with the other, except to force that cliche fly-off-into-the-distance ending. And wasn't it established that the monstrous villain lady (who we NEVER see) is really powerful? She could slaughter those pixies - heck, probably did off-screen. And Ivo intentionally drew her attention. For what purpose? Who knows. God. Everything about the ending is completely nonsensical, even aside from the fact that it just... happens. Very abruptly. The last puzzle in the game... is shrinking an orc in a completely different location from the climax.All-in-all... the game's a bit tedious, light on the comedy for most of the game, and overall just not a worthwhile investment of your time. It's alright, but not great. It has many, many problems. I'd say, pass.			"

												ONE OF THE BEST! (IMO)After playing more than a fair share of (point & click) adventure games in my life from all the way back in the beginning (in the 80's) up to present time, I have to say that this goes right in amongst my all-time favorites. It is a fantastic blend of humor, lovable characters, amazing artwork, intriguing puzzles/tasks to solve and excellent writing. It pleasantly breaks the 4th wall and shower us with references to games and movies alike that especially speak to the ones of us that has grown up with these types of games. I had many many ""Laugh Out Loud"" moments playing through this game, and it felt proper lengthy as well.The difficulty level was a bit up and down, and there was a handful of pixel hunts, plus quite a bit of running back and forth, but it didn't ruin the experience at all. There was so much fun going on when doing all those things that it didn't matter.The voice acting had me a bit worried at first as it seemed a bit flat at the very beginning, but it quickly escalated and felt proper good. The Welsh English dialect seem to suit this setting very well, as it did in Ni No Kuni. The sound effects and/or animation was a bit off at times, but easy to look past that. I can easily recommend this game to anyone who's into adventure games, or I'd actually go as far as call this a must have for any adventure fan. It would also be a good choice for people not familiar with these types of game and want to try one out.  It is well worth the money.Rated 9/10Happy gaming!J3ST3R			"

												I must confess it was rather surprising to go back to a proper point and click adventure after a streak of somewhat half-baked ones light on puzzles and perfectly content to hand hold you throughout the entire experience in favor of delivering their narrative. Make no mistake, The Book of Unwritten Tales makes couple of modern concessions but it is, at heart, a traditional genre representative. Starting off, I have to say this is one helluva charming game even if it does have a few things stacked against itself, as I'll explain later down the road in this write-up. Visuals succeed almost entirely in blending various 3D and 2D assets, with few exceptions here-and-there marring the presentation primarily because age creeps into everything eventually, as well as appropriate use of soft colors and lighting goes a long way in selling you on the locales you visit. Pleasant artwork certainly helps, as well. Standout element I REALLY have to give props to is the soundtrack – it's brilliant. Fantasy fare and nothing you haven't heard before, but packs a punch and I'd bet no expense was spared in putting it together. Polygonal characters are most of the time lovingly animated with, well, character and it comes through especially when they emote.Speaking of characters you'll be contending with more than just Wilbur the Gnome, who is portrayed as the game's central figure on most of promotional material, but as far as I'm concerned he is this game's genuine protagonist forsooth. Somewhat of a black sheep in his family comprised of a biologist, roboticist and engineers in general he instead aspires to become a mage one day. Sudden turn of events thrusts a great destiny on his shoulders and sets him down on a long road to potentially save the day and maybe, just maybe achieve his lifelong dream. Second character is a she-elf named Ivo who ends up enrolled in this adventure thanks to random chance rivaling that of Wilbur himself. There is a third person involved, but I'd rather not spoil who that is. Well, there's also a fourth. Sort of. Kinda. It's a whimsical game, what do you want?Now that I've gushed about the positives let's get down to gritty negatives... of which there aren't that many, surprisingly. I'd only list two real negatives, because if you're into point and click adventures you already knows you're signing up for with few nonsensical puzzles and such, even though The Book of Unwritten Tales dispenses with those for [mostly] perfectly logical puzzles, and they are as follows; entire playable cast does not get equal amount of character development and that game ends rather abruptly, following what is possibly the most arduous and tedious section of the game. Which you have to retread twice. I don't know if they simply ran out of time or money, but the ending itself felt rather automated and resolved much too quickly for all the buildup that lead to it. One point that's going to be divisive for most is game's heavy use of references, both playing them straight or ridiculing while portraying how genre savvy developers are. It doesn't get into obnoxious territory and ranges from your classical Discworld to Star Wars and World of Warcraft mentions, but there was one section that served as commentary of MMORPGs and TCGs as a whole which made me bolt a smile on my face for five minutes straight. So, closing words. Should you get it? If you want a modern game from a genre past it's prime, but one that's long overdue for proper revival I would say yes. It's not a masterpiece but for me game's charm carried it from beginning to end.			"

												It may not be the most challenging of games all of the time but it is fun!  It has a true charming quality right from the start and is jam packed with fun pokes at other rpgs and the like.  As others have said if you are big on gaming there will be at least one reference in there you will get which of course adds to the amusement.  You get to play as different chars as the game progresses which each have their charming or not so charming qualities.  It clearly has appeal to all as my entire family are eager for me to get on and finish so they can all have a go!  I have yet to complete the game but so far it has run beautifully on my machine with no hic-cups and I am on windows 8.1.  I have had a few graphical flickers now and then but thats probably because I am running on BETA drivers for my graphics card at present.I was gifted this while it was on sale (my partners such a cheap skate lol) I dont know as if I would pay full price for it (mainly because I am also a cheap skate) but it was worth getting!  I expected it to be a lot shorter than it is but is has a lot of game play in it and it will put a smile on your face.			"

												Haven't finished yet but I'd say it is a fantastic game. Not that hard for point&click genre newbie-which is me. Graphic is beyond my expectation. Dialogues are very amusing, I can't stop laughing when l hear 'em. Mind you I am not a native English user so I can surely say you won't miss the most of laughing points even if you are not fluent in english as I am. This game really worth a try.Recommended			"

												One of the best pont-&-click adventure's in my gaming history.What's make this game of one best's - is that it's mirror most fantasy universe's (Lord Of The Rings, Avantasia, Warcraft and e.t.c.) and even Real Life in so sarcastic manner, so you can't just ignore it.Puzzles and quest's grow in difficulty with every new chapter (but most's of them are not so difficult; I don't use ""SPACE"" to highlight all active object's untill chapter 4).""Sam & Max"" now have a really serious competitor ina face of thoose fellas.Highly recommended for all who familiar with fantasy worlds (even a little) and have a deep lust of good laughing infront of monitor.

												This is a great adventure game. It's one of those hidden gems no one knows about.Puzzles. Puzzles are logical in this game, unlike in some other adventure games where puzzles are made very hard and solutions are very illogical.The difficulty is great too, you don't spend hours on one puzzle, but you don't solve them in 10 seconds too. The story is very good and fun too, you want to read/listen all the dialogs. It has good humor, i laughed many times while listening to the conversations. Also the game is quite long.Graphics are nice but not great, the game probably would've been even better if the graphics would've been painted in 2D like broken sword or pendulo studios games. But it's probably a matter of taste :)There's some bugs, but they're nowhere near gamebreaking.I'd give this game 9.5. I'm really suprised by the Book of Unwritten Tales. I'd like to say a big ""thank you"" to developers for this games :)			"

												So! You are a fan of point and click adventure games, but long gone are the days of Guybrush Threepwood, Roger Wilco, and purple tentacles. So, naturally, you've left games like that to the past, and whenever anyone tries to make a new one, it's all focused on graphics, never on story, never on humor, and certainly never the old 'combine these things to make this new thing to solve this puzzle'.Well, I can say that if that is what you are looking for, The Book of Unwritten Tales is for you. The humor is a good blend of clever, self-aware, and just plain groan-worthy. The puzzles are not too simple and not too complicated. Well...ok, maybe a BIT too simple. Most of them were actually pretty basic, though a few stood out as clever.My only complaints about this addition to the genre were fairly minor. One of the more classic moments in these types of games was in The Secret of Monkey Island where there was a whole string of events that happens outside of your control and everything occurs off screen with you just sitting there reading the text and listening to the sound effects. A direct homage to that happens in this game, but then a couple more times things similar to it happen....once was funny and a nice tribute, but multiple times sort of makes it feel like lazy writing or a way to advance the story when there's no logical way to tie two events together.The other issue I had with this was one of...I don't know...dialogue trees? Programming? I am unsure what it would fall under but on multiple occaisons I would find an item and go 'Oh...I wonder if person X would like this items...' and so I go to check and they respond with 'Oh, hey, thanks for getting me that thing I asked for, here is the item I promised in return.' Except that none of that dialogue happened. It skips it entirely. It's not really a PROBLEM, but it certainly breaks the scene a bit and makes you kind of annoyed that you missed what might have been some funny moments.Those gripes are minor, however, and I recommend this game a lot, even if you've never really played point and click adventures before as there isn't quite as many gaps in logic as you find in many others.P.S. My favorite character was the dragon.			"

												Gorgeous, entertaining and definitely one of the better point & clicks out there. Despite the fact that the writers spend most of  their time crawling up Terry Pratchet's *** (read: honorable bottom), the writing is rather decent with a variety of references for all tastes and walks of life, distinctly articulated characters and some great chuckles in between. I also rather enjoyed the voice acting and generally found myself not skipping through the dialog. The art style is brilliant and the soundtrack is also great. The puzzles are for the most parts good, in a traditional point & click, Lucas Arts type of way.On to the negatives: The early game is in every way superior to the later game, making me wonder whether they run out of time by the end of production. Specifically, in most of Nate's part there was less love in the details, the puzzles were worse (more unintuitive, more pixel hunting), and it all kinda dragged on without an apparent reason and without the great writing that made it all flow earlier. Problem number two was also mostly apparent in the second half: the lack of any type of hint system. If you want to get away without including one, you'd better give better clues, either with the art or with the writing, which the second half doesn't accomplish well. Lazy puzzles of the ""put item x on spot y for no apparent reason"" variety (and btw, good luck finding that ""y"" spot) are immensely annoying. It all becomes 10 time more exacerbating by unskippable cut scenes (""wuzza"" anyone?) in two of those later puzzles. I don't appreciate alt-tabbing and having to look for walkthroughs - which I did because the ""wuzza""s were ruining my enjoyment of the experience. Last but not least, I found the ending rather anticlimactic: basically an annoying cliffhanger-y type of thing that the game didn't deserve. Nonetheless. It's for the most parts a good adventure game, beautiful to look at, great to listen to and with mostly interesting traditional point & click puzzles. Get it on a sale or a bundle instead of full price, and you can't go wrong.			"

												The ""Book of unwritten tales"" is a 3D point and click game where you're following some interesting characters. The game itself is beautifully designed, but the only thing I have to say about the design is that some objects can disappear for a few seconds and come back again. Another bad thing is that some of the items you need to find can be hard to see because of all the colours, even though I played the game in high resolution. Beside of that I think the game is well thought out with funny characters, funny quests, a good history, and an extremely funny ending.Keep doing what you are doing KING Art!8/10			"

												This game was fun and adorable, there's not much more I can ask for.  There were tons of pop culture references that made my inner geek spaz out with excitement!  I adored the characters, too.  The only complaint I really have is about the tedium of going back and forth between places later in the game.  There was a map function that let you more or less warp to SOME places, but I would have liked it if you could fast travel everywhere.  Oh well, it was really just a mild annoyance.Overall this game was great and I recommend it to anyone interested in point & click adventure games!			"

												Nice point-and-click adventure. Won't blow your mind but it's a charming little game. Lots of beautiful, painterly artwork, and the voice acting does a good job of bringing the characters to life. It's not without its flaws, though. It can be a bit too much of a hidden-object puzzler at times, so get used to sweeping the mouse over the screen looking for that 25-pixel hotspot you missed the first 4 times through the room. And it's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is... lots of clumsy breaking of the 4th wall that just fall flat. Still decent in balance, though!			"

												First and foremost let's take a look at the technical aspect of the game, especcially on how well it was ported over to Linux.The Book of Unwritten Tales is in my humble opinion a terrible Linux port. Not surprising if you ask me, since this has been ported by Nordic Games GmbH, the very same company that brought us Deadfall Adventures. My review of Deadfall Adventures speakes for itself (feel free to read it), and I swore to myself to never ever buy anything that has been published, ported or remotly touched by Nordic Games again. But I guess the sales wh*re in me couldn't resist Steam's €4.99 special sale lol.The game was release in 2012 for Linux, where multiple users reported countless bugs and even some of them game breaking, they still have not been fixed by Nordic Games until today. In fact, I had to replace library files, edit a bash scrip to even get the ingame settings menu to run properly. Not to mention the black bars on the right and left hand-side of the screen, although the game resultion is set to 1920X1080 - 16:9. This is totally unexceptable and mere laziness of the publisher/developer, considering that 3 years have passed  since the game was initially released for Linux. As I have alrady previously stated  in my Deadfall Adventures review, Nordic Games should consult Feral Interactive or Aspyr on how to properly port games over to Linux. From now on, no matter how cheap their games are, even if they throw them at me, I won't buy/play them!!!Now that we have the technical issues sorted out and you know what you can expect when you buy and install the game on Linux. How good is the game itself?If you want to feel like you're on a quest as Frodo Baggins was in Lord of the Rings, or be reminded of Yoda from Star Wars when a little gremlin appears in the palm of your hand, or just enjoy being in a magical world like Harry Potter, you will look forward to sitting down and opening The Book of Unwritten Tales. You will be going on an adventure with four characters but I like Wilbur Weathervane. I'm routing for you little guy, by the way he's a gnome. The controls are very easy to learn - just point and click. Press the spacebar if you get befuddled but use it sparingly.The creative author weaved a unique tale of good vs. evil. With a swish and flick of their paint brush, the imaginative graphic artists will whisk you off to an enchanted world. The voice actors with their wee bit of a Scottish accent have the best voices to tell a story, and hearing the sounds of birds singing, bees buzzing, potions exploding, wind blowing while you're atop a dragon, helps to immerse you into the story. So all in all the game is superb, if it wasn't only for that poorly executed Linux port by Nordic Games.  I can only reccomend the game and give it a thumbs up!!!!!!			"

												Summary: a fantastic story hindered considerably by sub-par controls.There are already over a thousand reviews, mostly positive, so i'll just recap a few points (some of which are specific to Linux):- notable video resolution detection/restoration problems on linux. Workaround: set up the game to run in the same resolution as your desktop does. Anything else is likely to Cause Grief.- the controls are annoying at times, e.g., you can't select any inventory items while you're waiting on a current speaker or animation to finish (and it's not always clear when animations are finished). There are many superfluously long animations. A good half of the clickables in any given scene have no game effect, they just drag out the story.- though the space bar can be used to show activatable/investigatable zones, this is horribly unconfortable for a game which is otherwise playable with a single hand. It ""would be nice"" to have a toggle option which turns (and leaves) this display on/off.- activatable/investigatable zones sometimes overlap with the inventory activation zone (bottom of the screen), making them nearly impossible to activate (one has to fight for a while against the inventory list, which pops up automatically when the mouse hits the botton of the screen). That's is, i dare say, an epic failure.- whether or not an item/zone can be activated cannot be determined via mouse-over while an animation/speaker is ongoing. You've got to wait until they're done before checking. Clicking bypasses a speaker, but you then risk missing important information. Which reminds me...- the inability to pause it during speaking sequences (in particular, the early-game ones can be effing long) is problematic when the telephone rings or the neighbor decides to mow his lawn right outside your window, interrupting your game (with no way to repeat what you just missed). Another major usability fail.- a ""hint"" button would be a big help. Apparently there is no way to bypass being stuck without reading a walkthrough, but....- the game only runs in full-screen and alt-tabbing out of it sometimes corrupts its awareness of the mouse, making it impossible to click on anything when returning to the game. In such cases, only Alt-F4 (close window) helps.- having to click some activation zones multiple times to get to the point is tremendously annoying. e.g. the first click might just tell you what it is. The second click might tell you more about it. The third click might actually let you do something with it. This causes a lot of repeat clicking on items which do _not_ require multiple clicks, as we are forced to click multiple times in order to determine whether multiple clicks are needed for that specific item. Aaarrrggg.If the story wasn't so entertaining, i'd have stopped playing by now because the quirks of the controls are so frustrating.			"

												Best adventure game I've ever played, really. If you ever have been put off by some obscure adventure game in the past and decided to avoid the genre all together, give this a try. I think you will change your mind.What's so awesome about this game? The script and writing are simpy terrific! Fantastic sense of humour, hilarious ideas and really nice 4th wall breaking. I've lost count how many times I laughed and chuckled. Yes, the story involves you saving the world again, but there are couple twists along the way and it's not easy to predict what will happen next (especially taking into account adventure game logic ;). Characters are likeable and have strong personality. Their adventures usually involve finding themselves in absurd situations, facing ridiculous obstacles and solving problems in most unusual way. So adventure gaming in its best classic comedic edition. During the course of the game you control different characters and there are times when you can switch between them on demand. The puzzles are fun and with subtle hints from conversations and item descriptions you always know what you need to do. You find and combine some items, execute actions in right order or say right things to right people. One of the highlights is preparing a magic potion, where you need to follow closely a recipe and add ingredients in correct amount, order and at right moment. There were times I missed an object (I only found out later that you can press 'space' to see all interactive objects on the screen) and walked around a bit, but in the end I found a solution by myself. Voice acting is top-notch. I went through every possible dialogue option and clicked on every item to hear every single sentence. As is expected from adventure games, the game is pretty to look at. It's 3d graphics with locked camera, but it does have handdrawn vibe and charm.It all comes together perfectly. Great game. I'm glad they are doing the sequel.			"

												I am a pretty big fan of Point & Click Adventures so of course I would happily play this.The game starts out with a Gremlin called McGuffin (Not just a name) being captured by an evil army as he has knowledge of a magical artefact that can end an on-going war. He manages to give a ring to Wilbur, a Gnome who wishes for a greater purpose in life, between being freed and immediately recaptured by a dragon. Cue the adventures of Wilbur the Gnome and Ivo the Wood Elf as they attempt to save the land from the Arch-Witch Mortroga.This game is OK. From the beginning it has a clear idea of what it wants to do which is poke fun at multiple fantasy tropes with World of Warcraft seeming to be made the most fun of (Wilbur's first area looks incredibly like Dun Moragh for example) but still tries to keep up with its story. Later it seems to get rather cofused and some parts and character descisions make little sense such as Nate (a selfish scoundral interested in his own wealth) suddenly decides to want to save the land instead of ensuring his own safety and wealth. It is a rather odd character descision that comes out of nowhere much like other certain plot devices.The worst part is pretty much the end. Which decides to solve the worlds troubles with a convuluted plot and then ends rather abruptly with no real explanation of what just happened. It's not a bad game. The story does get rather sporadic and non-sensical towards the end although it may just be that the game feels more compelled to tell jokes rather than a story. Try if you want, Don't expect anything spectacular though.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a point-and-click adventure video game created by German developer King Art originally released in 2009 in Germany and translated to English and re-released in 2011.Despite being originally released in 2009, the graphics still looks very beautiful and hand-drawn with alot of attention to details which makes this a beautiful journey to adventure in. Animations are smooth and fluid and the whole game is just looks very pleasing to the eye. The cutscenes could use some improvements however, as they are lower resolution pre-rendered videos with no option for subtitles even though the game itself supports it.Music is also very orchestral and professional sounding, with nice little jingles accompanied with sweeping epic symphonies. Voice acting is really very good and each of the voices add alot of substance to the characters.The story itself is about 14 hours long and is an interesting and light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to alot of fantasy and RPG stereotypes. Although there are no in-game hint system, the puzzles are not very difficult and feels just right. There are however some puzzle minigames that may require a little dexterity (Eg: a rhythm based music game)For younger gamers who have not played the classic old Lucasarts adventure games however, they may not get some of the jokes. For the most part though, the overall plot is easy to understand, entertaining and a clever plot mechanic near the end certainly surprised me. The ending was a little abrupt however, and while the game does end in a cliffhanger, it is still quite satisfying.Downside, there was a potential game stopping bug relatively early in the game and I was lucky to have had a savegame beforehand. (Protip: Do not press ESC when you are doing the Wheel of Fortune, because if you do, the character animations will just loop and you will not be able to progress further) Other minor annoyances include not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical ""mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable"" type of situations. (2nd Protip: Pressing Spacebar will allow you to see ALL the clickable locations on the screen. Be forwarned however that this might make the game a little too easy.) There are also no bonus features to unlock once you've beaten the main game thus lowering the replayability value.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Old-school adventure gamers will enjoy this game and appreciate some of the jokes which would bring back some nostalgic memories. It is not a very difficult game, and you don't have to think out of the box. For newer gamers who have never played an adventure game, this is an excellent introduction for you. Definitely well worth a look. Don't miss it.			"

The puzzles weren't like most were you had to waste a bunch of time trying to figure things out or make senseless combinations of items but things just made sense so you got to enjoy the game.  It's quite funny too :DWilbur  is the single most enjoyable character I've ever played in a game.  The voice acting for him and the rest of the cast (minus the human Nate - he's kinid of annoying IMO) is spot on.  Please play this game if you are at ALL a fan of point and click adventure games.  I've been hooked on 'em since Kings Quest VI and I know I always feel great at the end of finishing one, even if they're not too great, but these guys need to keep making adventure games.  Support 'em!			"

												Pros: The art is not pixel graphics!  Beautiful soundtrack, excellent voice acting, descriptive narration for the world and its items/inhabitants.  The story has a complete ending.Cons: The animation of the 3D models seems a bit clunky and rigid.  I experienced a bug where the game slows downs tremendously when accessing the inventory.  No Steam achievements.Summary: When I see a game from ""The Adventure Company,"" I roll my eyes and expect drivel.  This game was actually quite fun, so I definitely recommend it to fans of the point & click adventure genre.			"

												I LOVE you and your humor, KING Art!!! This game will bring you hours of fun even if you are not extremely interested in point & click adventure games. It has a wonderful graphics, not too complicated puzzles and wonderfully atmospheric background music. You really want to hear all the dialogues, because they make fun of everything and everyone, especially some groups of people... ;)What surprised me the most was that you could play as more characters at the same time and control them by switching between them. It was really a good experience for me when there were two of them, but at some point you get to play three characters and at this point the switching gets really annoying because most of the time it's about waiting when they return to their previous positions. One of them even got stuck once. Thankfully, they didn't go for it more than once for a short while, because this was really the only negative thing I could think of after finishing the game.23 hours of gameplay done so I am leaving you my beloved game! I am leaving you with this goodbye gift review hoping it will motivate someone to pick you up again!			"

												Rating 9/10Overview: Point and Click AdventureThis is a fantastic point and click adventure game that should be played by anyone who is a fan of the genre. The setting is fantasy, a beautiful artstyle with some great characters and well written dialogue. The comedy elements are also pretty decent. This is a fairly lengthy adventure ranging anywhere between 10-15 hours depending on skill level.  The puzzles are not terribly difficult and find the right balance between fun and challenging.  Strongly recommended.  "

												Good point and click game, though not very challenging. The story is entertaining and spoofs fantasy/sci fi stereotypes from Tolken to Star Wars.The characters are endearing and laugh-out-loud funny. I would say this is a perfect starter point and click for kids but for some (very little, actually) ""strong"" language. The graphics are good with the details in the scenes finely rendered. The characters are detailed and well voiced (though the voice effect for one character grated on my nerves). If the puzzles were more of a challenge I would rate this as a must buy. As it is I'd say its a must buy on sale.			"

Short version: 91%If you ever wished for a beautiful and engaging 3D adventure game that also gives you more than a dozen hours of pure entertainment, then Book of Unwritten Tales is that wish come true.Long version:The Book of Unwritten tales is a masterfully crafted point ‘n’ click adventure game which knows exactly what the essence of this genre is: the storyline, the presentation, the visuals and the puzzles. It takes place in a world where classic D&D fantasy is mixed with the modern laws of capitalism. This paradox, along with the constant fourth wall breaking, is one of the main sources of humour, a strong suit of the game, and very reminiscent of the classic LucasArts titles.Thanks to the Ogre rendering engine all scenes are lush and highly detailed, but the animation is prone to a lot of clipping and there are no facial expressions. These are compensated by the very slow character movement and an excellent British voice cast (who, I must admit, give a lot of class to the game). The story is fun and engaging, but it would be hard not to notice that it suffers from deadline syndrome, where the first half is much more detailed in design and in execution than the second one. The main sore point is the ending: the plot, which ran a slow and steady pace, suddenly makes several seven-league leaps, only to tie up everything in less than a minute and roll the credits. Thankfully there is a prequel and a sequel to remedy this mistake.As for the puzzles, they are fun and varied, and they have one wonderful feature: every time you move an object over another object or scene element that it can interact with, the cursor changes. It doesn’t mean the game holds your hand, only that it completely eliminates the frustrating part of the try-everything-with-everything scenarios, making it even more perfect and fun to play.			"

												Wonderful point-and-click game with lovable characters and interesting puzzles and one of my favorite games in the genre from the last five years. I often feel that games that try to be funny often end up being cringeworthy instead, but the characters in this game are actually amusing. Even when they fall short of funny, they still achieve lovable and whimsical rather than awkward. The voice actors must take quite a bit of the credit for this as they are brilliant. The puzzles should be solveable as long as you make sure you click on everything and try all combinations, and the game does not contain any puzzles of the type that requires lots of calculations or trying to guess what the developers thought a certain symbol looked like etc. Although I generally really, really like this game, its weak points might be the traditional storyline (an ordinary person must save the world), as well as the villain being a bit too cartoonish for my taste. However, this might be a positive aspect for a younger player as this means the villain is not scary. The difficulty level of the puzzles might also be an issue for those who want more challenging games - although the puzzles are not super easy, they are not extremely difficult either. This game is also more on the light-hearted side, so if you are looking for something darker and more serious, this might not be the game for you. That being said, I strongly recommend this game for someone looking for a casual, delightful and charming point-and-click game with entertaining and logical puzzles that do not stop the flow of the game.

Not any impossiible to figure out puzzles like .. umm Monkey Island games... but it also did not hold your hand in any way.. like say Back to the Future.. All the references to all the movies and other games were actually well thought out and did make me actually laugh a few times.. I also have the critter chronicles and hope that is done as well but I highly recommend this if you like these types of games and you will like it even more if you are an RPG fan as well.. I definitely will be playing the 2nd one when it comes out..			"

												Let me preface this review with the fact that I played book of unwritten tales 2 before I played this one.  I loved it just as a much.  I feel like it's funny without trying to hard.  The puzzles are not easy, but not impossible to work out.  There were a few times I was tempted to open up a walkthrough, but re-visiting what I had available ultimately allowed me to complete the game without help.  I really hope they continue with this series.  I am a huge fan of point & click adventure from monkey island, grim fandango, all the way to more modern games like kelvin and the infamous machine, machnimarium, deponia and inner world. To the developer please keep making games like this and night of the rabbit!			"

												There are plenty of things wrong with The Book of Unwritten Tales.  It uses cheap referential humor as an excuse for rehashing every fantasy cliché in the book. It uses self-deprecating criticism of the adventure genre to cover some of the worst contrivances and pixel hunts ever executed in a point-and-click game.  It has twitchy 3D animation on top of what is otherwise beautiful 2D artwork that is so busy that you have to sweep everything with the cursor over and over to figure out what 10% of the screen can be clicked.  It pads out its already reasonable playtime with slow repetitive dialog, slow animations, and backtracking, but still manages to end suddenly. And its areas are so complex that the player can think of a dozen logical ways to solve every problem before the particular required solution is stumbled upon.  Let’s say you need water.  There are at least four places in the environment with obvious water, not counting the various wet things in your inventory, but those aren’t the water sources you can use.  You know how these things go.But it doesn’t matter.To point out all of those things is exactly like saying Lord of the Rings is dumb because the eagles could have taken the ring to Mordor, or that the movies were cash grabs because they changed plot items and pacing to appeal to a broader audience and added multiple video releases in case you only went to the theater six times.  It’s like saying NASCAR is just going fast and turning left and that pro wrestling is fake.  You’re a troll.  You aren’t smart for noticing.  No one is impressed on “teh internets” that they didn’t fool you.The game is amazing.  There are no gimmicks.  The Book of Unwritten Tales takes every classic adventure game feature and does them all well.  The scenes are so detailed, the humor so genuine, the difficulty so finely tuned, the characters so comfortable that you have to love it and want more.  The worst I can say is that I tried playing it at a time when I was finishing only 3-hour games, and so it felt like it was dragging a bit.  I don’t think I’d have gotten that impression if I played it all on a long vacation weekend.  There are inventory puzzles, environmental puzzles, dialog puzzles, and few if any of the cheap everything-can-be-forced-into-a-traditional-sliding-puzzle puzzles.  There are a couple of fail-and-restart situations, but nothing too frustrating.Really this game deserves whatever praise you’ve already read.  If you think (like me) that Monkey Island 3 and The Longest Journey are the archetypal point-and-click games, play this.			"

												The writing is alright. Good humor sprinkled thoughout. But can't really recommend it because of the bad user experience design. THe animation is slow and you have no way of skipping somoe of them. Most of the time you have to wait for the character to SLOWLY move to a specific point before he/she starts talking or interacting with an object. Although this is a minor nuisance, the lost time adds up over the course of the game			"

It has been a long time since I have found a decent and fun game that connects me to those enjoyable games from my childhood.  Well worth the buy and playthrough.  The only thing it lacks is a decent amount of challenge.  The most challenging thing about this game is trying to find everything you need which is not as exciting as it could be.			"

												One of the funniest adventure titles I've played in a good while. So many great  pop-culture references from various movies, books and video games. The humour itself reminded me a lot of the good old Lucasarts era, which made me want to replay the old Monkey Island games again.  Voice acting was very good, with lots of interesting characters and a decent story that borrows everything from Lord of the Rings to Star Wars. The length was fairly long for being an adventure game, and it gave me nearly 20 hours of entertainment. But I must admit the ending felt a little rushed and it should have used some more explaining, polish and freshening up. It's sad to see how unappreciated these games are now a days, but they are slowly making their way back. Germany has been making a lot of great adventure titles lately, and they've really become the new adventure kings. Like they hinted in the ending, hopefully we will see a sequel sometime in the future.			"

												I bought this game  after reading some reviews which were mostly positive and I am so glad that I did.I have been playing the game  since I bought it and even though I bought it on offer I would have paid full price and not been disappointed.I bought the entire series offer and I am still enjoying the the first edition The Book of Unwritten tales so lots to look forward too when I get there!All I can say really is the story is engaging, the art work is beautiful, the unique way in which you play a number of characters to me is different and they also help each other out which takes a new perspective on things I have never been bored once.I have played about 14 hrs so far over the time I have owned it and thought I may have played enough now to write a review.I was a bit worried initally because it was point and click and wether it would be too old fashioned but no way is it! The puzzles are sometimes perplexing but you always get there in the end.The humour  is also a winner for me  very tongue in cheek and if you have played other famous games you will recognise all the jokes .All in all I am very glad to have found this set of games and if you are a fan of this genre then go for it you won't be disappointed.

												As a point-and-click veteran, the puzzles weren't the hardest in the world, but it did require a lot of thinking before I could get a few things figured out. The plot wasn't all that superior either, but humor is, as the norm for most point-and-click games, amazing. I'm probably just easily entertained, but I loved the colorful characters and the world they were in. Clever use of parody and wit was able to make me smile, and that's all it takes to make me love a game..... Yeah I'm starting to think I really am easily entertained. The use of using three different characters in order to proceed was an amazing concept, and I really wished that it continued using that mechanic throughout the whole game. But unfortunately it was only for a short period of time, although a new character, Critter, was introduced later with another ability that I loved. and Critter's pure existence makes me love the game even more. A character that's more intelligent that it seems and speaks in gobbledigook? Sign me up.Conclusion: 8/10Definitely recommended for point-and-click maniacs like myself. Gonna play Critter Chronicles and will eagerly wait for the sequel.			"

The odd ball characters and 4th wall breaking jokes will have you laughing out loud.  Game play is not difficult. The inventory system is simple and easy to use. If you like point and click adventures, you will love this game.			"

												I gotta say this was probably the best point and click game I have ever played.. Not any impossiible to figure out puzzles like .. umm Monkey Island games... but it also did not hold your hand in any way.. like say Back to the Future.. All the references to all the movies and other games were actually well thought out and did make me actually laugh a few times.. I also have the critter chronicles and hope that is done as well but I highly recommend this if you like these types of games and you will like it even more if you are an RPG fan as well.. I definitely will be playing the 2nd one when it comes out..			"

												This is a pretty great point-and-click adventure game.  It's rather long, the puzzles are for the most part reasonably straightforward (I didn't do too much random-clicking-to-see-what-happens), and the humor is often extremely well-done.  The voice acting is also top-notch, which is a nice feature.There's a few annoying technical issues if you're on Linux.  For one, the ""Settings"" menu crashes the game unless you manually swap out one of the game's bundled libraries.  For another, I couldn't find a way to set a windowed mode, or consistently set a windowed resolution, without hex-editing the main binary.  (Editing the generated config files in ~/.bout achieved nothing for me.)Additionally, anyone who's concerned about the representation of women in video games nowadays will find plenty to complain about in this title.Still, the good parts far outweigh the bad, and IMO the world could use more adventure games of this caliber.  I'd certainly recommend it to any fan of the genre!			"

												Just completed the game...its 3.30 in the morning...couldn't stop playing...lots of fun. Well thought out puzzles, a little difficult in places but not overly so. Well designed story, interesting characters. With a good splice of humour and cultural references galore. It felt like a labour of love from people who love adventure games. Which is kinda what i want from a these sorts of games. To top it off though, it plays nicely, looks good and has some amusing voice acting. My grumbles though come in the form of the animation cycles. You can get stuck in them and have to wait for it to finish and when you switch between chars you have to wait for the character you were using to move into their waiting spot before you gain control of the next one. but this problem was few and far between. I experienced one game breaking bug, which basically happened when i tried to put wilbur and nate into the same doorway. they both kinda locked up. Other then that, no issues.			"

												I really like point and click games, and so far I'm enjoying The Book of Unwritten Tales because it's a pretty game, the storyline is interesting and the characters are adorable. I play it to relax at the end of the day. The only thing that I didn't like in the beginning was that you have to explore the item before you can grab it, and sometimes it got a little bit annoying, but I'm used to that right now. It's a game I'd recommend for someone who likes point and click, wants to relax and enjoy a nice story :)EDIT: Now that I've finished the game I can give a proper review. I liked the pace of the story, the ending was fun, but what really annoyed me were the bugs. I had to download a file of the game's saves and constantly use them to keep being able to play, otherwise I'd be stuck. Sometimes I even stopped playing because I didn't want to close the game, search for the file and go back again. I really hope they fixed those issues on The Book of Unwritten Tales II.			"

												Definitely had a lot more story and gameplay than I was expecting. The only real annoying bits were the inability to run and missing little details hidden away that required pressing spacebar to find. Oh, and those evil fellows in the caves who bring you back to the start repeatedly. For walking slowly through that whole place is maddening, especially when one apparently has overlooked the existence of an entire small cavern tucked away just out of sight. Looking everywhere is key.After looking through the illustrations in the credits as well, I feel as though I would have loved the gameplay much more if it had left in that form. It looks much better than the 3D format.			"

												When I boght a game, I didnt know much about it and didnt have high (any) expetations. Main reason why i bought it was becasue it is an adventure which as genre i enjoy playing. Quick scope on rewievs (both personal and profesional (ie gaming magazines) was indicatiing highly quality game. After finishing it, shortest description of it would be like trying a most trendy, hip cocktail in town which everybody is driniking and telling you that its amazing, but you just have a sour taste in your mouth after trying it. Now, game is not bad, its just.... in the middle. Game is dancing on the line between comedy / parody of fantasy RPG genre and the story of heroes who are saving a world. Comedy / parody part really didnt work for me. Jokes are way too cliche and outdated to be intresting or fun. Majority of jokes are directed to mocking WoW which I see as plain laziness of authors. Few jokes would fit better (maybe) but when majority of it is in that direction, it just dont cut it. Most fun part for me was sarcastic personality of Captain Nate which is present in his conversatons. Ivo has her moments too in that light. Since parody goes deeply into game, its hard to take story anyhow seriosuly which by itself look unfinished or full of holes (if its intented to be done in the way how it was). Shortest summray of story would be: heroes are on the mission to hide already hidden artifact even from themself. Yes, i know how it sound and thats how it feels when you finish the game. In the end, it doesnt feel like there is any big or inspiring story, just a bunch of lined side quests. Puzzles are pretty simplistic and not presenting any singnificant challenge,   In the end, game is not bad and for players who didnt play much or at all adventure games, it is a a very decent introducton to a genre. For a veterans, it is an easy, relaxing piece. I dont regret buying (and playing ) TBoUT but I dont think that I would miss much if i didnt.			"

												Wow, how have I not played this until now? Not sure if it's referred to as a ""cult classic"" but it should be! I haven't got one single bad thing to say about this. The puzzles were not obtuse, nor did they require random clicking to get the stars to align (levers all up/all lights green etc - there is one green light thingy, but it does make sense, I promise!). Well it's not random in most games I guess, but most of the time you can solve them by bowing to the gods of RNG. Anyway, yes, the puzzles. Lovely. Also, unlike Daedalic, they help you by keeping your area of investigation quite small, so you can focus on the task at hand, and not wander lost in 10 different areas. You can enable visible hotspots which is nice. Best part is, if you look at them and they're not usable, they'll disappear. No clutter! :) And ohhh, the humor! You have zombie love, time travelling, LOTR references, RPG references (dating back to the text-based ones even), making fun of the ridiculous music puzzles we've all experienced and so much more! (like vegetarian dragons, which are always a nice touch)Characters are all nice, and the good news is you'll play 4 of them! Voice acting is amazing, artwork is beautiful - you'll love MacGuffin's house in the woods!  This is a MUST - and it won't be even a tiny bit frustrating, which is so rare in adventure games.			"

												As a point-and-click veteran, the puzzles weren't the hardest in the world, but it did require a lot of thinking before I could get a few things figured out. The plot wasn't all that superior either, but humor is, as the norm for most point-and-click games, amazing. I'm probably just easily entertained, but I loved the colorful characters and the world they were in. Clever use of parody and wit was able to make me smile, and that's all it takes to make me love a game..... Yeah I'm starting to think I really am easily entertained. The use of using three different characters in order to proceed was an amazing concept, and I really wished that it continued using that mechanic throughout the whole game. But unfortunately it was only for a short period of time, although a new character, Critter, was introduced later with another ability that I loved. and Critter's pure existence makes me love the game even more. A character that's more intelligent that it seems and speaks in gobbledigook? Sign me up.Conclusion: 8/10Definitely recommended for point-and-click maniacs like myself. Gonna play Critter Chronicles and will eagerly wait for the sequel.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales - a very amusing and beautiful game, especially if the gamer loves roleplay games and movies.In the beginning the player gets to know all important characters and is able to get to know some background stories of them. It's not important for the storyline but for me it's a fact that shows that the developers had fun creating the game and really thought about the whole story - not only the key-elements. Moreover the characters really show some personality and mostly are really likeable it's funny to see how they react in different situations. Besides the game is able to appear beautiful and very well constructed, it does not take itself serios. There are a lot of, to my mind, really funny jokes - about roleplay games, movies and even about the game itself. These jokes are able to remind the player that he's just playing a game by refering to real life situations. Furthermore the game criticises the whole fantasy world by showing off that the people inside the game try to flee from it but by giving that detail the criticism of the fantasy world turns out to be a criticism of our world or how we try to escape from it. The developers did not care for hiding references, they pointed them out shamelessly and obviously, what for me turned out to be even funnier - you might find some Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars and even Mission Impossible in it. By being that honest about how made up the world is the player does not even care about the lack of logic in that world. It's easy to accept that everything can be explained with magic, what makes the whole game chilly so that the player is able to fully enjoy that world. In conclusion the game is able to transfer some valueable lessons, while it does not take itself serious and gives a whole lot of funny jokes.The graphics of the game, also are really beautiful. It's a smoothe and colorful style and the world is designed really amazing and rich on details. During the journey the player can see a whole lot of different regions, like ice regions or elvenforests and all of them are designed in the same lovely way. Despite that really nice graphics the game still contains some difficulties - for example the walking animations sometimes mess up and let the characters float above the ground and the cutscenes look a bit trashy and very pixely (maybe that was because my settings but I think I had them at highest). I played the german version because I did not know how to switch languages and it turned out that for the german version the synchronisation is not well made. But these facts don't make the game less amazing.Some people complained that the riddles do not make any sense and force the player to do stupid things but in my opinion that's not true. If you play point and click adventures you'll always have some creative riddles, therefore you just have to be a little bit creative. Most of the riddles in that game are easy and not weird at all and the ones that are, are apologized by the game itself. Right from the beginning it points out that it won't make much sense. And even if the player has a lack of creativity it's still possible to solve that riddles by try and error or pushing the space button to see if there's something more. I know point and click adventures (e.g. The Whispered World) who are much more challenging and give riddles which really let you make stupid things. The Book of Unwritten Tales is one of the easier point and click adventures and follows a strict line, thus it's hard to really get stuck. All in all The Book of Unwritten Tales is a very beautiful and funny game, which is able to show you a world full of magic and magical creatures and after all it is not far from our own world. It gives you really nice characters and a story so full of cliché that it's hilarious. The animations and synchro are not great at all but that does not necessarily do any harm to the game. It took me about 2 hours less than promised but I think it's worth using 18 hours of lifetime to be amused by the game. "

												I love this game. The puzzles aren't as crazily difficult like the Deponia series but are solvable by using simple intuition and the Spacebar. I enjoy solving the puzzles but they are more of a ""If you can't do this, keep clicking on any other available spot""PROS1. Good GraphicsThe 3D is a step up from the cartoonish drawings of the Deponia Series.2. Interesting WorldTransport Dragons, Mummies, Elves, Gnomes, Orcs, Mages and Death himself.3. Good TitleBook of Unwritten Tales. Very catchy.4. Weird IdeasUsing a Telephone Booth (aka Tardis concept) to teleport? Interesting.CONS1. LinearityThere is really only 1 way to solve a puzzle and your choices don't really matter at all. You are just solving one puzzle to get to the next.2. Dead WorldYou can't interact with anything except what the developers want you to interact with. There is nothing that you can interact with for fun.3. Colour IssuesWhen you make a potion, purple is not pink.4. Number of StirsHow do you count 3 stirs clockwise? Why is not stirring considered a foul?5. Abrupt EndingThe ending was so easy and abrupt.SUGGESTIONS1. Removing the LinearityI would suggest referring to the Witcher series for examples on how to use multiple ways to solve one issue. Or the Osbourne kids' books.2. The Mighty Card GameIt would have been great to have a real Mighty card game within this game.			"

It doesn't have the MOST convoluted, highly unlikely plot in a game, but who cares, this game is really funny and I just loved it. The graphic style really plays in with the fairly lack of seriousness. The sound ... uhm ... was nice ... I guess. Voice acting was good. Anyway, this game really made me want to figure stuff out on my own and some things were fairly logical to figure out, but I did have to refer to a guide a number of times as I also generally suck at these games and can almost never do something exactly how it needs to go.

It's a great game to relax to with a good sense of humor.The puzzles are overall easy to figure out and most of the time it's not the lust for solving puzzles that keeps you going, but the urge to see and hear how the character react when they interact with objects and other characters and also to see where the crazy story takes you next.I highly recommend this game. I'm currently replaying it after a few years and it still delivers!Well worth the money.			"

												The Book Of Unwritten Tales is a very nice and fun adventure to play! The story is about the classic fantasy cliche about an ancient and powerful artifact, and the mission to recover it and save the world. You'll guide 4 main characters, sometimes together, sometimes alone. The puzzles, all mainly based around collected objects, are not difficult at all, and the ending is a bit rushed out, but all the rest represents a great tribute to classic adventure games of the past, from Monkey Island to Legend of Kyrandia, from Day of the Tentacle to King's Quest.Graphics and art are really beautiful, locations come to life and are very well characterized. There's a subtle but well played soundtrack and voice recording just nailed perfectly each character. Humor comes out from every single line of text, there are also a lot of fun quotes from mainstream games and movies, like The Lord of The Rings and Mission Impossible.It's thanks to small but passionate developers like King Art, but I also think to Daedalic and Wadjet Eye, that we're still able to play adventure games like this one nowadays. Playing TBoUT was like returning back to mid '90s, and I surely hope to see more adventure developers to take the risk and the challenge to reinvent and innovate the genre, keeping the good from the past. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to try this game's prequel, The Critter Chronicles, but even more its true sequel, the just released second chapter, which from what I read is going to be even more good!

												IT - IS - A - CHAIR. Honest!Okay, whatever. It's a horse.This game is simple, yet elegant. Interesting story, logical and working puzzles, fantastic humour with tons of good references. The artwork is clean and nice, so you don't get lost in the détails.For me, it is a 90+ (on a scale of 100) masterpiece. If you like adventure games, this is a must to play it game. If you don't like adventure games, try this, there's a good chance you'll like them after The Book of Unwritten Tales.			"

I been playing these kind of games since 1990.Kyrandia, Goblins, Day of the Tenticle, The Neverhood, Space Quest so forth, I know most of them.This game is a great parody to the genre and mixes it up with a lot of jokes from fantasy genre games like WoW and other clasic fantasy games.If you like any of the former then stop reading and buy the game already.Its worth every cent !!

And there's a guitar hero style reflex-based section that ALL ADVENTURE GAMERS HATE, that you can't bypass in any way, and is essential for progression.  I stopped playing, because it was so infuriating.  Not worth it for our style of gaming.  Terrible.  It's a shame, because the story was pretty good up to that point.			"

												Some of the dialog in this game is quite amusing, but that's about the only thing it has going for it. Story is dumb, graphics are alright but animation is klunky. I think more than half the puzzles take the form of ""person wants to trade item A for item B"" sequences, and alot of it's very nonsensical. I guess if you play adventure games by just randomly clicking items until something works, then this one might be good for a few cheap laughs, but it's not what I was hoping for.			"

												One of the most important things about making jokes is timing, in particular when it comes to breaking the fourth wall. Break it too often, the wall will eventually crumble, and the mechanic stops being funny.Unfortunately BOUT suffer from this problem. The forth wall is a particular important wall when it comes to maintaining the game's universe as a credible world different from the world of the player. Because the fourth wall is so utterly destroyed by the game itself, immersion into the game universe becomes impossible. This leads to a reduction in the experience, so the game becomes what a classic P&C game is at the mechanical core. A string of puzzles where certain objects must be combined in the right order to progress the story.In good P&C games, the attention of the player is directed away from the core puzzle mechanic by an engaging story, and immersive environment.Immersion is very often what makes the story believable and engaging, and because immersion is destroyed in BOUT, the story seems generally weak, and the mechanics of the strung together puzzles comes to the forefront. That it is just a puzzle game is not hidden behind the immersive story.One of the most important things about a P&C is that you can trust the characters ad the game when it comes to the hints and help it offers when trying to solve a particular puzzle. The game should never give you information that is misleading. It can keep information from you, but shouldn't make the player feel cheated or lied to. BOUT has a couple of these instances, but generally the puzzles are logical and reasonable.It has been claimed that the female elf is needlessly sexualized in BOUT. To that I have to ask: have you seen her move? Just because she wears very little clothing, doesn't mean that she is sexualized, or presented as a mere sexual being, with no other purpose than being visual stimulation for the male gaze. To this male gazer, there is very little sexual about her.It has a few graphical glitches, but nothing game breaking in my playthrough.As long as you treat BOUT as primarily a puzzler, and less a P&C with a story, you'll have a few good hours of entertainment. As a P&C adventure, I can't recommend the game. As a puzzler with commentary, it's quite good. Not a difficult puzzler, but good for relaxed playing with a smile or laugh here and there.			"

												It was good. The puzzles were on the easy side, but it was a long game. So, there's a lot of actual content and not just a ton of time clicking on everything frantically trying to make progress. It took 14 hours to finish. The story is kind of a parody of classical fantasy tropes, but the actual story itself is very worn territory.  The last chapter of the game was a real neat twist and I thought it was very well done. The humor is very good at times, but completely and utterly fails at others. The characters are ok, the voice acting isn't anything special. The graphics were nicely done. However, the animations of moving objects was poorly done and at times my video card was using more than a gig of vram for not very ambitious rendering. Overall, I had a fun time playing it and I do recommend.			"

The puzzles solving never holds your hand but never get to a point where you get so frustrated that you put down the game. There were about 2 or 3 puzzles that were a bit annoying, for example: having to follow directions to make a potion and having to start over if you fail. All in all, this is a great game to relax to and enjoy the story. Great if you have or regularly have kids come to visit.8/10			"

												A superb iteration of the point-and-click genre. With enough refrences to pop culture to throw a stick at, The Book Of Unwritten Tales comes off as a clever, well designed, thorough attempt at a marvelous fantasy adventure. Some of the puzzles take real thought, but it won't ever come to a point of irritating displeasure. There were a few times when a cutscene would bug and I would have to restart the game and trudge through some activities again due to a late autosave. With that aside, if you're looking for a somewhat challenging yet peaceful change of pace from FPS's and the like, then look no further, The Book of Unwritten Tales has you covered.			"

												Despite an impressive production and jokes that actually put a smile on my face, most of the game dragged on due to slow unskippable walking. 90% of playing time is spent watching your character walk. That and countless tedious ""3 tasks"" quests around a shallow story almost made me quit, and I played on out of stubbornness, already decided on a negative review. Fortunately, the game picked up quite a bit in the last chapter, and I'm left with slightly more reasons to recommend it than not, so a close-call thumbs-up here.Pros:- Great art, great music, great dialogue writing, great voice acting.- The jokes and references are really well done.- Last 20% is better than the rest.Cons:- Character movement is painfully slow! Any walking sequence becomes an unskippable maddening slow drag.- Not too much of a story.- Too many tedious ""complete 3 tasks"" puzzle quests.- Too many linear dependencies where the solution is to try something again that wasn't working before.- No way to pause the many long cutscenes and conversation sequences. Really sucks if you're interrupted.			"

			An amusing way to assassinate the clock, worth the price of admission, if you like this sort of game. Of course, the stuff in the video is merely my opinion. I could be wrong, but I don't think so.

												A friend who's also into adventure games recommended this to me, and I've gotta say, I was sorely disappointed.  In an adventure game, I look for fun dialogue, interesting puzzles, and a satisfying story arc--and unfortunately, each of these was missing in this instance.  The dialogue was uninspired, the puzzles were facile, and I actually didn't understand the ending until I read about it afterwards.  Thing suddenly sort of 'stop', with little to no explanation, and zero resolution for each character's story line.  It also drove me crazy how slow the characters moved about on the screen--and that time spent in the mines, my god, it was excruciatingly boring.  Would not recommend.			"

												One of the best (if not the best) point & click adventure games since the Monkey Island series. Accompany Wilbur Weathervane, Nate, Ivo and ""The Critter"" on their quest to save the world.+ Great story with many different locations+ Loveable (and zany) characters+ Wonderful humour+ Puzzles are mostly logical, some require the use of all characters to solve+ Long playtime for this genre (took me about 20 hours to complete)- 3D character models can seem a bit ""stiff""- English voice actors can't hold a candle to the original german ones (the translation itself is good, though)Note: Steam shows a very low playtime since I originally played through the retail copy long before the Steam version was available.

												With my coordination issues, I can't finish the game.If you have coordination issues, or rsi, or both, I doubt you will be able to either.I enjoyed the first parts of the story, but now I am supposed to mix a potion, and it requires perfect timing, and perfect coordination, and a lot of awkward circular mouse-movement. I can't reach the later parts.			"

												It's too blunt for my taste in its desperate attempts to live up to its role models, the legendary Lucasfilm adventures. I hardly made it over the first some puzzles, as the cheese hit me pretty hard: When a bullwhip was introduced rather heavy-handed, the elf girl comments the use of it with a whistling of the Indiana Jones theme. This fanservice was very telegraphed and as the game wasn't too impressive yet, i didn't want to go on.For Lucasfilm-style Adventure-Fans, this is a nice game. For anybody expecting stories and dialogs mature enough to stand on its own feet, this is a little hard to swallow.			"

												If you are looking for a blast from the past, with newer graphics, and AMAZING humor and voice acting look no futher. The Book of unwritten Tales, has everything, it is an old school point and click like back in the days, only with good voice acting and loads of good humor. I have been looking for a good point and click adventure game for a long time now and nothing has real caught my eye, but after watching the trailer for this game, and one of the funny scenes in the game I was sold. Played an hour or so of this game and allready laughed alot. The story is good. There are memorable characters and do I really have to say it again? This game has got loads of humor. Of course this game is not for everybody. If you do not enjoy point and click adventure games, you will probally not like this game. BUT! If you are a fan of the old school point and click adventure games, full of good humor and a gripping story, well then look no further.THIS GAME WILL BE WORTH YOUR TIME.			"

												Fun and hilarious at times and tedious and  frustrating in other instances, this game gets a mixed review from me. If you are an older school gamer who grew up with classic point-and-click adventure titles and enjoyed the genre then this is the game for you. If you're looking for a serious game or looking for blood-and-guts action then this would not be for you. The game is warm with rough edges, mixing satire and sarcasm with colorful fantasy settings. Family friendly for the most part, but most kids would probably not get much of the satire aimed at old-school gamers. Fun while you have it figured out, but I have spent quite a bit of time fruitlessly searching for the solution to a puzzle. I may just be stupid and you will have a beter go at it. Acquired taste for sure.			"

												Point n Click galore! If you're into adventure games and especially into fantasy ones this should be a no-brainer. One of the most enjoyabe i have ever played too. The difficulty though is fairly low so if you're lokking for an adventure game that will get your brain boiling and challenging your patience's limits better look elsewhere, but it was not where the developers focused as i saw. It's focus was exactly as it's title implies: telling a tale you cound find in a fantasy book. The backgrounds look amazing and the dialogues are it's selling point. The voice acting are one of the best i have ever witnessed. The voices fit perfecly on the characters. Even for those not particularly into andenture games give it a shot, the trip is fun and highly enjoyable.			"

												This is a fun, light-hearted, full-length adventure game.  It's also very accessible to people foreign to the genre since it clears ""hotspots"" after they've been used or no long have any impact and never puts the player in an unwinnable situation.Visuals are very impressive at times.  Most puzzles are logical enough, though sometimes they're hamstrung by the problem of knowing what to do to solve them, but you need to talk to a NPC first to actually start solving them.  There's also a terrible stealth section in this game.  Why would you do this in an adventure game?  The playable characters are fun enough save for Nate, who is just boorish and annoying.  Most NPC's are fun to interact with.Game is around 12-14 hours long, though I thought it started to drag in the last couple of hours and I was ready for it be over by the time it wrapped up.  One other thing, some people react in abject horror when games break the 4th wall or use humor that references other games, movies, fiction, etc.  If you are one of these people, stay away, this game pokes fun at this sort of thing quite often.  It didn't bother me as the game is consistently pleasant and light-hearted in nature.In short, fun adventure game that is accessible to new players.			"

												7 hours in and a mini game that cant be done unless you have good hand control. This game is old and had this problem from the start. You could send your save game in to get it solved but alas seems no more. How can they sell a game they know is broken, without a patch. Sadly ruined an otherwise excellant adventure.11 hours in next chapter another known bug but alas once again you could send your save game in for a fix. Or as it stands now its game over there is no cure for this one. Maybe a patch here if your going to keep selling it.			"

												This is a great point and click RPG.   It includes lots of humourous references to the ""real world"" inside the game's magical world.  The dialogue is also really good especially some of the over-the-top lines.  It's a nice relaxing game to play except for one little timed part, where you have to do a sort of rain-dance.  If you get stuck on that it can be frustrating, but you can just google that and there are ways around that tiny little part of the game.			"

												 If you're a fan of the Point-And-Click adventure genre, Or even if you're not this game might be for you! The setting and game is chock full of humor. The fantasy genre, MMOs, Fiction and all manner of things get deliciously skewered in the story. Unlike other such games however, This game reards the observant. All the puzzles and interactions aren't too hard to figure out for the most part, But looking at things around you or in your inventory or talking to a person near you always reveals even a subtle hint as to what to do next, And if truly stuck one can hold SPACE at any time to see what interactive spots are near you at any time. For an indie offring, This is a game both beautiful and functional. At the very least, IT will provide a fun story!			"

My one play-through was a few months ago, so I only remember little, but what I do remember is that I did enjoy playing this point&click adventure enough for a firm thumbs-up.The riddles mostly make sense, so you'll rarely be stuck wondering WTF you're expected to do.You play several different characters, so be ready for that - it's not an ""I, the protagonist."" game.https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=9790 says 13-15 hours which is correct I guess.

												It is ok. The Book of Unwritten Tales in a classic point&click adventure with all the problems which comes with the genre. Usually, the story and writing are the strong points of point&clicks and here the game falls short. It is sort of a comedy/parody game making fun of popular fantasy-themed stuff - Tolien, Discworld, WoW etc. The game is quite charming but it often mistakes reference with parody and braking 4th wall with a joke. For every good line there are 10 dull ones.If you are starving for a p&c it is decent enough, but otherwise you can give it a pass.			"

												Well, what's there to say. It's a point&click adventure alright, but it's genuinely fun, fully voice acted, has very few stupid minigames and a reasonably pretty world.You get to meet interesting characters, and the game makes fun about a lot of stuff you find in fantasy-themed games without being ridiculous or stupid (in fact, they even named the old gremlin who set all of this in motion ""MacGuffin""). Expect some real laughs from it.The puzzles are not overly complex, although I seemed to have missed a detail occasionally so I kept wandering around until I noticed. Never asked daddy Google, though.Occasionally it drags on a bit since retrying stuff often involves going through some cutscene-ish scenes as well, or simply because you don't exactly know what to do next and walking through places just takes time. The rest of the game more than makes up for that, though.You also get to play a total of 4 characters, usually on their own, but sometimes you get several of them in a scene and you can (and have to) switch between them. Switching takes a bit of time too, as they walk to some neutral position before actually switching, but you get used to it. It's not like you have to perform time critical action feats.Of course, all of these (and the non-player characters as well) come with their own personality.In general, I'm not a point&click expert, but I can definitely recommend this. In my opinion, a few minor shortcomings pale in comparison to the characters, story telling and humor -- and puzzles that don't feel contrived.			"

												As far as point and click adventure games go, it is alright. Solutions to puzzles are never contrived and there is no insta-death. Where The Book of Unwritten Tales falls flat is the tale itself. It is incredibly self-aware, and never squanders an opportunity to remind you. There is also a lack of context. There is supposedly a big war going on, but no effects are ever shown. We are just constantly reminded of it. The characters you play as are rather bland and one-dimentional and only serve to add get item and give item mechanic at certain points in plot. The climax of the story felt rushed and was very unfulfilling, what with obtaining the catalyst for the endgame offscreen.			"

												ok, during the first few hours, this game was GREAT!  very recommended!  fun, interesting puzzles, a bit of pop-culture references, etc.but then, it was the same thing.  over and over again.  jump through hoops.  know what to do ahead of time?  sorry, can't do it until you click on something or talk to someone and only THEN can you do it.  know how to do something simple?  nope, you have to do it the complicated way.  want to switch characters?  ok, but first you have to wait for the first guy to slowly walk to his ""rest"" spot and then wait for the other character to move to his ""play"" spot.and near the end, the activities got SO TEDIOUS, and SO REPETITIVE, and SO MUNDANE, that i just resorted to cheats to get through it to the end.it reminded me in many parts to an old game called Nibiru (2005).  i hated it, it was WAY too structured and made you feel like an untrained dog being trained to sit.if you have children around, close the door because you WILL swear a lot.  or just let them play it.  they may not find it too pedantic.

												This game was pretty fun, but relied so heavily on adventure tropes for humour that it kind of got old fast. If you are a chronic WOW player, this game is for you for the in-game jokes alone. However, Sierra and LucasArts fans will get an occassional smile as well.It was pretty, and the voice acting/scripts were great, but I didn't feel particularly drawn to any of the main characters. Difficult to be sympathetic to 3 drastically different main characters within such a short story. Interesting twists on classics, but nothing to really write home about. 7/10.			"

												I would very much have liked to have played this, but ended up getting a refund because it just didn't work on my system.  Every other game that I've purchased from Steam has run flawlessly on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit system.  This one just wouldn't do it.  I Googled like crazy looking for reports of how to deal with the problems I was having - even found someonething posted by the developers on the  King Arts website about making a change to one of the config files.  Unfortunately, all  that did was get me past the black screen and into the screen with the book - regretably nothing happened from there.  I'd click on the book, it would open, there'd be no menu, and I would have to Alt-F4 out because at that point the game stopped responding altogether.For those of you (in the majority) who can run this game, if you're a fan of the Adventure Game genre, what I've seen in the trailers looks fabulous and I encourage you to give it a shot.As of writing this, I've just started The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and thankfully, it's running fine. :-)			"

												Unfortunately shared that old trait of adventure games where you end up stuck because of not waving your pointer over some barely visable object that you need to pick up/interact with but otherwise the very 'old school' point-and-click gameplay worked very well.   Good mix of references and homages to geek culture and old generation adventure games.   The female protagonist is needlessly sexualised, which was a bit patronising given that most of the people who will get the references are probably in their late twenties by now. :o/   In fact, gender portrayals were somewhat worse than the old Monkey Island and Indiana Jones adventure films, which is rather odd. :o/[It's been pointed out to me that using the spacebar will reveal interactable items, which removes the furstrating 'hidden object' experienece that I had]			"

												At first look, this game brought back alot of memories from the good ol' Monkey Island, Goblins and Loom days. The game has a lot of references and not only from Amiga's best Adventure hits, but also various pop-cultural hits from Hollywood and even the music industry. Star wars among others.The voice acting and characters is well-put-together and the jokes, even though they are cheesy at some times are decent and funny.However, after completing the game - only using around 10 hours, I find myself fairly entertained, but in no way or format challenged. The in-game puzzles were way too easy, and despite of that the implementation of the ""space-bar-helper"" basically makes this game playable for 3-year olds, which is not in the spirit of Adventure games.They are supposed to be challenging, with puzzles that makes you scratch your head for hours.. Not only press the spacebar and get it over with.So would I recommend this game? If you're looking for a nostalgia-trip down memory lane, combined with 10-12 hours of fairly decent fun and not too hard puzzles, this is your game.If you however, like me, enjoys to get challenged with proper puzzles/riddles - there are better and more challenging games out there.

												5/10Pros:Interesting worldFunny jokesGood voice actingCons:Horrible storyBoring characterseasy gameplayAwful ending (How could anyone defend it?! )Very frustratingly slow gameplayvisuals are mediocremusic is mediocreAt first the game seems to be set in a world full of ogres, gnomes, elves, mages and warriors and it is set in war, but the story ignores all of the wonderful setting and forces you to go through generic caves, generic towns, generic lava levels and generic everything. Boring boring boringThe gameplay is so slow, moving from one place to another takes so much time, switching characters is even worse! It's like having a 2 second loading screen every 10 seconds.The only interesting character is the gnome, everyone else has no lore or character development, I forgot all of them by the end of the game.This game had the worst ending I have ever seen. Wow... Imagine playing a videogame, that was builing up to a huge fight against a villian, and just before you face the villian, you get a 5 second cutscene were a secondary character does the work for you. Actually you don't have to imagine that, you can just play this game.The Book of Unwritten Tales is not worth your time unless you are a hardcore point and click fanatic. Just play something better instead.			"

												First off, I  want to mention that I finished this game. Being a game that can last up to 20 hours the majority of my time was offline.                  Hark back to the days of adventure, by clicking on random pixels, picking up items, and combining items in random or ""logical"" ways in hopes of finding your way through the adventure. This game is a throwback. A ""Point and Click"" adventure game. While there have been many since the days of Monkey Island, and even in recent years, this is probably one of the best since Monkey Island.                   You take the role of a young gnome named Wilbur who yearns for adventure and hopes to remove himself from his menial life, the beautiful elf Ivo who just so happened to be in the right place at the right time, and a wise-cracking cocky human with a peculiar past named Nate. Nate on the run from a bounty hunter has a furry sidekick called ""Critter"" whom speaks nothing but nonesense (familiar?).                  Spoilers:  The adventure begins with a ring...among the backdrop of a war between the Alliance (gnome, dwarf, human...) and an army of orcs.                   I'll stop my spoilers there. It should sound familiar to you. This game is humurous, using obvious references to help out its humor, but it doesn't over do it. A wonderously funny game in its own right, It doesn't bash nor does it even spoof what it references. It's good natured ribbing over the typical Toklien-esque fantasy world, and certain games and films we've all come to know through the years, but again it doesn't over do it.  It brings up some good points about gaming in general though, mainly directed at the MMORPG when Wilbur asks ""Why would people feel the need to leave their real-life to play a fictitious life...."" That's not a direct quote, but it was along the same lines. Most likely done in jest,  to me it still brings up a good question about our hobby.                    The art style is superb. Bright colors and details abound, and I caught myself wishing there was a 3D space to it, to be able to explore more deeply than you're able in the game. The dialogue is also detailed. Click on certain items on-screen, and you'll get a simple explanation of it, but enough that it may give you a nice background and history of the world. Even minor points of interest, and minor characters have some history and background to them. In summary, this is just a nice game with lots of spirit. Beautiful artwork, clever dialogue, and never a time of frustration, it deserves your attention. I've been gaming since I was a kid,  this is one of my favorites.                     P.S. Soapbox time: As for Wilbur's question, we all have our reasons to ""game."" I've been lucky enough to travel and have real life adventures in this world. I SEEK it out. What motivated me to do all that? Playing games as a child. The fantasy and the worlds I got sucked into, it motivated me to find it in real life. Hope you all seek your adventures just the same.

												I want to love this title, but the experience falters a bit for me.  The graphics are quite beautiful, and unlike most point n click adventures, the environs are 3d, although you still interact in a 2d fashion. You won't buld too large of an inventory, like most modern games (i miss the massive inventories with tons of possibilities!), and most of the puzzles include talking. A lot of talking.  You talk, you look around, you use some items, then you talk some more, look around, then realize the only way to move forward is to talk yet again.  This is a common mechanic in most p&c games, but this game uses it far too often. The voice acting is fine, but unlike, say, a Walking Dead, where the expressions and gesticulations of the characters can actually bring you to tears, these characters are quite stale in their emotes. You will watch a back & forth convo carry on for minutes, with no more animation than a slight swaying or breathing; nothing indicating the feeling of what they are saying. The game really suffers under the weight of this, and I find it hard to move forward knowing that too much of the time I will be listening and not ""doing.""  Dialogue is mostly skippable, but at the same time I hate to skip through and miss things.  Some of the dialogue is really funny, with lots of WoW style outside references to pop culture-ish RPG staples (and the in-game mmo is hilarious).  Aside from being to reliant on lengthy dialogue, the puzzles are good stuff, except some are a bit too obvious when they give you hints with each item that might be applicable, and when you actually do get stuck, there is no help to be found within the game. Also, I'm not sure I like the fact that most environment items can only be examined once, after that they aren't clickable. So they are too easily excluded, and also, if you miss hearing what they said about them, that's it, you won't hear it again.  Bit odd that in 16/9 there are black lines on the screen, even though cursor moves over them. but in 1680/1050 it just looks like fullscreen. is this true resolution support? no big, but odd. Otherwise, interface, saves and other elements are all good.  All in all, a good game, that gets bogged down in it's heavy reliance on dialogue and it's inexplicable lack of luster in that area. I might redo this reco because I havent finished the game and kind of wrote this spur of the moment but i just fetl like it :p			"

												A point and click adventure game that failed to learn anything from previous incarnations within the genre.  Pick up everything you see, rub it on everything else you see, eventually progress -- the gameplay mechanic is as old as computing itself.  Typically what really keeps a player interested in an adventure game is the plot, diaglogue, and humor.  Unfortunately the writing in this game is pretty awful.  Just one fourth-wall-breaking self-referential joke after another.  There is absolutely nothing remarkable about this game except perhaps how incredibly unremarkable it is.  It's a shame the plot itself did not remain an unwritten tale.Can't say I'd recommend it.			"

												I LOVE point and click adventures, I always have. I love the originals like Space Quest, Police Quest, the Indiana Jones series, etc.  But this one...I don't know, it's kind of boring. I've played for several hours hoping it would pick up but so far I could really stop playing the game all together and not miss it. (Although my OCD will probably get the best of me, and I will finish it)The game does have some nerdy references in it that made me chuckle, but story and gameplay are kind of childish. I'm guessing that's part of the humor, but it still leaves me yawning. If it's on a steam flash sale for $5 or less, go for it just to try for yourself, otherwise, check out Jack Keane, Machinarium, or the remastered Monkey Island games instead.			"

												This game falls just short of the mark. The story is moderately compelling when it's at its best, the abundance of nods to other fantasy influences fall just short of cheeky and clever, the puzzles gravitate to the unrewarding and easy side, and the interface (especially when using more than one character) is quite clunky. Too bland for an adult, too tedious for a child.There are a few redeeming moments where the characters capture a certain level of warmth and whimsy but sadly they don't last. Even the environment, which is often charming, fails in that it really has no clever interactive extra detail that you often find in other such games.			"

												Pretty and polished game, but too short and the humour is too childish for me. There are some references for the mature public too, but it just sounded odd to me due to the rest of the atmosphere. The characters move very slowly too, and that can be annoying sometimes. The voice acting is great though.The game is  either far too easy, or just makes no sense:To distract a monkey, I rarely think ""Eureka, all I need is a jar and a bunch of bettles!""Luckly you don't have too many possibilities to try on, so this is not a showstopper. I've encountered a few glitches (Linux here) but they went away by themselves, so it didn't bother me too much.If you REALLY want this game, I'd recommend waiting for a sale. Its not all that fantastic.PS: There are some references to MMO RPGs in this game that got me a little bit uncomfortable, as I am a big fan of the genre. Devs seem to imply that they are repetitive, meaningless, and alienating, the main character commenting ""...that's the silliest game I've ever heard of"". The critiques go on in the trailer of the sequel of this game too. I don't know if they wanted to criticise a specific MMO or the whole genre, but the later sounds like an utterly equivocated idea.  Not cool.IMPORTANT: 11 people are butthurt because I thumbed down their game. If you don't find this review useful, I'd be happy if you comment below why you think so. Don't be immature.			"

												Initial impression was positive, before the sexism, homophobia and transphobia went off the charts in chapter 4 when you have to play as Captain Nate.Game mechanics: Switching between characters is an exercise in patience as they walk around aimlessly for awhile before hand off. Voice acting is excellent. The character movements are cool (except when switching characters.) Despite Ivo's ridiculous scantily clad girl-elf armor, she's a pretty interesting character, and the brains of the party. Wilbur is reasonably clever too. Many secondary characters are interesting, like the little rat warrior. Storyline is highly engaging, and the puzzles, while sometimes tedious or frustrating in the usual point-and-click manner, are mostly interesting and fun.Further into the game - chapter 4 - you're stuck being Captain Nate. Captain Nate is a jerk. He is such a jerk that I'm having a hard time progressing in the game now that I'm forced to interact through him. Captain Nate objectifies all the women he interacts with. They're just sex objects to him, so I'm a bit bewildered by the ""girl power"" tag associated with this game. He cuts down everyone around him like an insecure school boy. He goes on and on about what it means to be ""a man"" in this archaic, tedious litany of outdated stereotypes ... I'm just so sick of the culture remnants of shaming people who don't fit some stupid cultural concept of ""normal."" This guy is desperate to be ""normal"" where normal is some kind of ignorant, chauvinstic male pig and proving it at every turn. I think it might have been intended as humor? If so, it failed. Badly.There's a character in Captain Nate's sequence who's a pink-clad paladin with high heels on his pink banner. I'm all for flipping paladins♥♥♥♥♥♥as a timeworn gamer tradition, but this was deeply inappropriate. Liking pink doesn't make you weak. Wearing heels doesn't make you weak. Besides the obvious misogyny and sexism of demeaning femme-stereotyped gender stuff, it's also a train wreck of genderqueer shaming and pacificist shaming. I'm so done with this kind of thing in our culture. Teenagers kill themselves over ""humor"" like this. Leelah Alcorn didn't have a chance because of attitudes like this. Stop it. It's shaming and bullying and it's time for us to be better people. I keep trying to get through these scenes with Nate and the pink paladin, hoping that there will be some kind of redemption, but it just keeps not happening, and I'm running out of patience.			"

It also felt inconsistent since a few parts actually were pretty good and other parts were just ""let's get on with it already"".The games graphics is pretty good but it could have been better. I had this feeling while playing that the game wasn't as polished as it could've been and that it could have run much smoother.Certain areas in this game were much more charming and fun to play than the rest and to be honest there weren't that many of them in my opinion.If you absolutely want it I'd recommend getting it on sale for a low price.

Repeated attempts, reading walk thru's, watching video's and generally comparing notes with others who have the same issue have come to naught.

												I managed to play this game for 12 hours before I got frustrated and deleted it.The Book of Unwritten Tales started out promising with a lush and colourful fantasy setting, silly characters and humor. I naturally started waiting when the humor starts really kicking in and that was my first worry about the game; the jokes never quite landed. The game kept that semi-humorous tone the whole 12 hours and there was only one joke that really made me smile. Besides that it felt forced and cliched. Puzzles on the other hand were quite logical and nothing brain-straining but started growing tedious towards the end. Not tedious like in old monkey islands where you simply don't know what to do and the answer is something like ""beam the banana to space and then eat it in the future"" but tedious in a sense of ""visit this another room, go to next one, go back, back again, to the next one, talk to this guy, go to the last room and talk to this random other fellow that never said anything useful before.""My absolutely biggest gripe was the fact that you can visit areas where you find an item that only appears there after the story activates it there. This way you can't momorize what you have seen in rooms since the items appear only when everything's set for it. Characters lack character (lol) and since I can't remember the music it wasn't anything interesting. Overral TBOUT is a pretty point&click game with a very hollow intestines.			"

Nothing really exciting, but it kept me playing.Unfortunately, quite soon the game reveals itself to be a completely uninspired pile of overplayed references.Such a title could keep you hooked by trying to throw some humorous puzzles that are actually fantasy themed.For example you may have to send dragons to eat a shepherd's sheep to please his neighboring farmer, and have the dragon be upset by the sheep bleating and do something unexpected, or have the farmer upset with you because the dragon burned down his barley in the process.. but the game will not give you any of that.Instead you'll have to find a way to take a guardsman's sandwich by beating him at a round of an RPG cards game or make turns around a young tree until the protagonist will finally understand that he should make a wand out of it. Ultimately: not an exiting scenario at all, especially by the time anything gets finally done.As for the playing itself: too many times you have to go back to npc X to realize that a new dialogue option has been enabled or something new can happen in a screen you have already inspected before.Not only this but the (already uninspired) tasks stick around way too much: you solved a puzzle and guess what, you have to solve it again in a different way and again... ...if you're looking for some mix and match puzzles in a funny scenario, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

												Contrary to the big-name reviews, this game is not at all up the standards of the old LucasArts titles, certainly not the stand-outs (Full Throttle, Grim Fandango).  Not worth real money, not even on sale, but it might be okay in a Humble Bundle.  I regret paying $5.  Could have bought a sandwich instead.The writing and voice acting are okay, nothing special.  Sometimes bad, but not quite as bad as the♥♥♥♥♥♥Daedalic deems acceptable.  Dialog can be overlong, jokes tend to hit you over the head.  Kids will probably like it.Gameplay is weak.  You have to click on interactive objects several times before they become usable.  This makes solving puzzles unintuitive as you think you have the solution, you try it, it doesn't work, so you dismiss the possibility.  Turns out you didn't click enough times to get through all the uninteresting things your character has to say about the object in question.Character movement is really slow and there's no way to speed it up.  A run key (or run on double click) would be nice.The hitbox (or whatever you call it) for interactive objects can be too small, so you mouse over an object, see that the cursor didn't change, and assume it's non-interactive.Audio in FMV can be out of sync, and there are no FMV subtitles.On the upside, it's a fairly pretty game, and at least the player characters have something to say about their surroundings (unlike Syberia's generic response to every examined object).  Facial expressions are good and varied.  No other upsides to speak of.  Don't waste your time and money (unless you're a kid and have no experience with the genre, then you might like it).			"

												The jokes are stiff and unoriginal, and most puzzles are way to easy, to the brink of just being "" go fetch that"" etcera. But that is pretty standard or mediocre, the main problem I have with this game is that it still now, so long after it´s release (3+ years) it still have game breaking bugs where the game just breaks and corrupts saved data, making all your progress completely invalid. A game that breaks itself through big, biiig bugs and design flaws. Not worth your money, not even on discount because as a consumer, you should NEVER accept this poor quality on a product.			"

												The story is decent. The characters are decent.  The game is terrible.  This would be better suited as a webisode or something.  The gameplay is so absolutely linear that you have to know exactly what the developers expect you to click on and in the correct order-- all the time, every time, which kills the game for me.  Save your money and just watch someone do a playthrough on Youtube.  This is true for both 1 and 2.			"

												Attempts to be an adventure game that pokes fun at the cliches of other adventure games.  Some hits, quite a few misses.  The art is nothing special.  The game itself is rather misogynisitic and homophobic, and once they started making really homophobic jokes about the Paladin I stopped playing.  Don't recommend.			"

												While I did enjoy playing The Book of Unwritten Tales it left me unsatisfied in the end.The Book of Unwritten Tales is a parody and doesn't expect to be taken too serious in the first place, but the continuous unoriginal references to MMORPGs made the supposedly funny elements of the game rather lame and left me hoping the plot would at least be worth it. The setting is beautifully crafted and well done, but in the end the game failed to deliver a proper plot resolution and had no distinct climax.There are a lot of minor bugs to be found in this game, but none of them prevented me from progressing.In terms of gameplay there isn't much to say. click on everything you see and eventually you'll progress. The difficulty is fit for point-and-click-beginners.I would recommend the game for a younger audience, maybe 12-16.			"

												Bought it with a 90% off coupon for a total of $2.  Haven't yet decided if that was a waste of money.The game is rather bland.  Graphics quality is low-to-average for an indie studio.  Voice acting is average for an indie studio.  Story was cliche and unimaginative, but I believe that was the point.  I was also not at all challenged by the game with the exception of two or three points where I decided to look at a walkthrough because I felt I had clicked on everything possible and I didn't want to expend any more mental effort trying to progress myself.The pacing is quite slow and I thanked the Gods that the developer was good enough to allow double-clicking on doors to quick travel, but I really would have loved a hold-shift-to-fast-walk option... A couple hours in and the slow swagger animations were really quite old.  Between frequent afks and the slow crawl, I'm sure I could have shaved a few hours off of the time to completion.Bottom line though: was I entertained?  Just barely.  Was it $2 worth of entertainment?  I'll grudgingly say ""Yes"".  Can I recommend the game, however?  No.  It's simply too tedious.			"

												The game is very simple you walk around talk to people pick up items that's the game.The game got me fustrated mid point I just couldn't take it anymore.  Mainly I was getting fustrated with stiring the pot I did it correctly several times it blew up.  The designers of this game have a very simple system except at this point a mini game was created that doesn't work that well.  The game is very boreing after a certain point comboing with this instance of fustration I just quit the game I will never play it again.  The story and characters seem alright but the flipping between screens to just talk to a guy then come back talk to again got annoying.  The elf was much nicer to look at, listen too, and to play overall.  I wanted to just play the elf yet your forced to play as the hobbit for several hours of boredom which broke me down to point of fustration.			"

Was it so expensive to write a complete scenario, instead of theese shortcuts ?OK, you play some time, you take pleasure to solve the tricks... after a while, you feel the end is near and you hope for more, for a hard final, for a last tricky enigma in order to show to demons who's the boss here.

Certain areas became a bit too dragged out and it didn't have that charming/inspiring feeling I experienced in the first half.

The jokes and references about World of Warcraft are pretty funny and I love to see creative humor like that. 6/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												A great point and click adventure game, Unwritten tales offers players lots of humour in the form of witty fourth wall jokes where the wizards play MMORPGs as real-life bankers filling out tax return forms as well as lots of silly british accents such as - a newcastlian orc, a welsh gnome, posh two-headed ogre as well as a classicly british sounding elf americans would be familiar with.The game is quite moderate with its difficulty, nothing that can get you stumped for long and the point and click mechanisms are all self explanitory and you don't go ""how the hell was I supposed to know that??!"" the game strongly prides itself on having absolutely zero fighting or killing whatsoever (so much so that they even put Death himself in the game and he is bored out of his skull because no one dies in this game!). I highly recommend this game because it gave me lots of laughs and was a pleasant and enjoyable experience, something I don't find often in games nowadays.			"

												I enjoyed it, it took me about 16 hours to complete, I had to look up walkthroughts sometimes as I couldn't find some item I needed to get to the next stage.Good quality game. Beautiful artwork, the levels are all really well done and nice to look at. Funny, there are a lot of jokes, some of them are at you the player. Good voice acting, there is a lot of dialogue and they don't repeat themselves much unless you do the same thing over and over, makes the game interesting. Interesting story line, the characters seem pretty alive.A bit unpolishedGameplay gets a bit tedious, you have to solve the problems exactly the way the gamemakers want which sometimes makes no sense, for example you need some coins to put in a slot machine, instead of grabbing coins from piles and piles of coins you must use coins from a particular box...it is essentially a go fetch game.Characters look out of place, they aren't the same quality as the levels, would have liked to have a high res elf babe ;)Some things are unpolished. The dragon seems a bit slower than the other characters. The cut scenes are lower quality than the game, seems a bit strange when you play.The end comes too soon too easily! So I guess I enjoyed it :)			"

												I really enjoyed this point and click adventure. The storyline was entertaining and the puzzles weren't too terribly taxing. I greatly enjoyed the characters, design, and scripting, and was quickly immersed into the game. My one gripe was that towards the end of the game, it seemed rushed. The puzzles didn't become harder - they became easier. It felt as though the developers were running out of ideas and just wanted to wrap things up. It made the ending feel less rewarding to me, and caused the game to be more forgettable. I would still recommend playing it if you enjoy game humor, and point and click adventures. I would also recommend not buying it unless its on sale.			"

												This game is amazing. I've always been a fan of point and click adventure games, but rarely have I seen one that would make me spend an entire day playing it without realizing that I'd done nothing but sit in awe at my desk. Great story, graphics, and comedy that roasts standard gaming conventions. This is truly a game for gamers.			"

												A light hearted fantasy adventure straight out of the world of dungeons and dragons. It's pretty well written, and the characters are likable. It's a little on the easy side, which keeps the game from dragging.I wouldn't call this an instant classic, but if you like adventure games, this is definitely worth playing.			"

												This point and click adventure will give you all the things you expect in this genre, while at the same time poking fun at the genre for some good laughs. You'll also be bombarded by nerdy references, that everytime you catch one you smile or laugh. The story although not to far from the many overused tropes, is still very interesting and manages to still keep you guessing just how it will end. The characters are entertaining, and I enjoy that although they could have made them stereotyped, they went the opposite route and made several of them worthless in their ""field."" It made them more interesting and you really root for poor Wilbur. The puzzles are challenging enough to keep you on your toes without being frustrated to the point of pulling your hair out. It's a good happy medium. I played a little bit at a time and it proved to be a nice little casual game to spend some evenings on. For those who don't like point and clicks, skip this one, but if you are into this sort of game, you'll enjoy it quite a bit.			"

												Overall this is an enjoyable point-and-click adventure game.The environments look nice, the voice acting is decent and the characters are generally likeable, especially the support cast.The difficulty is on the easy side and the story is a bit predicable. There are some funny bits throughout and plenty of references to other games, tropes and such. Most of the humor is only vaguely amusing though, nothing too laugh-out-loud funny.I was a bit unsatisfied with the ending and (lack of) climax. It's a very open ending to make way for a sequel. If you come into the game expecting an epic story or climatic ending you'll probably be disappointed.I had fun with the game though, it's nothing amazing but it's worth a play. Especially if you catch it on sale.			"

												A witty and satirical game that has all the best bits of adventure games and all the sarcastic parts that we take for granted in games such as grinding or deus ex machina. The game is a fun adventure point and click which follows three main characters seeking to stop evil, a simple plot, but the real genius comes from it's writing and brilliantly timed comedy that even manages to do well after localization.The puzzles in the game are decent, some of them way too easy and some of them infuriating to the point at having to guess. The game also has moments where it feels the budget ran out as several scenes seem to be missing and some parts end abruptly.Overall this game is worth a buy for any fan of adventure games and a love of witty responses reminiscient of Monkey Island.

												I will be honest and admit that the golden era of Point & Click was a little past my age. Sure, I like digging up old gems and I have played through the various Monkey Island games, years ago, but that's it.A few months ago I came across The Book of Unwritten Tales. I might not be a point & click expert, but holy c%&p was this game fun. It's humorous, it's full of pop culture references, it makes fun of other classic point & clicks in an often clever, and never mean, way. The puzzles are well crafted and the solution is often delightfully improbable (in that way that, you know, ""makes  sense"" but only due to copious suspension of disbelief).The music is gorgeous and the settings are very well designed, especially for a game with the kind of funding that the Book of Unwritten Tales had.All in all, I would definitely recommend this game. If you just go through it with a walkthrough (which is, of course, far from encouraged) the game is a little bit on the short side, and considering it's now been 5 years since the game came out, I am not sure I would pay the full 20$ steam price. I would definitely get it if on sale though.			"

												I enjoyed it, it took me about 16 hours to complete, I had to look up walkthroughts sometimes as I couldn't find some item I needed to get to the next stage.Good quality game. Beautiful artwork, the levels are all really well done and nice to look at. Funny, there are a lot of jokes, some of them are at you the player. Good voice acting, there is a lot of dialogue and they don't repeat themselves much unless you do the same thing over and over, makes the game interesting. Interesting story line, the characters seem pretty alive.A bit unpolishedGameplay gets a bit tedious, you have to solve the problems exactly the way the gamemakers want which sometimes makes no sense, for example you need some coins to put in a slot machine, instead of grabbing coins from piles and piles of coins you must use coins from a particular box...it is essentially a go fetch game.Characters look out of place, they aren't the same quality as the levels, would have liked to have a high res elf babe ;)Some things are unpolished. The dragon seems a bit slower than the other characters. The cut scenes are lower quality than the game, seems a bit strange when you play.The end comes too soon too easily! So I guess I enjoyed it :)			"

												This is 3 quarters of a really good adventure game. It's charming and witty, and with just the right difficulty level for three chapters. Unfortunately the fourth chapter lets it down: least interesting player character, most frustrating puzzles (a water source used in one puzzle can't be used in another puzzle for no logical reason), missing translations (some WoW references went untranslated) and a completely out-of-place rhythm mini-game for which no instructions are provided (turns out the helpful target area is just wrong, which made me incorrectly assume that the arrow keys didn't work for it).Even with all the problems of chapter 4, the game is still worth it for the first 3 chapters alone so enjoy them.

The challenges are good with some real head scratchers, but enough easier puzzles that you don't give up.

												My time with The Book of Unwritten tales is the most I've enjoyed playing an adventure game since the 90's. After playing Broken Age and not particularly enjoying it, I wondered if the genre simply no longer held any pull for me.  Well, it turns out Broken Age just isn't a very good game.BoUT's puzzles strike a nice balance of having a just enough old school adventure game obtuseness to them that the game doesn't feel trivial, yet they don't go to such ridiculous leaps of logic that they're frustrating either.Good puzzle design coupled with some very pretty visuals, voice acting that ranges from good to excellent, and a little bit of humor that works (and unfortunately a bit more that doesn't, but isn't intrusive) all make for a good game.

												This Game was a pure Delight to play.The Plot was easy to follow, the puzzles were quite fun and not repative, like some games I have played. only downside is I found it ended to quickly for my liking but that only because I did not want to stop playing it and was in the zone I had to know what was going to happen next. I strongly recomend this game to any one whom is looking for a good point and Click game, it got charm, it got class, it got dragons.			"

												Pont and click adventure with lots of genre related humor. The puzzles made sense and there were no pixel hunting type annoyances. There were 1 or 2 puzzles where I got stuck trying to figure them out, before i found out the <spacebar> shows all possible interactions in a scene. I got the whole collection and Im really looking forward to playing the sequel. Well witten and well thought out.			"

												Cute and funny game, especially good if you miss lucas arts style humour and game play. It tailed off a little towards the end and had a couple of gameplay glitches that weren't too much bother, but overall a good game and I will be playing the second one.			"

												Amazing game, loved it!Awsome story, fantastic humor, lots of movie/book/etc. references, beautiful music, demons, friendly zombies and a dragon with a personality crisis.Normally I hate point-and-click games, mainly because I'm terrible at them or they are simply too predictable and thats no fun, but even though I needed some help along the way it was really entertaining and I just have to play the second game.How can you not love this?

												First of - I like puzzle games, and BoUT is right up there with your standard point & click adventure game.  And as they say several times in the game - ""Nobody dies in this game!"" since it's an adventure point & click :)What makes this different from all the other games I have played in the same genre - is the great storyline and insane humor. When you start laughing out loud from comments / actions in a game - IT'S GOOD!Recomended this to my brother when it was on sale on Steam - a week later he got The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 at full prize....  (I'm doing Rise of the Tomb Raider now - but will buy the follow up even at full prize when I have some free time).Try it youself...			"

It's challenging enough, but you can get by without a walkthrough if you really try. The story was fantastic, and the character development is fenominal. The only thing is that it could get a little choppy on my older computer, but other than that the artwork was amazingly beautiful. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend this game!			"

												Not bad for a point and click adventure, very light-hearted. The only part that annoys me is how hard it is to see objects that can be interacted with (only words at the bottom and the icon changes if you hover) but I suppose that is part of 'not making it too easy'. I've had better, but this one's not too bad.  I wouldn't pay above $8 for it though			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a entertaining and competent point and click adventure game. A proper widescreen mode would have been nice but the visuals outside of that is charming. I also enjoyed the voice acting and i have no real complaints on the presentation outside of the 4:3 ratio nonsense.I enjoyed the puzzles in the game and for the most part i found them to be at a reasonable level of being far fetched. There is also an option to highlight interactable object which i enjoyed having. And overall i would say that the point and click part of the game was enjoyable enough and worked as it should.Storywise i would say that the game is a bit of a mixed bag. There are a lot of enjoyable characters and situations in the game and i did enjoy that you got to play as multiple characters. The gnome in particular was really charming. There was also a bunch of references and jokes which i greatly enjoyed.The story though is not really all that great and it has a bit of a pacing problem. This is not a huge issue but i feel that there is room for improvements when it comes to the overarching plot of the game. But overall i enjoyed the game and i would recommend the game or the demo for anyone looking for a fun and lighthearted point and click game.			"

												If you're looking for the best point-and-click adventure game ever you're probably not in the right place. If, however, you're looking for great writing, witty comebacks, funny characters and a mythical world that encompasses all things fantasy, my friend, you have just struck gold. TBoUT is like those olden ""quest"" games where you have to do chores for a billion different people before you actually get the one thing you are after. How it manages to keep from becoming repetitive and boring is its humour. It has jokes about a zillion different elements from geek culture ranging from Star Wars to WoW - the reason I'm not pointing them out is that I think they're better if you get them on your own, either on your first playthrough or your tenth. So happy hunting.			"

												I've had this game on my wishlist for a while until it went on sale and was not disappointed.  Very engaging story and great characters.  I loved the concept of being able to switch between them, though at times the process of switching was tedious (waiting for the character to get to the exact position the game requires just to trade an item real quick).  There were a few issues with subtitles mismatching and lines going through the screen where action would later take place, but they weren't distracting. There was also one or two times where I could click on something from a previous screen, which was... interesting. Again, that didn't distract from the story and just made me chuckle and move on.  There are some fantastic references that had me laughing and looking for others. I only remember being frustrated with a puzzle twice, and both of them were simply because the solution was too specific and illogical (they may be references?).  They didn't completely ruin the game, but they were the times where I had to consult a walkthrough which I do not like doing, but they frustrated me too much to find the real solution. Specifically  When trying to get red paint - there is red powder that obviously needs to get wet: I came across 2 sources of water, the paladins spit and a giant tub of water in the caves, and neither worked, I needed the tiny puddle of tears that I completely missed in the crypt.  Also, needed a gold coin for the  phone booth  teleporter.  Ran up to grab some from the giant piles by the throne room, but nope, I need to get into that specific locked chest - actually didn't need a walkthrough for this one - it just seemed like a silly solution .  In the grand scheme of the game, these are nothing, and like I said, may be references that I don't know/remember. All the other puzzles were well balanced.			"

												One of the finest point & click adventure games to release in years. The story revolves around you trying to locate a secret artifact that will change the course of a great war in a fantasy kingdom. You get to play as 3 different characters - Nate, an Indiana Jones type pilot/adventurer, Ivo, a mysterious wood elf and Wilbur, a humble Gnome looking for an adventure. The game will send you to various locations as you piece together puzzles to progress the story. The beautiful visuals are the highlight of the game. It also has some incredibly funny writing, it pays homage to great adventure games from the past and does not shy away from breaking the 4th wall to parody modern gaming and poke fun at itself. The puzzles are also very well thought out, and they never fall into the trap of needing to randomly combine items in illogical combinations. There is one technical issue though. The game is built for 16:10 displays and 16:9 users will have to put up with black bars on the screen.			"

												Fun point and click adventure game. As a point and click newbie, It took a while getting used to it and the controls but after that was done, I breezed through it. Some of the puzzles can be a little frustrating as the game progresses, but they're mostly easy and pretty obvious. The dialogue is very well done and pretty funny, if somewhat predictable at times. It makes a lot of references to games and breaks the 4th wall a couple times (but again, that fits the game itself). It's pretty long (took me about 15 hours) and a must buy for the price quality.

tl;drThis game is beautiul, humourous with very high fun factor. Imagine a mix of T.Pratchett, Tolkien and.... World of Warcrft. Thats what it felt like to me.This is ""must have"" even if you're not adventure game junkie....... and if you are - this game is your wet dream. FullI still remember good old LucasArts and Sierra classics. They defined meaning of 'good adventure game' in my vocabulary, and by these terms i find  ""The Book of Unwritten Tales"" one of best adventure game i've played in years (if not for Deponia i'd say ""the best""). One important to begin with: the puzzle level is quite easy and that makes game pretty short.""The Book of Unwritten Tales"" is really not about solving various puzzles by randomly picking 20 items and chaotically using them on everything. It is about crafting a story with very logical and somewhat easy challanges. Yes - logical. You dont  build a flamethrower only to light a candle. In ""The Book of Unwritten Tales""  all you need to do is to get maches.This makes game very casual and i really loved that. The game is packed with funny situations and lots of references to other games and fantasy: like WoW, LotR and T.Pratchett Discworld. It makes this game really joyfull to play with (and this comes from 30+ y old horse).Lastly audio and visuals are top notch! The scenography is truly beautiful, landscape and characters are very well crafted, all that with exellent choice of music and voice acting makes this game a masterpiece.			"

												It is a very nice, little adventure and I can recommend it.The puzzles are quite easy in comparison to other classic adventures. The developers deicided to present you only with the items and interactions which are relevant at the point of story. Which helps a lot. You still need to search the screen like in many other of these games, though. Removing interactions after done or viewed (mostly twice) was also a very good choice from the developer.The story is okay and plays with many fantasy clichês mixed up with trinkets/ideas from our reality. If you don't like fantasy, you probably shouldn't play it. In the end of the story I even liked all of the characters, despite some of them make it really hard at first.The end (final confrontation) of the game is a bit too short for my taste. It seemed rushed to me. I am not sure if the money ran out or the writing was not fleshed out, but it doesn't make it necessarily a bad game.Overall the game is not too long, so you can easily play it through in multiple sessions. Like in most of the adventure games there is also no replay value.One technical issues I had: I played the game in a very high resolution (3440x1440), so for some puzzles (like the map and the dance puzzle) I couldn't see the part I needed to see. As workaround I set the resolution to a lower value in these instances.			"

												This game is a brilliant little adventure game- it really holds true to what made the classic adventure games so great.It has a lot of light humour that isn't too adult or childlike. The background art is very well done, and even the character models are nice (albiet not groundbreaking realism or anything). The voice acting is well done on most of the characters. The puzzles aren't insanely difficult but still provide a good challenge to a seasoned adventure gamer. It's a solid game too, didn't experience any crashes even while flicking between windows on my computer. There's loads of content too. I'm so used to steam games being over quickly but this is a full length game which is refreshing. If you liked games like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, give this game  a try. Even though it's fun to play as an adult, it's also appropriate for your kids, so if you're not sure what to get your kids- get this one :)I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.			"

												Playing The Book of Unwritten Tales is like opening a game preserved in a time capsule for the past two decades. This traditional point-and-click adventure originally released in Europe in 2009 harks back to the days when Sierra and LucasArts ruled the world with legendary franchises like King's Quest and Monkey Island. German developer King Art has crafted a lighthearted fantasy grounded in an earthy sense of humor and grown-up story themes and has avoided the impossible, illogical puzzles well known to plague other games in the genre. In short, this is a great achievement in both story and design that should be played by anyone who appreciates an old-school adventure. © By Brett Todd			"

												I am not in a good friendship with point&click adventures, because sometimes the puzzles are so ridicolous that I'd never find a solution without help. However The Book of Unwritten Tales is fun. It has charming and funny characters, I laughed many times in my first hour of the game (haven't completed it yet). The puzzles are solvable and totally not complicated, unlike in most point&click adventures.The artwork and the voices are are amazing, great fantasy world. Also little things like, 'hidings bugs' on the loading screen. :) Definitely recommend it for anybody who likes this genre, you'll have a good time.Thanks for the developers supporting Linux, your game works well!

												Absolutely amazing click'n point adventure. Seems to have had bad/no marketing. It is very well written, surprisingly long, very well polished and appears to have high production value for such an unknown developer. In addition to the awesome storytelling there's loads of references built in by bitter wow-players amongst plenty of other topics. I'm surprised this wasn't in the same price range of other triple-A titles, it sure should be. Hoping for a sequel.TLDR: If you like adventures, this is a must have. If you like adventures and played wow, there is no way around this title.			"

												Really fun point and click adventure with lovable, amusing characters and a bit of poking/mmo-parodying humour everywhere. Gameplay is quite long compared to a point and click game and the story is full of turns and witty dialogues. The puzzles themselves can get irrational or difficult to follow at times (both the logic and the items you receive are strange every now and then), but all in all it was really enjoyable.			"

												A witty and satirical game that has all the best bits of adventure games and all the sarcastic parts that we take for granted in games such as grinding or deus ex machina. The game is a fun adventure point and click which follows three main characters seeking to stop evil, a simple plot, but the real genius comes from it's writing and brilliantly timed comedy that even manages to do well after localization.The puzzles in the game are decent, some of them way too easy and some of them infuriating to the point at having to guess. The game also has moments where it feels the budget ran out as several scenes seem to be missing and some parts end abruptly.Overall this game is worth a buy for any fan of adventure games and a love of witty responses reminiscient of Monkey Island.

												A wonderful Point and Click adventure romp in the style of the classics.While not without it's flaws, no true widescreen support, (not 4:9 but not 16:9 either just out of place black bars on the left and right the screen in gameplay.) and a few translation issues here and there. (and at one point a minor characters voice changes) The Book of Unwritten Tales gets so much right that it's hard not to recommend. References, humor, challenging puzzles, enjoyable characters and a fun high fantasy story make this one definitely worth the time.			"

												Ok, here is the review. Keep in mind that I love adventure games.THE GOOD:- VOICE ACTING: It's really great. The wide use of accents suits this game really good. Loved Wilburs voice.- ITS FUNNY: And also filled with references of all kinds (especially Monkey Island)- ITS PRETTY: The backgrounds and characters are colorful and detailed, and suits the game.- THE CHARACTERS: And by that I mean Wilbur (did I mentioned that I loved Wilbur?)THE NEUTRAL- THE STORY: It´s okay, and the end was a little unfulfilling and abrupt.THE BAD:-  ITS EASY: Oversimplified item usage. Only the combinations that make sense (for the game) are available, and the items in the background are no longer ""visible"" once they are used or their funny description has been said.- A LITTLE PIXEL (or object) HUNTING: Just a couple of obscure items almost ruined it for me (hint: both are in the crypt) (UPDATE: After reading other reviews I just found out that holding the space bar highlight all items, which may be nice, but may ruin the experience)- UNNECESSARY FLESH: Speaking as a heterosexual male, the elf (Ivo) is unnecessarily sexualized (barely any clothes on), and it doesn´t do a great job at it either.Rating: 8/10Not the greatest in terms of the gameplay part, but the dialogs and characters make up for all of the above			"

												If you like Adventure games with strong storylines, and Point-and-Click games with great visuals and logical, do-able, not-mega-random puzzles, this is a game for you!Keep in mind the story fits in the very classic quest/adventure mold, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, it likes to play with your assumptions about adventure stories, and it's full of silly, sometimes very witty/sarcastic humor.The only ""complaint"" I have is that some of the movements are a little wonky (switching characters takes a little too long), and the ending felt a tad rushed. Really not that big a deal, though, and the game is still worth it.A great choice in the adventure point-and-click genre.			"

												Playing The Book of Unwritten Tales is like opening a game preserved in a time capsule for the past two decades. This traditional point-and-click adventure originally released in Europe in 2009 harks back to the days when Sierra and LucasArts ruled the world with legendary franchises like King's Quest and Monkey Island. German developer King Art has crafted a lighthearted fantasy grounded in an earthy sense of humor and grown-up story themes and has avoided the impossible, illogical puzzles well known to plague other games in the genre. In short, this is a great achievement in both story and design that should be played by anyone who appreciates an old-school adventure. © By Brett Todd			"

												This game is a brilliant little adventure game- it really holds true to what made the classic adventure games so great.It has a lot of light humour that isn't too adult or childlike. The background art is very well done, and even the character models are nice (albiet not groundbreaking realism or anything). The voice acting is well done on most of the characters. The puzzles aren't insanely difficult but still provide a good challenge to a seasoned adventure gamer. It's a solid game too, didn't experience any crashes even while flicking between windows on my computer. There's loads of content too. I'm so used to steam games being over quickly but this is a full length game which is refreshing. If you liked games like Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, give this game  a try. Even though it's fun to play as an adult, it's also appropriate for your kids, so if you're not sure what to get your kids- get this one :)I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.			"

												This is one of the best adventure games I ever played, and since I play a lot of them, I don't say it lightly. The visuals are stunning, and the world itself is colourful and very diverse. It's funny, and clever and oh so witty, with a lot of nods to many adventure games (and great adventures and adventurers) that came before and some breaking of the fourth wall which was awesomely timed and fit in perfectlyThe puzzles are logical, fun and although I was stuck a few times, it didn't bother me the least bit. There are a total of 4 characters you control at various points in the game, and at no time did it feel forced or out of place or too much.And the voice acting is just superb, which is always an important, and often overlooked factor in an adventure game.The story itself is just.. ohhh fantastic! I'm keeping this spoiler-free, so all I will say is that it's beautifully written and kept me playing almost without a break. Another bonus is that it's quite long, and you will spend a wonderful weekend with it. All in all, highly recommended.			"

												This is really some of the most fun I have had with an Adventure game in a long time. It has a lot of great humor, the puzzles actually make sense, and the story is actually interesting and fun. There is minimal ""pixel hunting"" for items to pick up or interact with, which is nice. You get to play as more than one character eventually, and you switch control between them in real time as you see fit in order to solve some of the problems facing you. Overall I ran into really no bugs or technical issues so the experience was always fun and enjoyable. If you're looking for a good laugh, this is a great choice, especially if you snag it on sale like I did.Edit: As of writing this, I am 7 hours into the game (not even half way complete), and I am wholeheartedly recommending it. Fun times all around.			"

												Highly recommend.  Overall the game is beautiful and a lot of fun.  The references to gaming, specific RPGs and well-known movies/books in the medieval/wizarding vein are well-done, very funny and make a great game even more enjoyable.  IThe voice acting is great and the character interactions are very entertaining.  All of the puzzles and problem-solving in the game are interesting and require a bit of thinking, but none so difficult or convoluted that you'll be stuck for more than a few minutes wandering from map to map wondering what miniscule item you missed in a shadow like in some other point and clicks. My only criticism is that the game seems to end fairly abruptly.  The story building and problem-solving are fantastic up to the last chapter or so, then it all goes extremely quickly and the ending seems ever-so-slightly out-of-place, imo.  Still a great game, I absolutely loved it.			"

												Buy this game.It's well worth the money you spend on it. It's quite difficult, but that's a proper puzzle game. There's a lot of humor that you will probably roll your eyes at, but it'll make you giggle a little to yourself. There's a lot of game/movie references as well, I've not even finished it, probably not even a quarter of the way through and I'm enjoying how much this has made me think about what to do and how to""get that item to get that item I need to progress in this puzzle to get an item that unlocks this item and progress through the story"".All in all, it's an enjoyable game, which I'd rate as a 9.5/10, the -0.5 because it can be quite frustrating as well since it doesnt give you much direction, which can (as I've said) be frustrating. But definitely worth the money.			"

However The Book of Unwritten Tales is fun. It has charming and funny characters, I laughed many times in my first hour of the game (haven't completed it yet). The puzzles are solvable and totally not complicated, unlike in most point&click adventures.The artwork and the voices are are amazing, great fantasy world. Also little things like, 'hidings bugs' on the loading screen. :) Definitely recommend it for anybody who likes this genre, you'll have a good time.Thanks for the developers supporting Linux, your game works well!

												It is a very nice, little adventure and I can recommend it.The puzzles are quite easy in comparison to other classic adventures. The developers deicided to present you only with the items and interactions which are relevant at the point of story. Which helps a lot. You still need to search the screen like in many other of these games, though. Removing interactions after done or viewed (mostly twice) was also a very good choice from the developer.The story is okay and plays with many fantasy clichês mixed up with trinkets/ideas from our reality. If you don't like fantasy, you probably shouldn't play it. In the end of the story I even liked all of the characters, despite some of them make it really hard at first.The end (final confrontation) of the game is a bit too short for my taste. It seemed rushed to me. I am not sure if the money ran out or the writing was not fleshed out, but it doesn't make it necessarily a bad game.Overall the game is not too long, so you can easily play it through in multiple sessions. Like in most of the adventure games there is also no replay value.One technical issues I had: I played the game in a very high resolution (3440x1440), so for some puzzles (like the map and the dance puzzle) I couldn't see the part I needed to see. As workaround I set the resolution to a lower value in these instances.			"

												Pro:+ nice graphics+ quite funny, if you like references to RPG and nerd stuff (but could be more diverse)+ unique characters+ easy puzzles, let you focus on entertainment+ long playtime (that is not bloated by getting stuck/hard puzzles)Con:- Easy puzzles, if you are looking for a challenge get another game- puzzles are mainly testing around, no elegant logical solutionsOverall puzzles and humor are good, but could still be a bit better (9/10)			"

But as I kept playing it, the more I started to like it. The Book of Unwritten Tales is an awesome game filled with puzzles, a nice story, atmosphere and most importantly, humour :D "

Short AswerShould I buy it - For $20 it does give you a good bit of game for the price. YesShould I buy it on sale - YesLong AnswerThe Book of Unwritten tales is a beautiful, albeit prerendered, 3D point and click game set in a dungeons and dragons type fantasy world (Gnomes, goblins and such). It really is just a little more than a standard P and C. It does not hold your hand but it does lead you a little bit. It has a nice little cast of quirky characters and a quaint storyline (The little guy gets to save the world, etc.) but it doesnt break any new walls for the genre. It did give me a few chuckles at times and overall I did find this game to be enjoyable. It does have the small draw back of all P and C in that there is no replayability (once you solve a puzzle it stops being a puzzle.) Total play time will vary from 6 to 14 hours depending on puzzle skills but if you like P and C or if you can get it on sale then this would be a good addition to your library.			"

												This game brought back the days of Simon the Sorcerer for me, a very clever string of easy puzzles and a fantastic twist in the story at one point which made me smile :)I can't even remember buying this one I think it was part of a bundle gathering dust. Definitely looking to buy version 2 when it comes out next year and keeping fingers crossed they don't make the same mistake and turn it into a 3D game like Simon did (which was a flop).If you are a fan of old school point and click adventure then this is a must-play game. If you are more into first person shooters, or fast action games you will probably not like it. "

												One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a long time. I have avoided The Adventure Company games in the past because their puzzles used to require the character in the game to perform enough actions to ""reason out"" the solution to the puzzle you were working on, and I usually had the solution sorted well before that, but would not be allowed to combine the items to solve the puzzle until I spoke to the appropriate person that the character needed to in order to reason it out themselves. Combining challenging puzzles with a plot is a difficult task, and since LucasArts stopped making point and click adventures, very few companies have been able to do this well. The Book of Unwritten Tales was excellent start to finish, with an absolutely BRILLIANT final chapter. The only criticism I have is that some of the items you can interact with are very difficult to notice, and sometimes you need to interact with them several times before you get what you need out of them (like a box you need to check twice in order to get both items, but the character gives no indication that it contained anything else the first time you check). Pressing SPACE to highlight the interactable items on screen helps this, but to me it feels like a spoiler to do this. I got this game as a gift, and wouldn't have bought it myself, because I had so little faith in the publisher, but they really won it back with this one.			"

												What should I say about The Book of Unwritten Tales?Let's start with all the positive things.Everything.Okay, almost. The game is more than I expected it to be. I really liked the characters and story, the world, the atmosphere, the style, the soundtrack and the system. Much love was put into the game, more than in TellTales games, I'd say. It is a worthy addition to the genre.That being said, let's talk about the negative stuff. There really isn't much negative going on here, though.1. The game is way too easy. Most riddles are no-brainers, you often realize a solution to the riddles before you even have to solve it. Many things are already clear by simply looking at the scene. Only in rare cases you need to stop for a bit and to think the riddle over.2. The game is way too short. The end came a bit... surprisingly abrupt. I expected another 4 or so chapters at least.Nonetheless, in the end I felt sad that my adventure is already over. And that is what counts the most.The game felt right, so I can only recommend it. Just don't expect anything challenging.Yours sincerely,a pointy and clicky demonsword.			"

												This game is a mouse-driven point and click adventure game full of puzzles that harkens back to the grand old days of gaming in the early 1990's when graphics and special effects weren't available to enhance a game.  In all there are about 150 puzzles and some 200 items that can be picked up and combined to make other items that are useful in the game.During the game you will play the role of each of four characters shifting back and forth between each one.  Character dialog has a lot of self-aware humor that pokes fun at traditional RPG games and which frequently makes reference to other adventure RPG games and many movies.  So don't be surprised at Star Wars references or at seeing a little Temple of Doom in one scene.  All in all it is pretty clever and full of wit.The graphics are beautiful and the storyline is fairly interesting.  The characters are enjoyable and the fantasy setting is pretty neat.  Although it is very linear, that doesn't spoil the game.  Each scenario has a little bit of fun to it whether its game play or something that just makes you chuckle.  The Book of Unwritten Tales should give you about 20 hours of enjoyment.  If you have played a lot of games, this one will be all the more enjoyable because you will get all the slings and barbs in the dialog. It can be a fun romp when you are tired of more serious games and just want something silly.			"

												Beautiful art, great voice acting, and fun puzzles help this little point and click adventure along.  It is frequently funny with some subtle and not so subtle pop culture references.  I found it somewhat short, but well worth the price for the laughter.  The only part that was really frustrating was the potion making task (start at 3 o'clock, trust me, it helps).  The story was somewhat predictable, but the twist in the last chapter was rather nice.  There are also sections where you have to switch off between party members to accomplish a task or puzzle.  All in all, I recommend it, and I'm looking forward to working on the prequel game that was released, ""The Book of Unwritten Tales: Critter Chronicles"".			"

The game is reminiscent of the Monkey Island games, but instead ofbeing intimidated by this, it embraces the inevtable similartieis of all game in this genrerewarding the player with a tasteful selection of in-jokes. The challenges are good with some real head scratchers, but enough easier puzzles that you don't give up. The play dynamic is very interested as you swap between multiple characters who each have different abilities and different ways of viewing the world.

												Just finished the game.  It's fun.  Simple puzzles that don't require huge leaps in logic, and few enough options that a ""Click on everything"" mentality should pull you through.  Everything looks nice, the characters are likable enough.  You need to be able to enjoy a good dose of meta-humor though, this game knows it's woorld doesn't make sense, but instead of trying to hide it like other point and clicks it laughs with you at it's sillyness.  Example: I enjoyed one part when the question was posed ""Why do you want to go there?"" and the answer was ""To look at everything one at a time then pick up anything I can, since it'll probably come in handy later."" The falseness of the world is a feature, not a bug.That said, I picked it up on sale.  I enjoyed the heck out of it, but I honestly wouldn't put down $20 on this game.  It's funny, but not challenging enough to occupy you, and not long enough for me to pay full value, that's just me though.  If you've got some money to spend and it goes on sale again I definately reccomend it.			"

												I am really enjoying this game. It's a good mixture of things that I look for in a point and click. First, it's not too hard - will make you think but doesn't have ridiculously obscure puzzles like some other games. Second, the writing is actually pretty sharp and lends a sense of fun. There have been other point and clicks I had to stop playing because I found the main character to be so cloying (Deponia). So just overall I would say that this game has a sense of fun and a winking humor that makes it a joy to play.			"

												I was surprised by how much I loved this game.  A lot of fantasy-themed point-and-click adventure games fall flat, but this one is great.  Certain tasks require you to switch between your snooty elf, your good-natured gnome, and your sarcastic human party members, which is a nice twist on the genre. The story itself isn't too remarkable, but it makes up for it with tongue-in-cheek pop culture references (Lord of the Rings, adventure games in general, D&D, etc) and really goofy puzzles that are just challenging enough to keep you interested but not to frustrate.

												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a nice point-and-click adventure told around  the intertwining stories of characters that act by more or less chosen disposition in the background of a war the outcome of which they must play a mayor role in. Along the way they have to become artillery, mages, tomb raiders, a level 98 blacksmith and more all the while not taking themselves to seriously and referencing again and again (to just name a few) Tolkien, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Psycho, Mission Impossible and commenting on specific adventures and adventures in general.There is nothing the game really excels in and it has a few irritating aspects. Still it is mostly fun and I'd recommend playing this adventure over a number of others. For example, by nature of a light fantasy setting versus a thriller setting this game has a a story less deep than Cognition but is more fun and I dare say the better experience.+ Good voice acting and music+ Good story with a nice conclusion+ Atmospheric items0 Believable, yet sometimes irritating character traits- A few minor bugs- One tedious sort of riddle- One riddle I consider brokenImportant hints:The spacebar is your friend. It will highlight all the hotspots on the screen and helped me find a few important hotspots I might have otherwise overlooked for quite some time.The disk puzzle is broken for me. Be aware, the shaft through the disks becomes a button once all disks are stacked. To the best of my knowledge: The puzzle is supposed to work like Mastermind showing colour-coded evaluations of the current ""centre column"" on the stacked-up disks - red for wrong symbol, yellow for wrong disk but right symbol, green for right disk and right symbol. I don't know whether the position of colours has meaning. The evaluation is executed whenever the button (former shaft) is activated (or you leave and reenter the puzzle screen). The button must also be pressed in order to finally solve the puzzle and make the machine work.Now, I spent something between one and three hours trying different approaches and characters and looking around for clues because not every evaluation with four green spinners is a solution that makes the machine work. I still do not know how to solve the puzzle. My last approach was to get all green spinners, then have as few spinners as possible spin on evaluation.The ""tedious sort of riddle"" involved running around branching paths in the earth pixie mine and being thrown back to the start again and again which started to get annoying after about the fourth time. I'm guessing the throw-backs can be avoided but when you come up to them it's not directly clear how.I liked the atmospheric items, i.e. hotspots in new rooms that the character comments on once or twice - thus adding to the scenery - and which are then deactivated as hotspots thus not cluttering up the screen.The voice acting is good and together with nice music helps tell a story that half colours a fantasy world and half mocks adventure culture in a nice way, be it games or movies or books. The last part of the story offered a not quite unexpected twist where my only question was ""will I play that or will that be played for me"" as the game had simply told me about the happening of an episode twice before. Anyway, with that twist the game comes to an, and let me state here I value that highly, agreeable conclusion.I had a few minor graphical bugs not really worth explaining. I had one state bug where the character was moved from A to B within a sequence but returned to A after which was clearly not the intention and almost a problem. Nate swims up to the ladder in the sunken temple when the chamber fills with water. After the sequence he was back in the chamber - standing, not swimming, in the water. Walking around a bit with another character helped.I can easily recommend The Book of Unwritten Tales and I'm looking forward to the second game which I'm about to start right now.			"

It's rare to find an adventure game of this caliber theese days! It took me right back to the good old days with monkey island and simon the sorecer and I could'nt stop playing it until I finnished it! It took me about 20 hours to comlete and it did'nt feel to short either. The story was great and interesting and I loved the characters. The graphic style was great and the enviroments looked gorgeous. The ""puzzles"" are interesting and humorus, not to frustrating and hard but still not to easy to get booring either. This was such a great experience I almost feel bad for buying it at a discount. I most certainly will buy the followup work in progress as soon as it's finnished! If you like point and click adventure games this is a rare gem! I recommend getting it asap! The best one I've played in years.			"

												What should I say about The Book of Unwritten Tales?Let's start with all the positive things.Everything.Okay, almost. The game is more than I expected it to be. I really liked the characters and story, the world, the atmosphere, the style, the soundtrack and the system. Much love was put into the game, more than in TellTales games, I'd say. It is a worthy addition to the genre.That being said, let's talk about the negative stuff. There really isn't much negative going on here, though.1. The game is way too easy. Most riddles are no-brainers, you often realize a solution to the riddles before you even have to solve it. Many things are already clear by simply looking at the scene. Only in rare cases you need to stop for a bit and to think the riddle over.2. The game is way too short. The end came a bit... surprisingly abrupt. I expected another 4 or so chapters at least.Nonetheless, in the end I felt sad that my adventure is already over. And that is what counts the most.The game felt right, so I can only recommend it. Just don't expect anything challenging.Yours sincerely,a pointy and clicky demonsword.			"

Short AswerShould I buy it - For $20 it does give you a good bit of game for the price. YesShould I buy it on sale - YesLong AnswerThe Book of Unwritten tales is a beautiful, albeit prerendered, 3D point and click game set in a dungeons and dragons type fantasy world (Gnomes, goblins and such). It really is just a little more than a standard P and C. It does not hold your hand but it does lead you a little bit. It has a nice little cast of quirky characters and a quaint storyline (The little guy gets to save the world, etc.) but it doesnt break any new walls for the genre. It did give me a few chuckles at times and overall I did find this game to be enjoyable. It does have the small draw back of all P and C in that there is no replayability (once you solve a puzzle it stops being a puzzle.) Total play time will vary from 6 to 14 hours depending on puzzle skills but if you like P and C or if you can get it on sale then this would be a good addition to your library.			"

												Ok, here is the review. Keep in mind that I love adventure games.THE GOOD:- VOICE ACTING: It's really great. The wide use of accents suits this game really good. Loved Wilburs voice.- ITS FUNNY: And also filled with references of all kinds (especially Monkey Island)- ITS PRETTY: The backgrounds and characters are colorful and detailed, and suits the game.- THE CHARACTERS: And by that I mean Wilbur (did I mentioned that I loved Wilbur?)THE NEUTRAL- THE STORY: It´s okay, and the end was a little unfulfilling and abrupt.THE BAD:-  ITS EASY: Oversimplified item usage. Only the combinations that make sense (for the game) are available, and the items in the background are no longer ""visible"" once they are used or their funny description has been said.- A LITTLE PIXEL (or object) HUNTING: Just a couple of obscure items almost ruined it for me (hint: both are in the crypt) (UPDATE: After reading other reviews I just found out that holding the space bar highlight all items, which may be nice, but may ruin the experience)- UNNECESSARY FLESH: Speaking as a heterosexual male, the elf (Ivo) is unnecessarily sexualized (barely any clothes on), and it doesn´t do a great job at it either.Rating: 8/10Not the greatest in terms of the gameplay part, but the dialogs and characters make up for all of the above			"

The characters balance each other very well. I preferred Ivo and Wilbur over Nate at first, but the characters he gets to interact with are so great I forgot my initial slight dislike.If you like point and click adventures and you have a taste for lots of fantasy references (Discworld, WoW, LotR etc.) and sarcastic voice acting you'll love this as much as I did.There is only one fault I can find with this game: the ending is a bit too abrupt.But there's no need to let that spoil the fun, especially since there is a part two now :)			"

												This was a game that was bought for me on a whim by a friend who had recieved a 90% off coupon.  Overall, it was a pretty fun game.  It was standard point and click adventure activities, with an easy way to tell what you had available to interact with.  The puzzles were fairly straightforward and the humor was present as well.  The biggest downside to this game is that dialogue can disappear - after examining some objects, they lose the ability to be examined again, so if you get distracted and miss a throwaway line about a random piece of scenery that isn't needed for progression, you may not have the ability to hear/read that line again.

												A great point-and-click adventure game that reminds me of the height of the genre back in the 90's. A wonderfully done throw-back with a good story line, voice acting and artwork. Some aspects are daunting, and the slow-paced walking can get a bit annoying. A little short for my liking : Start to finish just over 11 hours of gameplay. If you can snag this while it's on sale (I paid $3.99USD) it'll make a great addition to anyone's collection who enjoys P&C adventures!			"

												Very well done and funny adventure in the veins of old Licas Arts adventures, but in a more modern presentation. Though not all riddles are intuitive and it's easy to get stuck sometimes, it keeps you motivated and entertained throughout! The prequel and sequel (currently in Early Access with the first chapters fully playable) are recommended too!			"

												If you like Adventure games with strong storylines, and Point-and-Click games with great visuals and logical, do-able, not-mega-random puzzles, this is a game for you!Keep in mind the story fits in the very classic quest/adventure mold, but it doesn't take itself too seriously, it likes to play with your assumptions about adventure stories, and it's full of silly, sometimes very witty/sarcastic humor.The only ""complaint"" I have is that some of the movements are a little wonky (switching characters takes a little too long), and the ending felt a tad rushed. Really not that big a deal, though, and the game is still worth it.A great choice in the adventure point-and-click genre.			"

												Just finished the game.  It's fun.  Simple puzzles that don't require huge leaps in logic, and few enough options that a ""Click on everything"" mentality should pull you through.  Everything looks nice, the characters are likable enough.  You need to be able to enjoy a good dose of meta-humor though, this game knows it's woorld doesn't make sense, but instead of trying to hide it like other point and clicks it laughs with you at it's sillyness.  Example: I enjoyed one part when the question was posed ""Why do you want to go there?"" and the answer was ""To look at everything one at a time then pick up anything I can, since it'll probably come in handy later."" The falseness of the world is a feature, not a bug.That said, I picked it up on sale.  I enjoyed the heck out of it, but I honestly wouldn't put down $20 on this game.  It's funny, but not challenging enough to occupy you, and not long enough for me to pay full value, that's just me though.  If you've got some money to spend and it goes on sale again I definately reccomend it.			"

												It was fun while it lasted. Full of small references and quirks, it took me about 15 hours of gameplay to complete. It was fun and not too difficult, but some of the interactable items were so obscure and small, I never would have known when to look. (e.g. One icicle which very well would have been a piece of the background art, and so small there's little chance your mouse would randomly swing over it)The story itself ends rather abruptly. While I do like an inconclusive end, it was like they attempted to wrap up the previous 13 hours of story in a single hour.			"

												The Book Of Unwritten Tales, or BOUT, is a funny, and fun game. I've never been much for point and click adventure games but I decided to give this one a try and I'm glad I did. Note that the game can be difficult, I had to use a guide several times.Pros: -Amazing music (I recommend getting the digital deluxe edition which includes the soundtrack)- Beautiful and imaginative scenery (which is good since you'll be staring at it A LOT)- References to many pop culture things, like Lord of the RIngs, Harry Potter- Lovable, and funny characters- I like the plot, the game is very light-hearted, so if you're expecting a kinda silly (but well-thought out) story, it keeps you interested in the gist of why you are figuring out puzzles and such.Cons:- Sometimes I got stumped and had to look up a guide only to find out that what I was looking for was right before my eyes, just very small and very hard to notice. Which isn't fun really. But that only happened a couple times.-Not really anything else.Overall I loved BOUT and would recommend it to anyone looking for a point and click adventure game			"

												Just finished this wonderful gem of a game, it has a few problems but overall was one of the funniest adventure games I have played in ages, it is very self aware and pokes fun at adventure game tropes as well as rpg tropes. Below I will list some pros and cons to the game as well as my final score out of 10. so lets get startedPROS1. The graphics- for a small adventure game I thought the graphics were outstanding especailly the backgrounds, there are also certain characters who look great, such as the minotaur in chapter 4.2. the voice acting- the va work in the game is for the most part amazing espcially wilbur, for the most part all the voice actors get into their roles and you can tell are having a blast playing these zany characters.3. Length- I was actually shocked this game was so long my play time says 15 hrs but is actually longer bc I played the demo first to see if I liked the game. So when I purchased the full game I sped through the demo parts that I had already beaten.4 Dialogue- the Dialogue is pretty great, I would say a good 80 percent of the jokes land, and there were more than a few times I laughed out loud.5. Difficulty- as adventure games go this one is good for beginners, there a few brain teasers but for the most part the game is pretty easy, especially if you use the spacebar (the spacebar highlights all interactive hotspots on the screen). I reccomend using the spacebar bc I hate pixel hunting, I play adventure games for the story, characters, and puzzles not to pixel huntCONS1. Story- while the characters and dialogue are great and worth a play through, the actual story is pretty dull and boring and like most I found the ending to be a let down2. chapter 4- the game is broken up into 5 chapters and while I dont hate chapter 4, I felt like it dragged and the game lost some steam here, bc for the most part you only play as nate, and he was my least favorite character, he grew on me but I never felt attached to him like I did to Ivo and Wilbur.3. Pixel Hunting- if you dont want to use the spacebar than pixel hunting is real bad, bc a lot of the objects blend into the background and they are hard to see.4. MINI GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- this is an adventure game yet the devs decided to include two mandatory mini games that just plain suck, especailly the dancing one, in you guessed it chapter 4 lol.CLOSING COMMENTS AND SCOREOverall I loved this game, it has fun characters, a decent story, and can be laugh out loud funny. It is a long game if you take ya time and explore the different dialogue options, I got it on sale on steam for 5 dollars, I cant wait to play the new one now I highly reccomend this game to adventure game fans or for gamers who are interested in the adventure game genre, bc its good for beginners. final score is8.5/10			"

												One of the best point and click adventures I've played in a long time. I have avoided The Adventure Company games in the past because their puzzles used to require the character in the game to perform enough actions to ""reason out"" the solution to the puzzle you were working on, and I usually had the solution sorted well before that, but would not be allowed to combine the items to solve the puzzle until I spoke to the appropriate person that the character needed to in order to reason it out themselves. Combining challenging puzzles with a plot is a difficult task, and since LucasArts stopped making point and click adventures, very few companies have been able to do this well. The Book of Unwritten Tales was excellent start to finish, with an absolutely BRILLIANT final chapter. The only criticism I have is that some of the items you can interact with are very difficult to notice, and sometimes you need to interact with them several times before you get what you need out of them (like a box you need to check twice in order to get both items, but the character gives no indication that it contained anything else the first time you check). Pressing SPACE to highlight the interactable items on screen helps this, but to me it feels like a spoiler to do this. I got this game as a gift, and wouldn't have bought it myself, because I had so little faith in the publisher, but they really won it back with this one.			"

												A lovely adventure game somewhat betrayed by its simplicity.Throughout the course of the game you gain control of 3 characters (you can maybe count it as 4 even), playing some sections exclusively as one character, or sometimes getting the option of switching to another. All three are fun to play and have their own distinct personalities which also translate into their observations of the world, which you can directly see by inspecting the same items with different characters. Although the last one you are introduced to does take a little while to like, since at the beginning he's quite obnoxious.The story is one of the most important parts in an adventure game, and here it certainly does not disappoint. It is a lighthearted save the world plot spanning through a diverse set of areas with a real feeling of adventure. However the ending did feel rushed, and compared to the rest of the game the're just the feeling that not as much thought went into designing it.The biggest problem the game has is that there is only one usable button, you do absolutely everything with only the left mouse click. This means that even if you get stuck somewhere, it is not too difficult to brute force your way through, because there is a much more limited number of possibilities than in traditional adventure games.But perhaps there is some sort of an upshot to this as well. The game flow is rarely interrupted and you're not going to get frustrated over some random puzzle, although there is one particularly annoying area in a mine which for some reason uses a top down camera instead of the traditional sidescrolling one.The Book of Unwritten Tales is certainly lengthy enough without the need for convoluted puzzles, it took me 13 hours to finish it, but I didn't spend much of that time trying to figure out what to do next.7 / 10			"

												It's great seeing the point and click adventure genre getting more games again. This is one of the better ones I've seen. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the puzzles tough tricky, are logical. Also later on in the story when you are able to change characters, it doesn't feel tacked on, each character can do different things and that's part of the puzzles. The voice work is well done, even though the plot is very, obviously, cheesy. Looking forward to the sequel.			"

It took me right back to the good old days with monkey island and simon the sorecer and I could'nt stop playing it until I finnished it! It took me about 20 hours to comlete and it did'nt feel to short either. The story was great and interesting and I loved the characters. The graphic style was great and the enviroments looked gorgeous. The ""puzzles"" are interesting and humorus, not to frustrating and hard but still not to easy to get booring either. This was such a great experience I almost feel bad for buying it at a discount. I most certainly will buy the followup work in progress as soon as it's finnished! If you like point and click adventure games this is a rare gem! I recommend getting it asap! The best one I've played in years.			"

												This is hands down the best Point & Click adventure I have played since King's Quest VII. It has everything you could possibly wish for: memorable characters, brilliant voice acting, a great plot, beautiful in-game graphics and fun and engaging puzzles that actually make sense. Highly recommendable!This game shows me that this genre, when done right, is still as enjoyable as it ever was. I'm looking forward to being able to play the full, stable version of the sequel next year.			"

												Well written game with a lot of humor. I have played it in sessions over quite some time, so it didn’t hook me like some games can. Even so, the game is really nice and funny and worth a play through. I didn’t like the way characters were made, they looked to belong to an older game especially compared to the beautiful backgrounds. But the humor and well written script makes up for most of it, so I would definitely recommend it for point-and-click enthusiasts.			"

												A clever and very fun little game.  Fans of point and click Lucas Arts adventure games won't be disappointed.  The interface could use some improvement (switching characters is slow), but the dialogue and voice acting is great enough that I was interested in hearing what the characters had to say.  In a world where story is something to click through to get back to killing things, Unwritten Tales stands out.			"

												A fun but short game. Like most point and click adventure games, The Book of Unwritten Tales has intuitive puzzles and witty story telling. This game makes reference to a plethora of stories and concepts of the modern and geeky genres. This game presents nothing new in terms of story telling but in terms of wit it gets five stars. Recomended for those new to point and click adventure games, because of its simple puzzles and short stories.			"

												One of the most memorable adventure game. Because of it's humor.

Gnome, elf, orc, troll, etc.● Lots of humor, and broken 4th wall.● Lots of popular references. Star Wars? Checked. Monkey Island? Checked. Harry Potter? Checked.● Just right puzzle difficulty.● Did I mention the humor?CONS● The graphic is nice, but isn't especially stunning. But for me, I don't mind at all.FINAL SCOREGameplay: 8/10Story: 7.5/10Graphic: 7.5/10Music: 7.5/10Overall: 8.5/10Yes, the overall is because of  the fun factor it has.

												Ok, let's be a bit structured:Pros:- Good Point'n'Click humour in the spirit of a ""classic"" game (Simon the Sorcerer/Monkey Island);- The story is enjoyable, and so are the characters;- It is pretty long for a Point'n'Click (getting all the dialogue options and finishing the game took me about 20 hours);- Many references to pop culture, especially MedFan universes;- It isn't as simplistic/easy/obvious as a TellTale Point'n'Click... In my opinion !- The voice acting is cool!Cons:- Graphics are not THAT good, even though the fact did not affect my gaming experience;- Some parts of the game, especially at the beginning, are a bit easy;- The end of the plot felt a bit rushed to me.In a nutshell: if you feel nostalgic about good ol'LucasArts Point'n'Clicks, this game may be for you! I'm personally a big fan of Monkey Island / Sam and Max: Hit the Road,... and I found the game very enjoyable.			"

												This is a charming little game.  It's definitely in the tongue-in-cheek mold of the first few ""Monkey Island"" games, with blatant lampshading of its own silliness, as well as nods to other games and pop culture. In terms of difficulty, it was a bit on the easy side compared to some other point and click adventures, but it says something about the genre that ""a bit on the easy side"" means the same as ""for once, I never had to resort to a walkthrough.""  There is something to be said for puzzles that can be solved without cheating.  Highly recommended for fans of point and click adventures.			"

												I am really enjoying this game. It's a good mixture of things that I look for in a point and click. First, it's not too hard - will make you think but doesn't have ridiculously obscure puzzles like some other games. Second, the writing is actually pretty sharp and lends a sense of fun. There have been other point and clicks I had to stop playing because I found the main character to be so cloying (Deponia). So just overall I would say that this game has a sense of fun and a winking humor that makes it a joy to play.			"

												The Book of Unwritten Tales is a nice point-and-click adventure told around  the intertwining stories of characters that act by more or less chosen disposition in the background of a war the outcome of which they must play a mayor role in. Along the way they have to become artillery, mages, tomb raiders, a level 98 blacksmith and more all the while not taking themselves to seriously and referencing again and again (to just name a few) Tolkien, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Psycho, Mission Impossible and commenting on specific adventures and adventures in general.There is nothing the game really excels in and it has a few irritating aspects. Still it is mostly fun and I'd recommend playing this adventure over a number of others. For example, by nature of a light fantasy setting versus a thriller setting this game has a a story less deep than Cognition but is more fun and I dare say the better experience.+ Good voice acting and music+ Good story with a nice conclusion+ Atmospheric items0 Believable, yet sometimes irritating character traits- A few minor bugs- One tedious sort of riddle- One riddle I consider brokenImportant hints:The spacebar is your friend. It will highlight all the hotspots on the screen and helped me find a few important hotspots I might have otherwise overlooked for quite some time.The disk puzzle is broken for me. Be aware, the shaft through the disks becomes a button once all disks are stacked. To the best of my knowledge: The puzzle is supposed to work like Mastermind showing colour-coded evaluations of the current ""centre column"" on the stacked-up disks - red for wrong symbol, yellow for wrong disk but right symbol, green for right disk and right symbol. I don't know whether the position of colours has meaning. The evaluation is executed whenever the button (former shaft) is activated (or you leave and reenter the puzzle screen). The button must also be pressed in order to finally solve the puzzle and make the machine work.Now, I spent something between one and three hours trying different approaches and characters and looking around for clues because not every evaluation with four green spinners is a solution that makes the machine work. I still do not know how to solve the puzzle. My last approach was to get all green spinners, then have as few spinners as possible spin on evaluation.The ""tedious sort of riddle"" involved running around branching paths in the earth pixie mine and being thrown back to the start again and again which started to get annoying after about the fourth time. I'm guessing the throw-backs can be avoided but when you come up to them it's not directly clear how.I liked the atmospheric items, i.e. hotspots in new rooms that the character comments on once or twice - thus adding to the scenery - and which are then deactivated as hotspots thus not cluttering up the screen.The voice acting is good and together with nice music helps tell a story that half colours a fantasy world and half mocks adventure culture in a nice way, be it games or movies or books. The last part of the story offered a not quite unexpected twist where my only question was ""will I play that or will that be played for me"" as the game had simply told me about the happening of an episode twice before. Anyway, with that twist the game comes to an, and let me state here I value that highly, agreeable conclusion.I had a few minor graphical bugs not really worth explaining. I had one state bug where the character was moved from A to B within a sequence but returned to A after which was clearly not the intention and almost a problem. Nate swims up to the ladder in the sunken temple when the chamber fills with water. After the sequence he was back in the chamber - standing, not swimming, in the water. Walking around a bit with another character helped.I can easily recommend The Book of Unwritten Tales and I'm looking forward to the second game which I'm about to start right now.			"

												I just finished it ! Absolutely super-fun game :-)I really don't want to give any spoilers but from a very particular point of view this game is only for a particular type of hardcore fans ... LOLAnd obviously, I just can't wait to install and play the second Book Of Unwritten Tales gamePros:  a. A lot of open-source components (yes, for me, this definitely goes to ""pros""). Should I mention I played it on Linux ?b. With a VERY few exceptions, the game's ""logic"" is very clear. It's not that type of adventure game where you just sit and stare for hours, scratching your head, looking for a solution, asking yourself if you're not too stupid to play it :-))))Cons:a. Can't be played in Windowed Mode, but given the laughs I had, I decided to forgive the devs ... this time :-)b. Should have had an in-game ""interaction help"" or something. For example, I just happened to stumble upon a page on the internet where I luckily found out that I can press ""Space"" to see the ""active spots"". This little hint truly helped. A lot !(if this ""interaction help"" does exist in the game then, well, my ""complaint"" still proves I'm right) "

												A great, humorous point'n'click fantasy adventure that lets you play from the perspective of several different characters throughout the story. The intro is a little slow, but things soon ramp up as you solve the initial set of puzzles and the humour starts to shine through. If you've played any type of RPG or adventure game in the past, there are some great sequences poking fun at the genres, players and developers, lovely stuff. The humour doesn't always hit, there are some off screen sequences that don't quite come off, but its good to see a game try something a bit different. The artwork and style is lovely, although there are occasional glitches and not all animations fully reflect the actions that are taking place. But these are minor fiobles that don't detract from the main experience. The voice acting is generally top notch too, great to hear a Welsh accent from one of the main actors.The game is quite easy however. Items are easy to come by, sometimes just given to you when talking to other characters and experienced adventure game players will find themselves solving puzzles before knowing why they need to. This can lead to a bit of awkwardness, but that will be the player messing with the natural flow the developers had in mind.That said, at 17 hours playtime, the difficulty level is not too far off the mark and the Book of Unwritten Tales does not out stay its welcome at any point. A thumbs up from me and roll on the next adventure in the series..			"

												The best modern P&C game to date because it feels not only like a natural progression of the genre but a throwback as well. The voice work is solid, the graphics are pretty good, the puzzles are fine, and the story it tells is simple but effective, with a few interesting surprises. Better than most of Telltale's efforts. I haven't enjoyed an adventure game this much since the last time I played the Longest Journey a few years back.			"

												If you enjoy point and click adventure games and humor, don't let this pass you by. This is a truly excellent game. The puzzles all make sense, yet are not too easy to be fun. The story is fantastic and only gets better, all the way up to the end.The characters are all well done. They each have their own personalities as well as abilities, and different outlooks on the same objects. The animation is great, and with multiple dialogue choices it's always worth trying each and every one.On top of all that, the game is hilarious. Try it!			"

												This game is a point-and-click style fantasy adventure that's basically a parody of the fantasy genre as a whole. It's filled with pop culture references to famous fantasy and scifi fiction and tropes. The story is great. My only complaint is that one of the minigames requires very good timing. I had to find a savegame from right after someone beat the minigame in order to continue, but that was really the only problem I had.			"

												At the time of writing this game is £17.99 full price. However I bought it on sale. I do not recommend this game at full price. It took me 12 hours to complete, using a walkthrough for one point. I found it a solid point and click adventure with a fun story, faintly amusing jokes and hat tips to other games/stories, and a mix of easy and difficult puzzles. The puzzles ranged from collecting things from different locations to figuring out how to sneak past things. There were no hidden object scenes and logic puzzles were very minimal.However, there are some hefty flaws.* As others have said, the characters move VERY slowly, so a lot of your time can just be sat watching them walk across the scene. * The puzzles are frequently in the form of ""go to this place and get this thing then return to a previous place to get another thing and put them together, now go to a different place and give the thing to someone who will give you another thing and then..."" which was wearing. I would have liked to see a wider mix, and as a seasoned point and clicker I was disappointed.* The ending baffled me with some odd time travel.			"

												This game was a delightful surprise to my collection of point-and-click games. I thought it'd be super cheesy (and it was at times) but it was enjoyable in that respect. Very funny, and I mean, as long as you like the strange meta feeling of a game that knows it's a game and much sarcasm. But beyond the funny, it's about thinking outside the box and it feels GREAT when you get something right. I hear myself saying often: ""No way! WHAT?"" and laughing about how silly the answer was. I must admit it's a bit difficult at points, especially if you missed an item, but otherwise the story is so engaging that those things are kind of a hit-and-miss for me. Please get this game, you won't regret it :)			"

												If you're looking for the best point-and-click adventure game ever you're probably not in the right place. If, however, you're looking for great writing, witty comebacks, funny characters and a mythical world that encompasses all things fantasy, my friend, you have just struck gold. TBoUT is like those olden ""quest"" games where you have to do chores for a billion different people before you actually get the one thing you are after. How it manages to keep from becoming repetitive and boring is its humour. It has jokes about a zillion different elements from geek culture ranging from Star Wars to WoW - the reason I'm not pointing them out is that I think they're better if you get them on your own, either on your first playthrough or your tenth. So happy hunting.			"

												My time with The Book of Unwritten tales is the most I've enjoyed playing an adventure game since the 90's. After playing Broken Age and not particularly enjoying it, I wondered if the genre simply no longer held any pull for me.  Well, it turns out Broken Age just isn't a very good game.BoUT's puzzles strike a nice balance of having a just enough old school adventure game obtuseness to them that the game doesn't feel trivial, yet they don't go to such ridiculous leaps of logic that they're frustrating either.Good puzzle design coupled with some very pretty visuals, voice acting that ranges from good to excellent, and a little bit of humor that works (and unfortunately a bit more that doesn't, but isn't intrusive) all make for a good game.

												A lovely adventure game somewhat betrayed by its simplicity.Throughout the course of the game you gain control of 3 characters (you can maybe count it as 4 even), playing some sections exclusively as one character, or sometimes getting the option of switching to another. All three are fun to play and have their own distinct personalities which also translate into their observations of the world, which you can directly see by inspecting the same items with different characters. Although the last one you are introduced to does take a little while to like, since at the beginning he's quite obnoxious.The story is one of the most important parts in an adventure game, and here it certainly does not disappoint. It is a lighthearted save the world plot spanning through a diverse set of areas with a real feeling of adventure. However the ending did feel rushed, and compared to the rest of the game the're just the feeling that not as much thought went into designing it.The biggest problem the game has is that there is only one usable button, you do absolutely everything with only the left mouse click. This means that even if you get stuck somewhere, it is not too difficult to brute force your way through, because there is a much more limited number of possibilities than in traditional adventure games.But perhaps there is some sort of an upshot to this as well. The game flow is rarely interrupted and you're not going to get frustrated over some random puzzle, although there is one particularly annoying area in a mine which for some reason uses a top down camera instead of the traditional sidescrolling one.The Book of Unwritten Tales is certainly lengthy enough without the need for convoluted puzzles, it took me 13 hours to finish it, but I didn't spend much of that time trying to figure out what to do next.7 / 10			"

This is a point and click puzzle solving game.  If you get stuck the game has a hotkey for highlighting all clickable objects on screen.  I didn't need it for most of the puzzles, so it isn't an extremely difficult game to play.This game is a great casual puzzle solving game with a bit of humor in most scenes.

												Just completed this game after 20 hours of very enjoyable puzzle solving and silly antics. I recommend this game to anyone who adores the Tolkien style fantasy. gameplay is avarage as far as point and click goes. the puzzles can be somewhat far-fetched, but hey it's a comedy/fantasy adventure. With an open mind and the willpower to not check out a youtube walkthrough you will have a blast while figuring out the painfully ""obvious"". This game is the equivalent of having a cup of hot chocolate with a good book by the fireplace in a cabin 8/10PS. There's a sequal XD			"

												Quirky, clever and fun!  I really enjoyed playing it but it has glitches that the developers don't appear to be interested in providing patches for.  Suggestion that *may* be useful: try cutting graphics display back and/or resolution for a problem scene.  I would highly recommend this game for all who love well crafted point & click adventures except for the developers home page forum being too glitchy to register - that's very bad attitude to paying customers IMO.  But the Steam forum members are most helpful and they make it possible to get through the glitchy bits so you can enjoy the game.  Recommend but with reservations re developers lack of support.			"

												A well-designed PAC game. I enjoyed some of the innovation involved in switching characters (and just the change in perspective). I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the fact that you can only combine items if they'll work (no real need for experimentation), but I didn't mind it. I found it streamlined the game, but it took out some of the fun of trial and error (and seeing what the designers came up with in terms of character response). There is a similar feature where you can't just repeatedly click on items to observe them - usually after 2 observations, the item then becomes inactive if it's not intended to be used later. Again, the feature was kind of nice, but took away some of the challenge and fun of thinking outside the box. I tend to like at least a few trickier puzzles in a game that get me stuck for a while, but this game was relatively straightforward. It was fun, but not particularly challenging.			"
