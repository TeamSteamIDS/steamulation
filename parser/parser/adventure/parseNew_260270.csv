												This is an occasion when I wish Steam had more options than ""Yes"" and ""No"" for recommendations. This isn't a bad game for it's low price point. I would never replay this though.This hidden object game drew me in with it's Halloween-themed story. At first it starts as a basic haunted house story and then it turns into Jumanji junior in a sense. The entire plot revolves around your friends being trapped in a board game and the ghosts of the game's last victims haunting the farm. They send you on a bunch of fetch quests, so only a fraction of the game is about finding hidden objects. I managed to finish the game in around 6 hours, so that's not bad for the $4 or so I spent for this on sale, but I also lost interest about two-thirds of the way through. I stopped reading the diary pages, for example. The fetch quests were grinding on me. Some of the objects in the hidden object scenes didn't look anything like I would ever imagine them to look like. Some of the puzzles didn't have clear directions and if you hit the ""?"" to get an explanation, it focused more on telling you how to beat it than explaining the objective. Some of the later puzzles are very generic like they ran out of ideas near the end. For example, two of the last puzzles are a Sudoku puzzle and a sliding tile puzzle. There are some good animations that might look like a puppet show starring silhouettes, but the simple visual style had its charm. The voice acting over them is pretty bad. Early in the game, there are a few animations with higher production value. The graphics are nice for a hidden object game, though those animations are a bit hazy. Maybe they just didn't like the HD resolution. Each location is interesting enough and works with the Halloween theme for the most part. The developers made this game very easy to complete. Can't find a hidden object? Use a hint. Can't solve a puzzle? Skip it. Not sure where to go next? Just look at the map. It shows you. It'll be hard to get frustrated with the game when it provides you so many bypasses.			"

												10 ghosts, 8 friends, 1 disgruntled girlfirend who plays at being a witch, and a Jumanji like game board all on Halloween night, as if this would not cause enough trouble even in real life, let alone on an acclaimed haunted farm.  Story: Dylan is invited to a Halloween party of friends by her girlfriend Samantha (with special interest falling on Parker, the unrequited love).  While Dylan is taking a phone call from her concerned mother all her friends are sucked in the Jumanji-like game board.  (I personally do not think Miss Disgruntled (Dylan's girlfriend, Samantha) actually realized the game board was haunted by the ghosts of a previous tragedy.  The ""haunted"" gameboard simply recognized similiar natures, and history repeats.)  Simple enough storyline.NOTE:  I really like the opening where the car headlights light up the pumpkin from behind before the car is seen and drives past.NOTE 2 - Safety announcment: Please do not talk on your cell phone while driving even if it is your mom calling.Of all the reviews I read, good and bad, after I played the game I only have this to say: This is an old school Hidden Object game.  This is how they all used to be when actual storylines were first being introduced and being refined.  The games centered on the Hidden Object scenes, with the occassional pick up of inventory items to be used later or to solve some puzzle.  The games were not as strictly linear as they are now, but had a more ""open world"" feel with ""bottle necks"".  The games were also not nearly as ""hand-holding"" as they are now.  The gamer had to think and OMG guess about what had to done, plus click everywhere.  Yes it was and is annoying and frustrating but that is partly what made the game challenging, out thinking the game/developers.    Being a fool for old school this was a really refreshing game for me to play.  Very different puzzles and needing a completely different mind set compared to more recent and HD graphic ""hand-holding"" games of today.  One of the complaints centered on the half-completed objects in the hidden object scenes.  Well all I can say to that is you got what you clicked (Do remember this game was made before 3D was standard, so the objects were drawn in, not overlayed.)  The actual puzzles of this game include suduko, logic, slide, matching, ""minesweeper"" among many other types.  This game includes a vast and usually unseen variety of puzzles compared to the color, sound, and match fare of today.  So no crying about how hard the puzzles are, expand your repertorie.   If you want a challenging game and are bored with the standard fare of today, try yesteryear (in game time 2 years is like 2 centuries).  This game overall is quite challenging.  No penalties for hints which I had almost forgotten about being so used to today's games where there are penalties for hints, map use, and misclicks.  Hints were standard fare in old school and the gamer was expected to use the hint button... a lot, as well as be click ""happy"".  Guides and YouTube did not exist then like they do now.  Old school games did not have (or require) achievements, in-game or later the all important steam achievements.  They especially did not require trading cards to even be considered playable.  So if as a gamer one is looking for those things, this game has none of that.  So welcome to the adult version of ""Highlights"" and enjoy what made the games of today what they are today.			"

												A spooktacular game of mystery and evil perfect for halloween.  Those new to mystery games will find themselves hitting the hint button alot, though the game is friendly to new players since any puzzle can be skipped or the hint button can be hit if stuck.  Cant get lost because there is a map highlighting where an object of importance is to continue the story.  The Hidden Object Puzzles can be very difficult, there are things that can be moved on screen in the puzzles, meaning you just need to click everything to see what moves if there is an item behind it since there is no cursor change.  Due to the games age many objects are difficult to spot due to them being very small or the detail is so low they cant be clearly seen.  During puzzles it may ask to find a heart, or a knife, but there will be tons of hearts or knives meaning finding some arbitrary one.  Other times objects are just named wrong such as saying ""darts"" but there are none instead there is a dartboard you click instead.  There are not many full on Halloween games on steam so this is worth trick or treating it up.Rating:  7/10  Value:  $2.99			"

												This game starts off strong, but halfway it begins to fall apart with a somewhat generic storyline. The CGI cutscenes are terrible. They are blurry and the animation is a bit stiff. If looks like something out of the 1990s. Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on them but this game was released in 2013. Why it has very poor animated cut scenes is beyond me. The nto confuse me even further are these completely separate cutscenes that are done with flash animation rather than CGI. It looks like as if this game was done by 2 completely different developers. It just throws you off. The voice acting is dull and emotionless like they weren't even trying. The gameplay was your standard hidden object play through. Nothing fancy. The puzzles were great as least but some puzzles were either a little too easy and some were totally cryptic. Do I recommend this game, no. Not unless you are a die hard fan of hidden object games or if it's on sale. It's a 5/10 for me.			"

												I can't, in good conscience, recommend this game. While the puzzles and hidden object parts of the game work just fine - the story is incredibly lacking. Which is saying something considering that most hidden object games have very weak stories to begin with.The premise starts out okay. You're going to a friends party. This friend just inherited an old mansion. Starts out okay. It's after you find your friends that the story starts to fall apart. You don't really know what's happening because you step outside to take a call from your mom, but your friends decide to play a jumanji-esque board game which ends up trapping their souls. Standard stuff. But it's the 'why' they are affected by all of this, is what causes confusion.I loosely think I understand the whole plot, but it's completely dreadful and definitely not worth the price. If you insist on getting the game, please save your money and buy it on sale or in a bundle.			"

												I can't recommend this game, not at all. Why?There are good things - a few. Drawings/scenes are quite nice, and there are some intresting cutscene animations (videos that resemble to the story about Death in  Harry Potter 7 ) , but after a certain point I just skipped them, as the game itself was too painful.There is no voice acting to speak of.There is little to no feedback about the interactive areas in Hidden Object Scenes (HOSs), this usually turns the game into a clickfest. Items hidden behind tiles of wall that looks the exact same as the other ones, but you need to find THAT one.Quite a few items in HOSs are not even drawn correctly - only the visible half is drawn, so when it pops out because you found it you can eyeball a nice half watering can, for example.Also, click detection is strange, usually you need painfully precise clicks to your actions be registered, especially while using items between HOSs.The message window - info about your surroundings, about the story - if visible for a fixed, 5 secondish time. But wait! It's not visible for 5 second until your last click on an item - it's visible from the first! The timer doesn't get refreshed when you click on an item as long as the message window is up , so you quite often end up with flashing text that's only visible for 1-2 seconds.And finally: HOSs sometimes have invisible items. Once I had to find a peace sign and even the hint showed a blank place where the sign *supposed to be*.  And this is why I write this review now, instead of finishing the game. I think I'm at the Stables and need to find a floppy disk in the recect Hidden Object Scene, but EVEN THE HINT COULDN'T FIND IT.Never, ever buy this game.  I've played with bad-ish HOGs like Theatre of the Absurd - but I enjoyed it all along. On the other hand in the case of Shadows: Price for Our Sins I only struggled, because of how bad and frustrating the game is at almost every point.			"

												I am willing to admit as win10 user that the game had some problems booting up, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed in trouble shooting setting the .exe file to boot in in win8.Ever since I haven’t encountered any problems at all. I really enjoyed the puzzles and most of all the beautiful tragic story line.If you are a true HOG player and are willing to see through the few flaws it has like maybe a tad to easy HOG scenes (although some are a tad tricky), skip-able puzzles (which I didn't do due that would take the fun out of it), and less graphical beauty then we are used to today, I would recommend it to give this game a chance. Even if it’s for the story line alone.			"

												I actually enjoyed this one. I actually cared about the story for once in one of these things. While the story wasn't the best it was still interesting and had a decent catch and conclusion.  I enjoyed the silhouette cut scenes even though all the cut scenes in this game had terrible resolution. The puzzles were decent. The difficulty went up and down a lot; some puzzes I found just plain difficult, others I found the instructions baffling, and others were very simple. The Hidden Object Game parts of the game were interesting. I liked and disliked that for some of the items you had to do some other actions first. I liked it when the actions made sense like taking other items, putting them together to make the whole item. That was cool. But I did not like it when it was an arbitrary ""click on this RANDOM item to get it to move so you can see the item you need hidden BEHIND it!"" Why the hell would I ever have thought ""oh yes, that thimble is DEFINITELY behind that hat!"" The item using puzzles were decent though sometimes the reason you needed an item was pretty stupid. Like the part where your character wouldn't put her hand in a fountain because it's dirty? Hello? People's lives are at stake and you're worried about a bit of algae on your hands? Please. Overall, a decent Hidden Object, Point and Click game.			"

Short version: 53%If you like ghost stories, then this mediocre game should worth a few bucks for you, especially if it is on sale. It’s far from being the worst hidden object title on Steam, but even further of being the best.Long version:Shadows: Price of Our Sins had a really sound idea behind it: a hidden object puzzle game featuring a ghost story about witchcraft, love, betrayal and tragedy. It’s the execution that suffers.The game has no voiceover after the intro, so everything is told in large– and frankly, very boring– text dumps. Also, the main plot seen at the beginning pretty much disappears, and never gets a proper resolution: after solving the final puzzle, it just… stops.The puzzles range from bad to above average. They are also repetitive, with an uncomforting emphasis on colour puzzles. Despite this it is recommended to play it on an easier difficulty, since they follow little logic: key items just turn up abruptly in the most unexpected places.The graphic style fits well to the atmosphere, but it is also quite dated, which really shows in the meticulous pixel hunting of the hidden object scenes.

Horror on All Hallows Eve!Well! Cattiness goes a long way for some people - for others it's just an annoying matter of fact, that some people have the tendency to exactly emulate this behaviour patterns. And I am afraid, that is one of the real true horrors in life.Especially certain age groups have this trouble, regardless of gender issues. This game has a surprising Halloween story that is telling such a type of story, and it does it in a very good way. The sound is atmospheric for a horror/nightmare HOG, the graphics are just fine (actually, you can play this game through without using a hint because the graphics are quite crisp and you'll be able to find anything when you just use your eyes). The riddles though are a bit... overused, but it has some things within the story that make this game a nice waste of time.Pro:Good graphics with clear HOS.Atmospheric Sounds.If you like the type of movies, where adolescend young people are the victim either in a slasher or a paranormal ghost story, you'll be loving the game.It offers some of the more outlined backdrop stories.Con:Some Riddles are overused now.Replayability as with most HOG's tends to zero.RecommendedThe game actually is fun if you like movies like Paranormal Activity, or Helloween, or... well Nightmare on Elm Street... But still don't expect too much - it is a HOG and Remains one. That said, the game is a bit too expensive at 9,99 € so take care to get it either on a sale, or by Voucher ... or bundled!The game makes a great Hallows Eve Gift for one of your loved ones too, especially if they love playing such games.

												In this game, you play as some teenager who constantly throws away sharp objects and hammers as you investigate the mysterious disappearance of your friends from a Halloween party hosted at the most haunted house in the universe, and whether or not your immensely bitter best friend with access to mysterious occult artifacts is somehow involved.The hidden object scenes are serviceable. Most scenes use the 'one or two items are arbitrarily hidden behind another item' mechanic, which is kind of stupid, but at least your mouse highlights whenever you hover it over such an object. One big flaw is that the list of objects only displays about half the total for that scene, and you can't 'click ahead' and clear an object if it's not on the visible portion of the list. The puzzles are definitely the game's weakest point. Many of them are unintuitive (the fish/bathtub one springs to mind) and perhaps because of this a lot of the puzzles include a complete solution under the '?' menu, which if you find yourself reaching for it I don't know why you wouldn't just click the Skip button altogether. I also have a specific beef with the sudoku puzzle late in the game; I wanted to try and puzzle it out on my own, but turned the game off to go to sleep. When I returned to the game the next day, none of my progress had been saved. (An earlier puzzle, one of those beams of light/mirror deals, saved the positions of its lanterns even after quitting and returning, so this was a particularly boneheaded move). Sometimes the 'take item to a certain location' puzzles were a bit obtuse, but fortunately the map highlights any place you can interact with given whatever items you have in your inventory. There really are a lot of locations, and as a result hidden object scenes are rarely repeated. The plot is typical bananas revolving around a cursed board game and a bunch of dead losers whining about how they were personally responsible for sending the whole estate to Hell, despite it being out of their hands thanks to a big ol' curse. The more interesting plot, ironically, is the teen drama involving one of the protagonist's friends going bonkers enough to send the whole class to Hell, but sadly that's hardly touched upon.I wish Steam let you rate games as mediocre, but I suppose in the end I'd recommend this game. Definitely not at full price! I'd say hold out for at least 75%, or wait for it to pop up in a bundle again. Oh, almost forgot: This game had an awesome cat, an awesome crow, and three awesome owls.			"

												Normally I don't go for hidden object-type games, but the Halloween theme of this one drew me in. As it turns out the game is surprisingly well-made for this genre. It's more like a point-and-click adventure game; and not just finding hidden objects. The hidden objects were kind of annoying to look for, but I found the other puzzles to be much more enjoyable. Every classic puzzle is represented here and some are actually quite challenging.You'll spend your time traversing a gameworld of beautifully-crafted backgrounds and artwork (and some nicely-rendered cutscenes), meeting ghosts and helping them find lost artifacts. The end goal being to save your friends who were trapped inside a supernatural board game on Halloween night. You will unlock many areas and learn more about the story. I was genuinely surprised at how deep the story was and how long the game turned out to be. I expected a few rooms to explore at the most. There are a high number of rooms to visit and the map allows you to quick-travel between each discovered location. Places such as a house, church, cemetery, barn, greenhouse, seashore etc. can seem overwhelming for a small game; but they all tie neatly together to unravel a much longer story than originally anticipated.The atmosphere and aesthetic style of this game is perfect for playing on All Hallows' Eve or any October night. I highly recommend it!			"

												This is one of the more complex HOGs I've played, in that you interacted with several different characters.Some of the ""hidden"" hidden objects in scenes were pretty much only findable if you clicked everywhere or used a hint.  (Example: an item was hidden behind the top of a barrel, and there was no indication it was there; I don't think you even needed to use a crowbar or hammer or anything, so there were no clues to its location at all.)It got to feel so long that, towards the end, I just stopped caring much about saving my friends and just wanted to be done with the game.  That said, I did find it interesting until that point!			"

												For now, I'm not recommending ""Shadows:  Price for Our Sins Bonus Edition.""  There's a notice on the game's Library page dated from August 24th letting people know about problems with Windows 10, video drivers, and cutscenes.  I'm trying to run it under Windows 10 with the lastest Nvidia drivers and after the first couple of cutscenes, ended up with the problem (just a blank, black screen during the cutscene).  There doesn't seem to be a fix for this yet.  Along with that, in the two cutscenes I was able to see, the voice volume was inaudible.  I think the cutscene volume might be tied to the music volume slider in the options (since I had that turned off), but can't really check it any more.  Also, on a game-related note, just after the start, I was totally stuck.  It turns out I had to try to drive away from the area first.  Of course, I'd never have thought of that, since I'm playing a game and actually want to BE there and figure out what's going on.I'll update this when I try to run it again.			"

												Until such a time as I play a worse hidden object game, I will place this as my number one worst so far. Crappy story, a few glitches, bad voice acting, poorly explained puzzles, poor quality video in the cutscenes, harmful stereotypes, cliched story.. even the hidden object screens themselves seemed sloppy. I can't really put it into words.I completed this out of sheer hope that the story would eventually get better. It did not.The only thing I liked about this game was the fact that the map was separate from the journal. So you know, there's some glitter on a turd.			"

												Overall, I thought this was a pretty decent P&C/HOG. However... ...I did experience multiple technical/gameplay issues including; game regularly required multiple launch attempts before playing, wouldn't reset my display from game resolution to my normal resolution after exiting (I had to do so manually after each session), no video (audio only) for second cutscene, one crash (w/o any progress loss), inconsistent mouseover behavior in hidden object puzzles for multi-step items, one hidden object item misspelling, and a couple hidden object items with active area in a different location than image. I was playing this on Linux Mint 18 (Wine/PlayOnLinux). But I play a lot of Windows only games on this OS and rarely encounter this number/variety of issues. That being said......I didn't find those issues all that distracting given the positives this game has to offer; good graphics, decent art, good story, plenty of game, above average hidden object game difficulty, decent voice acting, and a map with current location - next available action - and quick transport. If it had played without the issues, I wouldn't hesitate in giving it a straightforward recommend. But as it is, I recommend getting it on sales to help make up for the issues it does have.PS I almost exclusively play offline. I typically only play online long enough for Steam to allow me to write a review. So Steam only shows that I played 0.1 hrs as of the time of this review, although I've played at least 6 hrs and have completed the game.			"

												The first half of the game is really nice, the second half feels uninspired and bland; it's like if each half had been done by different studios. The HO scenes are very cluttered but beautiful with some special moves quite original. The mini games are very bad, with bad explanation and a hint option that either directly shows the solution or has erroneous text; they're either too easy or totally obscure. Music is awfully dull. Story is the usual cheesy cliché: X loves Y that loves Z blablabla and ooooh! Look behind you! A witch! etc. And to nail it down, there was several items with erroneous names... On the whole I cannot recommend it, it is less than average.			"

Why do I need a hammer for one hammering and a mallet for another), and lots of running back and forth.  If you like this sort of game, you know what I'm talking about and are prepared for it.Also, make sure to use the map - it shows where you can perform actions and you can teleport straight there.  I didn't realize how convenient that was until I wasted a lot of time backtracking.			"

												I thought this was a really good Hidden Object game.  I had no problems at all throughout the entire game.  The plot was great, the scenes were good,  the games were great, the hidden objects were good, the dialogue was good, it lasted long enough,  I enjoyed every minute of the 10 hours or so it took to get through it.  I've read some other reviews that complained they had problems with finding the hidden objects and other things, so I wonder if they've played this type as much as I, as I found it fairly typical, if not better, of this genre.  I thought the storyline was especially good. I think I'll quit reading reviews.  They often cause me to not buy a game, yet when I do,  9 times out of 10 I disagree with their critiques.  I guess haters got to hate.			"

												This game is broken.  I've gotten into HOPA games over the last year, and haven't really had any technical problems with any of them.  But in this game the cutscenes don't play properly.  There is sound, but no video.  I found many other reports on the bigfish forums.  My drivers are up to date and the computer exceeds minimum requirements.  The first cutscene played properly, the 2nd, which sets up the whole story, does not.  I switched to playing in a window and started the game again.  The 2nd cutscene played this time, but the 3rd had no video.  If I could, I'd refund.Otherwise, from the very short time I played, it looked like a perfectly competent HOPA game.			"

												IT's an ok hidden object game. I enjoy trying to find things but when it's trying to tell me a story through scenes that only give me a black screen I just give up. I restarted the game and still get the same thing. It was fine for a bit but after a while I just got tired of it and decided to quit and delete the game.			"

												Do I reccomend this game for Hidden Object Game fans? I definitely do! The story is engaging and definitely unique, the voice acting (what little there is) decent, and despite its flaws and rough spots, I had a very fun time playing this.Overall it's a very good game, it just could have used a little more polish before being put up for sale. In particular someone going over the HOGs and making sure there wasn't duplicate items (i'm serious, it is very frustrating for 'star' to be on the list and finding THREE items that match that) and otherwise tightening up the writing.

												Story is poor, kinda put together for lame puzzles.  Many of the puzzles are a find the object from list type of deal.  There are some other puzzle types, but got to bored to continue...only made it about 1.5 hours in...lucky I got it on sale and didn't waste too much.			"

												The game starts out kind of interesting, you are invited to a Halloween party and then all you friends go missing. Once you start searching for them however the game shifts away from that current day setting and you end up searching through generic old kitchens, farms and churches and solving issues of some old ghosts. The story itself is just some generic love story with black magic and stuff and never manages to properly tie together with the current day setting at the start of the game.Minigames are overall ok, hidden object scenes are solid as well. The item use in the game however feels pretty arbitary and requires far to much backtracking, which is fast thanks to the minimap, but kind of destroys the flow of the game.Overall it's not a terrible game, it just ended up being far to generic after the promising start. I also had some technical issues with the game displaying a black screen instead of a cutscenes, restarting the game fixed that, but I lost a cutscene or two that way.			"

												The game is halloween themed old-school point & click adventure game. Main plot is that your friends have been trapped in a board game ( Jumanji ? ) and you have to find a way to save them. The game is just clicking various objects,  solving tricky puzzles and playing hidden object minigames. This can be turnoff for someones but I personally recomend to try this game.			"

												I have a very mixed opinion about the game.Graphics: The locations and characters are beautifully painted. The 3D animated scenes are pretty good for this genre, albeit a bit simplistic. Unfortunately the HO scenes are a lot lower quality than the rest of the game. I liked that there are quite many locations in the game.Sounds: Excellent! Some places are really freaky because of the sound effects. Loved it.Music: Fitting for the genre, nothing specialUI: Quite user-friendly. The map is very modern and useful (though I guess old-school players would be annoyed by it, because it shows which places have available actions and players can even teleport with it.) The only minor annoyance I had is while all other pop-up/zoom-in windows close if you click out of the window, to close the board game you have to click on its icon again. Seems inconsistent.Puzzles/HO scenes: The puzzles were mostly quite easy, which I liked, but one of my main problem with the game is that the instructions were often vague and in a couple of cases incorrect. (= It told me to solve puzzle in a different way than what later turned out to be the actual solution. Minor but important errors in wording.) Also the HO scenes are very junkpile-ish with many unrelated items (and what is a takeaway food box doing in an at least 100 years ago abandoned place?) and the scenes sometimes had wrong names for objects, like calling garlic onion and such.Story: kinda BS, the whole thing is just one boring and overcomplicated deus-ex machina, with very 1 dimensional characters (perhaps the only exception is the cook). Also the game seems somewhat racist to me, with 3 token minority characters, all based on racial & gendered stereotypes. Plus one HO scene mixed Native American and Japanese elements, which seemed quite culturally appropriative.Overall: I don't know if I would recommend it, I'm really on the fence, but I picked recommend because for me it was still worth my time, even if just barely. If beautiful graphics and very good sound design make a game worth for you then go for it, but if the quality of the plot or the HO scenes are important to you or you are bothered by racist and sexist stereotypes then avoid it.

												I don't usually play much puzzle games, but I like this one, because it's as casual as it gets.  Like most other hidden objects games these days, you can skip the puzzles; and it tells you the ""Available Action"" on the map, so you can advance in the game easier.  Another thing I like is that you can click on any location on the map, and you get there right away.  I also like the fact that its very fast loading too.  The graphics, story, and music are passable, no complains there.  I kind of like the way it tells the story, also you get a variety of puzzles as the story progress.The cutscenes looks a bit grainy.  It seems like the widescreen option doesn't work for me for some odd reason, when I watch cutscenes of the game, it will go to black screen.  So I stick with their native 4:3 aspect ratio, it's alright.I encountered one problem with this game though.  One time it stops showing ""Available Action"" on the map. And I thought there was some bug or glitch that prevent you to advance in the game.  So I stopped playing it for a while because I don't know where to go(yeah I really rely on that "" Available Action"" thing on the map).  One day I just decided to give it another try, I thought that maybe it was just a minor bug that stop showing the ""available action"", and it was indeed that problem.  All in all, I love the fact that the game is so casual, basically you can just breeze through the game in a few hours(maybe its a turn off for some though).   I recommend it people who likes it nice and easy.			"

												Shadows is a nice hidden object game. The search scenes contain have some items that require you to solve some very minor puzzles to get them, giving them a little extra flair. Throughout the game you also find other puzzles, including a sudoku-clone and various brain-teasers. The graphics themselves are very nice and colourful for this type of game and the story is sufficently interesting. The game contain quite a few interesting backdrops and the cutscenes are nice if a little basic.My only negative is the game offers quite a lot of help. The help-function for some of the puzzles don't tell you the purpose of the puzzle, it actually contains the solution. And the map will tell you where you have things you need to do. So you no longer have to backtrack to see if you missed things. One click on the map and you know where you have to be next.All in all though, Shadows: Price for our sins is a solid hidden object game. If you like this kind of games, you'll like this game.			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle and since I've enjoyed similar time waster games in the past, figured I'd give it a shot. The hidden object scenes are less than user friendly, mostly because there's a lack of detail when you need it most. There seems to be a second storyline that wanders around until it gets lost and forgotten while you're busy making sure your cursor is in exactly the right spot. I wouldn't buy this game at full price, but if you have a decently large screen and don't mind squinting, it's okay-ish for when you're waiting on laundry or something.			"

												Good enough HOG, with an interesting Halloween story (but not original and not scary). As usual the female protagonist must find a way to free some old spirits from their eternal torment, saving her friends'  souls from a witch's trap in the process. The puzzles are nice but the hints are a little too helpful, so it's not a very challenging experience for expert gamers. It's not a total waste of money since the game length is good (at least 5 hours) but it's better getting it on sale (I got it with a bundle).			"

I just can say it's much better like other hidden object games.Maybe here and there are lil mistakes in language, but clicking like a idiot will clear up the misunderstanding, if you hit the searched item.Game crashed and I lost some items. No chance to geht them back, otherwise I should start from point zero.Well, no.Sometimes the hitpoints for do an action are a small pixel somewhere, so no matter you click like a idiot, you won't hit. It's more easy to hit the point to make a woman happy.It was a good game ... until this epic crash.Hope nobody else got the same problem. It's a fun killer for good games.			"

												It's a decent HOG, however there are some that are much better.  A few of the puzzles were buggy and I had to skip to get past them, but most of them worked.The main issue is with how boring it is.  There is a story, but it's extremely slow and tedious. Also some of the puzzles can take a really long time if you decide not to skip.It provides a challenge, unlike many other Hidden Object Games.If you could get this at an 80% discount and enjoy HOGs, then I would recommend it.  Otherwise, it's just really mediocre.There are HOGs much better than this, but if the concept or theme in this specific one interests you, go for it.			"

												If you are willing to deal with the idiosyncracies of this game, it is fairly enjoyable. The story is kind of weird and the puzzles are interesting. I do have some caveats, however.I played it in casual mode, which meant that sparklies appeared near clickable items even in hidden object games. This is unusual and was actually annoying because I felt I didn't even get a decent chance to find objects without seeing a hint indicator. The game is very inconsistent in indicating what can be clicked on. Sometimes there's a sparkle nearby, sometimes the cursor animates when over a cilckable object, and sometimes there's no indication whatsoever that something can be clicked on. This last  thing often led to me scratching my head over some HOGs because I didn't realize I was supposed to turn a page or move something out of the way.Puzzle rules are not always accurate. For example, one matching puzzle said the color had to match, but it didn't. Sometimes a HOG contained multiple objects that matched a clue, so the only way to find the correct object was to click on each of them. Sometimes a clue made no sense for the object it referred to. (Example: ""excavator bucket"" meant the Big Dipper constellation.) There is no bonus material.Even with all these complaints, I generally enjoyed the game and marginally recommend it if you're looking for yet another game of this type to play. Expect 6-7 hours of play. Make sure you get it on sale.			"
